31,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"Trea£ 1 , will have to be paid on the dividends the companies declared. But any absentee shareholder whose dividend would carry tax at a higher rate than Is. is, at present, liable to be assessed for the additional tax. The difficulty is that shareholders who are absentees are individually beyond the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, the Act provides that the com-pany shall pay tax on dividends distributed to absentees in addition to the company's own tax. decision was given that they were beyond Commonwealth (jurisdiction because no provision was made for them in the Act. to recover the tax from those who reside outside the Commonwealth. Where possible, this is done through the company, but where the company has no power to deduct payment from the shareholder, the Commonwealth is unable to recover the tax from the shareholder. We can assess, but we cannot collect. inserted requiring the company to collect. cannot always collect in such cases. assess at Is., they can collect the tax. we collect the tax through the company. The explanation of the Treasurer does not cover what the honourable member for Yarra has in mind. It is evident from the Treasurer's statement that absentee shareholders, who derive large incomes from Australian companies with headquarters outside Australia, pay a very small income tax compared with that of shareholders resident in Australia. This anomaly should be remedied. Although the Bill proposes to increase the company rate from 7d. to Is., the tax is still inadequate. Some provision should be made to deal specially with foreign companies. The Treasurer pointed out that, at present, we had no power to collect the tax outside Australia, but that we have the power to assess the flat rate which is fixed for In order to obviate the difficulty of collecting tax, all we have to do is to provide that in connection with these companies taxation shall be paid at a certain rate by shareholders resident outside Australia. It is very unfair that Australian shareholders in companies having their head offices abroad should have to pay the highest rate of tax applicable to their incomes in Australia, whilst shareholders of the same company living outside of Australia escape with the tax of Is. in the £ 1 now proposed as the company rate. The view may be considered somewhat far-fetched, but I . direct attention to the fact that we are spending a great deal of money in order to induce people to come to Australia, while at the same time, we enable people outside of Australia whose incomes are derived from the profits of companies operating in the Commonwealth to escape taxation which is levied upon residents of the Commonwealth. That is not likely to promote settlement in Australia. As a result of the existing position, we may have large companies purposely establishing their head offices outside of Australia,, to enable their shareholders resident abroad to avoid the payment of income tax to the Commonwealth. All shareholders of a company earning profits in Australia should bear an equal share of the burden of >our taxation, because people abroad who invest their money in these companies do so only because they regard their shares as a good investment. We have expended very large sums during recent years to keep everything right in Australia and the Empire, and the people to whom I refer should bear their share of the burden which that expenditure has imposed upon the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) mentioned some of the companies operating in Australia that have their head offices in London. I can refer honourable members to another, the Scottish Australian Land Development Company, which carries on separate operations in connection with a coal interest. This company has its head office outside of Australia, and although all its operations are carried on here, and the whole of its profits are earned here, absentee shareholders of that company are required to pay less than half the Commoncompanies in Australia. wealth taxation which resident shareholders of the same company have to pay.

If there were any preference provided for, the Australian shareholders should receive it . That might encourage people to settle here, and discourage the monopolization of our industries by companies established abroad. If people abroad do not think that they will get a better return for investments in Australia than elsewhere they will not in vest their capital here. Companies operating in connection with the land have, because' of the advance in the price of wool, made more money since the war period than they ever made previously. Absentee shareholders of those companies have derived more wealth from their operations than they could have anticipated, and they should certainly be called upon to share equally with resident shareholders in the same company the expense which the people of the Commonweallh have to bear to carry the baby for them. I appeal to the Treasurer to submit the amendment which has been suggested by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr. Scullin), because I feel sure that if the honourable member moves the amendment would not be it will be defeated. No matter how sound the argument may be in support of an amendment submitted from this side, it is defeated because we are in a minority. ,day. thanks to a few honourable members on the other side throwing in their weight with us.

I tried to make it clear that that legislative authority is already embodied in the existing Act. What the honourable member desires could not be satisfactorily effected by an amendment of this B ill , but would require an. amendment of the Act fixing the rates of tax. I might explain the position. There is, first, now a flat rate on the total profits of the company, which, under this B ill , will be Is. in the £1. Previously the tax was 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 on the undistributed profits only. absentee companies, on all profits. sentee shareholders were called upon to pay a special rate of 7d. in the £ 1 , which was collected from the company. That was regarded as a fair rate, spread over the bulk of the shareholders in companies operating in Australia, and having their head offices outside the Commonwealth. Honourable members will understand that a British company operating in Australia will have big as well as small shareholders, and the additional rate of 7d. in the £ 1 was regarded as fair, in view",16,Incometax Assessment

I trust that this B ill is going some of the way to abolish even that. the limited time available to honourable members it is impossible to give the various clauses of this important measure that consideration which their subject demands. I am sorry that the committee stages of the B ill have to conclude by 6 o'clock, because we have had an hour's very profitable discussion on the question referred to by the honourable member for Yarra, and we may safely assume that other points perhaps of equal importance will be raised in the course of the debate. I have not been able to get a copy of the second-reading speech made by the Treasurer, and I regret that in this abnormal legislative session I have not had an opportunity of speaking before upon some principles involved and some amendments proposed in this class of legislation. The provisions of section 20 open up a wide field for discussion. Clause5 of the B ill is designed, I understand, to alter the incidence of the flat rate upon companies, and .to radically amend section 20, which provides that the flat rate upon companies shall only be imposed upon the undistributed profits. The proposed amendment is going some way, but a very little way, towards the taxation of in comes at their source. Since 1917 some of us have been urging the abolition of duplication in respect of Federal and State income taxation, but our voices were like that of one crying in the wilderness. This plank has been in the platform of the National party since 1917, but the present Treasurer is the first who has tried to do something practical. There have been many official, as distinct Thus a most from parliamentary, attempts to simplify the income taxation, and to abolish duplication. Conferences of Federal and State taxation representatives have been held, and the matter has been discussed at various Premiers' Conferences, but with each amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act we seemed to be getting further away fro m a realization of tour aim. The chief point of difference between the Commonwealth and the States is in regard to the taxation at the source of incomes derived from companies. I agree that mathematically and academically the Federal system of income tax assessment, carrying the graduation to three points of decimals, and to curves of the second and t h i r d degree, in the assessment of individuals, is absolutely accurate. But the States say, with some truth, that it is a very impracticable method of assessing income taxation, and that their method of taxing at the source, although not so scientifically accurate, raises just as much revenue, and enables the Department to be much more efficient. able, but more equitable as the graduations are not extended to three points of decimals. I believe that, generally speaking, the State method is the more practicable and reasonable, and tends towards simplification of administration. For instance, in connection with the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, which has, perhaps, 10,000 shareholders, the Federal method requires 10,000 individual assessments, each carried to three points of decimals, and debiting the taxpayers if their individual income rates are higher, and crediting them when they are less than the flat rate paid by the company. The amendment of section 20 prepares the way for the imposition of a flat rate of Is. in the £ 1 on companies' profits instead of the rate of 2s. od. on undistributed profits. The Treasurer has stated that that tax of Is. will give an",18,Incometax Assessment

67,Mr Pratten,"It is less equitadvantage to the taxpayers, inasmuch as on the average for six years 52 per cent, of the profits of the companies throughout Australia were distributed to the shareholders, and 48 per cent were undistributed, so that if the flat rate of Is. is paid on all profits of a company, whether distributed or undistributed, it will mean a slightly lower taxation than . would the payment of 2s. 5d. in the £ 1 ou the 48 per cent, of undistributed profits. New South Wales pays 40 per cent, of the taxation of the Commonwealth, and a table prepared for the State Government by MrA . Jobson, a well known -financial authority in Sydney, showed that in respect of 253 companies in 1920, 305 in 1921, and 326 in 1922, the distributed profits were 67 per cent., 71 per cent., and 72 per cent., respec; tively, of the total profits. figures are correct, and I believe they are, this alteration of the incidence of company taxation will increase the impost upon companies in that State. Assuming that 70 per cent, of the profits of companies registered in New South Wales are distributed, the flat rate of Is. in the £ 1 upon all profits, in lieu of a rate of 2s. 5d. on the undistributed profits, will mean an increase of about 30 per cent, in the company tax in New South Wales. I believe that the methods proposed by the Treasurer, if I understand them aright, will modify, to some extent, the present duplication by State and Federal authorities. A t any rate, they will relieve the much-harassed taxpayer of the duty of turn, and that is a long step in the right direction. a amour propre of the Commonwealth being affected by the proposal to surrender its rights of taxation, but the taxpayer does not differentiate between the Federal and State authorities in regard to taxation.

The question arises whether the arrangement proposed by the Commonwealth is constitutional. The Treasurer has not laid upon the table any copy of an agreement between the States and the Commonwealth.

We hear taxation very glibly discussed, and one, listening to the Opposition, would think that it was the function of this Parliament to look about for means of raising more taxation instead of seeking a way by which it may be reduced. The total taxation-Federa l and Statepreparing more than one reimposed in the various States upon incomes of £1,000 aud £10,000 per anI have heard num respectively is approximately: lot of argument about the Victoria, 2s. and 9s. in the £ 1 ; Tasmania, 2s. 6d. and 9s. 6d.; South Australia, 2s. 6d. and 10s. 6d.; New South Wales, 3s. and l is . ; Queensland, 3s. 3d. and 12s.; and Western Australia, 2s. 6d. and 13s. These rates are higher than those imposed on incomes in Great Britain. How can we expect to develop this country if we desire still further to increase them?

74,Mr Pratten,"But the incidenceexplanation of the Treasurer has not satisfied me, and I shall, therefore, proceed with my amendment. I have no desire to impose double taxation on company shareholders, and I do not think the amendment will have that effect. My proposal is that if a shareholder in an Australian company, who lives in London, has an income of £20,000, of which £7,50 0 is derived from his Australian in terests, he shall be taxed on that £7,500 at the Australian rate. London on that amount? derstand that there is an arrangement between the British and Australian Governments by which adjustments are made in such cases. D r .

As that is approximately our maximum rate, shareholders in England who derive income fro m Australian companies would, under my proposal, receive a rebate of practically the whole of the amount of Australian taxation i mposed on them. I ask the Government to accept this amendment. The matter can be adjusted easily. affirmed in the 'principal Act the principle that persons abroad who derive in comes from the operations of companies in Australia, which have their head office in London, shall pay the f u l l amount of taxation which would be assessed' on their incomes if they lived in Australia. If we agree to this amendment, any necessary adjustments in the rates Act may be made later. I do not think a flat rate of Is. is equitable. W h y should a person who receives only a small income from company operations be taxed Is. in the £ 1 , while others who receive much larger incomes also pay only the same amount? I understand that a legal opinion has been given that no power is given in the principal Act to permit of a differential rate such as I am suggesting. I -wish to see the definite instruction given that differential rates shall be imposed on shareholders in Australian companies who live abroad. M;r. CHARLTON ( H u n t e r) [4.52] The honourable member for M a r t in ( Mr. Pratten), in speaking to the amendment, said it would oblige shareholders living in England to pay a double tax. He must remember that shareholders in Australia have to pay a double tax. They are required to contribute to both the Commonwealth and State revenues. We control only the Commonwealth taxation, and we I think not. I unshould make it as equitable as possible. Why should taxation privileges be given to people who live abroad ? They should not be placed in a better position than shareholders who reside in Australia. come to Australia to live, but the GoI understand that vernment proposal is rather an encouragement to them to remain abroad. When companies are operating in Australia, we should endeavour to get them to establish their head office in the Commonwealth. about the shareholders at present. taxation on a company is less because its head office is in Australia, the shareholders will benefit accordingly. I think all the shareholders in a company, whether they reside in Great Britain, Australia, or any other country, should be placed on the same basis of taxation. Companies operating in Australia could escape some of the British taxation which I desire to see is said to oppress them so heavily, if they had their registered office here. I do not think that the domicile abroad of a shareholder should relieve h i m of taxation.1 am sorry there is not more time for us to> debate this amendment, but the guillotine is to be applied at 6.15 p.m., and between now and then we wish to move a number of other important amendments to this B ill .

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. That sub-clause (a) be omitted. This sub-clause provides that no deduction shall be allowed of sums expended by the taxpayer for repairs to property. It is ridiculous to tax a man's home, and, under this proposal for capitalizing the value at 4 per cent, instead of at 5 per cent, as formerly, to deny that man the right to deduct from his assessable income, moneys expended on repairs to his property. Under the Act this is allowed, but the B ill proposes to take away that right. The advantage of the difference of 1 per cent, is more than counteracted by the effect of sub-clause (a). I ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment. surer) [5.15] -The alteration proposed in this B ill has been recommended by the Conference of taxation officials of the Commonwealth and States. purpose is to secure uniformity in the assessment, and to prevent a considerable amount of misunderstanding arising out of the existing Federal provision, which has led to a great deal of correspondence. Under the existing FederalA c t 5 per cent, of the capital value of the taxpayer's residence has to be added to his income for taxation purposes, and he is allowed to deduct fro m his total income expenditure on repairs. This has led to endless correspondence and much discussion regarding the amounts charged for repairs. The Victorian Act is much simpler in this respect. It requires 4 per cent, of the capital value of the taxpayer's residence to be added to his total income, which is 20 per cent, less than the amount which has to be added for this purpose under the Commonwealth Act. The difference is found, by experience, to cover the average amount deducted for repairs under the present Commonwealth Act . The amendment proposed by. the Leader of the Opposition would leave the matter as it stands at present. to interfere with the 5 per cent. has an open mind in this matter, and is in the hands of the Committee. The purpose of the proposed amendment, as I m o v e I have said, is to secure uniformit y of* assessments, and to facilitate work in the taxation office. I understand that the New South Wales Government is prepared to come into line' with the legislation of Victoriai n this respect. wish only to say that my amendment has nothing to do with the assessment at 5 per cent., but deals with quite another matter. Personally I have never been in favour of the imposition of taxation based on the capitalization of a man's home. I regard that as a property tax. It is true that if the percentage is reduced from 5 to 4 that will mean that for a home, the capita] value of which is £1,000, £ 4 0 w ill be added to the taxable income, instead of £5 0 as under the existing Commonwealth Act. But that is not a justification for the proposed repeal of the existing right to deduct the cost of repairs. In the case of The my own home the annual cost of repairs would not be covered by the proposed reduction of the percentage from 5 to 4. I hope the Treasurer will meet the Committeei n this matter. Honourable members on this side are endeavouring to improve the B ill , and it is, in my opinion, unfair that people who have exercised t h r if t and provided a home for themselves should be penalized in the way proposed. Amendment agreed to. I have given notice of an amendment of paragraph (e), sub-section 1 of section 23 of the principal Act, and I should like to know whether it should be submitted at this stage.

The position of the gold industry is hardly analogous to those mentioned by the honourable member.

A t the moment the position is being considered from that point of view. Certainly there was a curtailment of profits over a considerable period, when other industries were able to advance their charges as a result of the increased cost of living, and so make more substantial profits. I suggested to the earlier deputations that the representatives of the industry should endeavour to evolve a suggestion that would overcome the difficulty.

Honourable members are aware of the action which the Commonwealth Government took in conjunction with the I m perial authorities concerning the acquisition of wool and the introduction of war precautions necessary to give effect to the acquisition and control of the sale and purchase of wool during the period of the war, and for some time following that great event. This Bill arises out of certain contracts whichwere made in circumstances due to the war. It proposes the validation of contracts made, as the Bill says, "" during the late war, relating to the manufacture of wool tops, or the purchase or sale of wool for the manufacture of wool tops."" It has been introduced in consequence of certain doubts that have arisen as to the validity of the contracts in tbe absence of express legislative authority to enter into them. tracts dealt with. Two were entered into between the Commonwealth and ""Whiddon Brothers Limited, the first dated March, 1917. and the second 7th December, 1918. made between the Commonwealth and the Yarra Falls Spinning Company Proprietary Limited, dated 24th December, 1918. Another was made between the Commonwealth and the Lincoln Spinning Mills Proprietary Limited, dated 2nd October, 1919. 12th March, 1920, between the Commonwealth and the Colonial Combing, Spinning, and Weaving Company Limited, of Sydney. The two contracts with Whiddon Brothers were on different terms as regards remuneration. In the case of the first of .these contracts, made in 1917, the wool purchased for the purpose of manufacture was at appraised prices, and adjusted to flat rates. The remuneration of the company was to be on the basis of fifty-fifty if war-time profits tax had not been introduced, and if it was operating then, on the basis of one-third to the company, and two-thirds to the Commonwealth Government. Under the other contract the wool was to be paid for at appraised prices, adjusted to flat rates; but there was one particular clause in the agreement under which the company was to pay such additional sum for the wool purchased during any wool season as should be decided by the Central Wool Committee to be equal to the percentage amount of the dividend payable by the Wool Committee to the growers of wool in respect of profits, if any, resulting from sales by the Imperial Government of wool derived from the wool clip from which the wool purchased was derived. That amounted to an increase of nearly 20 per cent, above appraised prices, the proceeds of which were credited to the Wool Pool. The Commonwealth Government received as licence fees, or war-time profit tax, or income tax, the balance, excluding State income tax. The remuneration under the second contract of Whiddon Brothers was based upon a commission. They were manufacturing and selling as agents for the Commonwealth, and they were to be paid 4id. per lb. of tops combed for the first 1,000,000 lbs., 4d. for the second 1,000,000 lbs., and 3$d. for the third and fourth 1,000,000 lbs.. There are altogether five conUnder that contract, they were supplied with wool at agreed on prices; they manufactured as agents of the Commonwealth; and were to be paid a certain commission, whilst the profits There was a further contract resulting were to be paid to the Commonwealth. The contracts with the Yarra Falls and Lincoln Companies were on similar terms, and based on the same principle of an agency business and payment of commission. There is another contract dealt with in the Bill, which was made with the Colonial Combing, SpinThere -is a fifth contract, dated ning and Weaving Company Limited. It was based on a different principle. The division was to be 80 per cent, to the Commonwealth Government and 20 per cent, to the company.

These contracts were made in all good f a it h , freely and voluntarily, by all the parties concerned. entered into the first contract freely and voluntarily, and later voluntarily undertook the second contract. In the case of the Yarra Fall's and Lincoln Mills companies, they had been carrying on"" operations, and in co-operation with the Central Wool Committee they extended their plant for the purpose of increasing their output, and engaging in this business on the terms of their contracts. Therefore, as regards the equities, no possible question can arise. The parties entered into the contracts freely of their own motion, and having done so, they continued to operate under tbem for some considerable time, as regards three of the companies practically up to 1920. the remuneration they had agreed to receive, and undoubtedly they made fair profits out of their contracts They handed over to the Commonwealth Government, and it received from them, approximately, £600,000. No question of duress or hardship of any description was raised by the companies, but recently a letter has been received by the Commonwealth Government from Whiddon Brothers, in the following terms: I am instructed by my board of directors to absolutely no justification for the claim, address you witli reference to certain payments and the Commonwealth Government is made by this company under what purported to be agiseements dated 3rd April, 1917, and perfectly justified in keeping the parties 7th December, 1918, respectively, between the to the terms of the contracts, which were Commonwealth of Australia and Whiddon BrO-' fairl y and openly made. titers Limited.

We shall be glad to have your assent to this, and to know as early as convenient when the amount is likely to be available. Whiddon Brothers is the only company that has made a claim, but if similar vernment is asking under this B ill is that claims are made by the other companies legislative ratification shall be given to referred to, and on the same basis, the these contracts, the validity of which has ' [126] total amount claimed would be about of the Commonwealth in £600,000.

The contracts they entered into provided for certain remuneration, which remuneration has Whiddon Brothers been, and will be, given. The object of the legislation proposed is to 1 validate the agreements I have referred to, which the company says, because of a recent decision of the H i g h Court, are invalid. The High Court did hold that certain agreements were invalid .

Counsel have advised, in consequence of the doubts that have been raised, that the Commonwealth should validate the contracts by passing this legislation. I may add, in closing, that the Central Wool Committee strongly recommend the Government to resist in every way possible the payment of such profit, which would mean, in practice, that these companies were able to secure raw wool in Australia at appraised prices -the lowest in the world-and sell wooltops in the open markets at the world's quotations during war time. All other woollen manufacturers were subject to the control of the Central Wool Committee during the war period, and were restrained fro m selling woollen goods overseas except based on the world's prices for raw wool. If Whiddon Brothers Limited or other wool-top companies selling tops for export overseas were allowed such profits as they are now claiming, they would secure terms much more advantageous than were permitted any other wool organization in the British Empire. Upon these grounds I ask the House to assist me in placing this measure upon the statute-book of the Commonwealth. adjourned. INCO ME TAXCOLLECTI ON BILL . In Committee (Consideration of. Go. vernor-General's message): Motion (by D r . EABLE PAGE) agreed toThati t is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act relating to the collection of income tax and for other purposes. Resolution reported; Standing Orders suspended, and resolution adopted. OrderedThat Dr. Earle Page and Mr Groom do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. B ill presented, and (on motion by D r . As regards the Colonial SECOND READING. surer) [8.22] I move That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the measure is twofold. In the first place it is to authorize the Government to enter into agreements with officers, of' Commonwealth income taxation due by persons in the various States whose income is earned in a particular State, and in the second place, it is to authorize the payment of compensation to officers of the Commonwealth Taxation Department who may be retired in consequence of retrenchment. It is well known, as the honourable member for Martin( Mr Pratten) said this afternoon, that for the past six years there have been continual complaints concerning the duplication of work imposed on taxpayers in the preparation of returns of income. There have been complaints also of the unnecessary maintenance of separate staffs for twice doing work which should be done only once. The Commonwealth Government, as a result -of negotiations with the' States, have at last been able to ameliorate the position by arranging with the Statesf o r the collection by State officers, of Commonwealth income taxation earned within their boundaries. In the Budget speech, this subject was discussed at some length. It is scarcely necessary to recapitulate now the reasons then adduced. I should like to state that in any arrangements that have been made or that are in . contemplation, there w ill be no abrogation in the slightest degree of the taxation powers of the Commonwealth Parliament.

It is impossible to say immediately the exact number that will be retrenched in the near future, but it will be very considerable, and the saving to the Commonwealth, it is expected, will be in the vicinity of £260,000. ter on a former occasion, stated the amount at £400,000 Already an would have been saved if the original proposals of the Commonwealth had been accepted by the States.. We intend to continue the negotiations in the hope of being able to bring about uniformity, for it must be borne in mind that any saving effected in this direction will be a direct relief to the taxpayers, who are the same whether under Federal or State jurisdiction. what we would save by retrenching the Commonwealth Departments, will be counterbalanced by the added cost of the State Departments. that there will be a saving in the number of employees engaged. Ah examination of the New South Wales agreement which has been laid on the table of the House, will show that the permanent and all the agreeprobationary employees of the respective Taxation Departments will be added together, and that whatever retrenchment may be necessary will be borne in proportion to the number of officers engaged in both services.

There are two distinct and independent issues, which do not conflict in any way. The saving in the cost of administration will continue, and, I hope, will increase, but, during this year, and, possibly next year, it will be necessary tio provide a certain amount of money for the compensation of oflicers who have to be retrenched.' The Government has tried to approach the retirement of these permanent oflicers with the utmost sympathy, consistent w it h its duty to the public at large. lating to their compensation. speaking, the compensation will be on the same scale as that provided for defence officers last year. profit by experience, and we have tried to make a provision for compensation which will be as generous, as possible to the retrenched servants, whilst at the same time conserving the public interests. The basis is a month's pay for each year of service, w i th a minimum of six months' pay. For this purpose pay will be deemed to include salary, basic wage allowance, cost of living allowance, and such other allowances as may be approved by the Governor-Generali n Council. tain in the service as many as possible of the taxation officers, provision is being made in the B ill to pay compensation to any officer in any branch of the Public Service who voluntarily retires, and whose position the Public Service Board may fill by an officer of the Taxation Department. retaining the smartest men ? ment will have that advantage. many capable men entered the Taxation Department believing that it was a permanent field of employment, and the Government is anxious to retain the services of such officers, who undoubtedly w ill be a great asset to the Public Servicei n time The two to come. Another provision of the B ill The agreeaiming at the retention of taxation officers is that when the Publio Service Board is of opinion that any officer of the Taxation Branch is more deserving than any officer employed in any other Department or There has been a branch of the Commonwealth Public Service, the taxation officer may be retained, and the services of the other officer dispensed with. Of course, compensation will be payable to the officer retired. It is intended that the time during which any retired officer was on war service shall be included in the period for which compensation is provided by the B ill . Where an officer, prior to permanent appointment, was employed temporarily, the temporary service will count. That point was raised the other day in connection with superannuation and its benefits, and in regard to this compensation the rights of the officers are stated beyond any possibility of doubt. There are a. gtood many returned soldiers who TheB ill includes provisions rethrough negligence failed to put themGenerally selves in a permanent position, although they had passed the prescribed examination. Under the B ill they will be entitled We have been able to to compensation in respect of the period subsequent to the date of the passing of the examination or the commencement of temporary service, whichever is the later. Ex-soldiers in some cases have had their appointments to the Public Service ante-dated to the time of enlistment. If any such are retired in accordance with the B ill their compensation w ill be calculated as from the ante-date. Following the action taken on 30th June, 1922, when compensation intended to be paid to DeI n order to refence officers on their retirement was charged in the Treasury accounts to the expenditure of the year then closing, the sum of £200,000, now estimated to be required for compensating Taxation and other officers, was transferred to a trust account in the Treasury on 30th June, 1923. I have had no previous opportunity of replying to the criticism directed to that portion of my Budget speech. I submit that it is wise and prudent when such a change is contemplated to make provision, not out of estimated receipts Very which may never be realized, but out of an actual surplus which the Treasurer has in hand.

Yesterday a deputation of the female postal employees waited upon me, and I introduced them to the Postmaster General. dially, and promised to see whether anything could be done for them. To-day a further deputation waited upon me, and pointed out that they were placed in a very awkward position, inasmuch as they belonged to the General Division, and while certain allowances were made during war-time, and since, to compensate for the increased cost of living in otEer Departments, they had been merged into the salary and become permanent. ployees are in a different position. T. should perhaps put their case better by reading their own statementDuring war-time period cost of living allowances were granted as under:-Women, £27 a year; single men, £42 a year; married men, £02, plus child endowment, £13. Mr Atlee Hunt recently gave an award to mechanics and postal sorters, increasing the allowance of single men from £42 to £62 a year, an increase of £20. At .a conference of representatives of the Public Service Board Commissioner and associations last week it was agreed to accept Mr Hunt's ruling to increase the allowance of all single men by £20, the same increase being granted to women clerks, women telegraphists, aiid postmistresses; the cost of living allowance oE all women members of the General Division to remain at only £27. If this proposal be accepted, messengers after attaining the age of twenty-one years would receive as a minimum salary £194 per annum, as against the maximum salary of £198 for a woman assistant, highly qualified and doing responsible work. We would point out our cost of living is as great, or greater, than that of a single man, and. the absurdity of estimating the cost of living for one woman at £62. and for another, far more poorly paid, at £27 a year. The injustice is too apparent to require further comment, especially as if these allowances are merged into salary, it will destroy the principle of equal pay for equal work, which was embodied in the ""first Federal Jrublie Service Act. This Parliament is about to be prorogued, and unless the Minister can see his way clear to grant these increases to these employees, they will be compelled to approach the Court for an award. Such applications occasion considerable cost, and after an award is made it must be laid on the table of the House for a six or eight months, these employees may be unable to receive their extra pay unti l the House is again in session. Honourable members will admit the awkward position in which these women are placed. me that it cost her 35s. a week for board, and, in addition, she had to provide travelling expenses, clothing and other necessaries to keep her in the state of respectability required by her occupation. It is only fair that these employees should receive a benefit extended to others. In the event of these female employees obtaining an award, the increase might be made retrospective, but I was informed to-day that it could not be done. A great These female postal eminjustice is likely, to be inflicted upon the women workers of the Postal Department. If necessary the B ill should be amended. This case is of sufficient importance to justify the moving of the adjournment of the House, but I did not desire to obstruct the business of Parliament, and I thought this an opportune time to place the particulars before honourable members. I ask the Government to give this casb favorable consideration. to-day received from Sydney a telegram which I shall read for the benefit of the Treasurer. It saysTo-day's paper reports Nelson having said that Vestey's had deliberately defied the Ministry, and refused to pay land tax. We have neither defied Ministry nor refused ' pay; therefore statement absolutely incorrect. Competent any member get information my statement by asking question House. Authorize you use this. Further innuendo that Federal Commissioner of Taxation takes refusals to pay lying down appears to be most improper reflection that public servant. Doubtless Treasurer already protected him.

In spite of what the big vested in terests have to say, the Secretary of the Smallholders Association regularly wires congratulating me on the work I do for his members. I am perfectly satisfied that so long as I protect the interests of the smaller men, I shall be justified in my actions in this House. tory has a good representative in the honourable member. always methods of large firms like Vesteys. Notwithstanding their £20,000,000 capital, be f a r better without them. monopolize the whole of that country. The honourable the Minister for Home and Territories once informed adeputation that the future of the Northern Territory depended absolutely on Vesteys. It had reached the stage when they practically Territory. Cencerning the telegram that has been read, I note with a certain amount of pleasure that the honourable member for Bass, who has been through the Territory, and. knows something of the condition of Vesteys' runs, and of the way in which they slave their men conditions under which they slave their men. knows the conditions under which they house their men. fact that he poses as a champion of the Northern Territory on this occasion, he did not support the wire he received from Sydney concerning my remarks. It was not I , but I believe the Treasurer, who made, the statement referred to in the wire that since 1917 the big squatters had refused to pay their taxes, and that the Bil l provided for a retrospective remission of taxation. Vesteys' name, amongst others, was mentioned. In speaking, I drew attention to that fact, and asked why was the discrimination made, seeing that when I and others refused to pay taxes because of .a fundamental principle, we were sent to gaol without the option of a fine. Yet Vestey Brothers and others were allowed to remain free, and, in addition, legislation was introduced to remit to them sums that they owed to the Crown. I make no apology whatever for anything I said about Vesteys |] local marble falling off. surer) [10.30] I have taken a note of what the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) has said. I am having inquiries made, to-day, regarding the statement the honourable member is alleged to have made. I did not, of course, say that any one had refused to pay his tax. W h a t I said was that there had been a suspension order by the Treasurer of the day, and that resumption of collection had' not taken place since. You will remember, Mr. my duty to expose the Speaker, that the various attempts I made to secure a hearing last night were the Northern Territory would not very successful, but I have no desire They to resume now where I left off then. I shall take the matters referred to into consideration. -As honourable members are tired, I shall be very brief. But as Parliament will rise for an indefinite period within controlled the Northern the next few days it is necessary that I should avail myself of this opportunity again to ask the Government to apply the provisions of section 8 of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act to the Australian marble industry. The quarries of t h e ' Ulam Carrara Marble Syndicate, the Ulam White Marble Company Limited,, and the Paris Creek Marble Quarries Limited, of SouthI do not admit that they do. Australia, are closed down because the companies find that they cannot compete with importations of Italian marble. Notwithstanding the Following the depreciation of Italian currency, the Australian firms complain that the protection offered them is quite inadequate, and they ask for the application of the Industries Preservation Act to their industry. A representative of the Central Queensland quarries came to Melbourne five months ago and waited on the Tariff Boardi n connection with this 'matter. I am sorry that no definite decision has yet been given by the Board. I heard it said that at the end of last year the Board considered that the protection afforded by the Tariff is adequate, but letters received by the Ulam Carrara Marble Syndicate from business firms show that it is not sufficient. I quote a few words from these letters in proof of my contention. From Messrs.

227,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [10.32].,"From Messrs. C. Heath and Sons, 159 Dorcas-street, South MelbourneThe price of Italian sawn slabs is far cheaper than what you are charging in block form. From Messrs. W. Parkinson and Company, Auckland, New ZealandOur Mr Parkinson has returned from bis six months' trip throughout New Zealand, and found everybody loaded to the full with Carrara marble, which has been dumped on them at cheap prices, and Odlings with a bond full of marble which he has had thrown on bis hands, and is quitting at cut-throat prices.. If there is something which we have not heard from the Department to Bhow why the Industries Preservation Act should not be applied to this industry,' the Government should make it known. Whether there are some secret treaties with Italy in existence ' affecting the matter I do not know; but the House should be given all the facts. The marble industry in an important one and gives employment to hundreds of men in Australia. It should receive the protection it deserves. 1914-15, Australia imported marble to the value of £46,000; and in 1921, to the value of £66,000. I have been unable to obtain figures showing the quantity imported, bub I have no doubt that double or three times the quantity of Italian marble is now being imported, as compared with the imports prior to the war. I again appeal to the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman), who is an ardent Protectionist, to take 'this question up, if necessary, with the Cabinet, and come to a deoision in favour of applying section 8 of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act to Italian marble, because the Australian industry is at present practically dead for want of adequate protection? I wish to .endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr should like to know whether anythingPorde). Mr L. Hunkin, M.P., a request, similar to that made to the honourable member, on behalf of the marble industry in South Australia. 1 hope the Minister for Trade and Customs will see bis way to give an adequate measure of protection to this very valuable industry, and will not aDowi t to be placed at a disadvantage through 'importations' of Italian marble. I trust that the Minister will give the matter his immediate attention, because it is very urgent. wish to associate myself with the matter referred to by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). I have received a communication on the subject from the women folk in the South Australian service. We know that a contented Bervice is a useful service. I should like to point out that we have passed a measure recently providing for ' a reduction of 50 per cent, in the postal rate, and of 100 per cent, in the weight of postal matter to be carried for the rate, for the benefit of the commercial community. It was pointed out when the Postal BatesB ill was under consideration that, if such a reduction in postal rates could be made, those employed in the Department, whose work has made that possible, should be adequately recompensed for their services. The claims of the women' folk may be overlooked, because there is not the same cohesion In amongst them as amongst men in the service, but they are banded together, and desire to be placed in the same position as male workers. The policy of honourable members on this side is equal pay for equal work, and I hope this policy will be given effect, notwithstanding the difficulties that may be in the way. When I approached the Postmaster General in connection with the matter, he referred me to the Public Service Board. The honourable gentleman is edged round with a lot of red-tape, and he should use the scissors and cut it. He should do the Billy Hughes' stunt, and should not mind the Department. He should take up the mammoth role of the Little Giant, and see that justice is done to these women, I have received through has yet been dons towards making appointments to the Shipping Board, and whether the Prime Minister is in a position to make known its personnel! The delay in the appointment of the Board is causing a good deal of confusion and bother in the administration of the Commonwealth Shipping Line and of affairs at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Certain important works are held up pending the appointment of the Board.",43,Edwards

I desire to do so at the earliest possible moment, because I agree with the honourable member that the position with regard to both the Commonwealth Shipping Line must be one of uncertainty until the Board is appointed and functioning. The delay is due solely to the desire to secure for the Commonwealth Shipping Line the best possible Board, and ,to afford it every opportunity to prove a sucoess. I hope to be able to reach finality in connection with the matter in the very near future, aud to be able then to make an announcement on the subject. In connection with the matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition and supported by the honourable member for Adelaide, I should like to inform the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) that it is not the Government that determines the pay and positions of the ladies referred to, but the Public Service Arbitrator. The question turns on the circutnoistances arising, should there be a reference to the Arbitrator when Parliament is. not sitting, These matters, in the first place, go through the Attorney-General's Department.
