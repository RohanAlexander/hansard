I believe that most of them would honour a promise given by their leader. Those engaged in the production of grapes are concerned, not only because of the actual reduction of the rate of the wine export bounty, but also because of a threatened further reduction, and I ask the Ministry to make a statement of the Government's intention, in order to obviate any adverse effect on the price of grapes. I admit that this Parliament has been generous to the wine industry in some respects, and for that I am grateful; but I suggest that the industry should be left alone for a time, and given a chance to become stable. As a result of a prolonged fight in 1924-25, the Bruce Page Ministry gave to the wine industry its first bounty of 4s. a gallon. On the 1st September, 1927, the bounty was reduced to 3s. a gallon, including a drawback of the excise duty of Is. 3d. a gallon. In 1928, the bounty was further reduced from Is. 9d. to Is. In 1929-30, I and other honourable members sought to obtain an increase in the bounty, and the Scullin Ministry agreed to restore the old rate of Is. 9d. I am still grateful for that concession. Emergency Act of 1931, the bounty was reduced by 20 per cent., namely to Is. 4 4-5d. a gallon, and in the 1932 Financial Emergency Act provision was made that the amount payable from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the credit of the trust account, from which the bounty is paid, should not'exceed this year and next year £96,000 annually. As the .amount paid into the trust fund from Consolidated Revenue last year was £130,752, the recent legislation means Unfortunately, attention was that the contribution from this source will be reduced by £34,752. I am aware Honourable that the trust account is reinforced by a percentage of the excise duty on fortify( Mr Lyons) that on the ing spirit^ contained in wine. There are those who maintain that the withdrawals from bond will be much greater in future years than in the past, and that, in this way, the trust account will be compensated, to some extent, for the reduction of the contribution from Consolidated Revenue. Those who expect this difference of £34,752 to be made up in this way, are, in my opinion, unduly optimistic. growers get out of this bounty? grape-grower. I very much question whether the extra amount of wine that will be withdrawn from bond will make up the difference I have mentioned. The Government itself has grave doubts on the subject, for it issued the following regulations on the 14th November:(1.) If at any time during any nnancial year the Minister considers that the amount available under the act for payment of bounty for that year may be insufficient to pay in full all valid claims for bounty expected to be received during that year, the Minister may approve of progress payments being made on each claim at such proportion of the full rate of bounty in respect of that year as he determines. (2.) At the end of that financial year, additional payments shall be made to each applicant in respect of all short-paid claims for that year to the extent, if any, of the amount available for payment of bounty for that year. (3.) Notwithstanding anything contained in this regulation, the rate of bounty at which payments are made under this regulation in any financial year shall be .the same to each applicant for bounty. Undoubtedly the issuing of this regulation will have an effect upon the price of Under the Financial grapes, for it will foe said by the winemakers that there is uncertainty about the amount of bounty that they will receive. Honourable members should realize that the price of grapes will be fixed by a different method this year from that adopted formerly. Hitherto, Mr Gollin, who was the senior excise officer, has made a recommendation to the Government on this subject, and the price has been fixed by the",13,Forma Lmotion For Adjournment

45,Mr Gabb,"I am fighting for the Government; but this year tbe representatives of tbe wine-makers will sit on one side of a table, the representatives of the grape-growers on the other side of it, and a customs officer who, I presume, will be the chairman, at the head of it, and the price of grapes will there be recommended-and we can quite imagine how the battle will be fought. member know about wine? He does not drink it. on which I am speaking. The wine-makers may be relied upon to use with full force the argument that there is uncertainty about the amount of bounty that will be paid. There is another aspect of the subject to which I desire to deal, and on which I rose to speak last night. A representative of the Viticultural Council has been in Canberra recently and, according to information furnished to me, he has requested the Government to reduce the rate of excise duty and the rate of bounty. I have no specific knowledge of his proposals, but I have ""been told in the letter and in other ways that he has requested a reduction of the export bounty to Is. a gallon. In considering any representations that these gentlemen may have made, the Government should bear in mind that the Viticultural Council does not represent the grape-growers of this country. It -may represent some interests which grow some grapes and also make wine, but it does not represent the ordinary grapegrower. I should probably agree with the statement that the council represents the firm of Seppelt and Sons, which has 1,200 acres of land under vines, but is mainly interested in wine making, and some other interests which are in a similar position; but it cannot be gainsaid that the Viticultural Council does not represent the small grape-growers. The honourable member for Indi( Mr sent to the Department of Trade and Customs. Hutchinson) recently asked a question of the Government about the wine bounty. I regret that I have not been able to find the reference to the answer made to him; but I request the Government to leave this industry alone, and give it a chance. We may be sure that the conference for fixing the price of grapes will be held during the next six weeks, and that unless the Government makes a specific statement that the wine bounty will not be decreased, at least during the present vintage, the position of the growers will be made very difficult. If the winemakers are in a position to say that the Government is considering a reduction of the bounty, they will do so, and this will be like another stick with which to flog the grape-growers. If the Government will not say definitely that it will leave this industry alone for a few years, I earnestly appeal to it to say that it will not alter the bounty during the coming vintage, Unless some such statement is made, the grape-growers, in my district in particular, may meet disaster. The Government should recognize that even the wine-makers are divided into two groups. The interests of one group are limited to the home market, while the interests of the other group are largely confined to the export market, although, to a degree, they extend to the home market. A certain movement for position is now going on among these two groups which may be designed to influence the Government. I appeal to the Ministry not to lean towards the group of winemakers which is entirely interested in the home market, because they are already in a position to fix practically their own price for the grapes they use. The bounty ' is, of course, payable only in respect to the export trade. Any wine-makers who export wine are obliged to pay the same price for all their grapes whether the wine to be manufactured is for export or for home consumption. I have received the following letter, dated the 28th November, from the Murray Biver Wholesale Cooperative Limited, a co-operative fruit growers association:Dear Sir,I am directed by resolution of a meeting of co-operative wine interests to forward you a copy of a letter which is being The proposed alterations would be a staggering blow to the co-operative wine-makers and growers who ship practically the whole of their product overseas. The reductions cannot be calculated to relieve the industry in any way. There can be no benefit from the reduced excise duty because the proposed reduction is not sufficient to alter the retail selling price of wine, but a diminished bounty would be a very Teal-",14,Forma Lmotion For Adjournment
46,Mr Lane,What does the honourable,15,Forma Lmotion For Adjournment
47,Mr Gabb,"I understand the subjecthardship to those companies who are increasing national wealth by exporting their production. Some of the growers' wineries are feeling the drastic effect of the recent reduction, and any further deduction would amount to a calamity. Not one of the co-operative wineries is represented by the Viticultural Council, although the extent of their interests in the trade is large. A copy of the letter sent to the Department of Trade and Customs was enclosed; but it is not necessary for me to read that, as it is before the Government. letter which I have read shows clearly that the Viticultural Council does not represent even the co-operative wineries. I, therefore, hope that the Government will not be unduly interested iu any representations that that council may make, because it is a wealthy body. is quite evident that the grapegrowers cannot afford to send a representative to Canberra to watch their interests, and it is for this reason, among others, that I have brought this subject under the notice of the Government in this way. My request is that the Government will not interfere with this industry, but will give it a chance of continuity of operations under existing conditions. The industry has its own peculiar troubles. It may face a crisis this season because of an overwhelming crop. If the Government interferes at this point, and such a crisis develops, it may rightly or charged with having helped to cause the crisis. I ask the Government to make a definite statement now that the rate of bounty will not be interfered with, at least, in so far as it will affect the coming season's vintage. [Quorum formed.] answer to the charge made against the Prime Minister that he prevented the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) from ventilating his grievance last night, I wish to say that I was responsible for what happened then, and I take the blame for it. It astounds me that the honourable member for Angas should show such a great interest in the wine industry of South Australia. In 1922 when I visited the Mildura irrigation area I found that the growers of doradillo grapes were being threatened with disaster because the Avine manufacturers were offering them a ruinous price for the grapes. The honourable member said he favours the abolition of the refreshment-bar in Parliament House. consistent is the honourable member. I know that he does not favour winedrinking. I know that, in his opinion, ""wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging "". If he spoke from his heart, he The would repudiate the wine-manufacturing industry altogether; but, from his place in this House, he defends the interests of the industry, which does more than anything' else to injure the people of Australia. The honourable member comes from a secluded district in South AusIt tralia, and is, perhaps, familiar only with Adelaide, the city of churches. I invite him to come down to Sydney, and accompany me through some of the wine bars -no t that I would invite him to drink wine. Honourable members who are disposed to make a jest of this matter do not realize what the wine business is doing in the congested areas of Sydney. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) admitted the other day that he had made an inspection of the wine bars of Sydney, and that some of them were a disgrace to the community. Mr .""WABD -He said that two of themhad been a disgrace, .but, that they were wrongly-r-probably wrongly-be now closed. closed. The police force cannot effectively control these places, which are frequented by denizens of the underworld. At certain hours they are packed with men and women of dissolute character. Their effect is to destroy the morality of the youths and maidens of the city by encouraging them to drink the wine, the production of which 'the honourable member for Angas defends. able member that the motion relates to the reduction of the wine bounty. reduced, wine will probably be cheaper, and the people will be encouraged to drink more of it.

When the returned soldiers came back from the war, they were encouraged to go on certain areas which had been set aside for the growing of grapes. soldiers go on the land. vided certain facilities, and the honourable member for Angas and others encouraged the soldiers to grow grapes for wine, and they are still doing it . Surely the honourable member cannot justify his action in defending the payment of a bounty on. the production of wine when he knows that Australia is not a winedrinking country, and that wine can be produced more cheaply in France and Portugal than in Australia. Why should we pay a bounty so that this stuff may be sent overseas, when we know the injurious effect it has on those who drink it? member will agree that it is better that the injury should be done to people overseas than to our own people. accepts the principle of the brotherhood of man, and he should not encourage the export from Australia of a commodity which must injure the health and morals of people abroad.

Some honourable members may think that I am not serious in what I am saying; but I have spent my life in trying to abolish from the streets of Sydney the wine bars, which do more to create prostitution than anything else of which I know. Yet the honourable member for Angas, knowing these things, claims that he has the right to support the payment of a bounty on wine in order to assist the growers. ber's time has expired. for Commerce) [10.48] -The mover of this motion was apparently inspired by a twofold fear. He feared that the bounty On wine would be decreased under the provisions of the financial emergency legislation, which limits the amount of money available from Consolidated Revenue for the purpose. It is obvious that, unless this contribution is supple-' mented by an increased amount from the excise fund, a reduction of the bounty must result. That was provided for by legislation passed through this Parliament, and the position cannot be altered now. Tho honourable member also fears what he referred to as a further threat against the bounty, arising out of representations to the Government by one section of the industry, which has suggested the reduction of the excise rate on the spirit used in fortifying wine, and a corresponding reduction of tbe bounty to Is. a gallon At the present time, the bounty is Is. 9d. a gallon, less 20 per cent., which is just under Is. 5d. a gallon net. This proposal was made to the Government by one section of the industry only, and the Government will take no action without ascertaining the opinion of the other sections. These have already been informed of the proposal,"" and have been invited to make representations. .The honourable member suggested that the growers are likely to suffer as a result of lower prices, and the Government has not been unmindful of this possibility. A little while ago, in order to stabilize There can be no greater prices, and to protect the interests of the growers, the Government convened a fully representative conference, which appointed a committee to go into the matter of prices for grapes this season, and to make a recommendation to the Government. Upon the receipt of that recommendation, the Government will determine what action shall be taken. receive a deputation from the citizens opjwsing the payment of a wine bounty? prepared to receive representations from every section of the community which believes that it has an interest in this matter.

Bill received from the Senate, and (on and Treasurer.) [10.59] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to meet changing conditions in administrative arrangements when new departments are established, and departments disappear or are merged into other departments. The second schedule to the act contains what purports to be a list of departments, and the third schedule a list of offices which are filled by permanent heads of departments. amended since the act was passed in 1922, and the lists of departments and permanent heads is not correct as they exist to-day. It is intended to amend the schedules, to bring them up to date, and, at the same time, to provide that the schedules may be amended, without recourse to an amending bill, whenever administrative changes may make that necessary in future. the definition of the word "" department"". In section 7 of the act, ""department "" is defined to mean "" any department of the Public Service specified in the second schedule to the act, and any department at any time established by the Governor General"". It is proposed to add certain words to this definition, in order to make it clear that the term "" department"" does not include any department specified in the second schedule if that department has been abolished by the Governor General, or another department has been established in its stead. Clause3 inserts a new section 7A, which enacts that when any of the departments specified in the second schedule is abolished, or another department is established in lieu of a department so specified, or an additional department is established, or an alteration is made in the name of any department so specified, the second schedule shall be deemed to be amended accordingly. This will obviate the necessity of amending the second schedule by the passage of an amending bill whenever it may be necessary to make administrative changes affecting the departments specified in the schedule.

This act shall not apply to any income derived from primary production in the Territory of North Australia or of Central Australia by a resident of either of those territories prior to the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-two. Paragraph b of clause 3 extends the exemption for eight years. I should like to know the special reason for extending the period for that time, because, previously, it was extended for five years. I agree that there 'is need for a certain permanency of exemption, and that was the object before of making the period five years. A period of eight years seems to be rather lengthy. The explanation of this clause is that it extends for eight years-unti l the 30th June, 1940-al l exemptions for income from primary production in the Northern Territory. The exemption was first granted in 1923 for five years from the 1st July, 1922, and was extended in 1927 for a further period of five years. ""We should be well advised to retain the period of five years, and, if necessary, the matter could, be again reviewed when that period is concluded. There is no need to debate the general exemption, because that has already been amply discussed.

The result is that he pays income tax on his income, Eederal and State, and, because he has agreed to pay to his wife money free of taxation, he also pays both Federal and State tax on her income. He, therefore, is required to pay a tax of over £2,700 on an income of £2,600, because his income is taxed twice. The State has already amended its law to deal with this anomaly, and we are now proceeding to amend the federal law. In respect of the normal husband and wife who live together, the husband earns the income, and pays, probably, most of it as housekeeping money to his wife, and she spends it. No one would think of taxing that money as the income of the wife. But in the case of people who are separated, the law, at present, provides that both the husband and the wife pay income tax. It is thought that that is not fair, and the object of the amendment is to bring about an alteration of that posisaid that if the income on which petrol tion.

Because of lengthy litigation which went as far as the Privy Council, there has been considerable delay in arriving even at the present stage. I am glad to say that the Commonwealth Government won on all occasions. From my own knowledge, 1 can say that the Commissioner of Taxation and his department have done everything reasonably possible to protect the revenue of the country, and whenever their decisions have been challenged they have defended the position. We have now reached a stage when the facts are being sifted. No doubt an inquiry is desirable, but I am not sure that a royal commission would be the right means. -There are a number of companies in Australia, well known to us, which, because of the adverse exchange position, are retaining in the Commonwealth considerable sums of money, representing the profits of their activities.

82,. Mr Latham (Kooyong,"Attorneyof the dividends in their assessable incomes. The amendment in clause 5 b was proposed because it was considered that the special tax should not be lost on any dividends paid during the operation of that tax. It is now being claimed by interested taxpayers that the proposed amendment should not be proceeded with. These claims are based on the ground that the companies concerned have already made distributions of profits on the assumption that, by virtue of the existing rebate provisions, shareholders will not have to bear any income tax on those distributions. In the course of examining the merits of these claims, the question has arisen whether, apart from the point of view of obtaining additional revenue, there is any real justification for the proposed amendment. Tax assessed under section 21 is paid by companies on undistributed income, usually ordinary business profits. The Commissioner determines in a particular case that the company concerned could reasonably have distributed a certain amount of its undistributed income, and the company is required to pay the additional tax that would have been payable by the shareholders if the company had distributed that amount. In other words, tax is collected on the basis that the undistributed business profits of the company have been converted into property income in the form of dividends in the hands of shareholders. At this stage, such profits have theoretically been fully taxed, that is, once at ordinary company rate as income of the company, and again as income assumed to be distributed as dividends to the shareholders. In theory, therefore, those profits should not again be taxed when actually distributed to the shareholders. The existing law accords with that theory, and the question for consideration is whether a departure from the theory is justified where (a) the fictional distribution of profits for the purposes of section 21 is assumed to take place prior to the commencement of the special tax ou property income; and (b) the actual distribution of those profits as dividends takes place after the commencement of the special tax. When the amendment proposed by clause (b) was first mooted, it was considered that the emergency Mr Latham. character of the special tax justified its application to dividends actually paid during its operation, notwithstanding that companies may have paid tax under section 21 on the assumption that those dividends had been paid prior to the operation of the special tax. It appears, however, that this point of view neglects to take account of the fact that where the fictional distributions for the purposes of section 21 are assumed to take place during the operation of the special tax, companies are required to»pay the special tax the shareholders would have paid if the distributions bad actually taken place. When the profits fictionally distributed are, in later years, actually distributed as dividends, the special tax may no longer be in operation, and if the Government now introduces an amendment which it purports to support on the grounds that a special tax is intended to be applied to actual dividends, it will, no doubt, be faced with the inconsistency that it is collecting a special tax under section 21 on fictional dividends. To justify the proposed amendment it will be necessary to reconcile tbe co-existence of the following bases of taxation: (1.) The taxation of a company on fictional dividends assumed to have been paid prior to the operation of the special tax. (2.) The application of a special tax to dividends actually paid out of the same profits during the operation of the special tax. (3.) The application of the special tax in assessments under section 21 to fictional dividends assumed to have been paid during the operation of the special tax, even though the profits so taxed under section 21 may, in later years, be distributed at a time when the special tax is no longer in force. In the circumstances, it appears to be impossible in principle to justify the proposed amendment except on the bare plea of the need for additional revenue. agree that it would be difficult to sustain the principle of this amendment, although I am certain that it was not included without due consideration. Should this special tax be remitted, I foresee future claims for exemption from the tax on distributed dividends after the tax has been either reduced or remitted entirely. We cannot have two different sets of principles. The principle we are now laying",21,Lyons
83,Mr Scitlliir (Yarra) [11.34],"Idown must be maintained in future after this tax has been lifted. The effect of this amendment would be that the Commissioner would be claiming 10 per cent, super tax in respect of dividends that were deemed to have been distributed before the tax was imposed. Assume that profits were made in 1927 before the special tax was imposed and are now included in dividends. The departmental claim was that as the special tax had not been paid on the profits it should be paid in respect of the dividends. The department cannot have it both ways. If it deemed those profits to have been distributed in 1927 they were, for taxation purposes, so distributed. A company may pay two-thirds of its profits into reserve, but the department deems, two-thirds of the profits to have been distributed. Section 21 protects the revenue against a company which might put profits into reserves to avoid taxation, and then distribute them as bonus shares; but if profits were deemed to have been distributed when they were put into reserve before this special tax was imposed, they cannot be regarded now as taxable in the form of dividends. venient from a revenue point of view uow, but it might be very inconvenient in the future. been reduced, the revenue would suffer.

This practice passed unquestioned until the judgment of the High Court in the case of Penrose v. Commissioner of Taxation. This established a curious anomaly in that the result was that if a taxpayer furnished a return showing sufficient income to render him liable to tax, and was assessed upon that return, and subsequently omissions of income were discovered, he was exposed to the f u l l effect of section 67, with its double tax penalties. Buti f the taxpayer committed a graver offence by either failing altogether to furnish a return or by furnishing a return showing an income so small as not to be liable to tax, section 67 was, by reason of the High Court judgment referred to, not applicable, and the taxpayer escaped the additional tax imposed by that section. It is considered that this anomaly could not be permitted to continue, and that such a person should be liable to the same extent as persons whose offence was, in degree at least, less. in the law provided that no injustice is done to persons who have already established their legal right under the existing provisions.

I want. intend to propose an amendment to give the taxpayer the right of appeal against penalties imposed by the Commissioner. Part V. provides for appeal to a board of review and to the High Court on matters of fact and law, but when the appeal has been decided and the taxpayer has been declared at fault, the task of determining the appropriate penalty rests with the Commissioner, who must be regarded as having been in active litigation with the taxpayer. recently came under the notice of the High Court in the case of Richardson v. The Federal Commissioner of Taxation, and Mr Justice Stark then statedHere the additional tax, according to the taxpayer's contention, should be assessed on this sum. Justice would thus be done to the taxpayer, though his punishment would still be heavy, for additional taxation by way of penalty would, in the aggregate, amount to £9,078 instead of £22,089 as now imposed. The provisions of section 07 are, I think, too strong. I am not aware of any system of justice which at the close of protracted and, perhaps, embittered, litigation leaves to the successful party the decision of the rights of the unsuccessful party. By the appeal provisions of Part V., the Commissioner is made a litigant. He succeeds, and fixes the penalty, and there is no appeal from his decision. I recognize, as one honourable gentleman remarked in this chamber the other day, that hard cases sometimes made bad laws, and that a bard case is not a sufficient reason in itself for an alteration of the law; but I ask for an alteration of the law on the general principle of equity, that no man should be a judge in his own cause. The Commissioner fighting a taxpayer should not be left to give judgment against the taxpayer, and then punish him. Surely that proposition will not be controverted. A. recent case of this nature has been brought under my notice by the Taxpayers Association of New South Wales since this bill was introduced. The Taxpayers Association assures me I believe that other that its members have long felt the need for the amendment I am about to suggest. member's amendment? ment may come under the consideration of the committee immediately, I move That the following paragraph be added:"" (&) by inserting the following proviso:' Provided further that if the taxpayer is dissatisfied w it h the decision of the Commissioner on an application for a remission of additional tax under this section, the taxpayer may within t h i r t y days after the service by post of notice of that decision in writing , or such further time as may be allowed by the court on the hearing of tlie' appeal herein provided for, The effect of section 67 request the Commissioner to treat the matter as an appeal and forward it either to the High Court or to the Supreme Court of a State, and thereupon the Commissioner shall forward it accordingly.

The circumstances of the case brought, under my notice are that a man in* Sydney was in business as a hotel keeper.. A part of his receipts over a certaim period consisted of profits made from thepurchase and sale of hotel leases. Thequestion arose whether these profits wereprofits of his business. He contended, that they were not, and the Commis-sioner opposed his contention. The matter was settled in favour of the taxpayerunder a decision of the House of Lords, given about that time. The case on which the decision was given came before the English courts, but the English law and the case in question were similar to this one. It was held by the House of "" Lords in the case of Leeming versus Jones, 415, A.C. 1930, that if a man^ in the business of buying and selling hotel leases made a profit in another business which was not his ordinary business, such profits need not be disclosed as income.",23,Lyons

This surely is bureauThat is now the law, and the man to whom I have referred is prepared to obey it . But the new law was given a sufficiently retrospective effect to cover the period in dispute between the taxpayer and the Commissioner. Commissioner subsequently decided that this taxpayer should have declared the profits on the sale of these leases as'income right through the years when, in fact, by the decision of the House of Lords, it was not income. The Commissioner next decided that the taxpayer had made a false return by his failure to disclose this income through the years when it was not income and he was not under obligation to disclose it as such. I repeat that it was held not to be income by the judgment of the highest court of England. On the ground that the man had made a ""false return, the Commissioner directed that he should pay not only the taxation due on the amount that had been in dispute, but twice that amount as penalty for not disclosing it as income. This case is said to be one of many of the same kind which have come under the notice of the Taxpayers Association. For the benefit of honourable members, who are not from New South Wales, I give my assurance that the Taxpayers Association is indisputably a body of first class standing, including in its membership leading professional men, as the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) and certain other honourable members of this committee could testify. It has done excellent work, and is actuated by a commendable public spirit. For example, it made available to its members and the general public valuable information ih regard to our sales taxation. In the case to which I have referred, fixes all penalties, but the Commisthe taxpayer had no appeal whatever, sioner, is given a power of remission. and he has been called upon to pay an It is now proposed by the honourable amount far beyond any sum that he has member that the power to remit ever possessed. He cannot do so, and is faced with immediate bankruptcy. No one can interfere with the Commissioner, or request him to reduce this penalty, although the offence for which it was imposed was failure to disclose income which, under the definition of income given by the highest court of England, was not income. Unless some redress is given to this man, his commercial career cracy in its highest development! I therefore ask the Government to give sympathetic consideration to the amendment, which I have moved. The granting, of such an appeal could not do any The harm. I think it is not the desire of the Treasury or of the heads of any of the departments wrongfully to take money from taxpayers. A ll they desire is surely to oblige a man to pay what he owes. I am seeking to substitute an appeal to the High Court for an arbitrary decision of the Taxation Commissioner whose interest it is, naturally, to protect the revenue. No possible harm can be done by providing the right of such an appeal. Considerable feeling has been aroused in Sydney on this subject, and since the introduction of this bill numerous articles have appeared in various sections of the press in support of the amendment which I am now moving. the honourable member is seeking to substitute the discretion of the court for the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation.

If judges are to be asked to discharge such a function it will be something entirely new and unprecedented. In the case of certain defaults certain penalties are by law imposed, subject to a power of remission in the Commissioner. It is quite novel to suggest that judges should say whether a man ought to be let off something more than the Commissioner is prepared to remit. As the Attorney-General, I am acquainted with the discharge of functions of this nature. When applications are made for the remission of ordinary penalties, it is the duty of the Attorney-General, independent of political considerations altogether, to advise the Governor General. Many factors are considered in the exercise of the discretionary power to remit. tions which have no strict legal significance are taken < into account. From time to time remission of penalties have been made in cases, for example, of a man with a sick wife. Isi t intended that such matters shall be submitted to judges? I suppose if Parliament says that the judges shall do this work they will have to do it , but how will it be done? Is it suggested that there should be a trial for the remission of penalty? Surely not. Is evidence to be called to show whether a man has been treated with sufficient leniency by the Commissioner? What standard is to be applied? I remind honourable members that we are not considering the imposition of a penalty. The penalty is imposed automatically under the act. Parliament has said that, in certain cases, there shall be a liability to must be maintained-that a higher rate pay additional tax at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum, and in other cases the additional tax may be double the difference between the tax properly payable, and the tax as originally assessed. I can assure honourable members that it is important that these penalties should be automatic. general, all-round squabble as to whether a penalty should be imposed or not, it would interfere with the effectiveness of the taxation system. When a taxpayer Mr Latham. brings himself within this provision, by failing or neglecting to furnish returns or information, &c, Parliament has said that certain penalties shall be automatically imposed, but power is granted to the Commissioner to remit those penalties. I suggest that this is properly an administrative provision. If it is turned into a matter for adjudication, I am sure that we shall have very many more evasions of taxation in the future than at present. son who administers the provision be one of the parties to the dispute? ment has laid it down that the rate of penalty shall be 10 per cent., but that the Commissioner may remit the penalty, whether there is a dispute between him and the taxpayer or not. Ordinarily, when it is found that a fault has been committed, a notice i? sent out charging the Even consideraextra tax. If the taxpayer objects to the charge, he may make a plea for leniency, and the Commissioner may determine the plea. In some cases the penalty is imposed because of information received by the Commissioner, with which he is able to challenge the taxpayer, and the taxpayer accepts the decision. The Commissioner receives information from many sources, some of them anonymous. The taxpayer may challenge any such information, but if there is to be a legal trial in every such case, honourable members may reconcile themselves to the fact that the income tax rate will have to be increased. I have often said to my good friends of the taxpayers' associations that some of their activities are likely to have the direct effect of increasing the income tax. If the revenue safeguards are taken away, the effect will be-sinc e the revenue of tax must be imposed, or, at any rate, that it will be impossible to make the remissions in other directions in which they have been asked for. This is one of the last directions in which remissions should be made.

It is a remarkable thing, however, that, despite the hundreds of complaints which I have received about this act, I have never had a complaint about this particular section of it. This section protects honest people, though it may be a little hard on dishonest ones. I do not propose to discuss the case upon which this appeal is largely based. I can understand that the creditors of the well-known, and, I might say, notorious gentleman concerned in that case are interested in the amount of the fine imposed by the Commissioner; but if we are to discuss that case it will be necessary to go into other phases of the matter, which I do not think is desirable at the present time. I ask Parliament to retain this provision, which is a sound one, and is necessary to protect the revenue. evidence whatever that it has not been fairly administered.

It is hoped that, as the result of the inquiries of the royal commission which has just begun its sittings in Sydney, a simplification will be brought about. do not think that any honourable members are in favour of deleting this provision. If a man has wilfully evaded the payment of his taxes, he deserves to be punished to the limit. There are always dishonest people about, and they are particularly active in connection with income tax payments. There are others, however, who are not exactly dishonest, but who have to suffer under this provision.

Seeing that he was able to obtain the property, it must be evident, they say, .that he has been robbing the Treasury. They arrive at his true income by dividing the value of the property by the number of years taken to accumulate it . In many cases the taxation authorities arrive at a fairly correct result, because there are men who have gone out of their way to conceal their incomes from the authorities. It is only when an investigation has been instituted that they admit that they have been misleading the Commissioner. There are others, however, who have failed, through ignorance, to furnish proper returns. Many men are unable to say what property or money they possessed ten or fifteen years ago, and it is necessary to have that information in order to determine how much proThere is no perty they have accumulated since. It follows that, in some instances, their incomes have been improperly assessed.

Many taxpayers do not make all the deductions allowed by the law. As one who has had experience of making up income tax returns for various people, I can say that I have never yet known a man to furnish a complete set of deductions. When I have asked a taxpayer whether he did not spend a certain sum of money for such and such a purpose, he has said that he did, but had forgotten all about it. Even by going through his cheque book butts I could not always trace the payment, because he might have drawn a cheque for £20, and paid the amount in cash.

I think that it should be stated in the act in what circumstances a man may obtain relief, either wholly or in part. In most legislation maximum penalties are provided, but they are rarely imposed. In this case, however, the maximum penalty is always imposed, and once it has been inflicted it is difficult to obtain relief. We know that when it comes to selling a horse, or paying taxes, many men not otherwise dishonest, waver slightly from the strict moral code, but some of those who have been fined for tax evasion have, I innocent of any intention to defraud. In the States, when a taxpayer goes before the court he can usually, without any trouble, obtain some remission of the penalty imposed upon him. But, personally, I do not know of a case in which the Federal Commissioner of Taxation has waived any part of a fine. such cases set out in the report of the Commissioner, which was recently presented to Parliament. knowledge of such cases, because none of my clients, nor those of my friends, have applied for remissions of penalties. I admit that there are thousands of cases that do not come under my notice. I suggest that the act should lay down certain rules which would enable a taxpayer to understand the basis of remissions of taxation. The Attorney-General has told us bow these remissions are arrived at, and what he has said is news to me. I was glad to hear his explanation, because it penalized under this provision know that there is some opportunity to obtain a remission. Many taxpayers pay their fines without protest, believing that they cannot appeal against the decision of the Commissioner. I do not suggest that this provision should be loosened, but at the same time, I think that, in of business, other than that mentioned by the honourable member for Martin abused that power? ( Mr Holman), some rules should be laid down in the act for the guidance he has. It is often to the benefit of the of the Commissioner. It is too much to taxpayer that the Commissioner is able lay the Commissioner open to the suspicion of favouritism. In making his decisions he must keep within the four corners of the act, * and because of that, and because he has been placed in a position of trust, he may be inclined to exercise his powers too strictly rather than too liberally. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [12.18] -On e aspect of the case mentioned by the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) I should like the Attorney-General to explain or to enlarge upon, because it seems to me to be an injustice to penalize a taxpayer because he has not furnished a am quite certain, been entirely return of income when there was no occasion previously for him to furnish one. case there would be no authority for imposing a penalty at all. Mr E. J. HARRISON -I understand that retrospective legislation was introduced to meet a case of that kind, and I should like the Attorney-General to make plain the justice of the provision. The honourable member for Martin mentioned a judgment of the House of Lords. It was because of that decision that a return of income was not furnished by the individual concerned. Legislation was introduced into this Parliament by the Government of the day which brought this person within the taxable field, and it seems to me to have been an injustice to fine him merely because he had not made a return of his income at a time when it was not taxable. I should like the Attorney-General to explain the position.

I do not wish to suggest anything against the Commissioner, but I know of cases in respect of which I consider that the decision of the Commissioner has been harsh. His business is really that of tax collecting. It is an unpleasant job, and the Commissioner relieves the government of the day of the disagreeable duty of refusing concessions. Still, I doubt whether an officer of the taxation office is the proper authority to exercise the discretion which has been placed in the hands of the Commissioner by this Parliament. It is true that the act provides for a penalty of double the amount of taxation, ibut it was not intended that that penalty should be inflicted in all cases. Circumstances vary, .and in some instances there should be remissions of fines, even where guilt has been proved. The degree of guilt varies, and, therefore, the penalty should not be fixed by act of Parliament. In most of our legislation the penalty prescribed is a maximum penalty, which it is not intended should be inflicted in all cases. Some discretion must be exercised as to the extent of the penalty to be imposed, but I do not think that the Commissioner of Taxation is the proper person ito make the final decision. In many instances the taxpayers are brought to book after a hunt, and a hunter naturally takes a delight in the kill. Very often there is a contest of wits between the taxation officer and the taxpayer, and when the officer, who, after all, is only human, runs the taxpayer to earth, it is only to be expected that the taxpayer will receive rather severe treatment at the hands of his pursuer. There should, therefore, be an opportunity given to the taxpayer to appeal to a judge. would not frequently be availed of, because the taxpayer who has been fined, unless he has a strong grievance, will object to having his affairs made public. But there are cases in which the penalty does not fit the crime, and where fair remissions have not been granted. In certain instances, the decision of ithe Commissioner has resulted in the bankruptcy of the taxpayer. I do not think that the Commissioner should be the final arbitrator. In our criminal and other courts opportunities are given for the revision of penalties. There can be no fairer tribunal than a court presided over by a judge, and it would not be weakening the general value of this position if the right were given to the taxpayer, who feels aggrieved because of the decision of the Commissioner, to appeal Ito a High Court judge. amendment proposed by the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) would, if accepted, unquestionably weaken our taxation laws. The .power to collect the tax would 'be diminished', and that would have the boomerang effect of increasing the rate needed to enable the Government to obtain the revenue required. I agree with what the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) has said. Whenever we create a loophole in the law and thus give some people an opportunity to evade taxation, we reduce the amount of our revenue, and that, if not checked, would inevitably bring about an increase in rates. I was astonished at the remarks of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn), and I am sure that if he reflects he will regret what he has said of the taxation officials. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) thought that the power to remit any portion of a penalty should not be placed in the hands of the Commissioner. My opinion is that it is in the interests of the great body of taxpayers that the Commissioner should have that power. The smaller taxpayers, if they were not permitted to ask the Commissioner for remission of penalties, would have no option but to appeal to the court, and if they did that, the cost of litigation would probably That opportunity amount to more than the remission of penalty asked for. The honourable member for Perth said that the Commissioner is really the hunter; that he pursues the taxpayer and takes a delight in the kill. I suggest that that is not the language to apply to an officer who has been placed by this Parliament",28,Lyons
113,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [12.28],"Th ein a position involving the duty of making impartial decisions. If I thought that the Commissioner of Taxation took "" delight in the k ill "" , I should move immediately in this House for the appointment of a new Commissioner of Taxation. This officer is invested with power greater, probably, than that possessed by any other individual in the community. He has discretion to remit penalties for the evasion of income tax. have not implicit faith in him, our whole system fails, for there is no other satisfactory way of carrying out the intricacies of income and land taxation than by the methods we employ. I ask the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) to put the whole of the cards on the table, and submit full particulars of the case to which he has referred before asking us to start to weaken our system of taxation. I have before me the last report of the Commissioner of Taxation, in which is given a list of over 100 cases showing how the Commissioner has dealt with attempts to evade taxation. The fact that we have not heard one of these cases mentioned in the House surely indicates that there cannot be very much wrong with the administration. concerns an omission of £10,201 from an income tax return. The penalty imposed was only £89. No doubt there were mitigating circumstances. The next case concerns an omission of £11,478, the penalty inflicted being £381. Nobody will claim that those are harsh penalties. It must be remembered that the law imposes a penalty amounting to double the rate of tax that would have been assessed had a correct return been rendered. In the first case that I have mentioned, the assessment might have been £2,000. very light one, indeed. In fact, some might declare that there was undue leniency, though I do not think so. Here is a case in which an amount of £30,000 was omitted from a return, resulting in the imposition of a penalty of £1,000. Another case concerns the omission of £755, for which the penalty was £72. Of course, circumstances vary, and that influences the decision of the Commissioner. There is an instance of a man having omitted the amount of Mr Scullin. £237,790 from his return. He was no back-country storekeeper. That person would certainly have a bookkeeping arrangement. The penalty imposed was £96,733. Probably it was the maximum penalty, but I have no doubt that it was well deserved. The list covers seven pages of the report, and, if I read it aright, the treatment of both big men and little men is equitable. If we There has been an endeavour by certain honourable members to convey the impression to the committee that the Commissioner of Taxation fixes the penalty. He does not. This Parliament fixes the penalty, and with good reason. But the Commissioner has power to remit a penalty. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) said that he does not know of any case in which that has been done. Has he examined this list? meant that no such case had come within my personal knowledge. know of cases either of remission or of the imposition of a penalty, but that is merely because I have not come into contact with people who evade taxation. I suggest that where The first case a heavy penalty has been imposed the Commissioner was absolutely eonvinced that there was a deliberate attempt to evade the payment of tax. I gathered from the remarks of the man) that the taxpayer to whom he referred has for a number of years failed to include in his returns profits on the sales of leaseholds. The honourable member also referred to the decision of the House of Lords that profits from such transactions are not to be regarded as profits Therefore, the penalty was a from ordinary trading activities, and are, therefore, free from income tax. That decision was given in 1930, I understand. but I understand that it was in 1928. I believe that the honourable member is wrong. This Parliament would not allow a decision of the House of Lords to stand for two years before it amended its legislation.

If it is proved that there has been an injustice, the circumstances should be investigated, and, possibly, the law should be reviewed. But I am not prepared to ask the court to assume the responsibility of remitting a penalty which this Parliament has deliberately imposed.. That is a function which the court should not exercise. Referring to another case, the honourable member for Martin said that the judge hearing it had declared that section 67 of the act is too strong. What right has a judge to say that a section is too strong? If he were in this Parliament as a representative of the people-and many eminent judges have been members of this Parliament before being transferred to the Bench-hi s opinion would carry the weight of only one member of Parliament. matters are purely matters of policy. mitted to make comments during a trial. the less comment they make the better. ment in that way upon the laws passed by exceed their function. It is their task to interpret the law, and give judicial decisions, not to give opinions on political decisions. It is not for judges to say whether these penalties are too strong. This Parliament has been operating taxation legislation since 1914, and it is guided by the experience of other parliaments going back for many years. Taxpayers have their advocates in Parliament, which, in its wisdom, has tightened up this section against taxdodgers. One could imagine what would be the result if we were to hand over the When legislation is intropower that is sought to judges who incidentally express views about legislation being strong. I venture to say that that judge would not have imposed that fine of £96,733 for evasion of taxation. This Parliament deliberately made possible the imposition of such a penalty, because' taxation is such an easy thing to evade. I venture the opinion that income tax is being evaded by a large section which should be paying it. The honourable member for Maranoa said that many do not regard one who evades taxation as a criminal or a dishonest man; that such action is not an offence against the moral law. A man who deliberately falsifies his return knowing that he is going to evade his legal obligation is breaking the law just as much as another man who goes into a shop and steals a pound of butter or anything else. I can imagine that the judge who regarded this legislation as too strong would not hesitate to sentence a man to gaol for stealing. Discretion has to be used by the Commissioner, for occasionally false returns are sent in merely as the result of an oversight. But I see no reason why we should become tender over the man who deliberately falsifies his return and can afford to pay tax. Too many people are sympathetic towards evasions by taxpayers, because it is considered that Those the incidence of taxation is extremely heavy. It is felt by them that anybody who can relieve himself of that burden, or beat the Government in any way, deserves the best of fortune. Parliament, in its wisdom, has imposed a penalty amounting to double the amount of tax that is due, in cases of deliberate evasions. It has also given the Commissioner this legislature they power to investigate the circumstances, and remit. Honourable members would do well to examine the report to which I have referred, and determine for themselves whether the Commissioner is the tyrant which some would have us believe.

The Leader of the Opposition declared that the courts have been inclined to show sympathy towards taxpayers who have attempted to evade taxation. The implication is that the Commissioner of Taxation shows less sympathy towards those people, and is not disposed to let cases go to the court. The Leader of the Opposition prefers that the Commissioner of Taxation should have the right to exact the full penalty, rather than that the taxpayer should have the right of appeal to a court. He suggested that the judges had been rather inclined to sympathize with the taxpayer. We should have no hesitation in declaring that a court is likely to be a fairer tribunal than the Commissioner of Taxation. penalties imposed by the legislature, and the case quoted by the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) proves that the Parliament takes a view different from that of some judges. imputation of partiality on the present Commissioner or his officers, but I assert that their occupation makes them pursuers, and unfits them to give an impartial decision. said that the Commissioner was a hunter, "" taking delight in the k ill "" . frained from making any personal criticism of the present Commissioner; my remarks apply to his office. Although a Crown prosecutor is as capable of being impartial as is the Commissioner, he is not permitted to judge a case. But, in dealing with a defaulting taxpayer, the Commissioner, who is, in practice, the prosecutor, has the power to determine the penalty. The hunting down of defaulting taxpayers is the special concern of the Commissioner and his officers, and he should not have the final determination of penalties, which often amount to many thousands of pounds. Downs) [12.50] I agree with the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) that the principle contained in section 67 should act or omission under the section is fixed by statute, and is applied only after the offence has been established. The taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner for a remission of the penalty, and the onus is upon the applicant to establish his claim. The Commissioner may not remit a penalty unless he has very good reasons; but he has very wide discretionary power. Very rarely is an appeal provided in cases in which there is this discretion. Even in the courts one judge will be loath to override the exercise of discretion by another judge. The exercise of. discretion involves a matter of opinion, rather than of law; therefore, the substitution of a judge's discretion for the Commissioner's discretion would be, in effect merely the substitution of one man's opinion for that of another man. Whether one man is better trained than another to exercise discretionary power depends on the nature of the business to which the discretion is to apply. I dispute the suggestion that the Commissioner is a hunter. The remarkable manner in which the first Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Mackay, exercised the I have not cast any discretionary power conferred upon him by statute was noted with approval throughout Australia, and the high tradition he established has been maintained by the present Commissioner. The discovery of an offence is not his personal concern. He has a body of trained officers, who inquire into books, incomes, and business dealings of taxpayers, and I have purposely reany case of evasion or omission may ultimately come before the Commissioner to be deal with. than the Attorney-General is a prosecutor. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -He is no more a hunter than is a judge who deals with evidence Brought before him by the Crown.

The Commissioner has a sound knowledge of business methods and commercial practice, and is able to apply it to the advantage, as well as to tbe detriment, of the taxpayer. If a matter of penalties were dealt with by a judge, he would not sift the facts better than the Commissioner does. The adoption of the amendment would introduce a cumbersome method of appeal which would not be more satisfactory than the present system. The Commissioner realizes his responsibility and exercises his discretion wisely and impartially. -The following paragraph from the report of the Commissioner of Taxation for 1929-30 may be of interest to the committee as evidence of the methods adopted by the department:The department, hy investigation of taxpayers' books and accounts, has discovered a number of cases in which questionable returns have been lodged by taxpayers. In many eases there has been little room for doubt to the lay mind that fraud has been present; but the difficulty of proving fraud in accordance wit h realize, too, that it would be possible for legal rules has been so great that, in the majority of cases, the department has imposed the maximum penalty provided by section 59 of that act, namely, double the amount of the tax that had been evaded. The Commissioner and his officers do not exercise their discretionary powers perfunctorily; they go fully into the facts. Some of the best-known firms in Australia have been found guilty of evasion of taxation. One firm omitted from its return £10,369 of income, and was fined £2,592. The offence of another taxpayer must have been more grave, for he was penalized to the amount of £4,895 for having omitted from his return £6,059 of income. The Commissioner's accountants thoroughly investigate the transactions of the taxpayers, and only established fraud does the Commissioner have to exercise his discretion in regard to the fixation of penalties. Sitting suspended from 12.58 lo 2.15 p.m. regret that this argument has not been confined to broad principles. The statement of the Attorney-General( Mr their notice my experience is that if they Latham) has put quite a new complexion on the subject. I do not think any honourable member will take the side of the [116] deliberate tax evaders. Th© provision before the Chair deals with persons who have been found guilty. As the Attorney General has said, the Commissioner'can only go upon the evidence in particular cases. A man in a small way of business who has not kept proper books is almost obliged to plead guilty; but some cases of tax evasion are accidental and not deliberate. In such cases it seems to me that it would be a good thing if the taxpayer concerned could have the question of penalty referred to some authority other than the Commissioner; but I can quite see that if the proposals of the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) were agreed to, it would be almost impossible to avoid a complete rehearing of the case. One or two remarks by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) -were capable of an interpretation which he did not intend. I do not think the honoralble gentleman will need me to assure him that I have never had anything to do with taxation evaders. a man to have some legitimate dealings with a tax evader. knowledge whatever of tax evaders.

I regret that certain remarks have been made with regard to the Commissioner of Taxation. I have had a number of r.hey have dealings with this gentleman and with his officers, and also with the State taxation officials, and my experience has been similar to that of the Leader of the Opposition.

T have been, moreover, quite certain in a number of cases submitted to me, that the taxpayers have been overtaxed, but through the absence of proper accouuts I have not been able to prove it. It is unfortunate that some people have Lord Dunedin is quoted as follows:the idea that tax evasion is not an infringement of the moral code, though that is undoubtedly the position.' There seems to have been a loosening of the mora I tenmerely the application of old principles to the sion iu many respects in recent years, in stock exchange dealings, market rigging, the preparation of false returns and the like. In my opinion, those who deliberately evade taxation deserve to suffer the full penalty, but, where possible, consideration should be given to those who evade the law through ignorance. Several honourable members have made reof taxpayers by the officers of the Taxation Department; but I gladly testify that all the dealing that I have had with these gentlemen have been helpful. They have shown me the utmost courtesy, and have given me great assistance on every is 8 fool who occasion. Taxpayers who have innocently made mistakes in the preparation of their return need not hesitate to submit their cases to the officers of the department, who are only too willing to rectify such mistakes. I do not know of a single instance of harsh treatment in such circumstances. Some people seem to think that the officers of the Taxation Department If the remarks made by endeavour to extract as much money as possible from the taxpayers; but that is not so. Persons who deliberately attempt to take undue advantage of the officers the taxation department deal of the department must not complain if they are subsequently met with unsympathetic treatment. I regret that some honourable members of the committee have officers deal harshly with taxpayers who have made legitimate mistakes owing to their inability properly to prepare their taxation returns. tain statements expressed during this debate make it desirable for me to clarify one or two points. First of all, I owe an apology to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin). His recollection that the Leeming v. Jones case was heard in 1930 was correci. I thought it had been heard a couple of years earlier, but I propose to read a ?uort passage from the report of this case to show that my view that the judges were merely applying well established principles of law was correct.

I must confess astonishment at the antagonism that has been aroused to the idea of an appeal. interfere with rude hand with the settled rights of the taxpayer or the powers of the tax collector, I should be prepared to stand rebuked for experimenting with a system the merits of which I did not understand. however, merely proposed to introduce the right of appeal, and that is so bound up with the ordinary legal rights of citizens, that I cannot understand the objection taken by the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) and the Leader of the Opposition. An appeal can only havo one purpose-the remedying of injustice. The Attorney-General and the Leader of the Opposition seemed to contend, however, that, if the right of appeal were granted in this instance, it would lead to a diminution of revenue, and that the rate of taxation which, would have to be paid by the undoubtedly honest taxpayers would, therefore, have to be increased. Do they assert that the revenue from taxation cannot be obtained at its maximum without the right to do an occasional injustice ? either of us made any such suggestion. rhe logical inference from the statements to which I am replying. It was said, in effect, that if we remedy injustice by establishing the right to appeal, we shall diminish the quantum of tax collected. ""What does that mean but that the maximum taxation can be collected only by retaining the right to perpetrate injustice? I am sure that neither the Attorney-General nor the Leader of the Oppositiou really take that position; but I cannot understand their antagonism to my proposal. It is laid down in the act that the Commissioner must initiate a prosecution for certain offences, the penalty for which is actually inflicted by the tribunal before which the prosecution is conducted. penalty is comparatively small. In cases in which a penalty of less than £100 is concerned, the taxpayer has the protection of an independent and judicial mind, which can intervene between him and the tax officials; yet when the penalty may involve an enormous sum, the officials are made the judges in their own cause. ShouldI be sued, and judgment be obtained against me, for the sum of DidI propose to £300, I can appeal, not on the facts, of course, but on the law. But in the cases which we are now discussing the penalty may run into five figures, and there is no appeal of any kind. We are told that an appeal cannot be allowed, because it I have, would interfere with the efficiency of the machinery by which the tax is collected. member is not suggesting that there are not ample provisions for appeal on both the law and the facts in the act as it stands ? lack of the right of appeal on the quantum of the penalty. This morning the Attorney-General, in the course of his reply, questioned the character of the man whose case I cited when speaking to my amendment. from discussing that case, on the ground that to do so would necessitate going into other matters, which was not desirable. placed at my disposal is correct, the man failed to disclose income earned during a time when the money, in respect of which the penalty was inflicted, was not, within the meaning of the act, regarded as income, and there was no legal requirement to disclose the facts to the Commissioner. The penalty was imposed for failure to disclose the facts subsequently. The character of the man is not at issue. What may happen to the bad man to-day may happen to the good man to-morrow; the wording of the law should not . depend on the individual character of those who come under it. It is not necessary to produce a certificate of character before entering a court as plaintiff. judgment on legislation on the strength of a single case, should we not be furFor those offences the nished with all the papers relating to it? informed that a deputation from the Sydney Chamber of Commerce waited on the Prime Minister six or eight months",34,Lyons

This is a matter, however, which has been under the consideration of public bodies, such as the Taxpayers Association and the Chamber of Commerce, for months.

The reform asked for by the various bodies of which I have spoken is the right of appeal against the penalty imposed. I beg the committee to remember that those representative bodies think that, the powers under section 67 of the act are too strong.

The honourable member asked that the section should be amended on the ground that the powers are too strong. I do not know just what he meant by that. : by the section is unqualified; there is n'6 right of appeal. there is an appeal from the legislature to the Commissioner. If anything needs amendment, it is the section itself. If Parliament considers the section too severe, the penalties should be reviewed, but there is no need to grant the right of appeal to a court. The honourable member for Martin said that the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) and I refused to admit the, right was not serious. The appeal, if permitted, would be, not an appeal for justice, but for mercy; an appeal for the remission of a penalty imposed by Parliament, on the assumption that the facts and the law were correct. If the taxpayer desires to challenge either the facts or the law, he has the right of appeal now. But, the facts and the law being established, Parliament has inflicted a penalty which takes effect automatically, after which there is the right of appeal to the 'Commissioner for the remission or reduction of the legally imposed penalty. We must assume that, in this case, the facts and the law have been established; otherwise, the taxpayer would have appealed against them. If he does not, he admits them both. If he admits the facts and the law, any appeal he makes must be for mercy, and whoever heard of approaching a court to appeal for mercy. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) The likened the Commissioner for Taxation to a crown prosecutor. He does not stand sioner is in control of a department. His officers pursue inquiries, as do members of the police force in criminal cases.

I endeavoured to obtain some information from the Treasury on this matter, and I was informed that this institution could not legally make this charge. I made further inquiries from the Attorney-General's Department-a t the time the Attorney General was in England-and received advice that the matter would have to be dealt with by the High Court. I have ascertained from the solicitor referred to that a number of mortgagors have refused point blank to. pay the super fax of 10 per cent., and that the institution has taken no action against them. But the poor, unfortunate persons who cannot borrow elsewhere are compelled to pay this tax. This clause makes provision for the future projection of such men. Subclause 4 states "" that any provision in a mortgage by or under which it is provided that any income tax payable by the mortgagee . . ."". I suggest that after the word "" payable "" the words "" or had been paid"" be inserted, and that the clause should be retrospective to the 1st October, 1931, the date of the passing of the Victorian law.

Section 12 of the principal act provides that the information obtained by the Commissioner and other officers is secret. There are, however, certain exceptions. Sub-section 4 provides that the Commissioner and other officers are entitled to communicate what comes to their knowledge officially to a board of review appointed under the act, or to the Commissioner of income tax in any State, or the officer or authority administering any act of a State relating to stamp duties or succession duties, or to the Commissioner of Pensions or the Eepatriation Commission, for the purpose of the administration of any law of the Commonwealth relating to pensions. Then there is a proviso. The proposed amendment will make it possible for taxation, officers to communicate information to the Director-General of Health for the purpose of the administration of any law for the Federal Capital Territory. The committee is asked to include this provision in order to make it possible for the Government to consider a scheme relating to the maintenance of hospitals in the Federal Capital Territory. Although not yet completed, there is such a scheme under the consideration of ithe Minister for Health which will involve the imposition of a hospital tax. In order to impose that tax and avoid the necessity of citizens of the Territory sending in further returns, it is proposed to authorize the Commissioner of Taxation to give information to the Director-General of Health. I do not wish to speak about hospitals in Canberra beyond saying that, as honourable members know, public hospitals in the various States are maintained in part by public money, which is State money, and in part by donations and subscriptions. A difficulty arises in Canberra in relation to the almost complete maintenance of public hospitals out of public money, which is Australian money.

There are cases in which a slip is made, where it is not so much a matter of sufficiency of time, but that somebody has forgotten. I know of instances in which serious results have happened because a clerk has not posted a letter. At present there is no power to extend the time for objection. The object of this amendment is ito give the Commissioner power to extend the period, at his discretion, for a further 30 days. I recommend the suggestion to the committee. It can hardly be abused, and it might lead to a saving in litigation. The Commissioner can be relied upon to use the power wisely. There must be finality sometime. The amendment does not mean that when a man has let six months go by he can come along and ask for a further extension of 30 days. It is imposed with a limit in one case of 72 days, and in another of 60 days, provided extensions were obtained in each case.

AND SEA ROUTES PROTECTION BILL. for Commerce) [3.23] I move That the b ill be now read a second time. This measure has a twofold purpose, first, to prevent the fishing grounds from being fouled by the sinking of obsolete vessels, and, secondly, to protect the sea shores, particularly the bathing beaches, from being polluted by garbage deposited at sea. Within comparatively recent years deep-sea trawl fishing has been established in Australia, principally off the coast of New South Wales.

Of this area, however, only ahout 10,000 square miles has been explored. Complaints have been made by trawling companies and others interested in deepsea fishing of the practice of dismantling a vessel, when it is no longer fit for use, removing the machinery, &c , and sinking the hull a few miles out at sea. Frequently a vessel is sunk right in a fishing ""Manly, Coogee, Bondi, and Crohulla. area, and, as no indication is given of its presence, serious loss and damage is occasioned to the trawlers by their trawl nets catching on the submerged wreck, and breaking or carrying away. Experience has shown that wreckage on the sea bottom lasts for very long periods before finally breaking up. The jurisdiction of a State extends only to the 3-mile limit, that is, to 3 marine miles from low-water mark along the coast. The fishing grounds extend, however, for many miles beyond this, and apparently the only authority having power to proteqt them is the Commonwealth. This Parliament has power to pass legislation in regard to fisheries, prohibiting the deliberate sinkmaking it an offence to discharge garbage ing of vessels in Australian waters, outside territorial limits, which are used for on to a public bathing beach. fishing purposes. power in regard to navigation and shipping, the Commonwealth can pass legislation controlling generally the disgarbage, decayed fruit and vegetables, position, by sinking in waters frequented by oversea or interstate ships, of hulks and other vessel's. It is not considered a practicable proposition to require shiplaws with respect to quarantine are being owners to tow vessels out to. sea beyond the limits of present and potential fishing bathers on our beaches. The bill consegrounds, as some of these extend a distance of over 40 mile3 from the coast. As an alternative, areas have been found in which, on account of the roughness of the sea bottom, trawling operations are impracticable. All requirements for the protection of the trawling industry will be met if ship-owners are prohibited from sinking vessels elsewhere than within prescribed limits in these areas. The bill is designed to give effect to this prohibited areas in which garbage shall proposal. No expense will be incurred in administering this law, the present staff of the marine branch of the Department of Commerce being sufficient for the purpose. The secondary purpose of the bill is to vicinity of our principal ports, from pollution by garbage and other offensive matter thrown overboard by ships or discharged from barges and thrown up on the sands by the action of wind and current. In recent years there have been bitter complaints on this score from the people of Sydney in regard to the garbage that comes ashore at the ocean beaches at Beaches at Melbourne and Adelaide also have been affected. The power of the State parliaments in this regard is very limited. State jurisdiction extends only 3 miles from the shore, and there is consequently no power to make it a punishable offence, under a State act, to discharge garbage outside that limit. It has been found in practice that in some localities rubbish is carried in to the beach from as far as 10 miles out. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Jennings) and others recently made strong representations that the Federal Parliament should support and supplement the action taken by the States, by at sea, even outside the 3-mile limit, in any place from which it will be carried It is Further, under the learned, oir expert advice, that health can be detrimentally affected by bathing in waters containing in suspension floating and other organic substances, whether from ships or cities. Therefore, the powers of the Commonwealth to make invoked to protect the health of the quently provides, in clause 3, that, unless special permission has been obtained from the Director of Quarantine, or from a chief quarantine officer, no garbage, rubbish, ashes, or organic refuse shall be discharged into the sea, within any prohibited area, from any vessel in Australian waters. The penalty for a breach of this provision is £100. Power is taken, in clause 5, to prescribe by regulation the not be discharged. which these areas will extend from any principal beach will be determined by local conditions, including the set of currents and prevailing winds. It is admitted that the effective policing of this provision will be difficult. Cases will doubtless occur in which breaches of the law will be committed, perhaps, under cover of darkness, without detection and punishment. The co-operation of shipowners and masters will, however, be sought to secure observance of the law, and. every effort will be made by the department to make it effective for the purpose intended, namely, the preservation of the health of the bathers on the city beaches around our coast. To this end the earnest co-operation of the general public will also be invoked. congratulate the Government upon having introduced this bill, which is long overdue, and trust that it will have the desired effect of keeping the beaches of our cities free from pollution. The vileness of some of the garbage which at times is washed back on the beaches is beyond description. I also approve of the provision regarding the sinking of obsolete and worn-out ships at sea. One of the worse offenders in this regard has been the Naval Department. I do not know whether this department has always carried out its operations of this nature in approved areas, but I hope that it will be policed in this regard in the future. I should like the Government to take up with the State authorities the question of transferring the control of intra-state shipping to the Commonwealth. If the crews and ships engaged in this business were under the administration of the Commonwealth it would be to the advantage of all concerned. I should also like the Government to see what can be done by negotiation with the State authorities to ensure that all vessels engaged in intraand inter-state trade are installed with wireless equipment. understand that there are certain constitutional difficulties in this regard, but if the the Glebe Council, with which I State Governments would co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in this matter these could, no doubt, be overcome. The John Burke line of steamers and the vessels of the Hunter River Company, as well as certain vessels used The distances to by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company during the sugar season should be equipped with wireless.' I believe that the Hunter River Company successfully resisted in the High Court an effort by the Commonwealth Government to cause their vessels to be equipped with wireless. We have heard the story revived recently that some of the white women who were on the Douglas Mawson when she was wrecked are being kept in imprisonment by the Caledon Bay blacks; but if people who make these statements knew the meteorological condi : tions of that part of Australia they would realize that the storm which that vessel encountered could not have met her if she had been off the west coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria. My point is, however, that if the vessel had been equipped with wireless we should have had a good idea where she was wrecked, and this would definitely have set the minds of many people at rest about the fate of the white women on board her. I shall support the bill because I think that the effort of the Government to prevent the pollution of our beaches by the disposal of garbage at sea is commendable. I hope that something will also be done that will prevent the people who have recently been dumping fruit in Sydney Harbour, in order to keep prices up, from continuing the practice. It would be a good thing if all local governing bodies installed modern incinerators for the destruction of their garbage. This is a hygienic means of coping with garbage which obviates much of the distasteful work that is sometimes associated with the business. I believe that all honourable members will support the bill, Although it is true that the garbage from the Glebe district in which I reside has been punted out to sea, and has in some cases drifted back to the foreshores north and south I of Sydney, I assure honourable members and the public generally that have had some association, has not been responsible for this. As a matter of fact the council some time ago took steps to construct a modern incinerator; but for some time it was prevented from proceeding with the project",42,Second Reading
177,Mr Martens (Herbert) [3.30],I,44,Second Reading
178,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [3.36].,"owing to the obstinacy of Alderman Jackson,' acting in his capacity as Minister for Local Government in New South Wales. As the' Glebe Council had done its best to make other provision for dealing with its garbage, but was hindered from doing what it wished to do, I think it"" only proper to state these facts. Even after the council had reached the< point of selecting a site for its incinerator and preparing plans for the work, it was not allowed to proceed with the enterprise. I do not think that the attitude of Alderman Jackson was approved by many of his colleagues, but probably it would have been rather embarrassing for them openly to express tbeir disapproval. However, that gentleman's obstinacy has now been overcome, and tbe council is proceeding with the construction of the incinerator. I trust that the day is not far distant when all garbage will be destroyed in incinerators. The present Minister for Local Government in New South Wales has now changed his attitude towards the Glebe Council in this respect, but unfortunately he does not seem so well disposed towards certain other local governing bodies in the northern suburbs of Sydney which desire to build incinerators. To the extent that this bill will make ineffective to refuse to take such contracts, and any opposition to the building of incinerators I heartily support it. When the measure is in operation it should have a definitely beneficial effect in cleansing the beaches of Sydney, which are, without question, favourite resorts for hundreds of thousands of people in the summer months. Parents will now be more favourably disposed than they have been towards their children bathing on our beaches. Without doubt, Bondi and Coogee beaches have often been in an unsatisfactory condition through the presence of garbage which has floated in from the sea. The construction, of modern incinerators for the destruction of garbage will also have a good effect, in that it will make the work of those associated with this unattractive calling much less objectionable than in the past. In conclusion, I assure the honourable gentlemen of this House who represent constituencies which include bathing beaches, that, the Glebe Council is very happy to think that it will no longer be necessary for it to punt its garbage out to sea, with the consequent risk of beach pollution. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [3.44] I also commend the Government for having introduced this bill. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for West Sydney say that the Glebe Council is proceeding with the construction of an incinerator to deal with garbage. What the honourable member has said about the punting of Glebe garbage to sea recalls to my mind the procedure adopted by a certain contractor who was responsible for the punting of this garbage to sea. He would regularly tie his punts up in Rose Bay with the object of proceeding to sea early in the morning; but whenever a likelihood of rough weather suggested that a trip outside the heads would be uncomfortable, or considerations of convenience made it desirable, this person had no hesitation in slipping his moorings and dumping the garbage inside the bay. As a result of protests, the practice was stopped, but it shows the length to which contractors will go to relieve themselves of their responsibility for taking refuse outside the harbour in rough weather. Legislation of this kind will probably have the effect of causing people municipalities will be compelled to adopt up-to-date methods for the disposal of garbage. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) referred to the pollution of beaches at Coogee and Bondi. Fortunately, not very much trouble is experienced at Bondi, because there is usually a current flowing quite near the beach which carries refuse out to sea. Only in easterly weather is any refuse deposited on the beach and that is mainly surface refuse. Municipalities^ in many instances, are erecting incinerators to destroy garbage, and it is time that action was taken to compel sewerage boards to adopt up-to-date methods. When sewage is disposed of on sewage farms, instead of being dumped at sea, our coastal waters will be less liable to pollution. It is a crying shame that the beautiful ocean beaches around Sydney, where so many honourable membersgo to bathe during their Christmas vacation, should be polluted by garbage and sewage. This measure will, I hope, help to relieve the situation in regard to garbage, and if the State governprising garbage from passing shipping. I ments would exert pressure .upon the sewerage authorities to treat sewage by modern hygienic methods the nuisance might be completely overcome. with what other honourable members have said regarding the proper disposal of garbage. In regard to the sinking of obsolete vessels, however, I desire to know why it should be necessary for them to be sunk at all. The people living along our large rivers would be very pleased to get possession of old ships such as HMAS. Australia. [3.49] -Any legislation that has for its object the maintenance of the health of the people, and the protection of their recreation, should receive the support of this House. The pollution of beaches in Sydney has become a public scandal. I speak mainly of Sydney's ocean beaches, because I am familiar with the affairs of a municipality which controls 15 miles of coast line. Sydney has a population of 1,300,000 people, the majority of whom indulge in surfing. It might be regarded as the national pastime in summer, and is enjoyed by countless visitors from other States. Owing to the action of certain municipal councils, ocean beaches, from time to time, are fouled with refuse which has been dumped at sea. is dumped near the foreshores where hundreds of thousands of people habitually bathe. supposed to be punted 3 miles out to sea. In some instances, the regulation requires that it be taken out 10 miles, but on occasions it is dumped just outside the heads, and the winds and the tide carry it back among the surfers. I have seen dead animals and filthy clothes, washed up on the beaches, so that surfers have had to leave the water. Probably surfing is the most healthy and economical of recreations, but the health of surfers, and, indeed, of the people of Sydney, is menaced by the practice of dumping gar^ bage at sea. I have before me a letter from an eminent medical practitioner in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, whose practice extends to the Bondi and Coogee areas. He states that cases of illness have occurred which were reasonably attributed to materials-fruit , vegetables, &c -com have, upon occasions, seen material dumped from passing vessels. One vessel dumped overboard a cargo of foodstuffs which was washed up on the beach. A similar condition of affairs has obtained for years on the coasts adjacent to New York, and the Supreme Court of the United States of America has prohibited the practice of dumping garbage at sea. I quote from a paper dealing with the developments relating to the disposal of garbageFor years, most of New York's garbage and a great deal of its ashes and rubbish has been loaded on to scows, towed 10 to 22 miles out to sea, and dumped. A few years ago, hundreds of sealed bottles, each containing a bright-coloured, addressed return postal card, were, dropped into the sea at the regular dumping grounds under different conditions of wind and tide, in an attempt to find out what became of the garbage so deposited. A few bottles apparently floated into the Gulf Stream and crossed the Atlantic to Portugal, France, England and Ireland, but many were stranded on Long Island and Jersey beaches. . . . New Jersey contended that a nuisance prevailed over . many miles of her coast line, that substantial expense was required to remove the. debris from her beaches, and that her property was reduced in value by this practice. An engineer, reporting on this problem, statedThe garbage Much of the floatable mass w ill return and be scattered along the beaches, through the action of currents and winds. . . . It became such a nuisance that the TJnited States At present the garbage is of America Government took the matter out of the hands of the municipalities and have now prohibited the dumping of garbage within 50 miles of the coast. Apart from other considerations, the dumping of refuse at sea has an important bearing upon the fish supply along the coast. The covering up and destruction of great areas of the sea bed by this putrid mass means that the natural feeding grounds of the fish are destroyed, and they move to other places, as has been proved by investigations conducted abroad. Because of the ever-growing popularity of sea bathing, seaside municipalities have erected bathing facilities on the foreshores such as, those at Coogee, Bondi,",44,Second Reading
179,Mr Gander (Reid) [3.48],I agree,46,Second Reading
180,Mr Jennings (South Sydney),"and Manly, in Sydney, at Henley and Glenelg, in Adelaide, and at St. Kilda, in Melbourne. The. value of those assets will be reduced if the beaches are damaged by the deposit of refuse. The disposal of sewage is a matter which concerns the Sewerage Board of Sydney. That authority has decided to introduce a scheme costing £125,000 to divert sewage from the eastern suburbs to the southern point of Long Bay, which will overcome the present difficulty. The menace created by the disposal of garbage and sewage at sea interferes with the peaceful recreation of the people, drives them from the beaches, interferes with the business of shopkeepers, reduces property values, and depreciates the revenue of municipal councils. This has been recognized by many local authorities, arid incinerators for the destruction of garbage have been, or are being, erected. was erected by the Randwick municipality. and manufacture, and a similar one has been erected at Essendon, in Victoria. We have found in Randwick that it is cheaper to dispose of garbage by burning it than by dumping it at sea. It costs 2s. 9d. a ton to burn, whereas the cost of dumping was twice as much. Even after allowing for interest on the cost of constructing the incinerator, it is cheaper to burn the garbage. Therefore, in the interest of the health of the people, and for the other reasons I have stated, I support the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative.

186,Motion (By Mr Lyons) Agreed To,"ter and Treasurer) [7.39] -by leave -Before referring to the discussions recently held between the Government and the tobacco manufacturers, I some of the essential facts. Honourable members are aware of the extraordinary and sudden increase which has taken place in the tobacco-growing industry within the last year or so. The area under crop has increased from 2,133 acres in 1928-29 to approximately 15,000 acres in 1931-32. Production, which was less than 2,000,000 lb. in 1930-31, amounted to between 11,000,000 lb. and 12,000,000 lb. in 1931-32. Because of the high import duty of 5s. 2d. per lb. imposed in November, 1930, many persons, tempted by the profitable returns, decided to grow tobacco. Some of them were quite unfitted for this industry. When the present Government assumed office, it was faced with the problem of finding a market for a crop estimated variously at from 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 lb. Happily for the tobacco-growers, it succeeded. As a result of an arrangement, manufacturers undertook to purchase 7,250,000 lb. of leaf at an average price of 2s. 3d. per lb. This quantity has, in fact, been substantially exceeded. To date, 7,800,000 lb. have been purchased by manufacturers at tha average price mentioned, while almost 500,000 lb. of leaf of lower quality has also been purchased. A promise to purchase another 1,000,000 lb., at an average price of 2s. 3d., has been given by the largest manufacturer, and it can be safely anticipated that the total purchases at this figure will not be less than 9,000,000 lb. At the recent meeting, the situation was frankly discussed with the manufacturers, and, although they have shown their practical sympathy with the growers of Australian leaf, they stated the difficulties The Government considers this of such of the present position with equal frankness. When the Government approached manufacturers early in the year to purchase the Australian crop, it was found, fortunately, that stocks of Australian leaf [117] were low, and that very little leaf had been placed in maturation. This enabled the companies to purchase more than would otherwise have been possible, and to put the leaf aside to mature. Manufacturers state that, in order to meet the difficult marketing problem desire very briefly to narrate occasioned by the phenomenal production of leaf, they have this year very definitely over-bought, and it is almost certain that they will not be able to purchase the same quantities of Australian leaf next year. Although it is the definite policy of the Australian manufacturers to use Australian leaf, there are limits to its use. In the final analysis, the smoker decides the proportion of Australian leaf which shall be used, and the ultimate success of .the tobacco-growing industry rests on the ability of the grower to produce leaf of a quality acceptable to smokers. It was claimed that any agreement must operate unfairly in its incidence upon individual manufacturers, and cause difficultios in buying operations. Another aspect to which manufacturers have drawn attention is that the arrangement made for the purchase of Australian leaf was limited to the 1932 production, and that manufacturers definitely understood that this was only an emergency measure. A fairly representative deputation of growers recently requested that the arrangement should be extended to the next season's crop on an even extended basis as to quantity, but opposition to this proposal has been expressed to the Minister by a deputation of representatives of northern Queensland tobacco growers. It is clear that there is no unanimity among the growers themselves on the subject. The Government is most desirous that tobacco culture should be placed on a firm and economio -basis, and, to this end, the Minister in control of development, Senator McLachlan, recently issued a press statement warning the growers that the ultimate welfare of the industry depended upon tobacco culture being undertaken in areas with suitable climate and soil conditions. importance that it has arranged for the printing and circulation of a guide to growers. This will indicate the basic requirements essential to the successful production of leaf, and also deal with such subjects as cultural practices, treatment of seed beds, curing, &c.",48,Special Adjournment
187,Mr Lyons (Wilmot,"Prime MinisThe reports that are to hand for this season indicate that in Victoria and southern New South Wales blue mould has, unfortunately, destroyed a large percentage of the seed beds, and it is quite probable that the production of leaf next year will be much less than last. It is regrettable that this development should have occurred after such a successf u l growing season had been experienced. In all these circumstances the obtaining of a satisfactory arrangement for a definite agreement to purchase.leaf next season appears to be a most difficult proposition. the future is uncertain, and the manufacturers are opposed to the idea. Government stepped in last year to tide over a distinct period of transition, when not only had the import duty been reduced, but a phenomenal crop was in sight. It is not, however, the normal function of the Government to sell the tobacco crop. The matter cannot yet be considered quite settled. siderations, the manufacturers point out that it is at present impossible to forecast the extent of the crop, or to consider what quality of tobacco will be available. They state, therefore, that it is superfluous months, the people of Australia may to discuss such matters at present, but, while strongly adhering to the view that the fixing of quotas and prices is against the best interests of the tobacco-growers, as well as being impracticable as between the interests of the different manufacturers, they have consented to discuss the -matter further about February or March next, when it should be possible to form definite opinions regarding the coming crop. In all the circumstances the Government has decided to defer further consideration of the matter until about the end of February next. i ter and Treasurer) [7.42] I moveTliat tlie House do now adjourn. This is the last occasion on which the House will meet during the present year, and, therefore, on behalf of the Government, I wish all honourable members a most happy Christmas season, and a prosperous and happy New Year. The session has been a strenuous one. Much important work has had to be done, and honourable members have been compelled to apply Ithemselves closely to the consideration of the legislative problems that were set them. There have been differences of opinion, and at times the conflict in debate has been keen; yet throughout, good personal feeling has persisted. It is, I think, typical of the parliaments of Australia, that, despite political differences, their members become good friends again immediately they leave the chamber. That is as it should be, for were we to The industry is divided, carry our political prejudices into our private conversation, life would not be The worth the living. Each of us fights zealously in the interests of those whom he represents, and for what he believes to be best for his country, because, before all, we are Australians. I thank honourable members generally for the assistance and consideration which they have extended to the Government during the past arduous months. Apart from other conI t is gratifying to the Government that a substantial and satisfactory programme of legislation has 'been accomplished. It is, I am sure, the sincere hope of all of us that, during the coming twelve know happier times than have been their lot during recent years. I trust that in the coming year we shall see a change for the better throughout the whole world; and that not only Australia, but every other country, may experience a happy and prosperous year. To you, Mr Speaker, and the Chairman of Committees, I express thanks for the help you have given us, and the able manner 'in which you have discharged your duties. We are grateful for the forbearance and consideration that you have at all times extended to us.

They do much to educate our people on the matters discussed within the walls of this chamber.

I join him in expressing our thanks to you, M i . Speaker, and to the Chairman of Committees, for the patience you have shown to us. Although, from time to time, incidents may occur that we wish f :>rgo1ten, I have the greatest personal rtipept and regard for you both,' and compete faith in your impartiality and fairness. I thank the Clerks of the House for their unvarying helpfulness. To the Hansard staff Ave are always indebted. They are cn.""able and efficient reporters. It is seld.vn that we catch them with a Avord <viih which they are unfamiliar. I have appreciated, too, the efficiency and courtesy of the officers of the Library, presses its appreciation of the way in and I am grateful to the attendants of the House for their services to us. Like the Prime Minister, I take pleasure in acknowledging the help that we receive from the officers of the various whose duty often compels them to sit for long and weary hours in this chamber. They are always courteous and helpful, not only to the Ministers on whom they attend, but also to private members. The Parliamentary Draughtsman and the other officers of the Attorney-General's Department give us invaluable help in putting our ideas into parliamentary language. I add my appreciation of the work of the representatives of the press in the parliamentary galleries. 1 do not express approval of everything that is published in the newspapers. Like the curate's egg, the matter that is published in the press is good in parts. But the representatives of the newspapers do their duty to the organizations they represent, and are always agreeable to meet. Sessions come and go, and Parliament will continue to meet in Canberra amid the pleasant surroundings and the growing beauty of this lovely city until long after all of us now here have passed away. YetI hope that Avhen new faces fill this chamber we who have gone may be remembered for some little bit of good that we have tried to accomplish. We differ widely as to the means to be adopted; but we all strive for the one end-the welfare of our people, and the betterment of our country. I reciprocate the Christmas wishes of the Prime Minister, and trust that when the New Year dawns, brigher days may come for the many thousands of those Avho are to-day in poverty and want. I wish every member of the Parliament a very happy Christmas. On behalf of the Country party, I join in the felicitations that have been expressed to all those associated Avith the Parliament on the occasion of our dispersal before.Christmas. This time last, year, we were setting out upon an election campaign, and Ave have before us now the prospect of considerably more enjoyment in the immediate future. The Country party, Mr Speaker, exwhich you and the Chairman of Committees have performed your important duties. We thank you for your absolute impartiality, which Ave recognize, even though on occasions one may rise administrative departments, for the tenth time before catching your eye. When, in the discharge of your duties, you may have to suspend a member from the ser\'ice of this House, you, Mr Speaker, do it Avith such an air of benevolence that I am sure the gentleman dismissed almost feels that a favour has been conferred upon him. I join with the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) in expressing appreciation",50,Adjournment Valediotobt

190,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [7.55],"of the work of all those who are associated with the House-the Clerks, the members of the Hansard staff, the officers of the Library, the attendants, and, indeed, all who help us with the work of this Parliament. Probably we do not sufficiently appreciate the extent to which we are indebted to the gentlemen of the Hansard staff. During an all-night sitting, while we who occupy these -benches can sit back for a few moments, at times, in a more or less restful attitude, the reporters must keep their quills working incessantly, and should we happen to receive some word of appreciation from admirers who may read our polished sentences, we should hardly like to inform them of the extent to which we are indebted to the gentlemen who report our remarks for the perfect English in which they are recorded. I hope that, in the new year, Australia may begin to rise out of the depression in which she has been labouring for the past two years. I am sorry to interrupt the expression of seasonal sentiment-and I echo all that has been said in that connexionbut I must seize this, the only opportunity that has presented itself, to ask the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) to give serious consideration to the setting up of a committee of a non-party character, representative of both Houses of the Parliament, which will keep under continuous review the operation of the Ottawa trade agreement between Great Britain and the overseas dominions. The Parliament of India has concluded a treaty for the term of three years, and, during that time, the operation of its provisions will be kept under review by a committee appointed for that purpose. In making the suggestion that we shall do likewise, I am not influenced by party considerations; but I think that it is wise, in view of the importance of the matter, that this step should be taken. I hope that the Prime Minister and the Government will, during the recess, give serious consideration to my request. suggestion of the honourable member under the notice of Cabinet during the recess. [8.2] -Before putting the question to the House, I desire to acknowledge, on behalf given to the honourable member in reply to his of the Chairman of Committees ( Mr Bell) and myself, the generous sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), and the Deputy son), in our regard. We greatly appreciate what has been said of us, and thank honourable members for their good wishes. The complimentary references to the officers of the House are thoroughly deserved. Personally, I am under a great obligation to the Clerk of the House and his assistants at the table for the help I have received from them during my term of office. The Parliament should be proud of its Hansard staff, and of its Librarian and his officers. We are under a debt of gratitude to the other officials in the various branches of the parliamentary service. The Parliament is fortunate in having as heads of its departments gentlemen of ripe experi ence, loyalty, and unfailing courtesy. I hope that the recess may be a ip[.>y h; one for every honourable member, and that each will return refreshed, and prepared to carry on their important duties in a manner worthy of the National Parliament. Question resolved in the affirmative. The House adjourned at 8.5 p.m. until a date and hour to be fixed by Mr Speaker. The following answers to questions were circulated:upon notice1. Is he satisfied that the full amount of interest reduction received by the States upon loans for soldier settlement and repatriation purposes has been passed on to the soldiers? 2. What is the percentage which is charged by the States for administration in the case of each class of advance, and is this in accordance with the conditions made by the Commonwealth when the interest charged to the States was reduced? 3. In the event of overseas loans which were raised for these purposes by the Commonwealth on behalf of the States being converted at a lower rate of interest, will the benefit passed on to the settlers and others to whom the money was advanced? honourable member's questions are as 1 and 2.

At that conference it was stated that the administration costs of the States were approximately 10s. per cent. 3. All advances made by the Commonwealth to the States for soldier settlement purposes were made from loans raised in Australia. D r .

On the 29th November, the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) asked the following question, luiihout notice:Is the Prime Minister aware that the forms which invalid anil old-age pensioners are required to fill in, are issued without an envelope and returned to the post office unenclosed, uiiil there assembled in bundles to be sent to the head office of the Pensions Branch? W ill the right honourable gentleman issue instructions that an envelope be issued to the pensioner, as is done to an applicant for a pension, so that personal and confidential information may not be disclosed to unauthorized persons? The honourable member is presumably referring to the Forms 41 which pensioners are required to furnish in connection with the recent amendment of the act. through the postmasters who pay pensions. The pensioner is required to complete the form and return it to the postmaster for transmission to the Deputy Commissioner. This procedure was decided upon as the most expeditious and economical "" method of obtaining the forms, and has been the practice for some time in connection with an annual review. To supply envelopes to all pensioners would have cost approximately £200. Moreover, many of the pensioners would have returned tlie forms through the post, thus involving themselves in the cost of postage. It is not considered that the present method involves any disclosure of confidential information. The forms are handled only by departmental officers, who, in many cases, have already assisted the pensioners to complete the forms and have witnessed their declarations. In the circumstances above outlined, it is not proposed that any alteration be made. Mr E. J.

As a result of such investigation the Minister approved that an entry in Captain Conway's records, dated the 9th November, 1917, and subsequent references thereto, relative to his not proceeding on active service abroad, should be expunged.

(5) Mutton and lamb, 132,381 carcases, valued at approximately £08,335. This reduction will, however, be offset by the increase in price which may be expected for the products mentioned since the restriction of exports was announced. Mutton and lamb have increased in price from Jd. to Id. per lb., and butter by 5s. per cwt. Owing to the increase in tlic price for mutton and lamb, the Victorian meat-works are now as busy as they have ever been, with the result that a considerable increase has occurred in the demand for labour. 2.
