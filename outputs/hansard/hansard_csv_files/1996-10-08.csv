We do have very extensive people to people contacts with France. While I was in Paris, I took the opportunity of raising with the French government the establishment of visa-free travel for Australians in France. I know the requirement to obtain a visa to visit France is a significant irritant for Australians who want to go to that country, be it for business or pleasure, and many of course do.

Its whole approach is based on towards meeting increased child-care costs. the premise of give with one hand and take The operational subsidy for community based back with the other.

It material presented earlier by the member for is also the argument that conveniently forgets Dunkley( Mr Billson) does not show, is what that community based long day care provides is being taken on the other hand: what famiservices such as more places for babies and lies are being given with tax breaks on the children with special needs, and extended one hand are being taken away in a whole opening hours, just to name a few of the range of other areas. things it does. We had a bit of description about the higher It is the case that some private sector prescription costs-$20 per script. There are services do provide these services but, on the whole, the community based services provide Community centres are, of course, more more in these areas because of the operational likely to be found in rural and remote areas subsidy. This operational subsidy equates to as well as in low income areas. As part of the $14 a week for a child over three and $21 a smoke and mirrors trick, this government is week for a child under three. Fees for commaking much of the $8.3 million that they are munity based long day care are likely to go providing to help community based centres up by this amount. The alternative to raising manage the loss of operational subsidies. But, fees is cutting services.

Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4943 Tuesday, 8 October 1996 Sitting suspended from 4.32 to 4.40 p.m. for 30 seconds, I believe that lowe it to the Main Committee to extend an apology, not because I deliberately or even unwittingly arrived late but in fact because, as you are aware, we were all at the same meeting. I stand simply so that there is no reflection on the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth)-who, as I left the meeting following you, said she was supposed to be in the Main Committee. I said, 'Don't worry, Trish, I will be there to cover for you,' not realising that she had a 4.30 p.m. responsibility. I arrived, imagining I was to follow the honourable member for Denison( Mr Kerr). I have, in fact, unwittingly caused this delay in the Main Committee, and the delay should not reflect unfairly on Ms Worth. I would say to the Main Committee that I did wait for two minutes which I should not have done, to extend the period of grace, but then I had to come in. A quorum not being present, I had then to adjourn. I might say that I adjourned to 4.40 p.m. to ensure that there was adequate time for a quorum to be present because, if I had reoccupied the chair and a quorum had not been present, I would have been forced, according to standing orders, to adjourn the sitting of the committee until tomorrow. Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 September, on motion by Mr Costello: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that: (1) the Budget betrays the Australian promise of working towards a more fair, just, inclusive and united society; (2) the Budget is both mindless and heartless, and its prescriptions are not what the Australian economy needs at present; (3) the Budget will have a savagely contractionary impact on economic growth and make impossible the job creation necessary to reduce Australia's still unacceptably high level of unemployment; (4) with stronger economic growth the Budget could be restored to underlying balance over the life of this Parliament through a much more moderate program of fiscal consolidation; (5) the spending cuts and tax increases contained in the Budget are, on the evidence of the Government's own Budget Papers, not necessary to reduce the Commonwealth Government's debtto-GDP ratio and will not produce a significant improvement in the current account deficit; (6) the Budget not only offers no hope to the unemployed but actively harms their prospects of finding a job by cutting labour market programs and privatising the previously publicly provided employment service function of the CES;",96,Adjournment Funds

' the Opposition ( Mr Gareth Evans), there are a number of references to the impact that the budget measures would have on those who make Australia their country of settlement. The main burden of this budget is, of course, on cost recovery from that sector, but the damage goes deeper because it is compounded with changes to settlement policies which run quite counter to the national interest and also to the interests of those who have made Australia their home. IfI begin with the direct budget measures, I suppose an overall summary of the budget would be to say that it takes something over $1 billion from the area of immigration and immigration support, whilst it boasts of spending some $64 million over four years: a net reduction of expenditure in this area of something of the order of $950 million. There are boastful announcements in the budget of trifling additional expenditure, but they are overwhelmed with new charges. The government says it will spend an additional $17 million on English language programs over four years, but it is going to slug users of those services over twice that amount during the same period. That is a tax on the coalition's commitment, which they proudly boasted before the election would ensure that all migrants would have the opportunity to gain effective communication. The rise proposed to each individual from $2,205 to $5,500 is in fact a deterrent to new settlers learning what the coalition called, before the election, a common language which is the glue of a cohesive nation. The government is planning to raise an additional $16.5 million in migrant health service charges whilst cutting back access. The family reunion program, which the government promised to reject, is cut; yet the costs for visa and other filing applications will yield over $37 million in 1996-97. The cost of visitor visas is up 200 per cent, the fee for application for change of status to permanent resident is up 120 per cent, and even the fee to become an Australian citizen has increased. Spending on multiculturalism, which was formerly the responsibility of the now defunct Office of Multicultural Affairs which was formerly in the Prime Minister's Department, is more than halved. The commitment to work with the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia-FECCA-is at least in doubt. With respect to FECCA, the policy of the government would appear, certainly to most observers, to be no more than that of intimidation. The budget for FECCA has not been resolved. On two occasions now the organisation has been told that decisions relating to its funding are being postponed pending further consideration and further reviews, and the organisation still has had no advice as to whether or not it will have its funding at the end of this year. The minister, in fact, has",100,Representatives Main Committee
340,Mr Kerr (Denison) (4.43 P.m.),"In the amendment proposed by the Deputy Leader of4946 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 announced a review which only commences its work in December and the budget for the organisation runs out at about the same time. The government, at a time when the subject of immigration and the implications for Australia of choices being made by this government are at the forefront of every newspaper, every editorial, every columnist, is holding an axe of funding over the principal body that speaks for ethnic Australians. It is not resolving that and I regard that as a complete travesty and a failure of this government to act in a way which is honourable. Mr Ruddock, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, boasted of adding multiculturalism to his portfolio. In his charter of responsibility on multiculturalism, he has said nothing on this across all portfolios, a practice observed by previous governments. There is nothing in the budget that refers to the way in which the interests and concerns of people from different cultural backgrounds are going to be recognised and respected in the different works of the various agencies. To me, the failure to produce such a document is a stinging indictment of this government's claim to speak for all Australians. With regard to the $10 million promised before the election with respect to racial vilification education, only $5 million is committed, with the rest to follow a 'review'. But nothing appears in the forward estimates, which means, of course, that the government is set to break yet another election promise. With respect to a racial vilification campaign, spending $5 million on that is akin to spitting against a hurricane when the Prime Minister has sat mute for so long while the whirlwinds of racial intolerance are fanned. His conspicuous silence remained to such a degree that people of goodwill, even on his own side of politics, felt the need to speak out, and to speak out in terms that can only be regarded as those of the greatest of alarm. In short, Mr Ruddock is boasting about spending $64 million while, by gutting, slashing and ramping up charges-and add the recoveries intended to be made, particularly by the extension of the waiting period for two years and a number of other measures announced by the government and implemented in this budget-he will grab something over a billion dollars. The government proposes that new settlers not have access to a whole range of education, labour market and social security support. They have made, in recognition of the damage that this will cause, a token additional contribution to emergency relief organisations-private charitable organisations-to pick up the broken pieces that their policy recognises will follow from that heartless approach. It is not only heartless, it is irresponsible. It is irresponsible because, if one looks at the time when people make a success of coming to this country, forming a new future, building the roots that enable them to go on and make their family's and their own success in this country, the first two years are the critical periods. If there are savings to be made, project them forward. But the first couple of years when people first arrive are inevitably going to be periods when people are most at risk of finding themselves in difficulties. If Australia is unable to provide for them the kinds of opportunities necessary to make effective settlement, to help them find educational skills if their skills do not prove to be adequate, to help them into labour market programs if their hopes are not met by employment--or help them find some emergency relief if their circumstances do not prove as they hope-then we are building up problems for the future. We are building up a large store of problems for future generations by what is a short-sighted and penny-pinching approach. Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMfITEE 4947 The real cost to Australians is the serious long-term problems this will leave us as our inheritance. To severely restrict access to essential needs for successful settlement in health, education and the opportunity to enter the labour market and be a productive member of society will carry a price we wish we did not have to pay. This is retrograde, myopic and simply bad policy. It makes short-term gains at the expense of migrants but risks big problems and high social costs for the future of all Australians. Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the areas, of course, where the impact is most to be felt is in the area of English language. Successive governments have expanded services available to new arrivals to this country to make sure that people do acquire effective English language skills so that they can make effective settlement. In its pledge before the last election, the coalition criticised the failure of the former government to expand those services adequately and indicated it was pledged to additional funding and to make certain that those services were more readily available to, as they put it at that time, ensure that the glue that makes for our social cohesiveness holds. But what do we find in the area of English language programs? What we do find is that in its first budget, the Howard government has announced a 250 per cent increase for access to English language classes under the adult migrant education program. But the fee will rise from $2,205 to $5,500 at 1 January 1997, with an interim rise to $4,405 at 1 October of this year. That has simply put the program out of reach for many migrants. The minister, Philip Ruddock, fools no-one with his announcement of additional funding of $17.6 million over four years. That was a pledged amount the minister claims that was delivered on in this budget. By the time the first instalment of that money is paid in 1 July 1997 the Howard government will have collected $11.6 million in user charges from the same program, up from $2.8 million in 1995-96. What you see just in that short period of time, before any money is paid out, is that a collection of $11 V2 million will be made and then the additional fees that are being charged will more than double, on a recurrent basis, the new expenditure. The language in the media release by the minister gives rise for concern about the future of the program. He speaks of consultations with migrants, service providers, state and territory governments and the wider community. It seems that this is setting up a preamble for what are now ambiguously called reviews, which are intended to bring to an end programs which the government feels less than comfortable with. Apart from migrants from English speaking backgrounds, many skilled migrants with much to offer our economy will be severely disadvantaged. Again, it is not the individual disadvantage to the particular new arrival that we ought to be most concerned about, notwithstanding that we should all, I think, have a compassionate response to people who have made such a wrenching decision to come from another place and to make their new home in this country as a permanent member of our community. I suspect there is none more traumatic, none more complex than the decision to actually leave the land of one's birth and to move to a new country to intend to become a permanent resident of that country and to face so many great changes that inevitably confront you. Take all those concerns into hand as the individuals battle to make a success of it-as everyone inevitably does when they make that choice-as they arrive from overseas; put to one side any compassion for people who themselves will be disadvantaged by the government decisions that will leave them without adequate social security support if, by some 4948 MAIN COMMITIEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 misadventure, their hopes prove unfounded. Put to one side any concern about the people who find themselves with a need to improve their training to enter the job market. Put to one side the difficulties people find in playing an effective part in their own communities where they have made their home if they do not have adequate English language skills. But think of the larger long-term cost to this community. Think of those long-term costs. Penny-pinching in this area is intensely counterproductive. The measures that are intended by this government to set up brick walls to those who come here to enter the work force, making access to English language programs more difficult, will lead to consigning many to despair and long-term dependence on social welfare. The simplistic justification of full cost recovery ignores the real benefits that such programs produce. The adult migrant education program has a solid track record of success and would be directly responsible for ensuring many new settlers' successful entry to the work force. And, again, the real cost of this bad policy will be manifest in future years. It is certainly possible, and ought to be possible, to contemplate a different outcome from this, especially if considered with many other measures proposed by the Howard government. We ought not to use mechanisms of this nature to seek to deter people coming to Australia. The Prime Minister today said that the government remained committed to non-discriminatory immigration policies. It hardly makes sense in that environment to create barriers of this nature which plainly will disadvantage people who lack fluent English language skills to make successful settlement. It consigns those now in this country and those to come to great difficulty in making that successful transition. I might also, in the little time that is left to me, reflect on the nature of the changes to the program itself. The government has recently introduced regulations which propose profound and unprecedented changes to the way in which Australia will proceed in the selection of those who come to this country. There is relatively little difference between the two parties in terms of the size of the intake. Pandering, I believe, to a sentiment that exists in the community, the Prime Minister has couched his description of that intake as a slash in the migration program, and the Deputy Prime Minister said that the government had taken steps because the program had been out of control. The truth is that the program of the current government is about average for the previous term of the Keating government which, in its own term, was the lowest post-war migration period in Australia's history. So we have no significant argument about numbers between us, but we do have very significant arguments about the way in which the program is being manipulated. Some people, I think, are already making suggestions to accommodate outcomes which are intended to make it less possible for people from some parts of the globe to come to this country; outcomes which have been designed and manipulated in that deliberate manner. Others are more charitably saying that it simply has that accidental effect. But whatever the account of that is-and that debate will happen in the discussion about the regulations and in wider forums than this-I think that I should focus on one particular savage decision of the government, and that is with respect to spouses. With no evidence other than the lead-out of anecdotal stories of abuse of the spouse arrangements, the government has proposed that from henceforth, the right of Australians to marry people of their own choice will be abridged. It has never happened before. In Senate Estimates, it was made clear by officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that there is no evidence of widespread abuse of the spouse visa system. Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4949 And to the extent that sporadic and occasional abuse occurs, I have assured the government that we stand ready with them to act against it. But there is no case whatsoever in a free country such as ours to say to any Australian citizen, or to permanent residents, that the right that they have to meet, marry and choose their partner for their future ought to be abridged. What the government is proposing to do is to cap spouse visas. That is to say that, at a particular time, no more Australians will be permitted the privilege of bringing their marriage partner to this country. I regard that as outrageous. And the greatest condemnation of that actually comes not from me, but in the words of the now Minister for Immigration ( Mr Ruddock). When legislation which first allowed capping of any visa categories came before the parliament, what he said, with respect to a specific decision to make it plain that that capping could not apply to spouses, was: The Minister has agreed to two specific amendments. One was to exclude the immediate family category-that is, spouses, dependent children and aged parents. I regard it as absolutely unconscionable for a government to say half way through a year, 'We have enough spouses in now, we are going to close off the category and no more people in that category can come to Australia-no more husbands and wives, no more dependent children, or aged parents'. I am glad that the Minister has made the decision to exclude those groups. We have saved the Government great agony had it persisted in that area. Of course, it was never the government's intention whatsoever to persist in that area. The amendments were moved to make absolutely clear th<1t no party in this parliament would tolerate that abuse. And now the government in which Mr Ruddock is a minister comes before us to do what he has condemned as unconscionable. It is a disgrace. in this appropriation debate I cannot open my remarks on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) without reflecting, at least briefly, on some of the remarks made by the member for Denison( Mr Kerr), the shadow minister for immigration. He has used all of his legal skills to very carefully avoid doing anything that would suggest that he was branding members of the government as having racist views. But while he has used all his legal skills to avoid that statement he has nonetheless skirted around the question of immigration and implied that, from time to time, racist attitudes have determined what the government's priorities will be. I have to flatly deny and refute any such allegation. Anyone from the opposition or the government who knows Mr Kerr interjectingpoint now that he has introduced it into the debate. But no-one from the opposition or the government, knowing the Prime Minister or the Minister for Immigration, could suggest for a moment that there is any racial discrimination in any of the attitudes that they have indicated, either before or after these budgetary measures. The member for Denison provokes me by going on to suggest that in 1988 the Prime Minister, who was not then in that office, had made remarks that the member for Denison alleges were racist. I would equally, and as flatly, refute any such allegation.

Mr Kerr interjectingnumbers-which has bipartisan support, which has been recognised by the opposition as being a responsible view to take of our present immigration policy-will in some way have racist overtones and lead to an emphasis on migration from one area of the globe rather than another. Let me equally refute that sort of allegation. All that the government has done in relation to immigration in these budget papers is to pick up what has been the call from the former government, in a bipartisan sense, to reduce the number of migrants freely coming into Australia-not to reduce a particular category. If that were the proposal I would be indignant in my opposition. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know, I know and I believe every responsible member knows, that all the government seeks to do is to offer a fair and internationally defensible immigration policy. For that reason I also take issue with the member for Denison. In his opening remarks he has suggested that the two-year waiting period proposed for migrants who come into Australia, which will make it more difficult for them to access Commonwealth benefits, is in some way an unfair measure-as if the government were proposing to take new migrants who come into Australia and deny them access to all benefits without forewarning. The simple reality is that every migrant coming into Australia beyond this budgetary period knows that they will come in to a two-year waiting period. All that the government has said is that the responsibility that every new Australian will face is the responsibility of making provision for their settlement in Australia for a period of two years. It would be very difficult in my electorate, and I suspect in any other electorates across the nation, including the electorate of the member for Denison, to find electors who are offended by that. I have a large migrant community in my electorate; an electorate which is made up of a number of horticultural crops which are labour intensive and which for that reason have attracted people with a relatively low capital base and a willingness to work. Within my migrant community there is overwhelming support for the proposal that people should wait two years before being able to access these sorts of Commonwealth benefits. Given that my migrant community supports it, you can be sure that most people across the nation feel this is a responsible step and most certainly do not see it as having any of the racial overtones implied by the member for Denison. There has been some debate about these appropriation bills being referred to the Main Committee. I want in my opening remarks to say that, given the time that has been spent on these bills in the chamber, the action of the government is entirely appropriate. The appropriation bills are very much about dealing with the economic success that Australia will have and the economic success that the government can generate for the nation over the ensuing 12 months and, indeed, over a longer time frame. The issue that, in fact, has been behind all that motivated the 1996-97 budget is the question simply of debt. No matter what the former government may say, the reality is that they left the books in a deplorable state and the incoming government has no choice but to introduce a budget that has some unpopular measures in order to address the problem of debt.",106,Representatives Main Committee
346,Mr Andrew,"The member for Denison has further suggested that the reduction inTuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4951 Let me pick up a quote from the independent review of the budget done by the National Farmers Federation. They said this: There has been a significant deterioration in the state of Australia's fiscal position over the past seven years. Measured in underlying tenns the Budget moved from a small surplus in 1988-89 to a peak: deficit of $17.1 billion in 1993-94. Urgent refonn was needed to repair this situation. The 1996-97 Budget represents a sensible and well balanced commitment to the Government's objective of achieving a balance in the underlying Budget over the course of the economic cycle. It is likely to boost business confidence, support lower interest rates, and provide the foundation for ongoing low inflationary growth. I do not want to take all my debating time simply quoting from the National Farmers Federation, but the document went on to say: The Budget strategy clearly identifies one of the major structural impediments to sustainable economic growth-a high structural current account deficit, as a result of a deficiency in national saving. There can be no doubt that the deterioration in public finances has been partly responsible for this development. In this context, it is simply not acceptable, after four years of solid economic growth, that Australia should have been running an underlying deficit of over $10 billion. This is not the view of the government's Treasurer, it is the view of the National Farmers Federation, which on behalf of the primary producers of Australia was reviewing the budget statement that makes up these appropriation bills. The simple reality is that as independent a source as the retiring Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bernie Fraser, has said that there is no more urgent need facing this nation than addressing the underlying debt and removing, so far as possible, the $10 billion deficit. Around this appropriation debate there has been a great deal said about the partial sale of Telstra. Much of this will be addressed later in this chamber and, of course, in the House of Representatives chamber as well. But the simple reality that seems to escape all economic commentators is that the government's enthusiasm for the partial sale of Telstra is entirely motivated not by a proposal to find $1 billion or $1.2 billion to spend on the environment but by a desire to find $7 billion to address our overseas debt and to reduce the overseas debt by something like 10 per cent. What the now opposition cannot escape is that when they came to office overseas borrowings in Australia ran at something like $23 billion, and when they left office overseas borrowings in Australia ran at something like $185 billion. I am the first to concede-and I would not want the member for Fowler( Mr Ted Grace) to feel that he has been misrepresented-that of that $125 billion, much of it is made up of private borrowings. But the reality is that, of that $185 billion, probably somewhere between $70 billion and $85 billion is made up of government borrowings. And in order to trim those government borrowings by 10 per cent and so make the economic objectives of the government more achievable, we need the partial sale of Telstra. That is the motivation that has been lost in the nonsense that has been run about using the Telstra moneys for the environment when, in reality, as a member of the government, I want that partial sale to reduce my overseas outlays and so give me an opportunity to realistically reduce interest rates within Australia. What does this budget do? We need to recognise that one of the things that the budget does is to effectively reduce the proportion of GDP that is going to the government. Allow me to quote one paragraph from the Parliamentary Research Service. On reflecting on the budget, the research service under 'Outlays' said: Total outlays for 1996-97 are estimated to be $129 billion or 25.2 per cent of GDP, compared with $126 billion in 1995-96, or 26.1 per cent of GDP. What the government can claim to have achieved while 4952 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 addressing the debt, is to have taken less of the GDP resources and addressed them to government services. That is no mean feat. In addition to that, the government has done something about what foreign ownership is effectively undoing in Australia. In 1989, when the previous government was in power, there was something like $53 billion poured into Australia to acquire Australian assets. In 1996, when the previous government was no longer in power, $190 billion had been poured into Australia acquiring Australian assets for foreign ownership. Some of that was the result of policies of the former government. The government, for example, sold such facilities as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and so, effectively, injected one way or another additional foreign ownership into Australia. Critics will say, 'But surely the proposal of the now government to partially sell Telstra will also inject additional foreign currency into Australia.' There is some truth in that, but the previous government sold those resources without-as my statistics illustrate-reducing the debt. The Howard government commits itself to using the resources of the partial sale of Telstra solely for the reduction of debt. That is a significant difference. We are doing something about pruning our outlays and unless we prune those outlays-the point made by the National Farmers Federation, and reinforced by Mr Bernie Fraser-we will bequeath to our children an impossible economic situation. I am one of those who have a vested interest in the partial sale of Telstra because I happen to represent the electorate in South Australia most served by the Murray-Darling Basin. It could be said that I am ignoring some of the opportunities that the environment package would offer for the Murray-Darling Basin by putting the emphasis on paying off the debt, but the facts are that this budgetary package targets more money for the Murray-Darling Basin, quite apart from the money that will be generated as a result of the partial sale of Telstra. An additional $4.5 million goes into the Murray-Darling Basin, money that is essentially needed for the Hume Dam, as was highlighted in question time today by the question on the future of the Hume Dam from the member for Indi( Mr Liebennan), who pointed out that there has been a movement in the dam wall that will require further engineering modification. That will cost more money. That puts some of his irrigators at risk as the total capacity of the Hume Dam is run down. While it does not put my South Australian irrigators at risk, it does mean that the flooding that currently exists in the River Murray will extend over a prolonged period. But there are additional difficulties. The additional difficulties are simply that we will then have a Hume Dam with a lesser catchment than may be responsible, going into next winter and next summer; a Hume Dam that needs to be filled, if the irrigators represented by the member for Indi are to be assured of their irrigation supply in a year that may not have the same level of rainfall as we have experienced this winter. I have focused on those remarks because there is a complication that is a largely related one also occurring for South Australian irrigators. Not many people in this chamber will be aware of the fact that, for South Australian irrigators, Lake Victoria-which provides the sort of effective safety valve on water availability for South Australia-has also been run down, because wave action has unearthed Aboriginal burial grounds along the edge of the lake. The running down of Lake Victoria-which was done responsibly, to allow for the recovering of those Aboriginal burial grounds with coarser soil at a cost of $1 million, which was provided in the budget-has had, as with the Hume Dam, a long-tenn adverse affect. Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4953 While Lake Victoria has been run down, 67 years of having Lake Victoria at a particular storage level has meant that water has penetrated the sandhills around the lake, probably for some kilometres. That water is now running back in, so that what is collecting in Lake Victoria is water that is much more saline than any irrigator.or any domestic user can tolerate. The government-or, more accurately, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission-finds itself in a delicate balancing act to meet the reasonable demands of the Aboriginal community to have these burial grounds preserved and, at the same time, to ensure that South Australian irrigators do not have a head of saline water awaiting them. I make those comments because, under this budget, money is provided to the basin. As the Hume Dam is run down, the storage of Lake Victoria-not only for South Australian irrigators but also for New South Wales irrigators-next year may also be at risk, unless the Hume works can be accelerated and there is adequate rainfall to fill that dam. and of course, ultimately, Adelaide's water supply. That is important because, as you will all appreciate, the South Australian irrigators are guaranteed a water allocation which comes from Dartmouth, Hume or Lake Victoria as the case may be; so that, while South Australia may be guaranteed that allocation, any shortage of available water in New South Wales and Victoria further exacerbates the problem of the guarantee that New South Wales and Victorian irrigators have. I make these comments to point out the importance of the budget to addressing the whole question of national debt and the fact that the budget has not ignored those principal environmental issues that need to be addressed in the national interest. There are a number of other comments I wanted to make, particularly about the supermarket to Asia strategy to encourage the sale of horticultural products in that booming market, and the $28 million to extend the Adelaide airport runway and ensure there is greater access to Asian markets, particularly for my growers and irrigators. I also wanted to comment on the enthusiasm the government has shown for the reform of AQIS and for Australia's quarantine measures to ensure that, within Asia, we have a guarantee that whatever vegetable, horticultural, meat and livestock products are provided come with a blue-ribbon guarantee and, equally, that we are secure in the knowledge that any products imported into Australia will not bring with them the pests and diseases that would put at risk our reputation as a clean and green producer. I will not go into the other areas because time will not permit. I am partially responsible for that shortage of time, so may I just say how much I welcome the opportunity to support the government's appropriation measures. the extent to which post-election revelations were accurate about the condition of the Commonwealth deficit for last financial year; that is, 1995-96. Forward costings that were then released demonstrated that the previously concealed effects of expenditure into future years inevitably meant that Labor's legacy would see even more copious bleeding of budgetary red ink unless severe measures to staunch the flow were taken immediately. While the coalition undoubtedly knew before and during the last election campaign that Labor was fudging by concealing the true position, the previous government has given its new successor the near perfect cop-out in the eyes of the public.

It is hard enough to do the job of an elected representative, without being tagged by mere association as an inveterate liar. It is uncontested conventional wisdom that the tax grab on superannuation funds was pounced on at the last moment, given the government's change of heart about the fuel tax rebate. One can only wonder whether the parliament's virtually unanimous support for an increase in the Medicare tax to buy firearms from the public encouraged the government to go one per cent further, albeit selectively. Why this government continues the charade that encourages the widespread belief that the Medicare so-called levy meets the cost of funding Medicare is beyond comprehension. Because it is a tax on income the levy should be integrated into the more progressive income tax regime. It would also be one way of simplifying the tax system.",111,Representatives Main Committee
351,Mr Rocher,"Last financial year, revenue from all sources, before asset sales, totalled4956 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 Both tax hikes in the budget expand the opportunity for future windfalls to revenue by way of bracket creep. It must be a source of despair for government in times of low inflation that the previous bounty from bracket creep is diminished. Perhaps the government realises that, by creating unindexed income brackets where none previously existed, as in the cases of new imposts on contributions to superannuation and Medicare, new growth taxes are there for the taking. But where does it stop? The superannuation funds were already a milch cow under Labor. Now that the coalition has made its initial bid for the lucrative spoils and has set a precedent, what logical impediment is there in the way of a future government of any persuasion to, say, lower the threshold, firstly, to be set at an unindexed income of $70,000 per annum in the case of the super tax? As it is now no longer to be a matter of principle that a particular level of income should be a determinant because the precedent has been set, it becomes a question of how much can be raised rather than whether further income tested imposts can be levied. The same concern about the behaviour of a future government surrounds new ground to be broken by partial income testing of the Medicare levy. It is now a pretty safe bet that in the lifetimes of most in this parliament the income threshold in this budget to apply to both the superannuation contribution and the Medicare levy tax hikes will be lowered, or become multitiered, along the lines of present day income tax brackets. It is a safe bet. Furthermore, without indexation of the threshold applying to these groundbreaking new tax measures, new elements for growth of revenue by way of stealth, in the form of bracket creep, will have been created. The costs of complying will be considerable but, no doubt, they will be calculated and revealed in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the relevant legislation. These increases, or new taxes, present further incursions into the household component of domestic savings, albeit to the advantage of public sector savings. The Treasurer has been scathing in comments about the deterioration of the levels of domestic savings under Labor, and with good cause. Yet there is absolutely nothing in this budget which will lead to increased private savings in the near term. The reverse is true. The two measures just mentioned are prime examples. It might be instructive if the government looked at some of the measures which it could tackle to meet what so far is merely its rhetorical concern. That the plummeting household savings occurred over a period of high inflation and revenue growth induced by income tax bracket creep, in large part, is no mere coincidence. Automatic indexation of the excise on petroleum products was also a factor, along with some pretty hefty imposts on the same commodities by state governments. More insidious, but nevertheless a huge drain on private savings, have been deliberate policy decisions which have brought forward the collection of a whole range of taxes and the associated compliance costs. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 5.30 to 5.55 p.m. achievable, be collected on a basis equating with pay-as-you-earn collection, huge private savings were transferred to the public sector, the proceeds of which Labor then blew like a drunken sailor.

So did the prescribed payment and withholding taxes from business in general. Also contributing to the decline in household savings was the credit card mentality boosted by high inflation which permeated society generally. State and federal governments led the way by example. After all, if governments do not have to occasionally balance the books and spend less than raised, why should mainstream Australia? On top of all that were new imposts, such as fringe benefits and capital gains taxes, which raided domestic as well as business savings. So little has been tackled in this budget which will improve what the government itself acknowledges to be totally inadequate levels of domestic savings. Looking at the bigger picture, even commendable relief from capital gains taxes otherwise payable by the proprietors of small unincorporated businesses will be insignificant. Nor will the business sector in general contribute, in the foreseeable future, to the restoration of domestic savings to anything approaching historically desirable levels, some seemingly heroic assumptions about economic growth forecasts in the budget papers notwithstanding. The collapse of the contribution of private sector businesses to domestic savings has gone hand-in-hand with the raising of new taxes and the earlier collections of existing taxes over the past 13 years. As with household savings, this is no mere coincidence. New taxes such as fringe benefits and capital gains imposts figured even more prominently in depleting the level of savings by the business sector. Even imputation of dividends, accompanied by an arguably offsetting reduction in the income taxing of companies, forced the earlier collection of part of what was formerly payable on company profits in the form of dividends in the hands of shareholders. It brought it forward. Escalating compliance costs, which do not add anything to government coffers--quite the reverse in fact-also played a part in depleting business sector savings. In the wake of what has taken place, and what the government proposes in this budget, any improvement in the levels of domestic savings becomes just another impossible dream. Even if the budget is brought into surplus over the life of the present parliament, it will only result in containment of the federal government's borrowings. At the end of March, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Commonwealth had eaten into domestic savings by borrowing a total of nearly $108,000 million, most of it in Australia. Its appetite and profligacy more than doubled to reach this record high over a paltry three years, the past three years. While the new government can rightly claim its predicament is Labor's fault, it might also, in the interests of transparency, make it clear that it is in no position to do more than contain borrowings to around present levels. Such a prognosis might also throw some light onto the prospects for reducing our overall international indebtedness. No matter what gloss anyone might care to put on it, the net national debt could be around $200,000 million at the end of this government's first termassuming there is no early election. It is no consolation to know that that figure could be halved, to manageable levels if, by waving a magic wand, the government's own borrowings could be eliminated overnight. But that is a measure of the significance of those government borrowings. The reality is, however, with balance of payments deficits still running well in excess of $1,000 million a month, any fiscally responsible government faces pure hard slog. Whatever the spin doctors in either the government or opposition may say, this budget represents a very 4958 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 small beginning in getting our fiscal affairs in order. It will be an even smaller beginning if some of the forecasts underpinning projected income or expenditure are not up to expectations. To put concerns about forecasts into some perspective, the three-year plan to bring the budget into underlying surplus is accepted as immutable. The underlying balance estimates call for the deficit last year of $10,317 million to reduce this year to $5,649 million and in 1997-98 to reduce to $1,548 million, and for a surplus in 1998-99 of $957 million. Major deterioration of either the revenue or expenditure assumptions, or both, is more likely than an improvement in either or both. This is because forward estimates for the current and ensuing years are at the end of the scales most favourable to the desired outcome. For example, estimated economic growth over the three years, essential to projected revenue forecasts being met, could hardly be higher, and historically they are unattainable at this time in the economic cycle, which is arguably on the wane. Further, while the short term-that is, 12 months or thereabouts-assumption for inflation seems reasonable, estimates of wages growth are possibly optimistic over both the short and medium term. Most regrettable of all, the human tragedy of unemployment is unlikely to be alleviated over the government's first term as it grapples with Labor's legacy. The Treasurer has predicted that there will be no improvement over the short term. More likely, unemployment will get worse before, or if, it gets better. To summarise, forecasts for economic and incomes growth, as well as for unemployment, are, if anything, on the sides which promote the best possible budget outcomes, both for this year and ensuing years. Normal prudence in any other field of endeavour would require best('ase and worse-case scenarios and mean averages to be adopted as the bases for forward planning. Like those before it, this budget and the accompanying rhetoric present the rosiest possible picture. A more responsible approach might be to present both worse-case and best-case forward estimates and outcomes, and not just the latter. More prudent still would be projected outcomes based on the averages of the highest and lowest in an expected range of movements in the rates of economic growth, employment, wages and the like. As it stands, the risks associated with the key forecasts which underpin assumptions about budgetary outcomes over the next three years are, to use the vernacular, all downside risks. One of the more pleasing features of the budget is the government's reaffirmation of an election promise to legislate for a 'charter of budget honesty'. When the next election is called, Treasury estimates of the then current condition of the budget, along with forward estimates, will be published. The sort of nonsense witnessed in the past, when governments changed hands and new administrations blamed their predecessors for concealing independent estimates, should not be possible in the future. The voting public will not then have to endure so many broken promises, excused because the incoming executive did not have an accurate picture of the state of the Commonwealth's accounts. Although adoption of a charter will have the effect of the opposition not announcing detailed policy until an election is under way because its promises cannot be cos ted either in quantum or for effect, that is also not necessarily a bad by-product. More honest campaigns should ensue. If so, it will not be easy to break promises post-election because of some real or perceived misconception about the true state of our fiscal condition. honesty by the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Rocher). As we know, the budgeting",113,Representatives Main Committee
353,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (6.07 P.m.),"I welcome the endorsement of a charter of budgetTuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITIEE 4959 situation that we find ourselves in at the moment is due to the true nature of the deficit being concealed from the coalition prior to the election. It is a situation which we look forward to not being repeated, come the next election. I also note that the member for Curtin was speaking about income tax reform. While there is certainly a mood around Australia, as noted by the forum that was held in Canberra last week, John Howard, as the coalition leader prior to the election, did go to the election with a basic promise of no tax increases and I believe that, by and large, the core commitments that he made were certainly upheld. In fact, the three promises that I believe were critical in the lead-up to the last election were to get our small business back on track by recognising that small business is the engine room of Australia's job creation program; to recognise the worth of the family unit; and, finally, to put young people back into jobs and address youth unemployment. Those three major commitments were made prior to the election. Those three commitments, I believe, have been well and truly addressed in this year's budget. I wish to speak to those three points. Since the budget was presented on 20 August, time and time again the opposition has accused the government of being ideologically motivated, as though the coalition's ideology were the antithesis of the values of social decency, caring for families, creation of employment, and protection of the genuinely needy in society. Members of the opposition have been attempting to portray those who created this budget as hardened conservatives, in some way out of touch with the needs and aspirations of mainstream Australian society. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. This is a budget for all Australians, and the Labor Party knows it. After 13 years of Labor, Australia's poor are poorer, the rich are richer, and the unemployed and disadvantaged continue to surface. We are presented with this disaster as a fait accompli. We are told, 'It was inevitable.' Labor Party politicians, some suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome, claim they have all the answers. If this is the case, why did they not implement policies to fix the problems while they had the chance? They had 13 years: they had their chance, and they failed during that time. It is time to move over and let the new government have its chance. Australia is better served by the coalition. We offer real and practical solutions. The 1996-97 budget is a key part of the new government's strategy to meet its election commitments and to restore and improve the economy. Of course, we could have devised the most lax, expensive and extravagant budget in this country's history. We could have maintained a policy of fiscal irresponsibility, which was becoming something of a tradition for the Labor government. But we were elected to solve the problem that Labor had left us: namely, a $10 billion bankcard debt, a debt which is damaging our economy in the same way that Labor's regressive industrial relations policy is destroying jobs, even as we speak. We agreed to solve the problem, and we agreed to do it fairly and with a view to helping those who were hardest hit by Labor's policies: Australia's families, small business and the unemployed-in particular, the young-who have been neglected in our society. Much was made by former Prime Minister Keating of the 20 consecutive quarters of growth, yet no tangible progress was made in helping the Deakin community. There have been no long-term benefits; none of Australia's alleged prosperity has trickled down to the people of Deakin. Labor claimed 20 steps forward while the Deakin community was forced to take a hundred steps back. It went backwards as it watched our national income fall from 10th to 22nd in the world. It went backwards as the self-proclaimed workers party claimed to be hard at work for 4960 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 the people of Australia while 14,000 businesses went under in 1994-1995. It went backwards as businesses struggled to pay off loans at around 20 per cent-and these were the same businesses that could have created jobs for those one million Australians who were left unemployed. In my electorate of Deakin young home buyers were discouraged from buying because they could not afford to meet the skyrocketing interest rates which increased by 17 per cent. That resulted in repayments going up by over 50 per cent-from $674 to $971 per month. As someone who has just increased their mortgage drastically in the last couple of weeks, I know just how much that sort of an increase can mean to the hip pocket-it hurts. And the people of Deakin were hurt. Yet the coalition, which is determined to help such people, is referred to as 'economic rationalists without a heart'. The Labor government foisted onto Australia program after program, one gimmicky policy after another. You name it, the people of my electorate have copped it-the accords, One Nation, Working Nation, employment initiatives. The more the names changed, the more the underlying social and economic injustices remained the same. On the way we experienced the worse economic recession since the Depression. All this while the party that was supposed to uphold the rights of the working classes was saying, 'Sorry, mate, it is the recession we had to have.' The ALP claims that, in government, they did a wonderful job; that no outgoing government has ever left an economy in better shape. The hundreds of thousands of Australians who are unemployed, many of whom recently voted for the coalition, know the Labor government had become reactionary, bent on defending the status quo which did nothing to eliminate social and economic injustices. If delivering a budget that lays a foundation for a more stable and secure Australia means criticism from those interest groups, so be it. The only justifiable accusation to be levelled at the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) and the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) is that they had the guts to deliver a socially and economically responsible budget. Let it be said that, in this budget, the coalition has reaffirmed its commitment to Australian families. The people of my electorate of Deakin, along with other Australians, will benefit from the coalition's pro-family stance. The Prime Minister promised to help families and the budget delivered on that promise. It is a recognition that the family unit had been neglected for too long by Australia's political leadership. As one commentator succinctly expressed, 'the Australian family can now come in from the cold.' The coalition's approach to family assistance as outlined in the budget is not an empty, rhetorical ploy, but a strong, unequivocal recognition of the importance of providing a society in which the family unit can flourish and reach its full potential. The centrepiece of this commitment is the family tax initiative in which families receive a $1,000 increase in their tax-free threshold for each dependent child, while one income families will receive a further $2,500 increase in their tax-free threshold if they have a child under the age of five. This is a socially responsible and compassionate approach to the hardships faced by families-and my electorate has more than its fair share of families who need all the support they can get. A report today by the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling has determined that the vast number of Australian families will benefit from the coalition's family tax initiative. The report concludes by saying that 71 per cent of families will see their weekly incomes increased; that is, their PA YE tax deductions will decrease. The government recognises the additional costs of raising a family and we have delivered on our Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4961 promise to families. The report goes on to say that the initiative will not benefit wealthy families. In fact, 40 per cent of gains will be made by families in the bottom 30 per cent of incomes. Once again the government is accused of presenting a slash and bum budget which neglects its social responsibilities. It is hard to understand the logic of such accusations when the government has met its election commitments in areas such as superannuation, involving an 18 per cent rebate to individuals who make superannuation contributions on behalf of spouses with low incomes; low incomes, not high incomes. For example, the government will allow banks and other financial institutions to assist low income earners by providing retirement savings accounts; these will benefit from the same taxation benefits as other superannuation products. Furthermore, the government is assisting these same low income earners by increasing the threshold of employer contributions under the super guarantee charge from $450 to $900 per month. This measure helps those who need the money now and were unlikely to benefit from the small super contribution. The budget also enables parents to have access to affordable child care. It is a budget that makes an extra $31 million available over four years to help children with special needs to gain access to quality child care. If this is a slash and bum budget then my electorate of Deakin, after 13 years of Labor mismanagement, has through its words and action given it its stamp of approval as a responsible budget and a fair budget. Yet Labor's campaign of misinformation has had its effect, to the point that certain groups in my electorate have put forward the view that budget changes will hurt parents. Let me state categorically that they will not. For example, the removal of the operational subsidy for community based long day child-care centres effective from July 1997 simply addresses the imbalances between the community sector and the private providers of child-care services. The subsidy was introduced in the mid-1980s to assist the community and since then there has been an explosion in the number of places provided by the private sector. Young families that are facing the burden of buying their first home will be extremely sceptical of claims by the opposition that this is an uncaring and unsympathetic budget. What young families will be quick to notice is how the government's fiscal responsibility and readiness to tackle the nation's debt will gradually lead to an environment in which interest rates will come down and the country will approach the level of certainty . Young families will be certain that their children will be able to grow up in a fair Australian society; a society which will have achieved a degree of sound fiscal responsibility. In fact this fiscal responsibility is already demonstrating itself. Since the election we have witnessed a drop in home interest rates delivering to mortgagees a saving equivalent to approximately $80 per month. I certainly expect this trend to continue and, as the economic forecasters indicate, there could very well be a further drop between now and the end of the year. This is the effect of a sound and responsible budget creating an environment of fiscal responsibility in which there can be great faith in our future. Mr Deputy Speaker, in the time. I have left I would like to speak to the issue of employment and unemployment. I am glad to be able to inform the unemployed people in my electorate of Deakin that the days of ineffective employment strategies are well and truly over. This government will end the strategy put in place by the previous government which saw expensive programs being funded by the taxpayer, without the certainty and often even the hope of 4962 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 making the unemployed any more employable. In fact, if there was anything heartless, it was the heartless nature of Labor's programs which created an air of expectation that at the end of the day there was a job. But at the end of the day there was no job, at the end of the day there was another program and another program, and so we found ourselves on Labor's merrygo-round training programs. Our approach focuses on individuals and their needs, not on programs or program objectives. It is a person's need that is far more important as to whether or not money will be expended and in what form that money will be expended, not whether or not a specific program in itself should be justified. We will help people when they need it. Labor's approach to impose a 12to 18-month delay on receiving labour market assistance was a major mistake. The coalition will not repeat this error by Labor. The coalition, far from being opposed to quality workplace training, is actually proposing a set of initiatives that will help get this country's long-term unemployed into the work force, something that is of particular concern to my electorate, in which youth unemployment is a constant cause of concern. One hundred and eighty seven million dollars will be provided over the next four years to assist the transition from school to the workplace. I consider this particular program to be one of the most exciting initiatives in the budget-<>ne of the unsung aspects of our budget. The school to work program will ensure that young people are not left stranded once they have left school. This program is part of the government's new Modem Australian Apprenticeship and Traineeship System, which is part of the process of the reform and streamlining of Australia's training system. Loss of apprenticeship opportunities over the last 13 years have been phenomenal and, in part, we have had both the former Labor state government of Victoria, and, certainly, the federal government, to blame. The old system of technical schools in our state, which gave hope to young kids who did not want to be streamed into university, has disappeared, thanks to the Cain-Kirner governments. The former government's approach in terms of moving people away from apprenticeships and into the labour market training program has continued that decline. At the heart of this $187 million four-year school to work package lies the allocation of $80 million to expand vocational education and training in secondary schools; $40 million for workplace training opportunities for students; and $38 million for up to 200 work placement coordinators to facilitate structured workplace learning opportunities for students. In my electorate they are lining up to be work placement coordinators. In my electorate the schools are approaching me to find out more about what is happening in terms of the school to workplace program. They are excited by it. I know that the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Sawford), who is on the same committee as me-the Employment, Education and Training Committee, which is looking into youth employment-also realises, from some of the comments that we have received through our investigations, that there is an air of expectation that the school to work programs will be addressed, and that the transition from one environment to another will be given prominence. Young students who are not planning to go on to university will be looking for an apprenticeship once they have completed year 12. They will be given the opportunity to gain valuable experience in the workplace while completing high school. It is an exciting program which I certainly fully endorse. Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4963 From my own experience in meeting with the people of Deakin, I am convinced that young people are looking for real training that leads to real jobs. Apprenticeships have for many years provided valuable opportunities for young people and the businesses employing them. The system has worked well for generations of Australians and it is important that they continue to function for years to come. It is imperative that this government be allowed to give a new lease of life to the system. The Labor Party, I am sure, will be surprised to examine the detail of such schemes; they are a genuine attempt to offer real opportunities to Australia's youth and to reveal a dignified way to enter the work force for those who are enthusiastic to work. In closing, let me assure the people of Deakin that, contrary to recent Labor rhetoric, there is no hidden agenda behind the government's policies; there is simply a commitment to create jobs for the unemployed, and a better working environment for those already employed. The budget is central to Australia's fiscal turnaround and its economic renaissance. While the previous government dilly dallied and promised substantial reform, which it was unable to deliver due to union pressure, the coalition has courageously set out a plan for the future of Australia. The government, furthermore, has announced in the 1996-97 budget broad design details of its commitment to provide capital gains tax rollover relief to small business. This measure will apply to capital gains tax otherwise payable on asset disposal on or after 1 July. The government's policy will see the amendment of the tax act so that equity investments in small and medium enterprises made by leading institutions after 1 July may be taxed under the capital tax provisions. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am glad to inform you that small business in my electorate reacted positively to the taxation election commitments that this government has either implemented or is in the process of implementing. The government has reduced the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six and it has announced an increase in the fringe benefits tax minor benefits threshold to $100. The small business deregulation task force will soon report with plans to halve the paperwork and the coalition will not proceed with Labor's proposal to force subcontractors into the PAYE net. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Australian people reacted positively to the budget. They understand that the only way out of the political quagmire we are in is through a readiness to take responsibility for the disastrous situation we have inherited from the previous government. It is encouraging to know that we have been able to get the budget message across in spite of the misinformation about the budget in the community and the opposition party's opportunistic scaremongering. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that the people of Deakin look forward to this budget being passed, not only in the lower house but also in the upper house. Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 8.00 p.m. conservatives in 14 years are very disturbing. My view can be summarised in saying that this budget is short on fairness and full of prejudice. It is a budget that has been driven by opinion polls. It is a budget that this government has at every opportunity gone out and sold by attacking the soft targets. Never before have we seen in the lead-up to a budget ministers making announcements in the manner in which they have done. In particular, we saw the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) give a doorstop",115,Representatives Main Committee
354,Mr Melham (Banks) (8.00 P.m.),"I must say that aspects of this first budget by the4964 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 press conference where he released a two-page press statement and then scuttled back into his office, and the next we heard of him was a couple of days later on the John Laws program. The tragedy was that on the same day that he announced that there would be some $470 million over four years cut from the ATSIC budget we had an announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, that the miners and the farmers would retain their diesel fuel rebate. The diesel fuel rebate in its totality offers concessions in the order of $1.2 billion per year to the miners and the farmers-more than the whole of the ATSIC budget. You see, it is sending the wrong signals. The indigenous community are prepared to suffer cuts that are fair, that are equitable, that are across the board, but these cuts to the ATSIC budget are none of that. They are targeted at the most vulnerable and disadvantaged section of the community, while at the same time the more privileged sections of the community are spared cuts. In this budget we have the defence sector immune from spending cuts. The cuts should be across the board. The pain, if it is to be borne, should be borne equally. But this government has picked the soft targets and has fed into people's prejudices. Instead of learning from the mistakes of history, this government seems to be compounding the mistakes of history. It is worth quoting the words of Pastor Martin Niemoller, a Lutheran minister who was a critic of Hitler and the Nazis. What Niemoller said summarises what I think has been the attitude of this government since it came to office, frankly. He said: They came for the Communists, and I didn't object-ForI wasn't a Communist; They came for the Socialists, and I didn't object-ForI wasn't a Socialist; They came for the labor leaders, and I didn't object-ForI wasn't a labor leader; They came for the Jews, and I didn't object-ForI wasn't a Jew; Then they came for me-And there was no-one left to object. The great tragedy is that this is not what the people were promised prior to the last election. They were promised that if John Howard were elected to the prime ministership he would have them feeling comfortable and relaxed by the year 2000. They were promised that this would be a government for all of us. The government for all of us quickly became a government for only some of us. It didn't include indigenous people, it didn't include migrants, it didn't include the unemployed, it didn't include public servants, it didn't include unionists, it didn't include the ABC. From day one, this government picked what it thought were the soft targets. That is a great tragedy. There is a sense of betrayal in the community. The cuts to the ATSIC budget were savage. They were not warranted. Again, in an answer to me in question time today, the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) conceded that members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community are amongst the most disadvantaged people in our community. The measure of a political party, the measure of a government, the measure of a society is how it treats the vulnerable and the disadvantaged. This is a march down the American path. The American path is simple. It is a classic conservative, divide and rule path. It is a dog-eatdog situation-bash the blacks and keep defence immune from spending cuts. The cruellest decision that this government made in the budget in relation to indigenous people was what it did to the community development employment program. John Howard talks about mainstream Australia. The Prime Minister says, 'This is what the majority of people think.' It is fair to say that the overwhelming majority-the white, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant section of the community-believe that people should work for the dole. The CDEP is basically a work for the dole program, but it is only the indigenous people who are required to do that. They do it welcomely, because it helps their self-esteem and it Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4965 helps the infrastructure in their remote communities. It provides an incentive for the local community to band together where there are no jobs. The cost of CDEP is an extra 30 per cent on top of unemployment benefits. So they work for less than the dole, but funding allows for infrastructure development. In this budget, the government has frozen the expansion of CDEP, the work for the dole program. Instead of allowing for the extra 2,500 places in CDEP, the government has allocated the money for unemployment benefits. It is madness. It is an absurdity. It seems to me that the attitude of this government is to say, 'If the Labor Party was involved in it, then we need to change it because it can't be any good.' What is the history of CDEP? ATSIC outlines the history in the attachment to its press release, and it is worth reading. On the bottom of page 5 of the attachment it says: The Community Development Employment Scheme was introduced on a pilot basis for remote Aboriginal communities by the Fraser Government in 1977 in response to those communities concerned that large scale payments of unemployment benefits would be both unproductive and cause considerable social problems. It has evolved into a scheme in which over 27,000 indigenous Australians voluntarily forgo their rights to Job Search Allowance (JSA) or New Start Allowance (NSA) to participate as employees in 262 CDEP projects throughout Australia for a wage that is approximately equivalent to JSA or NSA entitlements. More than 25% of working age indigenous Australians participate in the scheme and more than 60% of new jobs for indigenous Australians between 1991 and 1994 were created through expansion of CDEP. During the same period the CDEP scheme was responsible for the creation of 5,500 of the total 8,000 new jobs for Indigenous Australians. The scheme benefits Communities by generating a sense of pride in ownership and control and helps address a wide range of social issues such as long term unemployment, dislocation from mainstream labour market programs, substance abuse and habitual offending. Individuals by providing a transition to work, access to flexible training programs, helps to establish self esteem and a sense of cultural identity. Governments by providing for municipal services, particularly in remote communities, where local government is unable or unwilling to provide services and is critical to other service providers in the delivery of services to remote communities at outstations. The impact of not proceeding with the planned expansion will be felt both in the short term and the long term in respect of all the benefits identified above. More especially the cuts come at a time when the indigenous labour force is growing at 8,000 per annum. The likely impact is that indigenous unemployment will increase sharply as a result of this measure over the next four years. They then go on to talk about recent studies. And that is the great tragedy and the great irony. We are told that this government is going to concentrate on health, on unemployment and on housing. This is integral and it is related to those concerns, especially in regional Australia. Studies by Professor Colin Tatz from Macquarie University show that if you take away infrastructure spending or if you do not have community or cultural activities in remote Aboriginal communities, then those communities have an increase in youth suicide; they have an increase in delinquency; they have an increase in alcohol related problems; and they have an increase in health related problems. What worries me is that seven months into a new government we have a government apportioning blame, not a government coming down with a considered program, not a government coming down in this sensitive area with policies that have any long-term benefits. This was a program that was created by the Fraser government. We acknowledged, when we 4966 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 were in government, the benefits of the program and we expanded it. In the mainstream community's view it is work for the dole. And, what have we got? The government is discarding the expansion of the program and just allocating the money for people to receive unemployment benefits. That is not helping anyone. It is a problem in a number of other areas as well. The tragedy is that not a lot of people are listening. There is anxiety in the community; there has been so much change that people are concerned, and they are looking for the simple solutionsA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 8.13 to 8.38 p.m. the minister announced these cuts and then said it was up to the ATSIC board to determine where the cuts would occur. I said at the time that what the minister was doing was handing the ATSIC board a poisoned chalice because there were already criticisms of ATSIC from within. To then tum around and say to the organisation, 'We are going to impose $470 million worth of cuts but you are going to pick where these cuts are going,' is the wrong principle. The minister might argue that this is in accordance with the principles of self-determination. What should have happened was that the ATSIC board should have been consulted on where the cuts were to be made. There should have been recommendations but the minister should have worn the responsibility for where the cuts would take place. Instead, what he has done is leave the ATSIC board open to criticism from within the community. These are the other measures mentioned in the press release following the government's announcement. It said: ... the ATSIC board had reluctantly concluded it was forced to terminate the following: the Community Training program, which means that ATSIC will have no labour market program other than CDEP; the development of Industry Strategies, which had been an initiative of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody; the Movement to Award Wages program, which means that ATSIC will no longer be able to supplement those organisations moving their indigenous staff to award wages; and the Community and Youth Support program, which will effectively remove from ATSIC responsibility for assisting indigenous organisations providing community and social services to Aboriginal people. It is now the total responsibility of Commonwealth and State agencies to provide needed community services and welfare to indigenous people. There is something else that needs to be said. ATSIC has only been in existence for a couple of years, since the early 1990s. There is a perception that ATSIC provides all the services to the indigenous community. It does not; it only provides part of the services. The red tape and the accountability that ATSIC has to observe are just double standards compared to what we ask of the rest of the community. The guilty parties in terms of the lack of services going to the indigenous community are state and territory governments. Where is the accountability for those governments in terms of providing essential services that we, the rest of the community, take for granted? We only allowed ATSIC to administer health services for a fouryear period. We took them away from it in the end after consultation with the ATSIC board and the services were picked up by the Department of Health.",120,Representatives Main Committee
355,Mr Melham,"As I was saying before the division, it is worth quoting again from theTuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4967 There needs to be a coordinated whole of government approach to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander problem in this country. It is not only the nation's eyes that are watching John Howard as Prime Minister, it is going to be the world's eyes, given that we are hosting the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000. Like it or not, there is a concern in the broader community. It might be popular in the short term to pick these soft targets that the opinion pollsters tell you, 'That is going to go down well with those battlers who switched their vote on 2 March,' but over time the government is going to run out of alibis. They have had seven months. I remember the press conference that was held by the Prime Minister after the first cabinet meeting with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. We were told about the expose on the Sunday program. All this time on, there has not been shown to be any substance in those allegations-allegations that were actually pursued by the ATSIC office of evaluation and audit itself. There has been no evidence of widespread corruption, but evidence of problems in terms of some areas of administration in answering letters; technical breaches, as they are called. We had a situation where the ATSIC organisation has been forced to pay $1.4 million to meet the cost of a special auditor. That was part of the first cabinet decision. A couple of weeks ago that decision to impose a special auditor on ATSIC and those organisations was struck down as illegal. The minister was acting outside the powers given to him under the $1.4 million for that special audit, that illegal audit. The Labor Party has no problems with accountability. We have no problems with the proper accounting of public funds. The situation is that the way this government is going, in this area and a number of other areas, is all opinion poll driven. It is telling people what they want to hear. It is portraying, with the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), this false prophet, that things are simple, that they have simple solutions. They are not and they do not. They are complicated. We live in a humane and compassionate society. Australia is a fairer society than the United States was under Reagan and under Bush. It is a fairer society than Great Britain was under Thatcher. We do not want to go down the Thatcher path, down the Reagan path. As conservatives are getting turned out of office around the rest of the world, we took a different course. It will not take the Australian electorate long to wake up. There are no simple solutions, and in this area what is required is empathy and sensitivity. I have said time and time again since I have been a shadow minister that the Labor Party is prepared to playa constructive role with the government. We acknowledge that there is a new government in town, but we do not accept the way it is going in this area. It is a government without compassion. It is a government that does not have the solutions and it is a government that should take heed. It should count to 10 and pull back a little bit. It has been knocked over in the courts already and I think it will not withstand scrutiny. (Time expired) member for Banks( Mr Melham) with concern and interest, and also in appreciation of his sincerity in matters of this nature. But, I must remind him, since he mentioned Professor Colin Tatz, that it was Professor Tatz-was it not?-who made a visit to Aboriginal communities in 1971, I think, and found them in an absolutely deplorable situation. About 20 years later",123,Representatives Main Committee
356,Mr Tony Smith (Dickson) (8.45 P.m.},"One always listens to the learned and gallant4968 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 made another visit to those communities and found an even worse situation. That is something that cannot be ignored in looking at these sensitive issues. The policies over those 20 years involved, in many cases, doling out money without looking for achievable goals and without determining that what we need is outcomes-not just spending and telling people to take the money and go away. We really have to look at the history, certainly of the government that he was part of-a member of the backbench, I think, at that stage-during that 13 years, and, in particular, we also have to look at the overall history of Aboriginal spending. To say that we have to look at it is not to say that we have any predisposed ill view towards Aborigines. It is an absolute outrage and an insult to suggest that we, on this side of the House, do not have compassion and caring towards that very disadvantaged sector of the community. But, in so far as ATSIC is concerned, any organisation that spends $140 million of its something like $800 million budget on administering itself, in an area where money is as scarce as it is in this area, has to be looked at carefully and there has to be a thorough examination of whether or not that sort of money can be spent in really uplifting the lives of Aborigines on the ground. In that respect, and in principle, I support money going in at the bottom and not money going in at the top. That is all I wish to say in relation to some of those remarks by my honourable friend. The budget, in my view, has been accepted widely in the community as a good budget. It is a budget that has had to take hard decisions, but it also is a budget of forward thinking in relation to some particular areas of interest that I have, notably the training initiatives and the focus on moving towards the expansion of vocational education in schools, and, in particular, the recognition of the need for greater apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities. It is interesting to note that $187 million is going to be developed. In my own electorate of Dickson, the Pine Rivers High School has already, to some extent, been a beneficiary of the new focus towards developing, enhancing and expanding this latent opportunity. When a school like Pine Rivers has expensive machinery sitting idle between the hours of 3.00 p.m., after school finishes, and a reasonable hour for training, something like 10.00 p.m., and on holidays and weekends, and we have people out there who need training, it is absolutely incumbent upon us to try to utilise that equipment after hours. We must use it, as well, obviously, in relation to training in schools. The after hours use, which is part of the program that Minister David Kemp mentioned in parliament recently, is going to be taken advantage of in this particular area, and I applaud the direction of the government in that area. It is also important to realise that difficult decisions had to be taken in the overall budget context. The expenditure side of the equation had to be carefully looked at. However, in doing so, we must not be too blinded in looking for the black figure. There are groups of people out there-and I know this from representations that have been made to me in my electorate-who are largely being forgotten. These people have worked for something like 30 years in the Australian Public Service or perhaps in industry. They have suddenly found themselves out of work due to rationalisation or changes to industry structures---or whatever fancy terms are applied. One cannot help but be extraordinarily moved when confronted by these people who are the victims of the new age of rationalisation and reorganisation of companies, government departments and so forth. These people have intrinsic worth and intrinsic value. They have great skills and great wisdom. It is absolutely shocking that people have reached an age where they have so much Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4969 to contribute, have learnt such a lot, and yet suddenly find themselves victims. This has not just occurred recently. Indeed, one particular example goes back something like 18 months, but the process is unfortunately coming to fruition for this particular constituent fairly soon. Over a period of time he has been, as it were, wound down and shunted into a particular area. It is a bit like what happens to old rolling stock. They are gradually shunted around on the train tracks and then put into a shed and left there, forgotten. However, these people are not forgotten by me. In this time of budgetary restraint we must not forget that there is a human factor involved. We must not forget the people who have these skills and this wisdom. Just because they are in their mid or late 40s and sometimes 50s does not mean they should be on the scrap heap. I do not accept that at all. We must always come back to the human factor. In that respect, I also have a criticism of those who are in work and their concern for those who are not in work. For a number of years, former Labor minister Clyde Cameron heavily criticised the 17.5 per cent loading on annual leave. He pointed out that it was intended for shift workers who received particular allowances which were built into the nature of their work. When they went on holidays, this allowance was designed to assist them to have a reasonable annual leave. That allowance then drifted right across the economy, and I recall Clyde Cameron speaking about the fat cats who got it as well. Both during the election campaign and since, a number of working people have said to me that they do not really need this. I question the notion that that is a non-negotiable, bottom line condition that could never be negotiated away in relation to what we are looking at in terms of rationalising workplace agreements and so forth. In this day and age, when people are out of work to such a degree, can we afford to have that luxury when, apart from the hardliners, most people would not really insist on having that loading? And yet now it is being built into the structure. I question that. I really wonder whether we should be starting to look at that, because it is obvious for all of us to see that there is a disparity between those who are in work and those who are not in work. Those who are not working are trudging around looking for work and those who are in work are doing very well, thanks very much. Some would say, and I would say, that in some cases they are doing too well at the expense of those who are not in work. It is easy to be critical of the trade unions' position on this, and I am sure the honourable member opposite will not accept this point of view. Once a member is out of work they generally cease to be a member of a union and as far as the union is concerned it is not terribly interested in him or her once they lose their job. I think that culture is to be deprecated, that once they are out of work the union is not particularly interested in that person. I also wanted to mention another area that concerns me about the budget, and that is the area of foreign aid. I believe that it is unfortunate that the ratio of aid to GNP has now dropped from 0.34 per cent to 0.29 per cent-the lowest percentage that we have ever contributed to foreign aid. Unfortunately, we have a populist view that has recently gained currency, where we have a member of parliament saying there should not be any foreign aid. I have had people say that to me in the course of my travels in the electorate, but I ask them, 'Can you imagine your children with no basic services, lucky to have a crust of bread in their mouths every day, with no sanitation and no roof over their heads? Can you imagine that situation in your own children's case? Can you then say we should not have foreign aid?' They always come back to reality when you put that scenario to them. 4970 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 Unfortunately, we have this populist line that we would be a lot better off as far as our country is concerned if we did not have foreign aid. With a little bit of thinking about it, you come back to reality. It can be put this way: Australians have a history of helping their neighbours. That is part of the Australian ethos-to help your neighbour. Who is your neighbour? Is it just the bloke next door or the widow down the street? Is it someone in the other suburb? Or is it the neighbourhood of the whole community, and that is the world community, not just the community beside you. To suggest that your neighbour is only that person living very handy to you is, in my view, to have a very narrow mind on this issue. I hate the use of the word 'racist' because it is bandied about so easily. If a person has a different view to you then they are a racist. But when you think about it, to actually say, 'Let us look after our own backyard and not worry about them,' isn't that really discriminating on the basis of race? Isn't that the purest form of discrimination on the basis of race? That means saying that our near neighbours are the ones we should look after and those others are not really our neighbours. Why? Because they are not living close, they have a different colour skin or their eyes are differently shaped to ours. I think we have a duty to the world community to look after those who are in dire need. The figures show that 20 per cent of people have 85 per cent of the world income and the poorest 20 per cent of those have only 1.4 per cent of the world's income. When you look at the statistics, how can a cut in the aid budget be justified? I do not cavil at the idea of trying to ensure that aid is better distributed and more wisely directed, but those who espouse that populist view of cutting out aid should question whether in the long run we are not going to be worse off. Aren't we going to be seen in the eyes of the world to be a miserable and selfish country? At the same time, by denying people the assistance that they need, we are perpetuating and entrenching more strongly the gulf between rich and poor. I emphasise in particular the wise use of aid, that is, the provision of the pump to pump out the water, or the provision of seed. The development of the infrastructure within the communities is going to help them in the end to improve their position. That is really what it is about. It is not about just throwing money at the situation, it is about providing solutions, providing education. There is a welcome increase in the aid budget for basic education and primary health care. In that respect I support the government's approach because education is one factor that is very important in ameliorating this problem. On the other side of the coin, the marginal decrease in funds for Africa and the decrease for south Asia is very disturbing. It is something that we cannot ignore. It is something that we have a duty to do something about. It is a duty of common humanity what we are talking about here. It does not do us any good to put it in the language that was put in the budget papers of, 'Well, we really have to solve our own problems first'. That is an appeal to the most basic instincts. One could accept the cut without comment but to have a cut with that sort of self-justification is unacceptable and I do not agree with that sort of approach. In my view, the overall cut is a very sad one in the circumstances and it is a sad comment on our society. Overall, the budget is about correcting endemic debt problems at the national level, and that is to be applauded. Those hard decisions have had to be taken. In the long run one can say that Australia will be better off because of those decisions. The budget sets a path for recovery. However, there are areas of concern that we must never lose sight of and they include the human element, the unemployment element, and the aid element that I have just mentioned. Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4971 In addition, as mentioned by the member for Banks( Mr Melham), we have to be very careful in relation to the area of Aboriginal welfare. We must ensure that money spent there is well directed money and not wasted money, but we must ensure at the same time that we assist those who are in the least advantaged position in the community. In general, I welcome the thrust of the budget but with the reservations that I have mentioned. colleague, the member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith), at a point where he referred to assistance for Aboriginal people. As a former Labor minister for Aboriginal Affairs and as one who held a portfolio for six years I want to say that I was deeply distressed and concerned by the statements made by the present Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) who, although he described the taking of Aboriginal children away from their parents as horrible, went on to say that some Aboriginal children had benefited by that experience. That was a dark period in Australian history. I have no doubt that for those who administered it they thought that what they were doing was the right thing. However, I have never met an Aboriginal person, no matter their age, who had been separated from their parents who did not at the first conceivable opportunity go in search of them-and found them too in many cases. What they often found was a family that was completely dysfunctional, which is not surprising given that three or four children had been taken away from their family in their early years and transported miles away from their relatives. The Aboriginal people have a strong extended family concept and there is a great feeling of loyalty to each other within that. The pain and the suffering that was inflicted upon the parentsA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 9.05 to 9.30 p.m. statements made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. When he was appointed I said that he needed time; he needed time to get over the complexities of what is probably one of the most difficult portfolios in government. The statement that he made has led to a continued loss of confidence and loss of respect for the minister; that statement will come back to haunt him. He should modify and retract those statements because there are people living in the Aboriginal society whose lives are still, irrespective of whatever education they may have had, dysfunctional. They will never overcome the pain and the burden of those actions of separating them from their families. This was an inappropriate statement and it is a matter, I hope, that the minister will, either immediately, or in time, correct. I am concerned that, because of some of the aspects of government policy, Aboriginal leadership across Australia is increasingly losing confidence in the government. We are heading down a track where we could easily see massive confrontation, with Aboriginal people believing that there is no hope for them, and no hope for their future in this society so long as the government continues with its present policy. That is a situation which would adversely affect all of us.",124,Representatives Main Committee
357,Mr Holding (Melbourne Ports) (9.04 P.m.),I enter this debate following on from my,128,Representatives Main Committee
358,Mr Holding,"At the time of the bells ringing, I was expressing my concern about the4972 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 The other aspect that I want to touch on very quickly is some of the remarks that were made by the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in her maiden speech. It has taken this nation, under a variety of governments, some time to get to the point where one can honestly say that there is no element of racism involved in our immigration policy. Wherever you come from-it does not matter whether you are seeking family reunion, whether you are trying to come here as a skilled person, or how you are trying to enter-the tests are exactly the same. I have to take issue with the honourable member for Oxley, certainly at a very personal level, because of the quote that she made of the late honourable Arthur Calwell, the founder of our immigration policy. She took-as it was possible to take, given his time in politics-a sentence to claim some support and express some admiration for an attitude which he expressed as minister at a time when he had just come out of a war in which many Australians had died and many families were suffering as a result of the near Japanese invasion of Australia. Cal well was well aware of the prevailing sentiment in Australia, as was the then leader of the Liberal Party, Robert Gordon Menzies. There was a generational attitude. In my own party-and I was present at the conference that overturned the white Australia policy-one could accurately predict the vote on the ages of the delegates. I do not think it was much different in the Liberal Party. And the fact is that we have come a long way since people were excluded on the basis of colour or creed. I would refer those who are interested in pursuing this matter to the very important publication by Professor Jerzy Zubrzycki, who made a study of Arthur Calwell and the origin of post-war immigration. The reason I feel very deeply about this is because, if one ever had a political mentor and political father, Arthur Cal well was mine. I was a pallbearer at his funeral. Three things happened at his funeral, but I will only mention the two which are relevant to this debate. Firstly, the former Prime Minister, Robert Gordon Menzies, who had lost his ability to walk, turned up outside St Patrick's Cathedral in his car. He sat there and paid tribute to his political opponent, personal friend and colleague. As the hearse passed, Robert Gordon Menzies lifted his hat, and then he left. The other thing that occurred on that day-and I refer this to the honourable member for Oxley-is that the only community in Calwell's electorate of Melbourne which closed its shops and trade while the funeral was taking place was the Chinese community. That was because Arthur Cal well was not merely their representative, he was their friend. When he left the ministry and was in opposition, he chose to use his time by learning another language, and the language he chose to learn was Mandarin. He laid the basis for our immigration policy. The face of Australia we see today owes a great deal to his energy, his foresight and, indeed, the hard role he had to play. He had to deal with the issue of Japanese war brides. He had to deal with complex issues in a community where there was still, as I said, pain and suffering caused by the war. Zubrzycki said that, on 2 August 1945, the then Leader of the Opposition, Robert Menzies, pledged his party's support, choosing to underscore Calwell's statement. Menzies said: We may have only those next 25 years in which to make the best possible use of our chance to survive. Our first requirement is additional population ... These are grave words which I believe to be entirely true ... My pledge to the Minister is that, if a choice has to be made between a policy of extreme caution and an adventurous policy which accepts risks because great results are involved, then let us have a more adventurous policy. Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4973 I agree with Zubrzycki's comment that, in saying this, Menzies laid down a firm foundation for Australia's bipartisan policy on immigration. Any person applying to come to Australia comes here on the basis of facing the same uniform test. Therefore, it is a matter of concern to me-and I think to many of my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House-when a newly elected member, one of our number, says that one group in the community should be excluded. She says that they should not be considered as potential citizens of Australia. Why? She makes no apology for it-it is because they are Asian. As a concept, that is a reflection upon all Australians of Chinese origin who have made a great contribution to this nation. Is she saying that if she had had a serious heart condition when Dr Chang was alive that she would not have been operated on by him because he was Asian? In Queensland recently, there was a significant art exhibition of Asian art and culture. This reflects the fact that we are part of Asia, even though we have a European culture and European heritage. However, the one thing that all ministers for immigration know-and I said this when I was working in that capacity-is that the one thing that is certain is that the last group that gets off the boat will cop the criticism. After the war, if they were Italian or Greek, there were some fairly fanciful names used to describe them. And as these people became part of our community, I had given to me, when I was minister for immigration, an article written in one of the Sydney tabloids. The heading was: 'Australia being Latinised'. What had the Italians done? An enterprising reporter had actually been in that part of Sydney where Italian settlers had bought houses. But worse than that, they had actually opened restaurants and, worse again, the menus were in Italian. And Australia was being 'Latinised'. We have heard from the membefor Oxley that Australia is being 'Asianised'. It is palpable nonsense. It is ignorant nonsense. And words hurt. I have in my electorate a significant Jewish community, many of whom were victims of the Holocaust. No-one could have foreseen the fact, and Adolf Hitler, whether we like it or not, was democratically elected. What did he do? All the economic problems that then faced the German people were blamed onto one group: the Jews. And what started as words of hatred which were picked up, led to Kristallnacht and to the persecution of that group and, ultimately, to the Holocaust and the destruction of those people. I am not saying that is what is contemplated here, but what I am saying is that there is no place in this parliament, no matter how vigorously asserted, or how ignorant the person making the statement is, where you say that you now introduce into your immigration policy a set of standards by which people are excluded on the basis of their country of origin. Australia has moved beyond that. And the kind of allegations that are made by the honourable member for Oxley have no place in this parliament. I do not argue with her right to say them, but they are palpably wrong and immoral. I was carrying out my parliamentary responsibilities at the IPU and on the way home from ChinaI picked up, as did many other passengers on the plane, a major Hong Kong newspaper. What did I find on about page 3 or page 5-and I still have the cutting? There was a heading: 'Racism growing in Australia'. And what was it referring to? It was a reference to racism and racist attitudes being shown towards Asian people. And who was quoted? The honourable 4974 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 member for Oxley was quoted. The honourable member for Oxley was featured in a paper circulating amongst the population of Hong Kong and many other parts of Asia. That is doing the Australian people great damage because the majority of Australian people and the majority of members of this parliament do not share those views. They reject those views. AndI hope that the honourable member for Oxley will give some thought to that. There is one other matter that I feel I should raise, and I can understand the enthusiasm for the Prime Minister( Mr Howard). He is a political stayer and, as a political stayer, he fought his way through to the highest office in the land. But, equally, this view that he has that somehow his elevation to office has brought a new sense of freedom, and that political correctness-whatever that means-is no longer the order of the day, and that political correctness means that you have to support what are the prevailing views in this society, is wrong. I do not believe that this position was ever part of the Hawke or the Keating governments. And as one who has been in politics some time, I am bound to say that most of that time. I would have been regarded by the governments of the day as being politically incorrect. I started at an early age of 18 stuffing letterboxes in Richmond and Hawthorn in the anticommunist referendum. If you did that, you were regarded as a communist at worse, and as a pro-communist at best-a politically incorrect position. I was involved in the first of the nuclear protests and that was a very politically incorrect position. I am bound to say that at the recent protest at MururoaI was joined by a number of my parliamentary colleagues from the Liberal Party, and I was pleased to see that their presence has now made me politically correct. Equally, I found myself in the situation where I was opposed to the conscription of Australian youth for the war in Vietnam, and that also led to strong allegations that one was disloyal, one was not prepared to stand up to fight the threat of communism. I remember seeing pamphlets in my community saying: better stop them there than have them come here, with a big red arrow not coming out of Vietnam but actually coming out of China. That was a politically incorrect position. It was a minority position in the beginning and ultimately, of course, we were proved right. It was the same with apartheid. I remember seeing my fellow citizens being brutally bashed in a legitimate and proper democratic protest on the occasion of the South African rugby tour game taking place in Melbourne. That was then a totally politically incorrect position, but not any more. History has caught up with us and our views have been proved right, and the evidence now being given in South Africa shows just how right it was. So this view of political correctness depends upon how you see it. The fact is that in our political life the culture in this parliament has changed. After the Vietnam WarI was a lone voice speaking on behalf of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to herbicides. For three years I was pretty much a lone voice because the government did not want to know about it. Experiments that have taken place in America over the last five to 10 years have proved that those concerns are right and that there is a clear correlation between some of the conditions of the children of Vietnam veterans and Vietnam veterans themselves and their exposure to defoliants. What might be seen as a politically correct position today is not necessarily a politically correct position tomorrow, and this view that somehow in this new spirit of tolerance you can say anything you like, you can characterise people on the basis of their colour or their creed, Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4975 is totally unacceptable. It is even more unacceptable in this parliament. There is an old saying: if it walks like a duck, it quacks like a duck and it looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. For those people who want to engage in this kind of political nonsense, I believe they have no real contribution to make to this parliament. (Time expired) Mr ruCKS (Riverina) (9.48 p.m.)-Like many on the coalition side, I am a person who is very pleased to be in government after 13 years, but also equally pleased to be associated with this budget, the first Howard-Costello budget of the coalition. I know a lot of commentators have said that the budget is strong but fair, and as I go around my electorate and other electorates this has been echoed by the people that I have spoken to. Over the last 13 years they have faced the Labor Party and also faced the neglect of the former government for Australian families who they have purported to represent, who seem, particularly the middle income group, to be going further and further down, getting further and further behind. But at last they have seen some hope in this government. Farmers have also been affected over the last 13 years. Certainly, they had to face droughts and low commodity prices, but the actions of the previous government did not help them. And to small business, who are really the backbone of the economy, it seemed that every time they turned around there was some more tax and more red tape. As I went around the electorate before the last election, and the one before that, small business people were saying, 'We are getting older and older, we are working harder when we should be starting to take it easy, and we have a business here which is really our superannuation but no-one in their right mind would want to buy.' They were really feeling the brunt of the policies of the previous government. So they were delighted when the coalition was elected and more delighted when they saw the policies put forward by the government. But they are starting to get a bit edgy now because we are having some problems getting those measures through the Senate, even though we have a very large majority in the House of Representatives and, I believe, a mandate from the people to have that legislation passed. Like so many people in the community, I am both angry and disappointed that the Labor government's legacy to this great nation has been a mountain of debt in excess of over $100 billion. It seems to me that Labor governments have this reputation of being large taxers and large spenders, and you need the tax if you are going to spend. I notice the paper put out by one of the senators which says that income in taxes and charges in 1992-93 was $95 billion and it had increased to $124 billion in 1995-96. That is a rise of 30.9 per cent-and all that money has been spent. If we move to loans, it was $32 billion as at 30 June 1991, it rose to $100 billion at 30 June 1996-and that is all gone. Assets sales over four years-Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank et cetera-totalled $8.68 billion. All that is gone. The worse part of it was that infrastructure investment in the mid-1980s was eight per cent of outlays, was down to 4.7 per cent when Mr Keating was appointed Prime Minister and this year-1995-96-is down to minus 0.3 per cent. That is a tragedy for our nation and is really something we have to act on very quickly. Of course, it was not only the Federal government that had a problem. We saw what happened in Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia and it is starting to happen in Queensland. As I said before, it just seems that when you have Labor governments they like to spend big so they have to tax in a large way. The interest on the debt in the 1996-97 budget will cost more than is allocated to defence, education and industry assistance. I am also fairly upset that the coalition has had to start its 4976 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 8 October 1996 first term trying to claw its way up from the bottom of a deep financial hole dug by the mismanagement of successive Hawke-Keating governments. Faced with a budget deficit of $10.3 billion in 1995-96, the government has had to embark on a firm fiscal strategy to eliminate the budget deficit in order to secure the financial future of the nation. The coalition has been forced to make some tough and difficult decisions with the goodwill, understanding and cooperation of the Australian people. I must say that, despite the coalition having to take some strong actions, the Australian people--certainly the ones I have spoken to-on both sides of the political fence have said, 'It is about time governments were honest with us and told us where we stood. We don't mind bearing the burden as long as we are going to get somewhere at the end of it.' That is the attitude that I have seen in many people. The majority of people have accepted that it was imperative for the new government to take stem fiscal action. The majority of people accept that everyone has been asked to shoulder the burden. They accept the pain, knowing the government's budget strategy to reduce debt will secure a better future for all Australians and for future generations. Some of the people who have come into my office have complained about the problem they are going to face, the cutbacks in their area. I have asked them to consider the situation and said to them, 'Do you want to bear some of the short term pain now for the future as an Australian, or do you want to be an Australian who just doesn't care about the future, doesn't care about obtaining work for your children and your grandchildren, the quality of life and the standard of living?' While most people I have spoken to have not been happy about it, they have agreed that that is the way we ought to be going. All they ask of their government is honesty and they want fair play. They do not want to have one section of the community bear all the load. They want it to be spread right throughout the community. Our government would have been quite irresponsible if it had failed to take firm but fair action to tum around the Australian economy after a decade of economic vandalism. That is what it was that put us in that situation. Failure to take this tough, unpopular fiscal decision at the correct time would have condemned the Australian people to a continuing period of rising deficit and debt into the next century-this has been said many times before, but we should keep repeating it; we have to do something and that is why we have to get our legislation through the Senate-it would have exposed them and their families to a bleak future, and applied pressure to interest rates and to jobs growth. Despite the economic mess inherited from the Hawke-Keating administration, the Howard government has been able to deliver in full on its key election promises. First of all, it has delivered to families, and families are the cornerstone of our great nation-we know that. We really had to do something for families, which seemed to be falling further and further behind. I do not know, Mr Deputy Speaker-and I know that you would have been aware of this as you went around your electorate-how some of those families survived. People who were earning what once was a really good wage, say, between $30,000 and $40,000 per year, with a few children, were finding that they were slipping back further and further. They were wondering what in the heck was going on and what was causing this. The Howard government has looked into this situation and is trying desperately to help these families. Our young people who are unemployed are being trained and retrained and retrained-for what? There is no real training and no real jobs. The Howard government is trying to do something about this. Tuesday, 8 October 1996 MAIN COMMITTEE 4977 We have mentioned small business. They just thought that they would have to keep on working until they were carried out in a pine box. There was no way they could retire because no-one wanted their business and that is their superannuation. And, of course, there are the elderly. I know the Labor Party finds it painful to come to grips with the fact that the first Howard government budget has been a winner, as evidenced by the strong support of the Australian people and the majority of media commentators and economists. The Labor Party's pathetic attempt to attack certain sections of the budget and to resort to a campaign of scaremongering clearly illustrates just how out of touch the Labor Party continues to be with the Australian people. One of the key promises of the Howard government was the $1 billion family tax initiative, which is being delivered in full, restoring hope and reducing the tax burden on families with children. We have kept faith with the Australian community by keeping our promise to look after the poor and needy by maintaining and enhancing the social security safety net. The people who benefit most are those lower and middle income families with children, a group which, as I said before, was neglected by the previous government. Single income families with several young children will benefit between $40 and $50 extra each fortnight. This will certainly relieve some of the economic pressure. There will be assistance through the taxation system, while low income families will be able to claim the family tax payment through the social security system, paid fortnightly with their family payment. I know that members on the opposite side of the House would be concerned about what is happening to families in Australia. We have had inquiries into the Child Support Agency and family law. Much needs to be done there; I have spent a great deal of time in my office and I would say the major issues would be the Child Support Agency and family law. This is one of the problems we face in Australia and, I suppose, why our budgets blowout: family breakdown. We have to look seriously-both the government and the opposition-at this problem and see where we are going with it because I do not think we can sustain it too far into the future. Small business, which is at the heart of rural and regional Australia, has been given a much needed economic boost in this budget. Small business, as I said before, suffered enormous economic setbacks under Labor policies, which produced record business closures and bankruptcies. I mention the rural sector because if you go to many towns-not even outback towns but regional towns-you will find the shops boarded up and closed. There are many reasons for that and we cannot blame just the economy. It is modem transport and certainly there has been tremendous pressure on those businesses in rural and regional areas. The budget has restored incentives for small business; incentives aimed at creating an economic environment in which that important sector can confidently expand and create real jobs and get Australians back to work and be part of an exciting and innovative government program to revamp the nation's traineeship and apprenticeship schemes, which will offer significant working opportunities for young school leavers. I have found that a number of towns in my electorate are held up because of the lack of tradesmen in the area. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned.
