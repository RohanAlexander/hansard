That would be a more regular way of procedure, and I should be pleased to supply the information required. from the Prime Minister whether it is possilble for honourable members to see the ex-Public Service Commissioner, on the Public Service, seeing that that report was completed nearly six months ago? ther it is possible for honourable members to see the report. I am sorry to say I have not seen it myself, but that is entirely, no doubt, my own fault. However, since the honourable member has directed my attention to what is my obvious duty I shall endeavour to get the report and read it. No doubt it is full of sound advice, some of which probably we shall not be able to take; but still I shall see what the report says. I should like to say, however, that an early opportunity will be given to discuss the .whole question of the Public Service on the introduction of a Bill dealing with it ; and before that Bill is introduced this report, together with any other information for which honourable members may fairly ask, will be made available. news item this morning, Mr Heitman, the former member' for Kalgoorlie, has been appointed Publicity Officer to the Government. I should like to know whether that is a Government appointment, what are the duties of the office, and what is the salary? licity Officer, so far as I understand them, are those which are suggested by the name itself. There is a great deal of work to be done in connection with the preparation of documents, and, amongst other things, the preparation of advertisements which are inserted in various newspapers throughout the country. There are many other duties, but I am bound to say that I have never been Publicity Officer to a Government. If the honourable member wishes to ask me a fair question I shall answer it. I am quite sure that this gentleman is doing whatever work he has to do very well. of the House for the recent adjournment I raised the question of foreign exchanges in reference to Customs duties. On the last day we met, the Prime Minister gave a reply, and said he would invite representations from the Governments concerned. I should like to know whether representations have been made, and, if so, whether the Prime Minister can give any indication when the Government will arrive at a decision on the matter. would be quite accurate to say that reresentations by the French Government ave been made, but it would be true to say that during the adjournment of Parliament representations were made to me by the Consul-General for France. I had a long interview with that gentleman, and asked him to lay his views before' me in tlie form of a memorandum. This he did last Thursday, and on Friday or SaturdayI submitted it to the Minister( Mr Laird Smith) who was then acting for the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene), and requested him to consider the memorandum, with a view of seeing how far the views as there set forth could be sustained, and whether some remedy could be found for the injustice under which the French Government states France is suffering. The matter was again mentioned in Cabinet yesterday, and I think it fair to say that it will be settled without any very great delay. opportunity of discussing the question before a final decision is arrived at?

Has tbe Prime Minister any report to make as to what has been done, or is being done? was a considered reply to the question referred to at the time it was made. I have not the answer I then gave before me now, but I think I said there were six of our line of shipping on coastal work, and that -I had given instructions Austral liners was to pick up coastal cargo as soon as she touched Australia. also said that I would cable, with a view to obtaining information as to the price of tonnage which could be made available for coastal work, and submit it to the House. I have received a reply to the effect that the tonnage offered is not and it is, in my opinion, very dear. I will submit the matter to the House, and honourable members can express their own opinions about it. I have been reminded by my staff that since I made this promise on the 15th May, 78,000 tons of coastal cargo has been carried by the Commonwealth House with the other information as soon as I can get it from the official papers. Later : minutes ago that I had cabled inquiries regarding furthe r ships.

Some months ago I made a suggestion to the British Government that they should lend us, out of the I m perial purchase, a certain quantity of wheat, which we should return out or the new season's crop.

Many of them served Australia well during the war, and the staff includes to-day a number of returned soldiers. W ill the Minister suggest to the Repatriation Department that persons going upon the land should be able to purchase their saddlery and harness from the Commonwealth Factory, the output of which ought to be at least as cheap as any that can be obtained elsewhere, and probably much cheaper. I ask the Prime Sir GRANVILLERYRIE The Defence Department is sympathetic towards the factory and the continuance in employment of the returned soldier employees. From personal experience, I know that the material turned out by the factory for use in the field was very good indeed, and I am very anxious that men should-not be discharged. I succeeded a I cannot, on the spur few days ago in inducing the Postal Department to place with the Commonwealth Factory an order for the manufacture of a considerable number of mail-bags, but the bags did not provide much work for men. It was mostly work for girls. However, the Postal Department have in In view timated that they may possibly have a number of leather bags of a new design made at the Harness Factory, and I have asked the Repatriation Department to endeavour to induce all returned soldiers to have any harness, & c , they require made at this factory, where they can be supplied as cheaply as they can be outside.

W ill tlie Minister prepare for public information a ^summary .of the; position a-rid policy of the Italian Government and tlie Australian Government in calling up and deporting Italian reservists, and showing what action was taken thereon in Australia for the calling up of the military reservists for service in Italy? 4. Was the actio'n taken by the Italian and the Commonwealth Government legal under the circumstances T I then furnished replies to Nos. 1, 2, and 4, and promised to obtain particulars in regard to No. 3. I now lay on the Table of the House a statement regarding the repatriation of Italian reservistsThe history of the repatriation of Italian reservists and conscripts to Italy, briefly outlined, is as follows :In the latter half of 1915 inquiries were made of the Defence Department by Italian subjects and others as to the position of Italian nationals residing in the Commonwealth in 'regard to .enlistment in the Australian I m perial Force. asked to endeavour to obtain the consent of the Government to the voluntary enlistment of his compatriots in the Australian Imperial Force, as it was also represented to the Defence Department that the presence in Australia of so many persons of Italian nationality who had not enlisted was having a prejudicial effect on recruiting. Consent to the enlistment in the Australian Imperial Force of Italians was, however, refused. In May, 1916, it was decided to make representations to the British authorities requesting that the Italian Government be approached and advised of the detrimental effect on recruiting of the non-enlistment of Italian subjects, with a view to permission being granted for their enlistment in the Australian Imperial Force. The Italian Government replied, on the 24th July, 1916, regretting that they could not modify the decision already conveyed through the Royal Italian Consul. On the 19th September, 1916, and again on the 28th February, 1917, as the position bod in no way been relieved, renewed representations-which , however, proved unsuccessfulwere made to the Italian Government, through tlie Imperial authorities, asking whether, in view of the fact that since last communicated with on the subject, Italy had declared war on Germany, the necessary permission might be given. On the 13th June, 1917, the Secretary of On t h e 12th M a y State for the Colonies advised by cable that the Italian Government had inquired whether asked t h e f o l l o w in g questions: Italians in Australia recalled to the colours, who found difficulty in returning home in Italian or neutral vessels, would be allowed to travel to Europe on Australian vessels carrying troops or merchandise. Later cable3 from the Secretary of State advised that, if the Commonwealth Government could arrange for Italian reservists to be conveyed to the United Kingdom in batches not exceeding 700, their onward conveyance to Italv. through France, would be arranged by the War Office. The Commonwealth Government cabled to the Secretary of State on 25th Jul v. 1917, notifving them concurrence in , and acceptance of, the arrangements made, and added that it was presumed that the Royal Italian Consul would be instructed to approach the Defence Department in order to arrange details. In formation was also received nt this time that the Italian Government had been informed that the transport of these reservists from Australia was subject to the condition that the Italian Consular authorities vouched the bona fides of the reservists. On the 5th November, 1917. the Royal Italian Consul called on the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), and stated he had received authorization from his Government to arrange with the Commonwealth Government for the repatriation of Italian reservists and conscripts residing in Australia., ancl. after having ascertained the legal position of the Commonwealth Government, the Minister placed the machinery of the Defence Department at the disposal of the Royal Italian Consul for this purpose. In effect, the Commonwealth Government merely acted as the agent for the Italian Government, at the request of that Government, and in f u l l accordance with international law. The Royal Italian Consul was honourable member for M e l b o u r n e ( D r .

72,Mr Wise,,31,Destitu Te Allowance
73,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [3.55],"of the rich to meet their obligations to the poor. It is a mere palliative. We have our Old-age Pensions Act, which is one of the noblest Actsi n the world; but the pension rate must be increased, and I hope that when the time comes it will be increased to £ 1 per week, name I forget-ou t of 1,000 children if not more. The old-age pension gives independence, to a certain extent, to the old people in our midst, and I hope to see the time when the stigma of charity will no longer attach to it . I think I may speak of the late 'Treasurer as a gentleman who deserted his country in the hour of need. H i m I once applied to for an old-age pension, for two reasons: One-was that the people throughout the length and breadth of this land might see that there was no.disgrace in accepting an old-age pension, and the other was to draw attention to the contrast between the position of the late Chief'Justice of Australia, who applied for and obtained an old-age pension of £5 a day. The invalid pension also helps, to a great extent, to prevent destitution, and, in addition, we have our hospitals and our benevolent asylums; but, nevertheless, there are persons whom no agency relieves. A t one time they had in Victoria what was known as a compassionate allowance: but the Treasurer of this State, one of the meanest men who ever held a position so high, swept it away, thus causing immense distress, as every Victorian politician knows. provided for by the Government of Sir Alexander Peacock, and was continued by subsequent Administrations, until removed by the cheeseparing policy of the present Treasurer. Prevention is better than cure. If any one will look at the tabulated list of deaths, he will see that want and destitution, by lowering the fighting powers, make men and women more inclined to disease than they otherwise would be. are called out to a conflagration, they do not first busy themselves with seeking the cause of it . Shouldi t seem to be a case of arson, they do not look first for the person who has perpetrated that crime. Their business is to play water immediately on tbe flaming and inflammable material, and to do all they can to put out the fire. I recognise that the adoption of my proposal will not remove destitution, but it will be a palliative, and quite as useful a palliative as those that I have mentioned. When I visited the splendidly-managed Department for Neglected Children which they have in South Australia, I was shown an excerpt from a newspaper published in Great Britain, in which it was stated that in two towns there-West Gorton and another whose born, 800 died within the first year. To a medical man like myself those figures reveal a terrible state of affairs. But in the institution to which I have referred, a child has a better chance of reaching adult age than has the average child of well-to-do parents. No words of mine can sufficiently express my appreciation of that Department, and I regret that the Government of that State has not more money to place at the disposal of this most deserving charity. When a person sees a bath overflowing, he w ill, before taking a mop to wipe up the overflow, tur n off the tap; but should a child be in the bath and in danger of drowning, he will first rescue the child. Tliere are those who say that many persons who are destitute will not own to being so, but my experience in London and in other large cities, including Melbourne and Sydney, is that the splendid independence of the human often disappears before the pangs of hunger. I have never felt hungry, but I have been thirsty, and I do not know what I should do, supposing hunger to be as bad as thirst, were I to feel hungry and to That allowance was first have those dependent on me also hungry. Charity organizations devote a good deal of their time to the detection of imposition, and I do not blame them; but they can find no faul t if the Government does what I suggest. I know that my proposal is a startling one, but that may be said of every new idea. A few years ago wireless telegraphy and aviation would have been incredible, but the advance of science has made them common-place. When the -fire-fighters No one with a Christian heart, no humane follower of Mahomet or Buddha, and no member of that old religion upon which Christianity is based, Judaism, w ill deny that in helping those who are in want we do God's best work. I believe that God gave us brains to help one another, and is it not an argument against the so-called superiority of man to the other animals that human beings are lef t in want by their kind. If we look through the eyes of scientific men, we must, I think, acknowledge that there are three races of intelligent beings on this earth, the humans, the ants, and the bees. Never in the nest of the ant or in the hive of the bee do the workers or the young suffer privations, so long as the necessaries of life obtain there. so much for the humans. Mankind, is gifted with brains superior, we are told, to those of any other form of life, but how callous we often are towards the poor, making no provision against privation and want, even when our harvests are overflowing. As to the prohibitionists, I ask them if there is not positive destitution among the followers of Buddha and among the Mohametans, all of whom are absolute abstainers. claim the assistance of the prohibitionists. Every man who calls himself a philanthropist must be in sympathy with me in this matter. There are those who repeat the saying, "" The poor you have always with you""; but to them. I say, as I have said on many a platform, that they pay but small regard to the Creator if they do not allow the brains of humanity to be used to build up a civilization under which no man, woman, or little child will ever go hungry to bed. I have a quotation to make from a paper that has been of great use to me. It is addressed to moralists. it I remind honourable members of the saying of Richard Baxter, who once seeing a man in a cart on his way to execution said, "" There, but for the grace of God, goes Richard Baxter."" those who, in the pride of their hearts, look down upon others not so well placed, I say that to all temptation may come.

In this connection I desire to thank the Salvation But we cannot say Army for what they have done. I have seen their good work in many countries, and in the slums of such cities as London, Glasgow,' Dublin, Belfast, and Newcastle-on-Tyne, and I have been told by our soldiers that kindness, courtesy, and help were always given by the Salvation Army officers to those who appealed to them, either at 'he front or in the cities. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to my motion. I recognise That being so, I that it may present difficulties, but if it is fairly considered I shall be glad, and I shall welcome the assistance of the Government and of every honourable member. [4.14] I have very much pleasure in seconding the motion, though I shall not occupy much time in supporting it, because, in common, I am sure, with honourable members generally, I wish to know what the Treasurer proposes to do in regard to it. I cannot imagine any honourable member being against the proposal, which should commend itself to the Before reading House and to the country. When we amend the old-age and invalid pensions legislation, there are many amendments which should be made. I should like the rate of pension to be increased to So to £1 per week, and I should like to know what has been the effect of increasing the. pension rate from 12s. 6d. to 15s. per week?

We claim to be, from a democratic point of view, the most forward of any country.

[102] should be many more democratic countries. During the last five years, much of our experience has been the very antithesis of democratic government, but in regard to legislation of a sympathetic character we claim to be an advanced country; and it is a stigma on the Commonwealth that there are in Australia today hundreds of little children who, when they lie down at night to rest, do not know where. they are to get their breakfast in the morning. The honorcan the total able member for Barrier( Mr Considine) referred to children in Sydney whom he had seen searching garbage tins for a crust. but men. But I understood the thing is a disgrace, and the cause should be removed as soon as possible. We have in this motion a means for removing the stigma, and it has my hearty endorsement. We should stand for the principle that no deserving man or woman, and no child who requires food, should be allowed to go unsatisfied. I shall not discuss this question further, since I understand that the debate must close at 4.30 p.m., and I wish to give the Acting Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) an opportunity to express the views of the Government on the subject. I hope he will be able to regard this motion from a sympathetic point of view. The lives of thp future men and women of Australia It are at stake; and an ex-Victorian Treasurer once declared that the life of every child born into the country was worth £300 a year. Seddon said the same thing. know how that estimate was arrived at, but it is a very low one. A child born into this country is worth far more than I am £300 a year. The life of every child is of immense importance to the nation. By giving effect to the principle of this motion we shall do something in the direction of W ill the honourable memprolonging the l if e of every child in Australia, guard it from being stinted in its infancy, and so lead to better citizenship. tliat I am unable to support the motion, but I congratulate the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), because I",33,Destitu Te Allowance

As a member of the Children's Protection Society, I found that over 75 per cent, of the cases of want brought under our notice were the result of drink. I find, too, that some men, by their manner of life, are simply living up to the old-age pensions and Old Men's Homes stage. I once said to a worthy workman in my employ upon his return, after a three"" weeks' bout, "" My friend, flesh and blood will not stand this. What is tlie end to be?"" His reply was, "" O h , well, you know, Mr Prowse, there is the old age pension and also the Old Men's Depot."" If we could so regulate matters in this Commonwealth as to save men from themselves it would be well. Where there were real cases of necessity my heart would go out to help them without question, but when we find such stumbling blocks in the way of men-whe n we see them so lose their own self-respect that they would fall back on a measure of this kind, what are we to do? We are dealing, not with the slums of London, but with Australia, where every able-bodied iman should be able to earn his bread and <dcthes. This motion would apply to all such persons. That being so, while my sympathy goes out to the women and children, it seems to me that the motion would need to be vitally amended before I oould conscientiously vote for it . As I understand that the time has almost arrived when the debate must be adjourned, I ask leave to continue my remarks on a future date. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Debate resumed from 29th A p r i l (vide DINE1.

It is the longest industrial dispute of which I have any knowledge, and I do not think it can be denied that-those concerned in it , who have to undergo, as they have done during the last fifteen months, all the consequent privations, are carrying it on only for one reason, namely, that it is absolutely necessary that the conditions of the industry should be improved. They have endeavoured, through both State and Federal channels, to get the matter before a tribunal clothed with f u l l powers to sift the whqle of the claims and give a decision. Only recently, since the question was last discussed in the House, an effort was made by the State Government of New South Wales. Judge Edmunds was appointed to make the in quiry, and a conference was convened of representatives of both parties in order to sec if some settlement could not be arrived nt. Judge Edmunds, who realized the magnitude of"" the dispute, and the sufferings that arc being caused, and also the necessity, in the interests of the country, for a settlement at the earliest possible moment, suggested to the parties in a tactful way that they might consent to agree to whatever wa3 the decision of the conference.

The representatives of the employers also agreed to accept any suggestions that might come from the conference, and, after there had been a discussion, in -which both sides participated, Judge Edmunds made a suggestion tliat was really in the nature of a compromise. gested were seveu hours for the day shift, and six and a half hours ou other'shifts, but the representatives of the BrokenH i l i companies repudiated that idea. causes one to draw the inference that had the suggestion been favorable to the companies, they would have accepted it , but because it was not favorable, they refused it . Surely the time has arrived when something should be done, if only in the in terests of the companies themselves. The women and the children of the community are suffering more than the men directly engaged in the dispute, and it is absurd to suppose that this strike would be continued if they did not think their claims absolutely essential. The most vital point in the claims is that there should be some tribunal to inquire as to the effects on the men of their working in these deep metalliferous mines. that if there were such an inquiry, it would be found that the men are justified in asking for six hours a day. I speak as one with some knowledge of mining, and I have known men leave coal mining in perfect health to take up mining at BrokenH ill , only to find, after some years there, that they were suffering from lung disease, the effect of lead poisoning. The same results are found in all deep metalliferous mines; and the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) when he submitted this motion, adduced ample medical evidence to support what I am saying now. Can we expect these men to work for forty-eight hours a week under such conditions, when they know how injurious it is to their health ? Can we expect their women folk to encourage them to work for that length of time? [102]2 In the interests of the country, it is the duty of this Parliament to intervene. Of course, some may ask why the men do not go to the Arbitration Court; but, in my That, I opinion, the Arbitration Court, would not touch the health phase of the question. I have had considerable experience in connection with Arbitration Courts, and I know that these Courts do not consider the question of the health of the employees. I feel confident that the Arbitration Court would not consider how much money was being made by way of dividends, or who received it , but.would confine itself to hours I believe the hours sugof labour, wages, and so forth . ""What the motion desires is that a Royal Commission shall be appointed, with power to investigate the diseases that affect the miners, This and the causes of those diseases; and this, as I say, no Arbitratio n Court would do. As a matter of fact, it is almost impossible to get a case before an Arbitration Court to-day, and, as one' who has advocated arbitration for a lifetime, I .am beginning to doubt whether it is going to prove effective in Australia. I have noticed constantly since the war that the various companies have placed large sums to reserves and other special funds, and are reconstructing and in creasing their share capital. This share capital, of course, is largely fictitious, because it should have been declared as profits; but this might have been found liable to the war-time profits tax. However, the money is there, and similar conditions apply to companies generally. I venture to say The result of all this is that if cases are taken to the Arbitration Court, the men will be confronted with the fact that large capital has been sunk in the enterprises, and on that basis the award w ill be made. I can see nothing but disaster for arbitration in the way things are going now, and it would be wise for the Commonwealth Parliament to institute an in vestigation at the present moment as to the number of companies which have in creased their capital, as to whether the new shares are bogus or otherwise, and. in regard to the other point to which.' I have referred. The wealthy, and those who control certain industries in this country, are, it seems to me, so protecting themselves that they are able to carry on outside the law. I db> not know how this is done, and I cannot prove that it is done; but that the companies do seem able to evade the law is self-evident. Under the circumstances, if we desire to maintain the confidence of the men in arbitration, all these matters should be investigated. could save the lives of the children. that the Arbitration Court could not save the children who suffer from this in herited disease, and, therefore, the motion should be accepted by the House. The State Government has failed to effect a settlement, and the dispute goes on with disaster to the country generally, for it is not only those who are directly engaged in it that suffer. This dispute seems to be a matter of the purse against the stomach, and the companies, apparently, think they are justified in squeezing the workmen for all they are worth. These companies at BrokenH ill have made bigger dividends than any other t companies in Australia, and the accumulated profits are something like £24,000,000. The making of large profits continues, and I suppose that during the war they made even more than previously. Surely, if that is so, the conditions of the industry w ill bear investigation, and can afford to give healthy conditions to those who are engaged in it? The men, and those dependent on them, are prepared to continue this fight, although, as a matter of fact, their wives and families are dependent on the charity of the public for proper clothing. I am pleased to say that the organization with which I am connected has been contributing to the assistance of the men and their families during the whole of the fifteen months, and they are not doing this simply because they like to .give money away; they contribute because they know they are assisting in a fight foT humanity, in the interests of the working people. How long are we going to allow the present state of things to continue ? Is its continuance in the best interests of the country? The men have made fair offers for the purpose of arriving at a settlement, and' their whole attitude shows that they believe themselves to be thoroughly in the right. All that is desired is a Royal Commission, with ,power to make a thorough and comprehensive investigation, and I dare say, though, of course, I am not speaking for them, that the men would be prepared to accept the decision of such a Commission, and to return to work in the meantime on the six-hour basis. I admit that the time has arrived when this Parliament should do something. We are not justified in sitting idly by, and sheltering ourselves behind the plea that this is a State matter. It is quite true The BrokenH ill mining industry is as near Inter-State as any industry could be. A f t e r all, South Australia and Victoria derive much benefit from this industry, but in South Australia, and also at Cockle Creek, and, I understand, in Tasmania, works are closed down in consequence of the dispute, and hundreds of men thrown out of employment. As a matter of fact, the employees themselves are an Inter-State body, for they are associated with the Coal and Shale Miners Federation, which extends over almost all tbe States. From both these points of view, the dispute is a Commonwealth matter, and Ave, as the National Parliament, have a perfect right to intervene. As I say, all we are asked to do is to appoint a tribunal, with power to investigate the grievances, and I dare say that any decision arrived at in this way would be accepted. From all I have read and know of the matter, I feel confident that, on the medical testimony, a six hours day would be granted. There seems to me no justifiable reason for asking men to work for forty or forty-eight hours if thirty-six hours a week are ample to give a return on the capital. It has been proved beyond doubt that with a six hours day there would be ample return on the capital invested. That ought to be considered a f a i r thing. The companies have no right to endeavour to extract the last shilling out of the employees. I admit that the request for a six-hour day is to apply to a week of only five days. I am one who has always believed that five days is sufficient for any man to work underground. When I was working in the coal mines I held that view, and I endeavoured to have Saturday work abolished. What the men at BrokenH ill are asking for is only fair. Some honourable members may think that men ought to work for six days, but I hold that five days of six hours each is a long enough week for any man to work in the bowels of the earth, where he has to contend with bad air and other conditions which are in -",35,Destitu Te Allowance

96,Mr Charlton,"jurioug to health. The returns of earnings and dividends prove that, working five days per week, the miners can produce enough wealth to pay to the companies a fair return on the capital invested. will favourably consider this motion. The inquiry that is asked for -would do no harm; on the contrary, it would do a lot of good. It would set the wheels of industry in motion, and would give relief to thousands .of persons in different parts of the Commonwealth who have been thrown out of employment, although they are not direct participants in the dispute. At Cockle Creek between 700 and 900 men are out of work, although they are not parties to the dispute. By bringing about a resumption of work in this industry we should do much to absorb the unemployed. We ought not to advocate increased production to the jeopardy of the health of those employed in producing. Therefore, if we can get the miners of BrokenH ill back to work upon fair and reasonable conditions which will protect their health, the community as a whole will be the gainer. After all, what this country requires is a healthy and virile race, and we cannot have that unless the conditions of employment in the various industries are made such as to conduce to good health. The inquiry which is asked for is in the interests not only of the employees, but of the country as a whole, and I hope that it will be granted. [4.50J -The honourable member who has just resumed his seat is quite correct in saying that this strike has achieved a record in point of duration, but I remind the honourable member it is absolutely unjustifiable. That is the opinion of the people of Australia, and of a very large percentage of the miners of Broken Hill. For all practical purposes BrokenH ill is a South Australian town, and, therefore, the people of that State know from the mouths of .the miners themselves a good deal about the conditions there. There are not, possibly in any part of the world, companies whose treatment of their employees will bear comparison with the treatment meted out by the companies to the miners at Broken Hill. honourable members opposite to scoff, but some of them know nothing about the question, which has been placed before the House in a shockingly one-sided fashion. I hope that the Government side. but I wish to deal with both sides. It is and has been for the last thirty years a common occurrence that when strikes occur in BrokenH ill the best men leave the town on the following day, and seek employment in South Australia. Being good men, they easily obtain work and they remain in South Australia until the strike is settled. Why do they leave BrokenH ill so hurriedly? Simply because their only alternative is to remain there idle and speechless; they would not be allowed to tell the truth. Nobody knows that better than does the honorsidine). ' I know those men, and I have seen scores of them at work in South Australia during the currency of this strike. They get employment there, and are appreciated as good workmen. This strike is not the fault of the rank and file miners; it was caused by the officials and a relatively -small section of the miners. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) referred to the sufferings incidental to mining operations, and to the health of the children at Broken Hill. In that regard most unjustifiable and exaggerated statements have been made, as has been proved by the severe resentment expressed by the Broken Hill Municipal Council. 'That council is a body which would not be likely to be prejudiced against the miners, or to do anything detrimental to the health of citizens and their children. But the council unanimously stated that the statements that had been made were a slander, and that, in respect of health, the children of Broken Hill were a fair sample of the children in any, big Australian town. That is the opinion of a Labour council at Broken Hill. council there. cording to the honourable member's view of Labour; but the ordinary working men It is all very well for in Broken Hill do not endorse the honourable member's views by a long way.

As a matter of fact, the Federal arbitration award, under whicli work had been satisfactorily carried on for three years, had still a month to run when the A.M.A. issued a manifesto announcing that it was out on strike for the f u l l demands in a new log it had framed. This log claimed(a) £1 per shift for a l l men and boys alike, whether working underground or on the surface; (6) 3ix-hour shifts on surface and underW e w o u l d not have ground worked only on 5 days per week; We could The honourable member for H u n t e r was corrected on t h a t p o in t .

The companies, however, offered to give every facility to enable the A.M.A. to submit its case to the Federal or State Arbitration Court, and to make any increases awarded retrospective to 10th June, 1919, the date the old award expired. The member for the Barrier did not explain R o y a l Commission. I think the that all the suffering by men, women, and children in BrokenH ill during the last twelve for Hunter( Mr months has been caused by the A.M.A. refusing to submit these claims to any form of arbitration. Several conferences were held witli the leaders of the A.M.A., and the companies made substantial concessions. From first to last the A.M.A. gave no indication of receding from any of its demands, some of which the men themselves admit were utterly impracticable. In his desire to create an impression, Mr. Considine quoted the total amount of dividends paid by the mining companies in the past. This money, however, has not been banked as a fund out of which future wages might be paid. It has been distributed among A "" cooked "" statethe thousands of shareholders in the mines, many of whom are women and wage-earners who have been t h r if t y enough to save a little come out of future production. References to The the dividends paid in the past arc utterly futile. While the companies have never contended that they were unable to pay increased wages, they know that if the A.M.A. demands were granted, involving only 21 hours' work underground for miners, none of the mines could any longer be worked as ordinary business undertakings. Reference was made by Mr Considine to the BrokenH ill companies' investments in other companies. The whole of the mines are owned by public companies, which, under the Companies Act, publish half-yearly or yearly complete statements of their profits and their",39,Destitu Te Allowance

These balance-sheets, of course, carry the certificate of public auditors, whose professional position is accepted by shareholders, business people, and the Taxation Department, as a guarantee of correctness of the information given. In this respect the BrokenH ill companies are in the same position as all other public companies, or the Commonwealth Bank; but to a suspicious mind like Mr Considine's any business practice established on the world's accumulated experience is all wrong. It is true that the BrokenH j l l companies have invested Jarge sums of money in other companies, viz., BrokenH ill Associated Smelters, at Port Pirie, and Electrolytic Zinc Company, at Risdon, Tasmania, both of which are essential to protect the silver-lead-zinc mines of Broken Hill. Without the smelters at Port Pirie to convert the concentrates produced at tbe mines into market metal, there would have been no work at BrokenH ill during the war. Concentrates were unsaleable. the policy of making the British Empire self-contained orable member does not w a n t it to be self-contained. of it . The honourable member knows t h a t , surely. orable member is t a l k in g nonsense. repeatI n accordance with the policy of making the British Empire self-contained in regard to metal supplies, the Electrolytic Company has been established, and the smelters extended, with the result that the prospects of being able to give continuous work to 10,000 men at BrokenH ill and Port Pirie are greatly improved, and employment provided for up to 1,500 at Bisdon. The companies' investments in these allied companies require no other justification. With reference to the health question, Mr Considine was not fair or candid. He did not appear to think it worthwhile to explain to the House that the companies are just as anxious as the men to learn the facts of the position. He might have explained that the companies joined with the A.M.A. in making representations to the New .South Wales Government to appoint a Commission of experts to inquire into the whole subject. The New South Wales 'Government delayed its decision, and the companies then offered to the A.M.A. and other employees to find a l l the money necessary to enable a joint medical committee, half of its members to be appointed by the employees and half by the companies, to investigate fully the effect of working conditions on the health of the employees. ments for this committee were under consideration when the New South Wales Board of Trade inquiry again became a possibility. This purely official inquiry was preferred to the private committee previously arranged for. The Board of Trade estimated that its inquiry would run into at least £15,500, and the hitc New South Wales Government demurred at the expense. A t the suggestion, however, of Mr A. C. Willis, secretary of the Coal and Shale Employees' Federation, with which the A.M.A. is affiliated, the companies agreed to bear half the cost, despite the fact that the proposed inquiry is to cover Cobar, Ardlethan, and other fields besides Broken Hill. That Commission commenced its investigations at BrokenH ill in January last, and during it3 three and a half months' work has dealt with about 1,700 men, involving 5,000 examinations, made up of X-ray, 1,300; medical, 950; industrial histories, .1,150; and hookworm, 1,600. The Commission is comprised of Dr. H . G. Chapman, Professor of PharmaI n accordance with cology in tbe Sydney University; Dr. W. A. Edwards, of Macquarie-street, Sydney, roentgenologist; Dr. W. Sawyer, senior State Director of the International Health BoardH e a r , hear ! of the United, States of America (Rockfeller The honFoundation) ; Dr. S. A. Smith, of Macquarie Street, clinician and consultant; and Dr. Halcro Wardlaw, bio-chemist. On the staff of the Commission are Dr. John McKee, D r . The Germansg o t most Rosenthal, Dr. Rushton-Smith, Dr. W. T. Nelson, Dr. Packham, Dr. Pfeifler, and Dr. Waddell, as well as microscopists, laboratory attendants, X-ray photographers, registrar, The honclerks, &c. The Commission has the most up to-date X-ray outfit in Australia, and there am not. is every reason to believe that its investigation will be more searching and complete than L e t me any similar inquiry previously carried out in any part of the world. The intention is to examine all the employees, and the companies w ill review conditions at BrokenH ill in the light of the Commission's report. Unfortunately the Commission cannot complete its task until tbe mines resume operations, as the companies and the men desire the Commission to examine the actual working conditions. Thus we have the curious position of the A.M.A. leaders complaining of the health conditions, and yet making it impossible for the Commission to finish its work. Many improvements have been made in recent years in the methods of working the mines, which are equipped with the most modern appliances for protecting their employees' health. The companies w ill gladly take any further steps towards this end that the Commission's report may indicate. Meantime, the companies have offered to co-operate with their employees in establishing a sickness fund, and are prepared to formulate a scheme on tlie lines contemplated \ by the New South Wales Act, under which contributions by the employers and employees may be subsidized by the State. This would, of course, be in addition to the statutory obligations of the Workers' Compensation Act.

130,Mr Richardfoster,"brought by the companies' employees, decided to review wages and conditions generally. An offer of increased wages and reduced hours was made to all. A comparison between the rates earned by members of the A.M.A. before this strike, and what the companies have now offered, should show whether the A.M.A. has taken up a reasonable attitude. The claim of the A.M.A. in rospeet to wages was £1 a shift for man or boy above or below ground (based on 44 hours). Before the dispute the minimum rate for a miner on wages was 14s. Od. This has now been increased to ISs. for those on day shift, and to 10s. Od. for those on afternoon or night shift. The minimum wage for contractors underground was 13s. I d . This has been raised to lGs. 4d. for the day shift, and 18s. for the afternoon shift. Miners on contract previously earned an averago of 21s. 5d. a shift, and, in view of the above increases, there w i ll now be a proportionate advance in the earnings of contractors. The claim for the abolition of the night shift was met by the companies agreeing to abolish it so far as the stoping and breaking of ore was concerned, but continuing it for necessary work. The offer of the companies in this regard must, be viewed as a substantial compliance with the request of the men. I ask honourable members to use their own judgment in the light of these figures, and say whether this is not about as handsome an offer as has ever been made in connection with any industrial dispute. The statement proceedsThe demand for a six-hours day, bank to hank, five days a week, could not be granted. Previously the hours were 44 underground and 48 on the surface. The companies offered to underground workers a 44-hours week on day shift, and 40 hours on afternoon and night shift. A t the same time it was pointed out to the men that the Arbitration Court was making an exhaustive inquiry into the question of hours, and the promise was made that, should a further reduction be granted to other unions, the concession would be extended as far as possible to the whole of the employees of the companies at BrokenH ill . In regard to abolition of contract for the production of ore the companies could not see their way to make any compromise on this system whicli is fair to both sides, and meets with tlie approval of many of the men. The companies, however, agreed that a joint committee, comprising managers and union representatives, should be appointed to see what improvements could be devised in the existing system. In addition to the above concessions, the Companies agreed to periodically adjust rates of pay in accordance with official cost of living figures, and to finance a co-operative store, to reduce the ruling high prices. They also offered a scheme whereby every employee whose attendance reached a prescribed standard would be granted a fortnight's holiday on f u l l pay each year. All the otlier unions at BrokenH ill have gone to arbitration, and their members, num boring a majorit3' of the companies' employees, are not participating in the strike. revision, because the engineers have joined the miners since it was written, a couple of months ago. written a couple of mon'ths ago. The statement proceedsAmicable conferences have been held w it h them, and no difficulty is anticipated in mutually satisfactory agreements being arranged, outstanding points being left to the Arbitration Court. The companies' offer to these' unions was to reduce hours for surface workers from 48 to 46, and in continuous processes to 44 per week. Compared with pre-strike rates, tlie basic wage will be increased from 12s. to 15s. per day, and employees w ill receive 48 hours' pay for 46 hours or 44 hours' work respectively. Carpenters, fitters, :urners, boilermakers, & c , will receive 18s. 6d. per day, as against 13s. per day prior to the strike, and main shaft engine-drivers go up from 16s. 6d. to 22s. On day shift, and 24s. on night and afternoon shifts. The companies recognise that, in the past, rising cost of living has been imposed on employees for some time before the statistician's index figures were available, on which to base an increase of wages. To meet this position the companies have taken the latest available figures, and made a generous addition to them to justify the new basic wage of 15s. per day. The companies have endeavoured to grant a wage ahead of rising cost of living instead of having the wage rate dragging behind cost of living. These now rates w ill be retrospective to 1st January last, and w i ll be reviewed at tbe end of the year. In the view of Mr Considine and the A.M.A. strike leaders, however, the concessions offered amount to nothing, although they w ill probably involve the companies in increased wages of over £500,000 per year. In addition, all mining stores and machinery have greatly increased in price, but as the reduction of hours offered w ill , according to past experience, inevitably reduce the production of the mines, it is impossible to estimate the f u l l effect of the new conditions. Mr Considine could find only abuse for the companies which have done these things to bring about a resumption of work, and only admiration for the union which has done absolutely nothing in that direction. Ho applauds the actions of a small body of men who have scorned the principle of arbitration that their own party was instrumental in having embodied in the law of the land, and who have, instead, preferred to take the course of direct action, thereby bringing privation and misery to a thriving city of 30,000 inhabitants solely dependent on'the mining industry of BrokenH ill , as well as inflicting hardship upon a further 70,000 people directly and indirectly dependent on the industry.",41,Foster I Am Money For Investment Future Wages Must

220,Sir Joseph Cook,"The honorableI do not think that we are entitled to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the case of men who refuse absolutely to go to the Court in the setting up of which they had more to do than any other section of the community. From time to time in this House and in the State Parliaments these Arbitration Courts have been adjusted and re-arranged almost out of recognition. The persons chiefly responsible for all these adjustments and rearrangements have been the representatives of these men in the various Houses of Legislature. There is no getting away from that fact, and, therefore, these men and their representatives should not ask us to deliberately set aside the Courts which they have themselves shaped. able gentleman said ""shaken."" ""shaped."" which is responsible for the present Arbitration Court is the work in this House of Labour Governments. No one who has been here for any time will deny that statement. On the other side of this chamber some of us have been the critics of that legislation. We have said that it was not likely to work, but our advice was ignored. All my life I have contended for the local settlement of local disputes, and there will never be industrial peace in this community until we get back to that fundamental principle. A local dispute arises out of some local peculiarity, and should be followed up swiftly, and settled at the place where it occurs by some facile pay the wages without investigation ? mode of inquiry. affecting industry as a whole which must be left to other tribunals to review. Such questions as rates of wages and hours of labour, which affect industry as a whole, require to be dealt with perhaps at greater length and by other than local tribunals, but I should say that 99 out of every 100 disputes occurring on mining fields arise because of some local peculiarity or circumstance, and should be dealt with as I have suggested. What the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) is asking us to do is to set up a Court of Inquiry to sit on the Commonwealth Arbitration Court-for that is what his motion means. He wants the cost of metals inquired into, and also the profits made in the industry, the wages paid, the hours of labour, and the prices of The honourable gentleman will find that the products. that he asks for in his motion. too, I have no doubt. May I suggest that all these matters-costs , profits, wages, hours, and prices-al l come within the purview of the Arbitration Courts, ami are investigated almost every day in those Courts, and necessarily so, because they are correlated; it is impossible, for instance, to settle the question of costs without reference to prices, profits, wages, and hours of labour ? The question of costs involves the consideration of all these other questions. f u l l well that the companies' representatives have on every occasion refused to permit any investigation of these matters. under our arbitration laws the Judge of I mean that the legislation the Arbitration Court has the right to require the production of books, to have them examined by experts, and to satisfy himself as to the whole of the conditions under which any industry is carried oru was last before the Arbitration Court, the representatives of the companies said that they did not question the fact that they were able to pay the wages, and, consequently, no investigation was made.

233,Mr Considine,"The Prime Ministerwhat th© Prime Minister, Mr Courtney, or anybody else has to do with the matter. I ani speaking of a law which permits the Judge of the Arbitration Court to make an investigation whenever, in his opinion, it is necessary to do so. The honourable member asks for a Royal Commission to sit on the Arbitration Court, and all the machinery set up from time to time chiefly through the instrumentality of the section of the community which, he tells us, he specially represents. There is a further objection to this motion, and it is that it is an attempt to interfere with a State industry. It refers to a State industry. It is of no use to say one thing and mean another, and in my judgment we have no legal right to inquire into this industry in the way What right have we to inquire into the health conditions, for instance, under which a State industry is carried on? has the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to inquire into the industry? Sir JOSEP H COOK -Surely such an inquiry is a State function. In this Parliament we have nothing to do with the health of the community as such except in the most incidental and indirect way. All these matters are reserved under the Constitution to the State authorities. We do a good many things which perhaps we ought not to do, and the State authorities do not like us to meddle with their concerns. Here we have a proposal to meddle with one of the vital industries of a State over which the authorities of the State have absolute and unqualified jurisdiction. I think it would be wrong for us to do so. .We have no constitutional right to do so. the Federal Arbitration Court deal with rier that, in the circumstances, he had the matter? ing of arbitration, b u t of conducting an member would be serious. investigation into the health conditions of a State industry. has an Inter-State effect question of the ultimate consequence, but ferred will give these men at BrokenH ill of the cold, hard lines of the Constitua measure of justice? Is that what the tion, which sketch for us a line of dehonorable member calls joking? markation, and we are told to keep on one side of it , while the States are told man evidently cannot understand his own to keep on the other side. On the States' humour. side of this line is the mining industry at BrokenH ill , which is carried on in the State of New South Wales. Leaving that and coming to another point, I suggest to the honourable member 'for Barrier that he should not persevere with his motion at the present time, for a reason which I dare say he knows, and that is that I understand that the New South Wales Ministerf o r Mines at the present time is a member of a Labour Government. I ' refer to Mr George Cann, an old-time and .very much respected member of this House. He went to the State Parliament, and has done very much better for himself there, and I say, good luck to him . He is now in office as a member of the Government of the State of New South Wales. If any man has sympathy with the conditions under which miners have to work, that the honourable member proposes. man is Mr George Cann. I remind the honourable member that there is also in the New South Wales Government Mr. John Estell, a miner from the Newcastle jurisdiction district, a much-respected and levelheaded man. Surely th„s e gentlemen can be trusted to take charge of this matter, and see that the fullest measure of justice is done to the miners of BrokenH ill . shouldering our responsibilities on to some one else. Sir JOSEPH COOK I emphatically deny that they are our responsibilities. They are primarily the responsibilities of the men in charge of affairs in the State in which this industry is carried on, and I understand that at the present moment those men are taking steps to discharge their responsibilities in this regard. I understand that they are going to inquire into this matter by means of a compulsory conference or some such method, and I suggest to the honourable member for Barbetter leave the matter alone. more serious in my life.

I have to reply to the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) and other honourable members who have seen fit to oppose my motion. Dealing first with its last opponent, let me say that the Minister for the Navy, after referring to the disadvantages of the Arbitratio n Court, and to the fact that it is almost impossible for workers seeking the redress of their grievances to obtain justice in that Court today, went on to say that he did not in tend to deal with the merits of the dispute, because that was the job of the State Parliament of New South Wales. I say that it is not. It is our duty to deal with this matter. We are here as the representatives of the people of Australia. Whether we do it or not we are supposed to look after the interests of' the whole of the people. have'only certain things to do as affecting the people of the Commonwealth. gentleman must know that disputes, so far I take the other view. as mining at BrokenH ill is concerned, cannot be settled separately, because operations at Port Pirie, BrokenH ill , Cockle Creek, and Risdon, in Tasmania, are dependent upon supplies from the I suggest to the BrokenH ill mines. When BrokenH ill stops work-as it has for the last fourteen months-Port Pirie is in idleness. The right honourable gentleman knows that, in the language of the Arbitration Court, there is an Inter-State dispute, because the men at Port Pirie have made common cause with the men at BrokenH ill . The Why begin tinkering with the dispute is Eederali n its scope and its results. Out of the mouth of the companies' own publicity agent, whose report the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr. Foster) has quoted, it is made quite apI propose to ask this parent that this is not merely a State dispute. The companies say, in this report, that there are fro m 70,000 to 100,000 people affected by it . If it is not the duty of the Commonwealth to step in and to direct an inquiry to be made into the causes and the results of the trouble, as I apprehend that honorwell as to ascertain a way of settlement, why was a special tribunal set up quite I recently in the case of the Seamen's and the Engineer's and Firemen'6 dispute? Why did the Prime Minister( Mr. Hughes), in the case of the coal miners' dispute at Newcastle, appoint a special tribunal? Why did not the Commonwealth Government, in that and many other cases, say, "" This is a matter for New South Wales itself and not for the Commonwealth to take action "" ? In the past tlie Commonwealth Government have said that it is their duty to take action in these cases. have been better if they had. members who have just interjected are quite entitled to their personal opinions; but the House has to decide whether we are to stand by and allow this trouble to continue.

257,Mr Considine,"The parliamentary I have covered in my motion, such as themay say in passing, is rather ill-informed on the subject. He told the House, for instance, that the BrokenH ill Council was a Labour council, and that it had repudiated the statement that the health of the children of BrokenH ill would compare unfavorably with that of the children of other parts of the Commonwealth. The honourable member must have obtained his information from the Argus. That newspaper sent a special reporter to BrokenH ill to inquire into the conditions prevailing there, and should be better informed than it appears to be. If the report of its special representative on the industrial conditions of BrokenH ill was no more accurate than the subleader which it published a few days ago, in which it stated that the BrokenH ill Council was a Labour council and had repudiated the insinuation that the health of the children there was inferior to that of the children of other centres, then we cannot say much for it . Argus ought to know that the Nationalist party have been in control of the BrokenH ill Council for some time. H ill Council repudiate that insinuation? Council did carry such a resolution, which was moved by a local building contractor, who said that "" his "" children were quite healthy. worked in the mines of BrokenH ill . Like many other business people there, he has seen the mines, and may perhaps have been down some of them once or twice; but he has never worked in a mine at BrokenH ill , and his system has not been saturated with lead. children are all r i g h t , "" and claims, therefore, that the children of BrokenH ill generally must be healthy, despite the fact that the Commonwealth Statistician has proved that the infantile mortality rates of BrokenH ill and Port Pirie are the highest in the Commonwealth. The authorities on industrial diseases-Si r Thomas Oliver and others-sa y that this hieh rate of infantile mortality is attributable to the fact that the fathers or mothers have lead in their system, and that the children, consequently, have no chance before they are born. A r e we to take the Commonwealth Statistician's figures and the evidence of the medical authorities on industrial diseases, or are we to accept those of building contractors, who, in order to back up the political interests of the mining companies of BrokenH ill , and, as good party men, carry a resolution repudiating the suggestion that the children of the Barrier are not as healthy as are children in other parts of the State, despite the statistics of the Commonwealth Statistician and the reports founded upon medical inquiry? Isi t to be said by us that, because this dispute has gone on. so long, it shall be allowed to continue? Are we to have, in response to this demand, as the speech by the Ministerf o r the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) suggests, the answer alleged to have been made some thousands of years ago, "" A m I my brother's keeper ?'' It is the bounden duty of this House to order an inquiry. The interests of the people of the whole Commonwealth are bound up with the health of the men, The women, and children of BrokenH ill .

Judging by the speech just made by the Ministerf o r the Navy, the Government are going to say, ""We have nothing to do with this matter, although it affects 30,000 people in BrokenH ill , and, notwithstanding the fact that, according to the companies themselves, between 70,000 and 100,000 people are dependent upon the industry.",51,Foster B E Fair And Ber Evidently Supports Its Contents

Of these the most important is that of article 40, which lays it down as a fundamental principle that at no moment of its voyage may a passenger steam-ship have on board a greater number of persons than those for whom accommodation is provided in life-boats and pontoon life-rafts on board. which the Convention, perhaps, insisted more 'than any other, and our Act already gives the Minister power to prescribe that it shall be met. boats trading on rivers? it. does. to boats on the River Murray? the Murray; at least, I am inclined to think it does not. both sea and river passage, does that provision apply? to be led into long explanation of some of these matters, but I understand that all vessels which cross routes that are traversed by oversea steamers come under this portion of the Act.

Similarly the requirement of article 11 that a Morse signal lamp of sufficient range must be carried by passenger ships will be dealt with by regulation under sections 191 and 258, which fully cover the ground.

The matter of regulating the trade within its own territorial waters has been left to each country itself to deal with. That means that our adherence to the Convention does not make it necessary for Australia to apply these provisions of the Bill to our own shipping on our own coasts, which is entirely under our jurisdiction. We could, if we liked, adhere to the Convention, and leave those provisions out. to do so? Act, to which reference has been made, gives the provisions of the Convention a much wider application. It applied them to all passenger steamers, irrespective of whether their trade is within the TJnited Kingdom or to foreign countries. That means ships passing from the jurisdiction of England to that of Erance, Holland,"" or seme other country, and the provision applies to all passenger ships, irrespective of whether they trade within the United Kingdom or in foreign countries. Similarly, the requirements as to wireless are applied to ships and voyages which do not come under the Convention. ping Act contain tbe same provision that our own Act does, namely, that wireless shall be provided for all vessels carrying over ten passengers? that point without looking the matter up. sailors are just as important as those of the passengers? conceded that if such precautionary measures are desirable in the interests of human life on the short voyages within the waters around the United Kingdom, or even on the somewhat longer voyages from ports in the United Kingdom to European countries, they are even more desirable and necessary on the long runs of from 400 to 1,000 miles between ports in Inter-State voyages along the 10,000 miles of steam-ship routes around the Australian coast. Our power under the Constitution is, of course, not so wide as that of the Imperial Parliament, and the limitations therein imposed must be regarded. Generally speaking, however, the provisions of the Convention are applied, under the Bill, and subject to the conditions laid down in section 2 of the Navigation Act, to the following classes of ships:(a) Ships registered in Australia; (o) Ships, whether British or foreign, engaged in the coasting trade; and (c) British and foreign steam-ships embarking passengers at a portin Australia for conveyance to a port outside Australia. This Parliament has f u l l power to prescribe, in regard to these last-mentioned ships, .the conditions under which they shall be permitted to embark passengers at any port Avithin the Commonwealth jurisdiction. It is this power which enables us to control ships which are not registered in Australia, but which embark passengers in Australia for ports beyond the Commonwealth. control foreign ship3 which carry passengers on our coast? over all vessels, whether British or foreign, engaged in the coastal trade. from one port to another in Australia, ancl not merely disembarking passengers or landing cargo in this country. subject to correction; but I believe that we have jurisdiction over every vessel Avhich touches Australian shores, and engages in our coastal trade.

So much for the provisions arising out of the Convention for the safety of life at sea, and which constitute the most important clauses of the Bill. structional accommodation on oversea vessels, will it he uniform on British vessels with that on vessels registered in Australia, by reason of the Convention, or otherwise ? with the question of construction. If the ship is registered in a British Possession which has adhered to the Convention and passed the' necessary legislation, or if it is to-day only about two-thirds of what is under the jurisdiction of any other power which has done so, then the provision will be uniform; but, of course, in the case of any vessel which comes to 'our coast and engages in the coastal trade, the coastal-trading provisions insure uniformity. I wish to explain clauses 3 and 4, which provide for the postponement of the coastal-trading provisions of the Act. Clause3 provides for the annulment of the proclamation issued in December last, fixing 2nd March as the date on which certain provisions of the Act, commonly known as the coastal-trading provisions, were to commence. Clause4 similarly suspends the operation of regulations issued under those proclaimed provisions. deal of misconception, and possibly of ignorance, on the part of the public, both as to the nature of the Navigation Act itself and as to the effect that its provisions would have on shipping facilities in Australia if the Act were proclaimed at this moment. We often hear criticism directed against this Government, as it has been against previous Governments, for not proclaiming the Ac't. That criticism I believe to be very largely based upon lack of knowledge as to the shipping situation generally, and as to the effect which the enforcement of the Act would have upon our coastal trade. I was not here through the closing days of the last part of this session, but I believe a good deal was said at that time as to the enormous accumulation of cargo in different parts of Australia and the impossibility of moving it to other parts where it was badly needed. At that particular time the drought was very bad. It looked as if it were never going to break. There were vast accumulations of fodder at various parts of Australia, and it was found utterly impossible to move it. Great pressure was brought to bear on the Government to release some of its overseas vessels and put them on the coastal trade. This position arose in the first place through the war. I think over fifty of our coastal vessels, and the very best of them, were during the war taken off our coast and requisitioned by the Imperial Government. According to the iatest statistics available, the Inter-State steam-ship tonnage remaining on the coast it was at the outbreak of the war in 1914. This deprivation of one-third of our effective transportation service was a most serious loss to the Commonwealth. We felt the effect of it all through the war; and, had it not been for the fact that the' Government requisitioned all the ships and ran them as one line to all intents and purposes instead of a number of competing lines, it would have been utterly impossible, during the period of the war, to meet the requirements of Australia. The position has been accentuated for another reason, to which I am very glad to be able to bear testimony. During the war, owing to the fact that we were shut off from our sources of supply for many things which we had been in the habit of I believe there is a good importing, Australian manufacturers got to work, and all sorts of new industries 'were started in the country. one; but still it was one. The result was that the coastal trade of Australia grew tremendously during the war. doubled. ships during the war; but, a3 I am reminded by the honourable member for Wakefield, who is a member of a Commission that has been investigating this matter very closely, the coastal trade of Australia has very nearly doubled. in value? That fact, has of course, accentuated the difficulty very much. The position is far from normal, and this abnormality has been brought about, I am sorry to say, by two very serious maritime strikes.",57,Gbeene Read A First Time Navigation Bill Second Reading

We have, however, not yet fully recovered from the effects of the strikes, because they meant a complete cessation of shipping. Honourable members will see, therefore, that, for the statement he has just made. time being at all events, it is absolutely necessary to engage in the trade every vessel that comes to our shores, and is prepared to carry coastal cargo. The object of the coastal trading provisions of the Act, was to insist that all vessels which the accommodation has not been engaged, in our coastal trade should comply with certain conditions as regards the manning scale, accommodation, pay, and rations, and generally to make tilt condition of Australian seamen very much better than it had been in the past. made better. to be Every one who has looked into this question must admit that the conditions which obtained in our mercantile marine in days gone by were a disgrace to our twentieth-century civilization. The provisions of the Navigation Act are an attempt to put them on a much better footing. It was recognised, too, that it claim the whole of the Navigation Act, inwould not be fair to compel the owners of ships registered in Australia to comply Government decided some time ago to with the coastal trading provisions while allowing ships trading from other parts of the world, and which had not to comply with those conditions, to compete with them. But for us at this moment to ask those vessels calling at our shores, and which are so necessary to carry on our coastal trade, to comply with the coastal trading provisions, would simply result in pushing them out of the trade. Australia's national requirements are such at the present moment that the Government do not think that would be a desirable step to take. We have, at the same time, the knowledge that, as a result of the conference held at the conclusion of the first big maritime strike, practically all the provisions relating to the comfort, pay, rations, and manning scale on Australian ships are now being carried out; and I believe I am safe in saying that, if the coastal trading provisions of the Act were proclaimed to-morrow, they would not materially alter in any respect the gaged in the coastal trade. commodation ? that the seamen do not agree with the House the information which has reached me from responsible quarters. I believe that, broadly speaking, that is the fact.

I have made is, I believe, correct. We cannot insist upon the observance of these conditions until such time as we are able to proclaim the coastal trading provisions of the Act. The disadvantages to this country of doing that at this time would be so great that no Government would be justified in adopting that course. As soon as we are able to do so with due regard to the'welfare of the community generally, we intend to procluding the coastal provisions. When the prolaim those provisions, we were met by insuperable difficulties in several quarters.

I believe the principle adopted by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) in giving notice of the intention of the Government to bring certain items in the Tariff into operation on a particular date is quite right. I do not say that such -a principle can be applied to everything in the Tariff, particularly tea, and other items. Although there may be some justification for such action, in connection with sewing machines, there is certainly none in connection with cotton hosiery and corsets, as these are items that at present cannot be manufactured here. I think the Minister for Trade and Customs will agree that not 5 per cent, of not a fair the corsets used in Australia are manufactured in this country; and probably I would be correct in saying that the quantity does not exceed 1 per cent, of the total number used. It is absolutely impossible to obtain machinery to manufacture corsets in the Commonwealth, and at present about £500,000 worth of cotton hosiery is imported into Australia': every year. As regards cotton piece-goods, it must bo admitted that the. machinery required for their manufacture cannot be made available for some time, and the Government would have been wise if they had given notice in connection with the items I have mentioned, as they have done in connection with iron. Owing to the shortage in the cotton crop, cotton piece-goods have increased to four or five times their previous price. action of the Combine. sewing cotton is under the absolute control of J. and P.

I shall be glad to hear the Minister for Trade and Customs give some explanation of the duties proposed in connection with the imports of copper and many other items dealt with in the Tariff. We should, as far as possible, carry out the work of producing copper in the form of angles, rods, and even wire, in Australia, but I fear that we shall not do so by imposing the duties proposed in this Tariff, and lhat their effect will only be to p u t the business into the hands of one or two rich companies. people do not do any work except electrolytic refining. was a proposal that at Mount Kembla they should manufacture copper, and turn out rods, and even wire, for telephone lines. not by tlie Mount Kembla people. that is so. I believe that we should carry out the refining of copper here. Sometimes the impurities in copper are gold or silver, and that should not be overlooked. We should get the fullest in formation in connection with these items before being asked to vote upon them. I believe that the duties at present proposed in connection with imports of copper represent to some extent a blot on the T a r if f. I am glad that under the Standing Orders honourable members will be able to speak as often as they please on the Tariff, because some may have a better knowledge of particular items than all the res of the members of the ComL mittee, and if they were confined to speaking but once or twice upon an item which they f u l l y understood, they would perhaps be prevented from correcting the misunderstandings of other members of the Committee. I am glad to have the opportunity to consider this Tariff. In 1914 it was my privilege to introduce the highest Tariff up to that time introduced into any Parliament in Australia. We nevar had the opportunity to discuss it because, owing to the war, it was considered that it was not desirable to do so. opportunity of collecting revenue under it. there may not be much alteration of the duties prqposed in the British preference column, there are alterations proposed in the other columns of this Tariff. I have never been anxious that we should collect a great deal of revenue through the Tariff, but that industries should 'be established in Australia. very convenient to> collect revenue through the Tariff just now. it might bring about the position we have recently had put before us in the newst papers. It has been shown that i m porters have added their profits to the original cost of the articles they import plus the duties imposed on them by the I understand that there Tariff. We have an object lesson in the statement made in to-day's press that, in the early stages of the gas stokers' strike, lamps, which were imported at a cost of 4s.

I hope that, during this discussi a honourable members will not hesitate to point to any defects in the Tariff. I shall be quite ready to do so, and I shall be pleased to know that we shall have an opportunity to alter and amend it. No Minister-n o matter to what party he belongs-ca n claim to have that general knowledge of the industries of Australia which is possessed by the House as a whole. The Minister in charge should be glad to avail himself of the combined knowledge of honourable members. Every honourable member has a knowledge of the particular industries in his own electorate, and the extent to which they affect it, and I hope that we shall be guided in our deliberations by a desire to make Australia as self-contained as possible. We have been told by one daily newspaper that we have no right to consider such a matter; but I , for one, care not for the opinions expressed in the newspapers. It is our duty to make Australia less dependent upon other countries than she has hitherto been. During the war we found that we were able to manufacture much that we had never attempted before, and I am convinced that the Australian workman, when supplied with the necessary machinery and tools, can hold his own with the most skilled workers of any other country. I should like at the outset to refer to a remark made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), who, in reply to an interjection made by me, classed me as one of the "" Stinking-fish "" party, so far as the progress of Australia was concerned. objects to the remark I shall have pleasure in withdrawing it. as offensive, for I know that the honourable member did not intend it to be. No honourable member has a keener desire than I have to advance the best interests of Australia. I also give the [104] Leader of the Opposition credit for a de-: sire to improve the conditions of the country. difference of opinion between us as to the best way to improve the conditions of the country. in Sydney recently I saw some thousands; of small parcels of hats which had been sent by parcels post from America. A more expensive way of importing them could not have been adopted. The rabbit skins from which they had been manufactured had been purchased at high prices and sent from Australia to the United States of America at heavy freights. The wages paid in the trade' in the United States, of America were' higher than those prevailing here, and' yet it was possible to bring over this enormous consignment in the most expensive way, and to compete with the local manufacturers. How was that possible? Surely there must be something wrong with the industry here. Again, only a few days ago, at the Parcels Post Office, I , in company with other members of the Public Wqrks Committee, saw' large quantities of goods which had been sent here in the same way, not only from the United States of America, but Japan. hats as good as those manufactured in any other part of the world. to do so, and it seems to me to be extraordinary that we are not making much greater strides in regard to the manufacture, not only of hats, but boots. M i l lions of pounds worth of boots should have been exported from Australia during the war. Industry generally should have flourished here. The fault, rests, not with the Australian workmen, but with the agitators, who got behind them in the first place and urged them to ""go slow,"" and put other obstacles in the way of the activities of the Commonwealth. Coming to the Tariff itself, I thought that, when the present Leader of the Opposition, as Minister for Trade and Customs, introduced his Tariff of 1914 we had reached the standard of Protection required to build up the industries of Australia.

462,Mr Gregory,"We should be ablebefore we had heard it said that, in order to .build up Australian industries, a higher Tariff was necessary. The Tariff was continually increased until, with the introduction of that of 1914, I believed we had a Tariff which would enable local manufacturers to compete .with the Test of the world. But we have now submitted to us a Tariff that "" outHerods Herod,"" largely increasing the duties on almost every article we require. There can be no argument at the present time for an increased Tariff in order to build up Australian industries. know that, prior to the war, we had been importing large quantities of goods from .various countries. Prices have increased enormously, but still we are, and must continue, importing. due to the fact, not that the duties in force at the outbreak of war were insufficient to protect Australian manufacturers, but that millions of people, and hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of machinery, were diverted from peacef u l pursuits to the manufacture of munitions of war. Machinery which had formerly been used in the manufacture of these goods had to be utilized in the proI do know what the Government did in duction of war material. Of recent years it has been almost impossible to get goods into Australia in any shape or form. Yet, at a time like this, a new Tariff has been back country for some years, took £70,000 brought forward. We ought to be told whether this Tariff is intended to !be revenue producthey obtained was less than £4,000. They ing, or whether it is designed to encourage the establishment of local indusexcept through certain agencies. tries. mous quantity of raw material, when we should be utilizing it for manufacturing purposes? duces the raw material of this country ought to be able to get the world's parity for it. The only way in which we shall ever be able to progress and discharge the tremendous obligations with which we are faced is by developing the vast vacant spaces of Australia, and by encouraging people to come here. When we have a population of 15,000,000 or 20,000,000, which we shall have with good government, there will be a home market for the manufacturer, who will thus be in a far better position to compete in the open nv..Vets of the world than he is to-day. About 1913-14 the value of our primary industries was something like £170,000,000, whilst that of our manufactured products was only about £60,000,000. In 1918, the value of our primary industries was over £200,000,000, whilst that of our manufacturing industries was less than £70,000,000. We know that one-half of the population of Australia is to be found in the State capitals. I have figures in my possession which will refute the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) in We regard to the population of this country. The Commonwealth Statistician tells me that 50 per cent, of our population is urban in character. Whilst such conditions obtain, the man who goes into the This has been bush to struggle for an existence has an embargo placed upon the exportation of his products. upon the export of goods to-day ? Opposition spoke of an embargo in regard to copper production. I do not know the facts of the case he speaks of, but regard to the export of metals from Australia. I have previously cited the case of a few men, who, after battling in the worth of lead out of a small pot-hole in less than two years. Yet the profit that were not allowed to export their product that policy was to build up a few monopolists in our cities. In my judgment, that is one of the vilest things that has ever happened; and what has happened with the metal industry may to-morrow affect some other industry. Coming to the Tariff itself, I have a bitter complaint to make concerning many of the acts of the Customs Department. I object to the action of the Department in imposing embargoes upon many classes of goods coming into this country. I am not speaking of the present Minister's administration, but of a period antecedent to it. Take as an illustration the question of sheep dip.
