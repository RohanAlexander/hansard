63,We Have Practically Estab,"Mr Wilks -That is so. The questhe power of taxation. His contention that the Senate is not composed in the same way as this House shows that the course proposed by the Government will make the Senate stronger than the Constitution intended that it should be. In 1902, as the Prime Minister said, we wrote oyer the door of the Senate, "" No taxing powers,"" and then passed the matter by. time we run away from the issue in that fashion, the Senate will become stronger. If , on this occasion, they resist our action with regard to twenty items, they will do so next time with regard to forty items. If they can do that, why should they not take the f u l l power of taxation into their own hands ? If , on this occasion, we adopt the course proposed by the Prime Minis'ter, I hope that we shall send back to the ' Senate, rejected, every one of their requests. I desire also to support the view taken by the honourable member for Kennedy. A distinction was undoubtedly made in'the Constitution ' between the powers of the two Houses with regard to money Bills, and rightly so, because this House represents the people in the mass, while the Senate represents them in States, and nnancial questions are not questions which affect the States as States. ""The Constitution, therefore, laid down a deliberate distinct i o n between the powers of the Houses with regard to measures of taxation. Such measures can be initiated only in this Chamber, and the Senate has no power to amend them. What the Senate are trying to do now amounts to .a. distinct assertion of equality of power with regard to money Bills, and in some cases of their right to initiate taxation. The Constitution provides that the-Senate shall have no power to amend money Bills, but that they' may make re-, quests for alterations or omissions, the intention being to make a distinction between an amendment and a request-. If the. power of making requests can be insisted upon for any length of time, there is not the slightest difference between a power of amendment and a power of request. The introduction of the method of making requests was intended to convey some power less than the power of making amendments. Obviously, therefore, the Constitution intended that the power of making requests should not be insisted upon. A request can be made' which we may or may not grant, and there the matter should end. means -anything further than that-if a continued insistence on requests is allowed -ther e is no sense in saying that the Senate cannot make amendments. Jn these circumstances, it seems to me that the House will be abrogating its powers and privileges as the Chamber representing the masses of the people if it gives way in the fashion proposed. I agree with the honourable -memEvery ber for Kennedy that if we admit on this occasion, as we did in 1902, the power of the Senate to press requests, notwithstanding that we carry a sort of pious resolution that we are not really giving way, we shall, as a matter of actual fact, be giving way. The fact is that we are giving way,, although we say that we are not. VVe are saying in effect, "" While we are giving way, we are only.doing so on this occasion."" We said the same in 1902, and the excuse now, as it was then, is that the pressure of . public business renders Ijbis course, necessary. But will not the pressure of public business always render it necessary? Can we expect ever to have an occasion when we can take as much time as we like to settle the question of the relative rights of the two Houses? The question ought to be considered on this B ill , which represents absolutely the most important expression of the money powers bf this Chamber. Proposals for taxation are the very proposals which render it essential that this House should make a firm.and determined stand to protect its rights. No occasion could be stronger than this one. -that is the only weapon we have. using the weapons that we have. The proper thing to do is .to assert the principle that this Hoiise alone has the power of imposing taxation, and that the Senate has no power of insisting upon its requested amendments being made. If the power of insistence is granted, it amounts to a power of amendment. If this House \\;ere to take up a determined stand on the question, the Senate would, I think, recognise the true constitutional position, and would give way. Otherwise, it would have to take the responsibility of throwing out the Tariff. On the other hand, if this House gives way on every occasion, our'power goes by default, and the Senate is placed on an absolute equality with us in regard to monev Bills.

I was at first inclined to agree that it is not desirable that the privilege or right claimed by the Senate should be conceded"" to it. But after more mature consideration, I am inclined to think that it Was rather an advantage that the practice which obtained in 1902, and which is about to be repeated, should be made perpetual. I believe that where there are opportunities for the interchange of views by message -between the two Houses, there is less likelihood of there being a deadlock on a matter such as the Tariff, as might be the case if the Senate were limited to sending one set of requests only.

It is not a question of whether this is to be a high or low Tariff, but a question of maintaining .the 'rights and privileges of the House'. It is abouttime that its leader, the Prime Minister, gave us sqme advice. I feel very strongly about the matter. I have indicated that if there were a chance of dealing with the suggestions, it is probable that, fiom my. fiscal stand-point, I might favour some of them, but I want to put them all on one side. I ask every honourable member to regard the situation from a much broader stand-point than that of fiscalism, and to maintain thepowers and privileges of this House.

I feel that the Government are leading us on a > wrong road in proposing to assent to what has been done This House has the sole power of dealing with money Bills,'but, in spite of that fact, it is proposed to allow the Senate to make recommendation after recommendation at the same stage. I think that it is a fair argument and a fair read-, ing of section 53 of .the Constitution to suggestions once and once only, and that is when it receives a Bill from this House after its third reading here.

In a large number .of instances we took the latter course, and those proposals were settled, I contend. There is no other stage at which the Senate can act. Where we have rejected any pro-, posals of the Senate, I submit that it has no right to further request amendments. It must reject the Bill if it disagrees with our decisions. It has exhausted its powers of request, and if this House once consents to allow message after message to be sent down covering requests, it might just as -well give to the Senate equal powers in regard to all money Bills. rather pleased to hear some representatives of the smaller States speak as they did regarding the power of the Senate.

In Australia, before ,the final act of granting the Royal assent to a Bill-so that from that time forward it can be regarded by the Courts only as an Act of Parliament-the practice is that the Attorney-General shall advise-as is done in Great Britain-that it is fit to be presented, and that it complies with a number of requisite's that are mentioned in the instructions 'issued to the Governor General or the Governor as the case may be. generally certifies that a Bill has been passed by the requisite majority. Mr W. H . IRVINE I accept the honourable member's statement. Mr Speaker and also the Attorney-General are asked to give certificates. the case of every Bill. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Such a practice is merely a precaution to prevent any Bill which, in its mode of passing through the House, . has not complied with constitutional requirements from receiving the gested that once that assent has been granted any Court has a right to question the mode ih which a Bill has been passed : cannot inquire' to say whether the majority by which it was passed or whether the form of the messages passing from one House to another in connection with it was such as to leave it within the Constitution. Let us take as an illustration what took place, Mr Speaker, when you were asked recently to give your ruling on the point of order raised by the right honourable mem-. ber for Swan, that the Senate in making -requests for increases of duty had . exceeded its powers under the Constitution. Suppose that you had determined that it was wrong for the Senate to request any increase of duty, and that at the same time we received a message containing requests for reductions of duty in the case of 150 items, and one small request for an increase of"" ""duty. Let us assume that' that one request for an increase passed unnoticed, that the message was dealt with, and the Bill became law. Could it be suggested that in such circumstances the Courts would have a right to examine into the records of the two Houses, to turn to the evidence of the papers or messages passing between them, and fo say finally,"" "" Yes, we find that at one stage a message was sent by the Senate to the House of Representatives actually containing a request for an increase of duty, and that that request was unnoticed by honourable members, and effect was given to the message""? Such a position would be altogether impracticable. The Courts could never arrogate to themselves the right to inquire into those matters, and in my opinion, Â»the High Court would never venture to do so. If that view is right, then the position is that we are either dealing with a message under section 53 of the Constitution, or there is nothing before us. I understand that, following the usual practice, a messenger ' from another place placed this message in the hands of theClerk, and that, as soon it is was handed to you, sir, the Prime Minister moved the motion now before the House. The message being in your hands at the present time, and the Prime Minister having moved this motion, I desire to request your ruling on the point -of order whether there is any message, under section '53, before the House. It must be decided, and you, Mr",27,Forrest Tha T Is Exactly Say That The Senate Has The Right To Make

107,Mr Groom,"That has to be done in-Speaker, are the only authority within the four corners of the Constitution who, so far as this House is concerned, can decide it. I do not want to press very strongly the arguments one way or the other. If I may say so, with all respect,' I was entirely in favour, of the view which you -took on the point of order raised on the first message on the Customs Tariff Bill received from the Senate. You then held .that the Senate had-a right to send a message requesting increases ' as well as decreases of duty. That is a very different question from the one now before us.' Mr W. H . IRVINE -There is room for a difference of opinion on that point, but the question now before us is, in my view, a very different one. Section 53 of the Constitution provides thatThe Senate may at any stage return to. the House of Representatives any proposed law .which the Senate may not. amend; requesting, hy orders as shall accurately and fairly message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. . . . It seems to me that, whilst that provision may be wide enough to include one or more' 'requested amendments, yet, reading the section as a whole, the intention was that at any particular stage the Senate'might return 'the whole B ill , and that the. Senate has no case, surely ? -power to send a message without returning .'with it the B ill to which it relates. The sure that circumstances cannot arise in conmessage must be accompanied by the B ill nexion with the piocedure adopted between to which it relates. I suppose that at the the two Houses which would raise the 'present moment, Mr Speaker, the Customs question of the validity of an Act. SupTariff Bill is in your hands, and the only pose, for instance, that both Houses agreed' question is whether this message is one that to .certain rates of .duty, and to a certain can be sent down from another place.

Mr W. H . . IRVINE joint standing orders would not overcome this particular difficulty: to .do so, but the course of framing joint . standing orders might involve a settlement of this question. I can conceive that that is possible, though it is not very probable. But joint standing orders have not been adopted, and consequentlv we find ourselves, in a sense, in the same position to-day that we occupied in 1902. But we do not find ourselves in the same position in regard to the particular question before us, or even in regard to that to which the honourable member for Flinders addressed himself. If , at that time, instead of carrying the motion submitted, w e bad taken our other course, a practice would have been established by which you, sir, would have been bound. Asi t is, neither of those practices-the one aggressive, the other concessionary-ha s been adopted.

I agree to part being free, and ask for a modification by which another part will not be free. position taken up by the honourable member for North Sydney would be quite correct, but in this instance the Senate asks that the various articles that come under this item should be all free, and the Treasurer, while agreeing to a number of them being made free, asks that some of them is clearly a modification that he can move. he wishes to take out of this item would f a l l under a lower duty or be put on the really means proposing a new item with articles free and increase the duty on one other by i \ per cent. The really important thihgs are to be made free. sure of that. The term "" apparatus "" may be stretched by the Minister and his officials to cover quite a wide range of electrical appliances. There is no definition of electrical apparatus in the Tariff, and we certainly should have a definition of it . Whilst the Treasurer expresses a hope ""that the Committee will get through with the Tariff, he should not forget that such proIn posals as that now before the Committee tend to delay its passing. We may, without knowing it , be including at a higher duty under the term ""electrical apparatus"" a number of things of which we have no knowledge.

Any one who has had any dealings with the Customs Department must be aware that it is the practice, of the officials in doubtful cases to levy the highest duty. If there is no trick in this proposal-and I tell the Committee candidly that I fear a trick-it would appear that the Treasurer is willing to forego a In this case, the 15 per cent, duty on electrical fittings consisting wholly or partly of metal n.e.i, including switches, fuses, and lightning arresters.

In the circumstances I am prepared to vote in this matter with the Treasurer. I remind honourable members that the duty proposed on electrical apparatus is only 17J per cent., and that they have not been satisfied with duties of 30 and 40 per cent, for the protection of other industries. Foodstuffs and wearing apparel used by engineers in common with other persons in the community have been' made dutiable in the interests of various industries at from 30 up to 120 per cent.; but apparently it is a crime to suggest that the engineering industry should be' protected to the extent of 17 J per cent. Really the way in which this Tariff has been framed is enough to make any man a protectionist. We find that every member of the Committee looks after the interests of industries established in his own electorate or in his own State, and it is about time that some one considered the interests of those engaged in the engineering industry of Australia. ber out for "" loot "" on this item? are always out for' loot, and I say openly' that the passing of the Tariff is nothing but a scramble for loot. I am prepared to make that same statement from a public platform. Right through the piece, in considering this Tariff there has been a struggle for what 1 call "" loot "" on behalf of .various industries, and I can only regret that so far the engineering industry has been able to get so little of it. Probably the reason why fittings, switches, fusings, and lightning arresters are to be made free is that they are not made here, and that it would be rather an assistance to the engineering industry than otherwise to admit them free of duty. No body of men has done better work for trade unionism than have the engineers of Australia. The industry pays good wages, and is carried on underfair conditions, and I should like to see thousands of people at work :'n Australia under such conditions. We shall shortly be asked to encourage the immigration of nersons of the artisan class, and the best persons of that class that we could introduce are those of the English, Irish, and. particularly the Scotch race, whose industry is devoted mainly Â£0 engineering. highly equipped engineers are about to leave Australia for America, because they cannot find employment here. go to a country where there are 6,000,000 of unemployed ! count of the interjections to put forward a plea on behalf of the engineering industry of Australia, whilst honourable members have been ready enough to listen to pleas put forward for the protection ol other industries.

I make no secret of the fact that a great number of them reside in my electorate. For years past they have given me strong support as a free-trader, and it is about time for me to do something ""for them now -T hope that the Treasurer will make a strong appeal to the protectionists in the Committee, and to the "" leaven "" of whom he scoke the other day, to give some protection to the engineering industry. As the engineering establishments of New South Wales are .largerand better equipped than those of any other State, ""I can speak on this matter not only from the stand-point of my eleclarger and better equipped than those of my State. I urge that this important industry of the State from which I come should receive some assistance under this Tariff. think the Committee might make the concession asked for by the Treasurer, although, after the abusive language which the honourable gentleman applied to me early in the afternoon, I do not know that I am called upon to advance any special reasons in support of his proposal. It appears to me that if it is within the capacity of Australian workmen to make dynamos, up to 500 horse-power, and all their accessories, honourable members are quibbling over a very small matter when they object to a duty of 17 per cent, on 1 electrical apparatus.

318,Mr Dugald Thomson (North,"decided that the duty against the United Kingdom should not be increased from ad. to 6d. per lb. The duty affects only one firm of directory proprietors, and T am unable to understand why they are being differently treated from those who are interested in other books, which are admitted duty free. Why is this particular printed book taken out of the free category ? of advertisements, for which the proprietors get well paid. other books. Sir WILLIAM LYNE sent. honourable gentleman seems to have a monomania regarding publications containing advertisements. book. other Australian books are admitted duty They say furtherfree. in the same sense as others. difference is there between books on natural history and other subjects, prepared here after great research and expenditure of money, and sent to England to be printed, and this particular book, which is also prepared here after great research and expense and printed in England? Why should' not a directory be treated in the same way as any other book? But the point in dispute is whether the duty should be ^d. or 6d. per lb. As the duty of 4d. would amount to about 2s. 8d. per copy on the larger directories, surely that would penalise the proprietors sufficiently to satisfy honourable members. that the printing can easily be done in Australia.' It was said in the Senate that a firm of Sydney printers who formerly had the contract for printing Wise's directories had given up the work on account of the conditions imposed. I Bavei t authoritatively stated that no new conditions were imposed, and that the proprietors of these directories did not vary their contract in any way; but the firm in question' indicated that they could not ""continue the printing owing to the difficulties involved. Honourable members are well aware that there are difficulties attached to the printing of such books as directories. A great quantity of type has to be kept ""standing,"" and a large number of corrections have to be made, which involve a considerable amount of work and conduce to the disturbance of other work with which the printing firm may be concerned. In any case, if the'work can be done in Australia a duty of 4d. against the United Kingdom will afford an ample opportunity for Australian printing firms to tender. I protest against an unfair distinction being made between this particular book ancl other books which may be prepared in Australia, and printed in England. I shall S o are vote against the Minister's motion. No t with mv con-Honorabl e members have been led to believe that there is a difficulty about printing The Wise's directories in Australia. In fact, a circular has been sent out by the proprietors, in which they stateWe have made every effort, both by calling for tenders in the newspapers and interviewing printing firms, to have our publications printed But in Australia. No doubt, could we allow the printing to extend over a period of nine months in each year for each work instead of three months, we should not have the difficulty. Owing to the nature of the work, however, it is impossible. We cannot, therefore, find a firm willing to undertake the responsibility. I have here a telegram from the firm referred to, in which they sayWe .printed Wise's Directory several. years, and voluntarily abandoned same, only because proprietors' views regarding price and conditions intolerable. Cheaper prices outside always used as leverage -Wm. Brooks Ltd., Sydney. Of course the lower wages paid in England would be used as a leverage; . a duty of 4d. per lb. at that time, though. It has been stated member for North Sydney has asked why a distinction is made between directories and other books prepared in Australia and sent to England to be printed. There may be many reasons! Wise's directories contain many advertisements that the other books referred to do not contain. The leverage used by the firm in question is easily understood. I have before me a copy of the British Printer, which contains a list of wages paid to compositors in some of the cities in England. They range from 28s. to 34s. per week. In this country, however, the wages of compositors range from -Q2 12s. to Â£ 2 16s. per week. 4d. per lb. is sufficient to cover that difference.",47,Thomson Yes Ing Of The Item By Leaving Out The Words

Mr .JOHNSON (Lang) [9.5] -The honourable member for Hindmarsh, although he has been supporting the proposal for a higher duty, and has spoken about the intolerable conditions under, which the successful tenderer was to do the work, has not told us what they were. I think that the Committee ought to be informed -on that point. Sir member wants to know too much. will ever accuse the Minister of knowing very much. If he knows anything about this matter he has not enlightened the Committee. He takes too much for granted, so long as the representations come from 'one side only, and are in the direction of an increase h. => duty. I have received a letter from another firm who are interested in this matter. I do not happen to know the writer personally, and I ask the indulgence of the Committee' while I read the letter in rebuttal of the one just read. It reads as followsIn the Senate last week, Senator Findley, in supporting an increase of duty to 6d. per lb. preference on directories, said that Messrs. Sands and McDougall had received a telegram from Brooks and Co., of Sydney, stating that the reason they had ceased printing Wise's Directories was that the conditions imposed by Wise's were "" intolerable."" In contradiction to this statement. I have to say that thd firm of Wise's never in any way wished or did vary the contract entered into -with Brooks and Co. in 1902; and, further, that in 1904 Brooks and . Co. undertook the printing of Wise's South Australian Directory on exactly the same terms and conditions. Again, in 1905, Brooks and Co. advised the firm of Wise's that they were putting in additional plant, and would be in a better position to cope with the work, and asking for additional directories. If the conditions were, as the telegram says, so ""intolerable,"" why were Brooks and Co. anxious in 1904 and IQ05 for additional work? I can only presume, from my own knowledge and what has come to light during this debate, that the rivals of Wise's had induced them' to join forces in crushing my firm. As regards the printing of the works in Australia, I can only reiterate my statement that my firm has not had a single offer to print the works at any price whatsoever. Trusting the House of . Representatives w ill retain the 4d. per lb. preference which they, have twice carried, I have the honour to be, Yours faithfully, F. C. GRAY. I do not happen to know Mr Gray, but I received his letter to-day, and have quoted it in order that honourable members may be in a position to form their own conclusions. As regards the contents of the letter, I take no responsibility. Where conflicting statements are made by interested firms, honourable members must realize that there is always very great difficulty in knowing exactly where the truth lies. The firm who produce Wise's Directory are known as reputable people, and I think that their statements may be given that credence which is due to the. statepute. directory ? Why does it not contain an imprint ? printed by Brooks and Company, of Sydney, for 1904-5 and for 1905-6. I consider that a duty of 4d. per lb. as against the United Kingdom is ample protection.

There is not a word said on the other side about any orotection for the unfortunate person who is to pay. According to the Treasurer, and those who think with him, there is only one person to be considered, and that is the person who has something to gain by the duty. The smaller .section of the community have to be considered by them, and the largest section have to pay and to look pleasant, whether they can afford it or not. Ir the opinion of the Treasurer, only one person in this community has any right to'receive any consideration from the Committee, and that is the manufacturer or producer of something in Australia.

The Salvation Army, which has as fine a printing plant ,as there is here, could, I am sure, do it in less time.

Treasurer to reconsider this item, because we ought not to be asked to agree to a proposal which does not in any way represent a compromise. Mr HU ME COOK -What does the honourable member suggest? ally, I should prefer the item to be free, but, at most, I think. we ought to adhere to the duties originally carried by the Committee. At any rate, we ought not' to agree to such an evident absurdity as that now placed before us. I hope that the suggestion of the Senate will not be accepted. First we were requested to make the item free, and then, by some.extraordinary process of reasoning, the Senate go.to the other extreme and suggest duties of 30 and 20 per cent. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission-recommended 20 per cent., while the free-trade sectionrecommended 15 per cent.; and, under the circumstances, I see no reason for departing from the decision which .this Committee arrived at originally. The bulk of the glovesare imported, and the duty in the main is a revenue duty, puzzles me so often that I might as well which, of course, presses very heavily, espuzzle him' sometimes. pecially on the ladies. Duties of 15 and 10 per cent, are quite adequate for revenue -. purposes, and for protecting the small inhere. Chamber which has recommended such a reversal' is the Chamber to which we were this afternoon asked to bow down in the matter of. taxation. How can we listen to a body which would ref use to give protection amounting to 17J per cent, to the engineering industry, and yet propose duties of 30 and 20 per cent, on gloves? This is only an illustration of the unscientific way in which this Tariff has been dealt with. The bulk of the gloves included in the item aire not made in Australia, and I am prepared to vote for duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on gloves because I believe that the people who wear them can afford to contribute in that way to the revenue when the poorer sections of the people are asked to contribute so largely, under other items not taking any extreme view as to our rights in connection with these matters, but really it does occur to me that, when in connection with an item on which we proposed duties of 15 and 10 per cent., another place should have suggested that the item should be free, and should then suddenly propose double the duties to which we had agreed, if we accept such a proposal we shall be transferring the right of taxation with a vengeance to the other Chamber. though the duties suggested by the Senate on this item are; exorbitant, I must say that, so far as the right of another place to propose increased duties is concerned, I can see. no difference between this and any other item in the Tariff. I agree with the.honourable member for Dalley that if it is wrong for the Senate to propose an in. crease^ of duties in one case, it is wiong for that Chamber to propose increases in any case. I was very sorry that the motion submitted this afternoon was carried. When the leader of the Opposition so strongly objects to the Senate's proposal in connection with gloves, I want to know why he did not take the same strong objection to all the requests by the Senate for increases of duty?

In the railway carriage were two commercial travellers with a knowledge of the piecegoods trade. One of them said, when he read what the Committee had done, "" I do not know whether the members of the Federal Parliament are mad, but the fact of the matter is that what they have done will let in the rich person's material, and exclude that used by poor people."" When I reached Melbourne I called upon two soft goods merchants, and asked them whether what I had been 'informed was correct. They said that they had read the debates in Parliament, and that the effect of the amendment, carried at the instance of the honourable member for Melbourne, would be to let in the very goods which he intended to keep out. Of course, the intention of the honourable member for Melbourne was to give the poorer people the benefit. But, as a matter of fact, the 5-oz. stuff is the richest material made, and it is principally made by foreign manufacturers. I am surprised at the Treasurer supporting such a provision. It is a class tax, and he professes to be opposed to taxes which set class against class. have from people who know is exactly opposite from. what the honourable member says. weighing 5 ozs. to the square yard, is used by poor people. not necessarily be rich in quality, because it weighs 5 ozs. to the square yard. amongst the most valuable that is made. I can assure the Treasurer that there are members sitting behind him who -would rather vote to leave out the item altogether than support it in its present form. trouble me. honourable member for Batman constitutes the whole party supporting the Government. He has been very active and prominent during these Tariff debates, and has [408]2 ""cheek "" enough for many things; but if he imagines that he can speak for the whole of the supporters of the Government he has more brazen impudence than I give him credit for. I think that the CommitWhen this item was dealt tee should either make the weight provision 8 ozs., or leave the item out altogether. [10.28.] I have simply been trying to eliminate the stipulation as to weight. If the words to which I object be eliminated, the item will readPiece Goods, woollen or containing wool, including women's and children's dress flannels. The duty will still remain. But I want to obliterate this unfair preference to the foreigner ""over the Britisher. The Treasurer seems to know nothing about the question. If he believes in protection, he has .no need to resort to this subterfuge. My proposition would not interfere with the protective incidence of the item. I simply wish to sweep away the differentia tiori in favour of the foreigner, but I cannot get that idea into the Treasurer's cranium. -The proposition submitted by the honourable member for Parramatta is a very serious one. It would amount to, a tremendous invasion upon the 30 and 25 per cent, duties upon woollen goods. In fact, the effect of those duties would be swept away. Under the guise, and with the apparently good intention of having a shot at the foreigner, my honourable friend is certainly going to' cut very deeply into the duties on woollen goods if he succeeds in getting, the words referred to excised. in favour of taxing the poor woman's dress and allowing the rich woman's dress to come in free? sible for this limitation as to the weight per square yard. 1 must confess that to me it is a puzzle. How it got into the item I do not know. It was not recommended by either section of the Tariff Commission.

Paragraph 95 readsBut however attractive this or other proposals of the same nature may appear, and admitting that the adoption of new business methods has become essential for the effective federation of six separate State Post Offices, it cannot be denied that there is no direct precedent for such 'a change, either in the Commonwealth or beyond its boundaries. management of State railways in Australia presents very different problems and has been dealt with by Acts which differ considerably in their devolution of Ministerial powers.'
