'temporary congestion arises when a large number of the public clamour for immediate attention, and, in order to minimize this, a redistribution of the tellers has just been effected. A rearrangement and extension of the counter accommodation has also been determined on, and when this is completed it is expected that the accommodation and attendance will be adequate f o i all demands.

If this report is true, what action does the Minister intend to take in the matter? honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. As regards the first quotation, I am informed by Mr Morley that the report is altogether incorrect, and that on first seeing it, two days ago, he wrote to the editor requesting its correction. The second quotation is believed to be a. correct report.

Australia's Parliament by raising prohibition standard-beginnin g at hornet-ca n assist great world movement for righteousness. That telegram was signed by the Grand Chief Templar, Mr Page Hanify. received also a letter from the Sons of Temperance of Victoria, from which the following is an. extract:I can assure you of the hearty sympathy and good wishes of every member of my society, and trust the members of your honourable House will rise: to the occasion and set a noble example to our land by supporting you in your, aetion, thus consummating the desire of so many in our cause. The letter is signed by Mr Herbert R. Francis, General Secretary. These letters, together with over a hundred telegrams and letters upon the same subject that I received last year, show that there are outside this House a large number of people who are looking at this question from the national point of view, and are not merely concerned with its local aspect. rather interested last year in tlie public notice given to my motion, and particularly pleased with some comments made by the Melbourne Herald. I had the honour to -draw from that newspaper a comparison between my own attitude and that of the late Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone, who was described by Disraeli as being inr toxicated with the exuberance of his own verbosity. out how intemperate 1 was in my language, how extravagant I was. in. my illustrations, and how unfair I was to the membtrs of this Parliament. troduced this motion last session, however, that, anything I might say with regard to it would have no reflection on, and no personal application to, the members of this Parliament. day. free from any personal application, and wish only to ask honourable members to realize that, since we are charged with the national' affairs of Australia, and concerned with those things which are for the welfare of the Commonwealth, we cannot ignore our respuosibility by refusing to consider what wonld be at least the moral effect of our action, in prohibiting the sale That that of intoxicating liquors in theParliamentary Refreshment-rooms, and upon the whole question of the sale of intoxicating liquors throughout Australia. In order that honourable members and the public generally may not imagine that I am a lone voice crying in the wilderness regarding the Carrying resolution would have farviciousness of the liquor traffic, the degrading, and debasing effects of tlie use of. alcohol, and the national waste and the national loss, both in money and in lives,, that result from this traffic-in order that honourable members may realize that I am I supported in my attitude of uncompromising hostility to the trafficI propose, to make a few quotations from statements made by persons in. all walks of life in regard to this question. I begin with a quotation from a speech made by the late Queen Victoria, when addressing some South African chiefs at Windsor in 1895I am glad to see the Chiefs. . . . I approve of the provision excluding strong drink from their country. I feel strongly in this matter, and am glad to see that the Chiefs have determined to keep so great a curse from the people. Sir George Sydenham Clarke, when Governor of Victoria, saidWe cannot measure it, but we know what an amount of evil'intemperance is causing amongst us. We know, for example, that it distinctly lessens the I was brain power, and therefore the intellectual and industrial productiveness of the people. We know that it imperils physical health and helps to_ f ill oar asylums. We know that it entails crime and squalor on. thousands of homes;. and, lastly, we know that it will stamp its baneful influence on generations and generations yet to be born. Theodore Roosevelt, in Mwise y's Magazine, wroteThe. friends of the saloon-keepers denounce their opponents for' not treating the saloon busiThe Herald went on to point ness like any other. The best answer to this is that the business is not like any other business, and that the actions of the. saloon-keepers themselves conclusively prove this to be the case.

If the American people do not control it, it w ill control them. Since the honourable member's motion relatesto""the sale of intoxicating liquors",14,Liquors
17,Mr West,"I rise to a point of order.within the precincts of this building, I wish to know, Mr Speaker, whether he is in order in introducing matters relating to the sale of liquor in the United States of America, and the liquor trade in general? I contend that he is going entirely beyond the scope of his motion. give my ruling. honourable member for Brisbane is merely bringing forward illustrations to substantiate his argument in support of the passing of his motion. He is in order in doing so. honourable members that before I have finished they will have ample argument to induce them, I hope, to decide that since the liquor traffic has these evil effects in other parts of the world it is our duty to take up an attitude of hostility towards it in this House. wasting the time of the Parliament, which might be used to some better purpose. ought to withdraw that remark. when Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, saidThere are yet some great battles to be fought, some great enemies to be encountered by the United Kingdom, but the most pressing enemy is drink. It kills more than all our newest weapons of warfare, and not only destroys the body, but the mind and soul also. Let me quote now what the statesmen say. These are the words of Richard CobdenThe temperance cause lies at the foundation of all social and political reform. The Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain tion to, but would rather prefer, their health saysI f I could destroy the desire for strong drink Lord Mayor of London, at the annual meetin the people of England, what changes should ing of the Post Office Total Abstinence Sowe see? We should see our taxes removed by millions sterling ! We should see our gaols and ciety, spoke as follows :work-houses empty ! We should see more lives saved in twelve months than are consumed in a century of bitter and savage war 1 Lord Rosebery saysThoughI am not a fanatic in temperance reform, I view the uncontrolled conditions of the liquor traffic as a serious danger for two reasons :1. No one can deny that there is. a great deal too much drink in this country, and that much of the crime and much of the pauperism, and almost all the degradation prevalent in this country are attributable to the curse of Drink. 2. The liquor traffic is becoming too great a power in the State. I go so far as to say this-That if the State does not soon .noticed in further confirmation of that view that control the liquor traffic, the liquor traffic will control the State. The temperance movement has my most enthusiastic support, because it will put an end to a political ring which threatens to throttle and control the Commonwealth itself. Lord Randolph Churchill wrote as follows :Imagine what a prodigious social reform, what a bound in advance we should have made. I understand that the if we could curb and control this devilish anil destructive liquor traffic. Imagine, if by some reasonable wise legislation, we could diminish the facility of recourse to the public-house, what a large proportion of these scores of millions spent on drink would be diverted from the liquor trade, and flow over to other trades and industries. All trades would benefit; more food would be purchased, and better kinds of food ; more clothing and more furniture; more education would be given to the children, and better kind of education. Viscount Peel, Chairman of the Royal Commission on Liquor Licensing Laws, wroteI t has come to be a struggle for mastery between the State and a trade, and the time hasf u l ly come for the decision of the questionwho is to be master? The following was the opinion of the Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone:It has been said that greater calamities, greater because more continuous, have been inflicted on mankind by intemperance than by the three great historic scourges of war, famine and pestilence combined. That is true, and it is the measure of our discredit nnd disgrace. Prince Bismarck saidI f it were possible to extend the field of legislation, so that protection could be afforded to workmen against the demon of dTink, a large portion of the Social question would be solved at one stroke. An honourable member reminds me that the late King Edward and the present King George both said that they had no objecbeing drunk in water instead of wine. The He could state from personal experience that he thoroughly believed in total abstinence. . . . Total abstinence from all intoxicants made for better health. Had they any doubt on that point t Had they ever reflected that, when a man wanted to obtain the best physical results, he became a total abstainer for the time being with that object in view? Athletes, for instance, invariably became total abstainers for the time being. . . . It was part of his duty to sit on the Bench and hear all kinds of trouble .discussed in' the cases which came before him. He had there discovered that drinking in excess was productive of an immense proportion of the trouble and the crime afflicting our nation, and disgracing more or less the national flag.

23,Mr Finlayson,"Viscount Wolseley,the Posmaster-Gen'eral had stated that intemperance was responsible for 35 per cent, of the dismissals and 66 per cent, of the loss of good conduct stripes in connection with the Post Office. The experience of all departments of life was in the same direction. The Right Hon. John Burns saidI f the waste slopped at the direct cost, the trouble would be large, though computable, but the bane of drink is that the chief mischief only begins when it has passed into circulation, and it returns after many days in crime, disorder, disease, squalor, and all the abominations drink causes. Sir T. Whittaker, M.P., saidThe trade blasts and blights human happiness, degrades and pauperizes, shames the purity of women, darkens the home, and makes child life miserable, terrible, and horrible. Mr T. P. O'Connor, M.P., saidI am not a teetotal fanatic, but never shall I lose an opportunity of saying that in this country those who have to make their Uving, and especially those who have to make it under great disadvantages, are little better than lunatics if they do not cast behind them the incalculable temptations ancl the infinite perils of moderate drinking. If I wanted living object lessons to preach this gospel to the world of youth, I could point it out on the Treasury bench of the House of Commons, at this very moment. There are three teetotallers at least on the BenchMr liquors should be used at all, but there could and there is not one that hasn't helped himself in life and that isn't the better and fitter for his work because of his teetotalism. That reminds me of the fact that in this Parliament we are very fortunate in that regard. I believe that at least seven of the Mr Philip Snowden says on this matterten Ministers are teetotallers, and several of them have been life-long abstainers. The Hon. J. G. Appell, Home Secretary, poisoning in introducing the Liquor Bill in the are born; the Queensland Parliament last month, saidThe Government f u l ly realize the importance of this measure in view of the great interests involved-the physical and moral benefit of the people of the State, and the great interests^-the financial interests-connecte d with the liquor trade. . . . The question above everything else is the welfare of the people-irrespectiv e of any loss that may be caused to the State revenue owing to a decrease in the amount of liquor consumed. The Brisbane Worker in an article on 2nd September wrote as follows:When you are counting the ruling Powers of the earth, don't omit Bung. If you do, your estimate of the world's forces won't amount to much. Bung is one of the greatest monarchs of our day. There is not another who exercises so wide a sway, or claims jurisdiction over a race so aumerous, or has such absolute dominance over the bodies and souls of his subjects. Yet Bung has no country of his own. He doesn't need one. He is more powerful in the countries of other sovereigns than they themselves sure. He does just what he pleases with their possessions; not infrequently it happens that the very king on the throne is his abject slave. He goes into their courts of law, and dispenses what is known as justice. He goes into the parliaments; and the legislation bears evidence of his work. Many of the things we call "" laws"" are only beer stains on the statute book. He goes into the homes of the people, and fathers-eve n mothers-prostrat e themselves before him, and strip their children bare to offer liim sacrifice. You can't alToid to ignore Bung when you are reckoning up the ruling Powers of the earth. Under Capitalism-the supreme Despot-h e is mightiest of the vassal kings. Mr Keir Hardie, M.P., saidNational greatness did not depend upon the size of our armies and our fleets only. The country that was the most righteous was the greatest.' And it was because the drink traffic tended to hinder the realisation of that ideal that they of the working-class movement, especially the socialist element in that movement, were bound to be the most pronounced in their opposition to. the success of democracy. There was no man ivho was engaged in public work, whatever his position in politics, who could f a i l to be impressed with the magnitude of the evil of intemperance. There must be differences of opinion concerning the question as to whether alcoholic be no question about the terrible evil which drunkenness inflicted upon our nation. Those best acquainted with the Labour movement would bear him out that the strongest ally there was on the side o i reaction was intemperance. It made every movement more difficult, and tended lo thwart many a well-meant effort. The traffic is largely responsible for murder, suicide, immorality, and petty crimes; it is bodies of the children before they it sends thousands to the grave before tliey have learned to lisp; it gives to tens of thousands who survive a shattered constitution and weakened w ill ; it predisposes them to every form of illness; it is destroying the capacity for motherhood, and weakening the natural instincts of the mother. It wastes all this human l if e , ancl it involves an incalculable loss of social' wealth through physical inefficiency, mental incapacity, and loss of self-respecting ambition. It wastes the value of the lost time and expense through sickness, and the maintenance of prisons, police courts, homes, and asylums due to drink. Drink is, in fact, one of the most destructive evils, destroying mind and body, which curses the human race. John B. Lennon, Treasurer of the American Federation of Labour, savsI am against the saloon because I have been, in the organized labour movement all my life and know what the saloon has done and is doing against the workers of our country. I know that every particle of influence that goes out from, the saloon must mean the reduction of real, wages, that every cent spent in the saloon is so much wasted. I am against the saloon because organized labour has always insisted that the. children shall be kept out of the factories and",16,Liquors

Richard Treyellick saysIn my work of Labour reform I am brought The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. I . , page face to. face with, the liquor traffic. It foils our efforts to get good laws.

Powderly saysBoycott the saloon, and in five years we will suicide, immorality, crime, insanity, disease and have an invincible host arrayed on the side of death. truth and justice. John Swinton saysThe use of strong drink has always operated against Labour in its conflicts against the unfair encroachments of capital. Mr John Verran, Premier of South Australia, has taken a very courageous stand in regard to> not only drink, but gambling, which he calls the twin curses. He saysI will make no uncertain, stand, about, the Cardinal. Manning saysquestions of drink and gambling, the great twin curse.

From a sociological stand-point we are compelled, by incontrovertible evidence-, to acknowledge that it (alcohol) is, of all causes, the most frequent source of poverty, unhappiness, divorce, The late Cardinal Vaughan saidThe houses of the liquor trade are as so many vampires that suck the life-blood out of the bodies of the poor. While we strenously defend the sacred' rights of private property, how can we defend the property that depends for its value upon the physical and religious ruin of a countless number of human bodies and souls ? The drink' traffic is a public, permanent, and drink trade is our shame, scandal, and sin, 1 Would God place in my hand, a wand with which to dispel the evil of intemperance, I strike the door of every saloon, every"" traffic should be wiped from the face of the You may ask where do I stand?

The saloon is the enemy of man. It bloats his visage, corrupts his heart, weakens his will, sears his conscience, makes a common sewer of the body intended to be the temple ofGod's spirit, sends animmortal sou] -reelinginto outer darkness. The saloon is the enemy of the home. It puts out the fire, empties the larder, turns the protector of the family into a thing of"" terror and abhorrence, 'clothes the wife in rags, and brings the children to suffering and shame. The saloon is the enemy of the State. It is the breeding place of all plots and conspiracies that threaten tlie downfall of society. It is the Gibraltar of bad politics, the gathering place of thugs and repeaters, the market of the purchaseable vote, the fountain head of municipal wrong doing. .The saloon is the enemy of tlie ChuTch. Beside every sanctuary the Devil would open his pit. and Christ, fills men with hatred toward everything lovely and of good report, bars the way to the sanctuary, and laughs at the thought of God and eternity. Henry Grady, speaking of the "" Mission of the Liquor Traffic,"" says' To-night it enters a humble home to strike the roses from a woman's cheek, and to-morrow it challenges this republic in the halls of Congress. To-day it strikes a crust from the lips of a starving child, and to-morrow it levies tribute from the government itself. There is no cottage humble enough to escape it, no palace strong enough to shut it out. . It defies the law when it cannot coerce suffrage. It is flexible to cajole, but merciless in victory. It is tlie mortal enemy of peace and order, the despoiler of men and terror of women, the cloud that shadows the faces of children, the demon that has dug more graves and sent more souls unshrived to judgment than have wasted life since God sent plagues to Egypt, and all the wars since Joshua stood before Jericho. It comes to ruin, and it shall profit mainly by the ruin of your sons and mine. It comes to mislead human souls and to crush human hearts under its crumbling weight. It comes to bring grey-haired mothers down in shame and sorrow to their graves. It comes to change the wife's love into despair, and her pride into shame. It comes to still the laughter on' the lips of little children. It comes to stifle all the music of the home and fill it with silence and desolation. It comes to ruin your body and mind, to wreck your home, and it knows it must purchase its prosperity by the swiftness and certainty with which it wrecks this world. R. E. Glenn, Governor of North Carolina, saysThe curse of drink brings mourning instead of rejoicing, tears instead of laughter, rags instead of clothing, disease instead of health, insanity instead of strong mind, crime instead of law and order, death instead of life. Dr. D. Wallace Smith says: If drink makes it harder for a man or a woman to ibe honest, truthful, pure, upright, and efficient, it is a thing to be condemned. If strong drink robs men and women of their ""best qualities, their character, and their souls, then, in God's name, away with it. According to the Indianapolis NewsThe saloon is a running sore on the body politic. It is a vicious, contagious, dangerous plague spot.' There is not room for it and liberty both to live. One or the other must go. This is Abraham Lincoln's opinionWhether or not the world would be vastly benefited by a total and final banishment from it of all intoxicating drink seems to me to be not now an open question. Three-fourths of mankind confess the affirmative with their tongues, and I believe all the rest acknowledge it in their hearts. It builds up a barrier between the soul Then General Grant tells us thatThe intoxicating cup is of the devil, and leads to hell, and we will neither touch, taste, or handle the poisonous liquid, nor have any fellowship with those who fatten on the woes and miseries of mankind by its sale and manufacture. Drink is the greatest curse, because practically all crime and all disaster are the result of it. Nearly every great disaster in the country, barring accidents of nature, is due to drink Ninety-five per cent I wil l make it no less-of desertions and acts of lawlessness in the army is due to drink, If I could, by offering my body as a sacrifice, free this country from this f e l l cancer, the demon drink, I would thank the Almighty for the privilege of doing it. General Booth is of the opinion thatThe mighty torrent of alcohol, fed by 10,000 manufactories, sweeps on, bearing with it , .1 have no hesitation in , saying, the foulest, bloodiest tide that ever Sowed from earth to eternity. The late Dr. MacLaren, of Manchester-, says thatNo single vice drags after it more infallibly such a multitude of attendant demons as the vice of drunkenness, which is the crying sin of England to-day. . . By the soul only are the nations great and free, and a nation can be neither where the drink fiend has its way. Another divine, the Rev. W. Walsh, of Scotland, has expressed himself in these termsA monopoly, the most gigantic, determined, and unconscionable that ever dug its fangs into the vitals of mankind, is represented by tiie traffic in alcoholic liquors. It is bound up with the selfish interests of every class in the community-fro m the working man, up through the parson and the bishop, to the M.P. and -the K eer-and from the legislature's triumphant eight looks down upon the shaking or the f a l l of other institutions; while they crumble and totter, it apparently flourishes in immortal youth. 'A French authority, the late Brouardel, of Paris, wroteThis invasion of alcoholism ought to be regarded by every one as a public danger, and the principle that the future of the world will be in the hands of the temperate ought to be inculcated as a truth that is incontestable. Let me now turn to the statements of authors and poets. Rudyard Kipling tells how, in the city of Buffalo, he saw two young men get two girls drunk, and then lead them reeling down a dark street. He writesThen recanting previous opinions, I became n prohibitionist. Better it is that a man should go without his beer in public places, and content himself with swearing at the narrowmindedness of the majority; better it is to poison the inside with very vile temperance drinks, and to buy lager furtively at back doors, than to bring temptation to the lips of young fools, such as the four I had seen. I understand now why the preachers rage against strong drink. I have said ' There is no harm in it taken moderately,' and yet my own demand for beer helped directly to send these two girls reeling down the dark street to-God alone knows what end. If liquor is worth drinking, it is worth taking a little trouble to come atsuch as a man will undergo to compass his own devices. It is not good that we should let it lie before the eyes of children, and I have been a fool in writing to the contrary. Marie Corelli, writing on the subject, local option contest in New South Wales, saysAs for the drink evil, I wish that every one of the Grand Hotel, Bathurst, wrote.into whose hands this book may fal l would honestly try to realize the widespread misery, disease, pauperism, crime, and lunacy for which that hideous vice is responsible, and would add his or her wish to mine, in a strong prayer that the wicked financial fortunes derived by the few out of the physical debasement of the many may be checked and finally come to naught, so that the British people, released at last from the dominant sway of the liquor traffic, may rise to the best of everything in them-the best of brain, the best of work, the best of health, and the best of life. perate people must always be a strong people, and to hold our own in the days that are coming we shall need all the strength that sound minds and sound bodies can _ give us. There is no room in Britain for a national vice which betrays a national weakness. Other authors whose opinions I might quote are Hall Caine, the late E. P. Roe, "" Ralph Connor,"" and "" John Strange Winter."" In the centenary edition of the poems of Robert Burns is a short address to William Steward, one of his acquaintances. It gives the experience of one who knew the -sufferings that come to every drunkard after a debauch, and is as followsIn honest Bacon's ingle-neuk, Here maun I sit and think; Sick o' the warld and warld's-folk, An' sick, damn'd sick o' drink.

Drink is a foe that has overcome such great men as Pitt, Addison, Sir George Trevelyan, Charles Lamb, Hartley Coleridge, and "" Bonnie Prince Charlie"" in England, and Webster and Poe in the United States of America. abuse of intoxicating liquors. that objection later. I wish now to make a series of quotations of the views expressed by persons in the liquor trade. I have no quarrel with them individually. They must accept full responsibility for what they are doing, and are answerable to their own consciences, but it is the traffic with which I am at war. During the recent Mr Richard Kenna., the licensee and owner I have an interest in three hotel properties, and under these circumstances it is compulsory for me to handle filthy lucre accruing from the sale of detestable liquor. The public will be surprised to hear I abhor my hotel associations. Five years' experience convinces me that in any phase the liquor traffic which the union is attempting to defend is a curse and a scourge to humanity. I could wade through a category of deplorable scenes of crime, starvation, and ruin, of which I have been an eye-witness, A temthrough this cursed liquor traffic. When before the Victorian Tariff Commission, Mr Saul Joshua saidThere is humbug in all trades, and that in the spirit trade is beyond description. Referring to the evidence of Mr P. Daly, the secretary of the Victorian United Licensed Victuallers' Association, the Australasian saidThe public have long suspected that lliey were being slowly poisoned, and it will be consoling to receive the official assurance that their suspicions were perfectly well founded. In an essay written by Charles Buxton, M.P., a famous brewer, and published i i i the North British Review, these passages occurI t is in vain that any engine is set to work that philanthropy can devise, when those whom we seek to benefit are habitually tampering with",17,Liquors

The next war, the next naval battle, will demand from you sound nerves. Nerve power will decide the victory. Now, the nerves are ruined, damaged from youth by the use of alcohol. . . . The nation which absorbs the least amount of alcohol will carryhome the victory. By order of the Emperor, a copy of Alcohol and Virility, a German temperance publication, is handed to every recruit on entering the military and naval service. Vice-Admiral King Hall, who is now in charge of the Australian station, in an address at tlie Seamen's Institute on 4th May last, saidA total abstainer all my life, and believing in it implicitly, I gladly say a word on the subject to-night. My father became an abstainer when he was captain of a man-of-war, and I followed his good and wise example. Personally it affects me favourably in three waysI am better in health, in pocket, and in nerves. . At least 60 to 70 per cent, of our troubles come from alcohol, LIFE , many of REASON, most of PROPERTY J and therefore we must leave it alone. I personally, on leaving England, thanked His Majesty King George for permitting us to drink his health in water, and His Majesty said he was pleased to think so many did so. In conclusion he saidI have seen the evils of intemperance and the blessedness of total abstinence, and cannot but speak of what I know. I have here a statement showing thatA test of precision in marksmanship was made in the Swedish army. Out of thirty shots fired On a second series of days, the men were allowed brandy containing alcohol equal to what one would get in two to two and one-half three hits out of thirty shots. Another series of tests was performed without hits. The wind, weather, and light were all better they were shooting better. I shall now give the House a quotation retions, and in this way predisposes mento strife lating to the experience of one of our own and British ships. Vice-Admiral King Hall statesThe HMS. Natal affords an interesting illustration of the effects of alcohol on the nerve's. They keep a daily record of the big gun practice, and it has been noticed that there are disour asylums, there is gradually creeping over tinct and regular gradations in the shooting record, whicb is at its worse the day after leave, and at its best at the day before leave. This the men. call the "" grog curve."" A deputation waited on the captain and asked him not only to arrange the battle firing test for the day before leave, but also to postpone the giving of the daily portion of rum until the evening of that day,, the result being that the Natal has won the battle-firing test two years running. With regard to the effect of alcohol on national efficiency, I propose to make only one more quotation. Royal Commission lately appointed to inquire into the question of the health of miners reported thatSome attention was given to the part played by alcohol in connection with the health of ture of the body. It. can only do that by miners. The death register examined revealed diminishing the activity of the vital processes. a considerable number of deaths in past years .It also diminishes very gyeatly the power of reasonably ascribable to this cause, and althe muscles, and it diminishes the intellectual though the relative proportions appear to have power of the nervous system.

The as I soon Safeguard writesA strong nation cannot be made out of weak citizens. No nation can be stronger than the band which binds its individual citizenship together. brotherhood in the hearts of the people. The genius of the liquor traffic is diametrically opProfessor A. Forel, of the University of posed to this spirit of brotherhood. The saloon has absolutely no respect for law. It obeys only when it must. This' is true under any and all conditions. An evil tree cannot be made good by building a fence around it, nor can access to that tree be prevented by limiting the number of the entrances. An institution which thrives only as it destroys men will never hesihuman diet. tate to destroy laws. Professor Sikovsky, of St. Petersburg, has address delivered at the Church House, said thatAlcohol diminishes the rapidity of thought, makes the imagination and power of reflection commonplace and deprived of originality, acts upon fine and complex sensations by transforming them into coarse and elementary ones; provokes outbursts of evil passions and disposiUr. Finlayson. crime, and upsets habits of work and perseverance. Then again we have the statement of Dr. Theo. B. HyslopIn spite of the evidence of the ravages of alcohol in filling our hospitals, our prisons, and the country a more intelligent appreciation of the fact that if we are to maintain our health, our morals, and our sanity, we must set ourselves with renewed vigour to the task of averting disaster by overcoming the curse of alcoholism. Professor Sims Woodhead saysPeople taking alcohol are interfering very seriously, first of a l l , with, the building up of the body, and, secondly, with the getting rid of these waste and poisonous products which are constantly acting against our interests. A l The Queensland cohol is a poison in itself-bu t it is worse than that it interferes with the tissues of the body, and in getting rid of the poisons which ought to be gotten rid of.

The train of physical wreckage that lies in the wake of drunkenness is, unfortunately, a matter of only too common knowledge. 1 -should like, rather, to occupy your time for ten minutes in dealing with the effect of alcohol on the body generally producer alcohol is exceedingly extravagant, aad, like other extravagant measures, it is apt to lead to .a physical bankruptcy. It is well known that troops cannot march on alcohol. I was with the relief column that moved on to Lady smith. It was an extremely trying time apart from the heat <if the weather. In that column of some 30,000 men, the first who dropped out -were not the tall men, or the short men, ordie big men, or the little .men-bu t the drinkers, and they dropped out as clearly as if they had been labelled with a big letter on their backs. . . . Xhere is a great desire on the part of all young men to be "" fit."" A young man cannot be fit if he takes alcohol. By no possibility can he want it. No one who is young and healthy can want alcohol any more than he can want strychnine. I would now invite the attention of the House to a statement made by Mr Thomas 'A. Edison, the famous inventor, who, in the course of an address delivered in England lately, saidI think you people have too many whisky shops here. Coming down from Liverpool I noticed that at every place we stopped, it seemed to be all whisky shops, with just an occasional grocery store trying to squeeze its way. I am sorry, very sorry, for this is not a good thing for the people. As to the effect of alcohol on physical effiParliament, in which he wroteciency, I propose now to refer to the exstainers periences of Polar expeditions. Let me have a lower mortality than those that are not quote, first of all, a statement made by abstainers. There is a wide-spread popular belief Professor David, of the Sydney University, that some stimulant is required in the tropics, at the great reception in the Town Hall, especially Sydney, given to him upon his return from the tlie AntarcticThroughout the long journey, extending over at least four months, the party never had one drop of alcohol. On one occasion, for a comrade, it being a birthday celebration, they had just a little wine, and* they found their resistance to cold dropped, so they dropped alcohol. I would quote in this connection certain interesting statements from a journal of the proceedings of the forty-third session of the Supreme Lodge, International Order of Good Templars, held at Hamburg in June lastFrom the days of Commander Nares, who set out in 1875, with four Good Templars, to reach the North Pole, until the present time, total abstinence has been satisfacorily tested on all such expeditions. Nansen, the Norwegian explorer, returned the Scotch whisky sent to him as being useless to him on his Antarctic travels. Commander Peary, the American explorer, declares : "" No man can drink alcoholic liquors who goes to the North. It would mean death to the man, and a menace to the expedition."" Sir Ernest Shackleton, the British explorer, gives as his opinion that "" alcohol is useless in these climates."" Lieutenant Shirase, the Japanese explorer, and Captain Scott, the British explorer, both of whom (on separate expeditions), are .now proceeding to the South Pole, have fitted .'out their expeditions on similar lines. I .propose now to follow my references to the experiences of Polar expeditions by As a work some statements regarding expeditions in tropical countries. I have here an extract from Across Paflua, by Colonel Kenneth Mackay, CB.., Chairman of the Federal Royal Commission, who crossed Papua in IQO6Personally, I . . . have used tea as a daily drink from Beira to Cape Town, over 8,000 miles, in India, and from sea to sea in Papua, with such good results that I would never dream of drinking anything else in a tropical country, or when engaged in work that demanded constant and severe exertion. Whatever may be said against tea, one thing is beyond all possibility of denial-alcoho l is the very worse drink a man can indulge in in Papua. It is directly responsible for more breakdowns than all the diseases put together, aad, indirectly, accounts for an enormous percentage of malarial deaths and recurrences. . . The natives who are universally free from alcohol craving, call all liquor "" s ill y white man's medicine."" As regards Papua, they could not give it a better name. Sir William McGregor, who had a wider tropical experience than perhaps any other living man has had, when Lieutenant Governor of British Nlew Guinea-no w Papua-presente d a report to the Victorian In my experience people that are total abin the Colony enjoy better health, and by people that have in a cooler climate been accustomed to it. This will not stand test of experience. It is a matter that any one not a total abstainer can prove for himself in a month. I have not known a missionary that was of intemperate habits; but it is easy to see that the missionary that has no alcoholic stimulant with his meals is healthier than he that has. The principle applies to all residents in the country, but it is easier to see in the case of the missionaries tlian among other classes, because their habits and practice are more regular and uniform. The missionaries that as a class are total abstainers are the healthier, and stand exposure better than others. The man that is a total abstainer bears very much better the onset of fever than the man that is not; and he is also less liable to other diseases. One rather interesting feature of this question of the effect of alcohol on physical efficiency is the position taken up by railway companies in various parts of the world. Honourable members are no doubt aware that every railway company in the United States of America absolutely prohibits the use of intoxicants by its servants, who are subject to immediate dismissal if tliey are found indulging in them either when on or off duty. A somewhat similar practice obtains in Queensland. South Wales.",20,Liquors

One immediate result of the publication of that report was that over forty towns and cities in England spent money placarding the walls and hoardings with warnings in regard to alcohol and physical degeneracy. That movement originated, I believe, in France, where the people, aroused by the enormous decrease in the physical vitality of the nation, particularly among the young men, placarded Paris and other French cities and towns on the question/ Here is an extract from a placard dis^ played in Paris in 1902 by order of the French Governmentmany of them most deadly-paralysis , insanity, alcoholic.

Let me quote what leading doctors say on are first affected by alcoholic drink-judgment , the question. Dr. Breinl, Director of the for example; Australian Institute of Tropical Medicine, the' -Townsville, in his report on the results of prime danger, of such drinks; the true lights of his journey to the northern parts of the mind are quenched by them, and the false Queensland, indicates that alcoholism, does and misleading ones are kindled. much to impair the health of the QueensDr. Lorenz, the famous Austrian surgeon, land cane-cutters. He saysIs the white man able to stand the strain of cutting cane in the tropical parts of North Queensland without having his health permanently injured? The consideration, and, if possible, the solukeep on edge. As a surgeon I must not drink. tion of this question, seems to be of vital importance for the development of the sugar industry in North Queensland, and would also throw some light upon the White Australia question generally. In my personal opinion, alcoholism and other debilitating habits do much more than cane cutting to impair the health of the workers. Professor Anderson Stuart, of Sydney, mitted on the areas of the works. With stated lately, in a, lectureI t is by the muscular system of the body that ing has been published :we do work, and there is no more frequent excuse for the consumption of alcohol than that it increases the working power of the bodv. We'l now, that is a little true and a great deal not true. It is a little true to this extent, that by the temporary stimulation of the heart it enables a man perhaps to do a little bit of a snurt, but that spurt is very soon over. The staying power has suffered; and you can ask yourself what is it in the world that does most-the spurt or the stay. Sir Victor Horsley, in reply to a press correspondent, wrote as follows :My work as a surgeon commonly means a day of hard physical manual work, as well as intellectual, and I do it best on water. But I should like to add that as regards the instru ments he mentions, namely, the pick and the shovel, I have had considerable experience of them, too. The last occasion on which I did continuous work of the kind was some years ago, when I was occupied for two or three weeks in excavating deep trenches in heavv boulder clay to explore some Roman foundations. M<day's digging was always at least eight hours' long (usually more), my hands were kept in good condition by alcohol applied externallv. and when at the end of the day I returned home I went to a refreshing tea, and did not narcotise myself in the public-house on the road. Some day "" Moderate Drinker"" and his fellow citizens who subscribe so liberally to the maintenance of the drink trade will agree with me that no nation which habitually narcotises itself gives itself a fair chance in the International struggle for existence. Professor Sims Woodhead saysI want you to realise that those who have made a careful study of this alcohol question are satisfied that the best work is done by any individual-and I don't care who he is-if he abstains from the use of intoxicating liquors. Dr. Lauder Brunton expressed the follow; ing views: We find that the highest powers of the mind the whole of the lower powers of mind, 'such as imagination, being made more active than before. Herein consists the statedI am a surgeon. My success depends upon my brain being clear, my muscles firm, my nerves steady. No one can take alcoholic liquor without blunting those physical powers which I must I have also some rather interesting statements on the question of how the capacity for hard physical toil is affected by the use of drink. An immense work is at present going on at the Barren Jack Reservoir, now being constructed in New South Wales, and no intoxicants are perregard to the Panama Canal, the followThe work of making a great canal from Panama to Colon, uniting the Pacific with the Atlantic, was commenced in 1879, but suspended in 1889. The district was called "" the white man's grave,"" owing to the fearful death rate. The open saloon for the sale of intoxicating liquors to the workmen was considered by many one of the causes of this evil. In 1904 the United States Government purchased the property for $40,000,000 (^8,000,000), and by an International treaty agreed to construct the canal at a further cost of $140,000,000 (^28,000,000). In recommencing the work the canal commissioners determined to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors along the whole route, except at Panama and Colon, where the saloons were already licensed under the laws of the Republic. The results have been most advantageous. Sir Harry Johnston, KC.B., says: "" T he whole of the canal zone (10 miles on either side of the canal banks) is ' teetotal.' No alcohol is sold by the canal commissioners at its hotels or boarding houses, and the general result of these stern measures-the improvement in health and the absence of crime-ampl y justifies this anti-alcohol policy. Of course, there still remain some Americans (and some Britons) who kill themselves with alcohol if it can possibly be managed, and so "" alcoholism"" emanating from the grog stores at Panama and Colon accounts for a few deaths among the employees-jus t enough to show one what a pandemonium might rage here in the little army of 26,000 men but for the prohibition policy of the Canal Commissioners. Here is an interesting quotation with regard to the same matterIn South Africa, during the General Election in Cape Colony (IQOQ), Mr Merriman, the Prime Minister, stated to a deputation of . the W.C.T.U. ; "" The wine-drinking Latin races are notoriously healthy; in fact, the Italians actually endured conditions, while working on the construction of the .London Tube Railway, which the English navvies found insupportable."" This statement was absolutely untrue. The 'general manager respecting this matter, said : "" The statement that Italians were employed in the construction of London tubes because Britishers failed, is quite untrue. Italians might bave been employed in some instances, such as to do Mosaic pavement work, at -which they are experts, but for general labour they were not employed."" On the question of national m in e and disorder, as affected by the sale of intoxicating drinks, let me quote a f e w authorities who know what they are t a l k in g about. tice of Victoria, in a letter dated Government wroteJ regret to have to say that excess of drink beyond all doubt or question, is either the cause or the object of a large proportion of the crime of our community. Much of the gravest crime is directly traced to the influence on or to -the mental disablement produced by alcoholic liquor in those who commit it. On the other hand, a great deal of less grave crime is committed with the object chiefly of obtaining such liquor. SirH a r t l e y W ill i a m s , of Victoria, saidI have observed with painful interest the very numerous instances in which prisoners who have been tried before me, have, under the influence of drink, committed offences which it was manifested they would not otherwise have committed . I do not hesitate to say that one-half of those falling within the class of first offenders, who have been tried before me in the country, have committed the offence for which they have been placed upon their trial while under the influence of drink. Judge Docker, is thus reported in the SydneyM o r n in g He r a l d in dealing with an important licensing case connected with the borough of Mosman yesterday afternoon at the Darlinghurst Appeal Court, he took occasion to refer to the practice of drinking in its relation to crime. He thought that drink was responsible for a great deal of the crime that was committed, and in his position he had considerable opportunities of judging in this matter. He supposed that, if it could .be prohibited, they would have a kind of Garden of Eden or an Arcadia. Sir CharlesL ill e y , late Chief Justice and Premier of Queensland, saidConstant observation has founded in my mind the settled belief that the use of intoxicating liquors is the prime factor in the production of crime. There are otheT vices and passions which occasionally tend to crime, but even the-re drink will very generally be found awakening and arousing them to destructive energy. In almost every crime of violence tlie drunkenness of the prisoner and his victim either urged on or tempted the criminal to the commission of the offence. I have further a firm conviction that if the women of this country would refuse to sanction the use of intoxicating drinks in their homes, and on festive occasions everywhere, and if they would furnish a constant example of abstinence themselves, they would Mr Finlayson. bring a priceless blessing to their country, sad secure the eternal gratitude of the future generations of Australia. Mr Justice Hodges, speaking in the Melbourne .Exhibition. Building on the 15th September, 1898, saidI wish to say again to-night, that drink ties at the .root of most of the evils of the community. I am not, and never bave been, a member of any total abstinence, or even temperance, society, and am no faddist, but try virtue of the office I hold it is my duty .to watch the causes which pontribute to the falling, of my fellow-citizens; I say this deliberately, Sir JohnM a d d e n , the Chief Justhat not only is drink responsible for more crime than any other single cause, but it is responsible for more crime than all other causes put toHouse, 23rd November, 1900, gether. The stages of most men's downfall are marked by the one pervading evil-drink . If you want to study the awful influences of drink on human l if e in one of its saddest phases, go to the Divorce Court. Almost all the wretchedness there paraded has its origin in drink. Mr Justice Hodges further saidAfter close upon nineteen years' experience in the Criminal and Divorce CourtsI can repeat what I said publicly some years ago, that drink is either directly or indirectly responsible for more crime, more sin, more domestic misery than all otber causes put together. It is appalling to no.te the number of crimes that are traceable to drink, and still more awfu] to sit in a Divorce Court and hear detailed the squalor, the poverty, the domestic misery, the utter destruction of home life that result from indulgence to excess in intoxicating drinks. A late Chief Justice of Victoria, Sir William A'Beckett, saidI say advisedly that in nine cases out of ten that come before me judicially in Australia intoxication or the public house, was directly or indirectly the cause. Mr Justice Simpson, of New South Wales, saidThere is not the least doubt that drink is the cause of a good deal of crime. I have seen it in every phase of l if e during my experience as Crown Prosecutor, Chajrman of Quarter Sessions, and as a Supreme Court Judge. I have no hesitation in -saying that were it not for the drink there would be a very great diminution in crime. In the Divorce CourtI see wretchedness and unhappiness and misery, all frequently brought about by drink. My experience is that many of the cases of cruelty that come before the Court are tie result of drink. Judge Molesworth, Chairman of the Metropolitan Licensing Bench, Victoria, saidI think drunkenness is the cause of a great deal of the crime that exists among us. Mr Justice Kerferd, who went from tbe brewery to the Bar, saidthe calendar began and ended with drink. Judge"" Dowling, of New South Wales, saidSince 1849 he had sat either as a judge or police magistrate-and was in a position 'to know what was the cause of our gaols being so full-and had probably tried more criminal cases in New South Wales than any other man. He felt convinced that if nine-tenths of the Colony's public houses were closed he, as a criminal Judge, would soon have nothing lo do, and the gaols of the country would be almost empty. Sir Frederick Darley, late Chief Justice of New South Wales, saidSeven-tenths of the crime in the community can be traced directly, or almost directly, to drink. At the first assize at which I presided, every single case was directly traceable to drink. Many years ago, Sir William Denison saidIn. my position as Governor, not only of this general population being below i per cent.). Other Colony (New South Wales), but also of the neighbouring Colony of Tasmania, I have had f u l l experience of the baneful effects of income epileptic. Also, the families tend to die temperance, and I can safely say that ninety out of every hundred of those unfortunate persons suffering the penalty of their crimes can trace their misfortunes to intoxicating liquors. ThenI have the report of the Inspectorquence General of Penal Establishments in Victoria, a statement signed by the warders alcoholic drink, and stimulants should be absoof the Sydney prison, and other docu-. lutely forbidden during school life. In adolesments, ajl showing the evil effects of incence they impair self-control, and are a source toxicating liquor from the point of view of of national crime. .

Mr Richard Teece, children."" Sir Henry Parkes saidthe actuary of that society, has, according to the Rechabitetaken the favorable experience of the A.M.P. and compared it with the temperance section of the United Kingdom Temperance and General Provident institution with this result :-Actua l deaths among select A.M.P. lives, 8,259; according to the British Temperance experience these would have been 7,607; excess in A.M.P. 652. The inference is that if all the A.M.P. policy-holders had been abstainers there would have been 652 fewer deaths among them; that their wonderfully low mortality would have been lower still. But this is only half the truth, t f the abstainers in the A.M.P. were in a separate section-as they ought to be-and Mr Eighty years ago, when the Norwegians were Teece bad been able to compare moderate drinkers by themselves with abstainers, the conborn, died before they reached their first birthday trast would have been much more striking. The many abstainers in the A.M.P. have helped to keep down the average death rate. As it is, Mr Teece says :"" In view of the remarkably favorable mortality experienced in this society, this result should be a useful weapon in the hands of temperance advocates."" There is rather a pathetic aspect to this question in so far as it relates to children. Dr. Mary Stone, of Melbourne, saidA large number of children of drinkers are physically or mentally, abnormal-8 2 to 93 per cent., according to different authorities. . . . Dr. Sullivan personally investigated 600 children, born of 120 drunken mothers, and found 55 per cent, were still-born or died before they were two years o l d ; and of the survivors, 4.1 per cent, became epileptic (the ratio in the investigators have found 12 to 15 per cent, of the surviving children of alcoholics have beout. There is nothing more startling than the fearful mortality amongst children in conseSir of the abuse of alcohol by parents. William Broadbent saysChildren should never know the taste of any danger. At all ages when taken to relieve feelings of weakness or faintness, serious danof falling under their influence is close at Dr. James Ewing, of Leeds, saysWhat we want to drive home as members of Dr. Norman Ker estimates give it up for their own sakes as fathers and they should give up taking alcohol for the sake of their children, because they might When the innocent and promising boys and girls get up of a' morning, let them feast their eyes upon the beautiful in nature, and not glasses and' bottles, the remains of a night's drinking in the home; adorn the tables, the mantel, and the sideboards with flowers-cultivate the lovely plants yourselves; teach the little ones to plant and grow them about the home, and never under any circumstances allow them to see the beer bottle and jug brought into the house, or the effects of their maddening and debauchery contents, consumed with idle and backbiting chattermaggery and slander. Speaking of drink and infanticide, a note in the Lutheran Standard saysa drinking people, .300 of every 1,000 childrenanniversary. people, the ratio is 80 and 90 per r,ooo. Bavaria, where the drink evil still exists, of every 1,000 born, 300 do not survive a year. Of the 237,000 born last year, 6,500 were stillborn, and 69,000 died within a year.

The proportionate increase in the Commonwealth has been greater than that of any other country with the statistics of which I am acquainted. bread riots such as have occurred in the Old World. into controversial matters, but I say, without fear of contradiction, that the cost of living, certainly in New South Wales, has gone up, I should think, nearly 40 per cent, since 1900. -increase d rents or increased cost of food supplies ? as a whole, has increased. The position is so serious that the Government of New South Wales have had to appoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole subject. There are many causes for the increase. In our efforts to facilitate labour getting a fair remuneration for its services, through the medium of either Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts, we have undoubtedly put up, to a certain extent, the cost of comonly the expression of his own individual modities. I am not putting the matter controversially, and do not give that as the only reason for the increase. If a man receiving higher wages in one industry has to pay more for the necessaries of life owing to the wages being put up in the industries which produce those necessaries, his position is not so prejudiced, because his wages have gone up with the increase; but a man in the Government service, receiving a fixed pay, feels the pinch all the time. The difficulty all through in regard to the Permanent Military Forces is that, although the present pay and allowances might have been a. fair thing in 1900, it will require a good deal of argument to satisfy us that they are adequate to the extent of the services rendered, and to the cost of living to-day. If wages in general employment go up, and the cost of living as a whole rises, the pay and allowances of the Public Service of the Commonwealth ought to go up in equal proportions. Minister of Defence make proper provision for the payment of those under him? refused point-blank to have an inquiry into the matter. sponsibility off his shoulders ? [79]2 absolve him from a shred of responsibility. It simply gives him the opportunity of having an impartial body to go into the whole question of wages, and will strengthen his hands if he is anxious to increase the pay and allowances of the Permanent Forces. He will afterwards have I do not desire to enter to act on his own responsibility as to whether he accepts or rejects, or as to how far he will act upon, the recommendations of the Committee. The honourable member for North Sydney appears to have chosen bis Committee quite impartially. There aro on, it men from both sides of the Chamber. There are the honourable member for Newcastle, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and the Honorary Minister, from the Ministerial side; and there are the honourable member for Franklin, the honourable member for Parkes, the mover and myself, from this side. I cannot see why the Ministry should refuse to appoint so impartial a Committee. I had hoped that the statement which emanated from the present Postmaster-General was opinion, and that the Government would see the desirability of letting the House know, through an impartial body, what is a fair rate of wages and allowances in this service. There are enough strong Government supporters nominated on the Committee to see that recommendations for increases in pay, & c, are not made greater than the Government would perhaps like. Committee would not finally decide what wages should be paid. pointed out, it will be only an advisory Committee. If a Committee consisting of violent partisans were to be appointed and conduct its labours with the definite object of embarrassing the Minister, I could understand him being afraid of being placed in the position of refusing to act on its recommendations; but the body proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney is an impartial bond fide Committee of inquiry into a subject which ought non-commissioned officers and men of our Permanent Forces.

That is a curious anomaly which might well be inquired into in this connection, although I do not think it is nearly so important as the inquiry into the pay and allowances of the non-commissioned officers and men. That is a most urgent matter, and in common justice to them ought to be attended to at once. I move That the word "" commissioned"" be inserted before the word "" warrant."" Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [4.46] I second the amendment. seems incredible that the Government should offer any objection to so simple a proposal as that now before the House. After all, the Committee is asked for only with a view to inquiring into the pay and allowances of those connected with the military service. The Committee may make recommendations but the Government alone have the right and power to say whether they shall be given effect to, or whether the present conditions shall remain. The mover of the motion desires to ascertain whether the rates of pay in the sections of the service specified are commensurate with-the cost of living in the community, and adequate for the duties they have to perform. Surely it is not the desire of the Government, or of the party supporting them, or, I hope, of any honourable member, that our military service should be paid less well than any other branch of the Commonwealth service. If these men are underpaid, it is our duty, in looking after their interests, and the incost of living, general rates of wages outterests of the community generally, and in enforcing the general wish of the people of this country, to see that their wages are increased to a proper and reasonable standard, according to the nature of the duties they have to perform. It has been said that the junior officers in the Australian service have a higher rate of pay than that whichprevails in. Great Britain. But it is more apparent than real when we look at all the facts. A comparison of the rates for certain grades shows that a company sergeant-major in the Imperial service receives 6s., and in the Australian service6s. 3d.; a sergeant gets 5s. and 5s. 6d. respectively ; a corporal, 4s. and 4s. 6d. respectively; a bombardier, 3s. od. and 4s. 3d. respectively; and a gunner, 2s. 5d. and 43. respectively. about the last figures. Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -The figures from which I am quoting are compiled by those within the service who should know something about the rates of pay, but I take no personal responsibility for their accuracy. Those who compiled them should be in a better position to speak with authority on these matters than we who are mere la ymen, without any inside knowledge of the workings of the Department. Although the figures indicate that a slightly higher rate of pay prevails for those officers here, it is not in any way proportionate to the higher rates of pay prevailing in general outside occupations here as comIt pared with Great Britain. I believe the pay of ordinary citizens in the Commonwealth is no less than from 80 per cent, to something like 130 per cent, in some occupations greater than in Great Britain. If the rates of pay of those officers were increased in proportion to the difference in the cost of living, and the difference in wages to the Government, as between citizens in Great Britain and Australia, I understand from the list which has been supplied to me that the pay of a company sergeant-major here would be ios. od. instead of 6s. 3d.; of a sergeant, 9s., instead of 5s. 6d.; of a corporal, 7s. 2d., instead of 4s 6d.; of a bombardier, 6s. 9d., instead of 4s. 3d.; and of a gunner, 4s. 4d., instead of 4s. I do not say that those are the rates of pay that should prevail. That could be determined only aftet inquiry into all the circumstances. We should ascertain definitely what is a fair rate of pay for the services which these people perform for the Commonwealth in their military capacity, in the light of the side, ancl other vital considerations. It seems, from what we can learn so far, that the rates of pay in the permanent Defence Forces of the Commonwealth are very small as compared with those received by the Imperial Forces, when those conditions are taken into account. I do not know whether the utterance of the Postmaster-General on this subject last week was merely the expression of his own opinion, or was indicative",31,Smith Shoul D Not The To Be Dealt With In Common Fairness To The
54,Mr Page,"-There is something wrongof the attitude of tlie Government as a whole. If it was the latter, I sincerely trust the Government will reconsider their position in relation to the question, and at least allow a Select Committee to be appointed in order to ascertain all the facts. No harm can be done by an inquiry of this kind, and I can see no reasonable objection to the passage of the motion. [4.55] I support the motion as proposed to be amended by the honourable member for Wentworth. The Government would be well advised to permit an inquiry of the kind into the whole question of the pay ancl emoluments of officers and men. I cannot see that any ill could result, but, rather, that a Select Committee would prove a great source of help to the Ministry in launching the new defence scheme. There are a great many readjustments required from various aspects of administration. For instance, a Select Committee could investigate the question whether a number of officers now performing civilian duties should be under the Defence authorities or under the Public Service Commissioner. At present, the control is divided, with consequent confusion. Since seven honourable members are to form the Committee, I suggest, having regard to the state of parties in the House, that it would be well if fhe Government party were given the odd man rather than that the personnel should be as proposed in the motion. It is, in my opinion, a very proper thing that the Minister representing the Defence Department in this House should be a member of a Select Committee of this character, because he will be able to see that the Department is properly represented and its interests safeguarded. An inquiry bf the kind would, I think, save the Ministry some unpleasant duties. Honourable members will have seen that, at Home,, the Postmaster-General has consented to a thorough inquiry into the staff arrangements of the whole Department; this., in England, is considered to be no reflection on the Minister. under .threat of a strike. -that such an inquiry is held to be no reflecthose who had set out on a similar mission tion on the Minister.; and, on more than one occasion, there have been inquiries by Commissions into the administration of the War Office. Very often, schemes of reform are suggested, and taken advantage of by the Government, with good results to the Department, the country, and all concerned. If I thought tliat an inquiry of the kind would in the slightest degree embarrass the Minister, I should vote against the motion, but, as I say, I think the Government would be well advised to accept the proposal. It may mean tlie obtaining of information from the War Office ait Home; and if the Committee do not conclude their labours before the end of the session, they might, as is done frequently, both bere .and at ,Home, ibe constituted a Royal Commission. There is a scheme for the payment of officers suggested in Lord Kitchener's recommendations, but I see no reference to that in the Estimates; the whole matter would be better for an inquiry by an impartial body, such as that now suggested. see that the Government have anything to fear from the motion now before us. I do not support the appointment of a Select Committee because I hope to obtain any political kudos thereby. While I cannot vote for the amendment to include officers in this inquiry, I think the subject ought to be probed to the very bottom. We have heard, on many occasions, that, in regard to pay, our forces do not compare favourably with other forces in the Empire, particularly those in the oversea Dominions; and I have no doubt that on this point valuable information could be obtained by a Select Committee. The military authorities regard themselves as quite immaculate when they get on to their little thrones in the different administrative offices throughout the Commonwealth; and this is the most difficult of all Departments to obtain any sound information from. The present Postmaster-General, when speaking as Honorary Minister some weeks ago, said that all the information contemplated in this motion could be obtained from die Department. My experience, however., is tliat, though the officials of the Department will give .the information asked for, they will give neither more nor less-tlie y simply say "" Yes"" or ""No."" If a private member desires to enter into details, a hurdle is always put up in front of Mm.

The private-members' business day is neither more nor less than a farce-it is a day to give us an opportunity to ""blow off steam.""

If a Committee can bring fresh light to bear on the Department, it may allay a great deal of bad feeling, both in and out of the service.

Last year, with the sanction of the Minister of Defence, the matters which have been referred to were discussed by members of the Forces, and a petition presented to the Minister and to every honourable member. But it went the way of all petitions-int o the waste-paper basket. The more I think over the matter, the more certain I am that a Select Committee should be appointed. We have entered upon a big defence policy, and it is not right or proper that our soldiers should be unfairly dealt with. We shall always have soldiers, so long as the world continues. Those of us who cherished the idea that peace was within a reasonable distance have had their illusion shattered within the last month by the action of Italy in grabbing territory from Turkey, altogether without warning. We ought to take a lesson from that occurrence. I hope that even at this late hour the Prime Minister will consent to the appointment of a Committee.

In my opinion, the Government should not consent to an investigation of the administration of the Defence Department by a Select Committee. If honourable members think that the Minister of Defence is not capable of making the necessary representations to the Cabinet, and the Cabinet of presenting the necessary proposals to Parliament to secure proper pay and conditions for the commissioned oflicers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the permanent service, another sort of motion should be moved. The honourable member for North Sydney says that he has excluded commissioned officers from the scope of the Committee's inquiry, so that we may not suspect him of an ulterior motive, but the real question is, What is the proper course to pursue with a view to the proper administration of the Departments of government?

Much more is yet proposed to be done. It is easy for the honourable member for Parramatta to say that if he had remained in office he would have done this and that; but this Parliament will have to make up its mind as to what is to be expended on defence, and as to what extra taxation shall be raised to maintain our defences in an efficient state. All these matters hinge on the question now before us. If outstanding grievances can be pointed out, the Minister of Defence will look into them and make recommendations to the Cabinet; and I , as head of the Government, will ask Parliament to remedy those grievances, even if extra taxation be necessary to allow that to be done. Durhave never hesitated to say that our national defence system must be efficient; that those engaged in it must be properly equipped and dealt with fairly, and' that the people who want that defence should be asked to pay for it. I appeal to honourable members not, at the very inception of a big scheme of national defence, to intervene with a Committee of Inquiry between the Minister and the Forces. Senator Pearce is one of the most active, energetic, and able Ministers of Defence we have ever had. Whilst the appointment of a Select Corrtrnittee would not directly reflect upon him personally, it would weaken his position at the present time; and instead of strengthening the position of the officers, non-commissioned in my opinion, do them an injury. I am not going to say that an inquiry into matters of defence is unjustifiable in any circumstances, but such an inquiry ought not to be entered upon lightly, nor without full and deliberate consideration. I ask that this motion for a general investigation be not pressed. I cannot support it, and I do not think it is wise that the House should agree to it. --It is a matter of regret that the right honourable gentleman at the head of the Government did not address himself to this that I could not. ing that the right honourable member has been in any way neglectful, for I can well understand that his many duties make it impossible for him to be always in the chamber.

It is to be regretted that the mover of the motion did not ask straight out for a Royal Commission. The appointment of a Select Committee at this stage of the session would beuseless. The Commdttee would lapse before anything could be done. As the honourable member for Maranoa has pointed out, if we are to have an inquiry, it must be of an exhaustive character.

There may be some grievances of a minor character, but every man who any substantial grievance should, undoubtedly be removed.

Some honourable members opposite have sought to draw an analogy between the Postal Comrnissioii and that which we are now asked to appoint. I fail to see any analogy. Military affairs are always looked upon as exceptional, since, in connection with them, we have to deal with men who bear arms. Their position is totally different from that of postal employees. ceive exceptional treatment. that those who bear arms should, because of that fact, be compelled to suffer grievances. The point of my argument is that the exceptional character of their work is ing between them and the Government, unless a very strongcase were made out for action on our part.

We constantly hear that it is at hand; but I well remember hearing, as a boy, the statement that the Great Exhibition of 1851 was going to bring about an era of peace, and that the lion was going to lie down with the lamb. Modern history has falsified that prediction. Only a few years afterwards the British Empire was involved in a big war, and, as the honourable member for Maranoa has mentioned, a war is now being carried on by two other nations. The only element of doubt in regard to that war is whetiier or not another great Power thought of doing what Italy seized the opportunity to do. Whether it did or did not the opinion has been freely expressed, not only in Australia, but on the other side of the world, that it did. I appeal to honourable members to be very careful not to come between the Government and the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth in the way now proposed, until all other legitimate parliamentary means of securing redress of grievances have been exhausted. If the Government are prepared to resist the appointment of a Select Committee I shall support them, but I do not wish them to gather from my attitude that, if grievances on the part of members of our Defence Forces are repeatedly brought before Parliament, the time will not arrive when I shall be compelled, however reluctantly, to support an inquiry if IT have no confidence whatever in the mover come to the conclusion that the Government are determined hot to remove the causes of 'dissatisfaction. I wish briefly to justify the vote that I intend to give on this motion. If I thought, for one moment, that the Select Committee asked for would have the desired result, I should support its appointment, but I have no confidence whatever in such a Committee. What will it do? It will simply inquire into this question at great cost to the country. Its report will be laid before Parliament, nothing will come of it, and the Minister will be able to shirk his responsibility. Cannot honourable members see the move? I am of opinion that it is simply a move to deal with the highly-paid officers. right or not, what has been the trend of tbe -debate? Has it not been that the rank and file are receiving a very fair amount of -remuneration for the work performed? debate it has been so. It is questionable whetiier thefiguresthat have been submitted are accurate. We repeatedly hear it stated outside the House that the lower-paid non-commissioned officers and the men in our Defence Forces are receiving such high pay that the best men are being attracted to the service. The proposed Committee, if appointed, will in bringing down their report to the House, forget all about those whom I should like to see receiving better pay-that is, the very lowly-paid men in the ranks. The honourable member for North Sydney knows very well that they will not get a rise.

I take exception to that remark, and ask you, sir, to make him withdraw it. orable member for Denison has said anything offensive he will withdraw it. I will, but I am at a loss to know how thc honourable member could understand my meaning before I completed the sentence. of the motion. Why does he come here, just when the Minister of Defence is about to inaugurate a great system laid down by officers brought from abroad, and spring upon the House a motion that will put honourable members in a most awkward position by compelling them to take sides on a question that the majority of them know nothing about? In my opinion it is merely-and if I am out of order when I say it I will withdraw-a n electioneering dodge. If that is out of order. I will withdraw it, but it is in my mind, and I wish to give utterance to it. able member must not make a statement simply on the chance of its being in order. It happened that the statement which the honourable member made was not out of order, but had he made a statement which was out of order he would have put me in the position of being able only to call upon him to withdraw it.

I am not going to take the responsibility which certain honourable members would like to throw upon me. Coming as I do from an electorate in which a number of my supporters are military men, I want to explain to those gentlemen the attitude I am taking up now, and my reasons for it. In the first place, I have every to be put to the expense and trouble of this confidence in the Minister of Defence; but what self-respecting Minister would remain in the position while a Committee of irresponsibles from this House dictated to him how he should run his Department? I am opposing the motion, and until it is shown that the Minister of Defence has failed as a Minister, I shall not support the appointment of any such Committee. That has not yet been shown, and not an argument has been brought forward to show us why we should vote for the motion. Honourable members have not brought forward a specific case to show where any particular body of men are paid very low wages or are suffering to any extent. There may be individual cases. I have had individual cases brought under my own notice, but I believe that, given time, the Minister of .Defence will rectify those grievances. He has been, however, only a few months in oflice, and the same thing applies to exMinisters of Defence. What we have suffered from in the past in regard to our Military Forces has been the short tenure of oflice of the various Defence Ministers. The present Minister has had no time to remedy these grievances. Members who have been a long time in this House, and should know better, come down to support propositions which would involve the country in enormous expense, and for what purpose? Can any honourable member show me where a Select Committee of this House has yet done any good ? When a Minister or member wants to throw responsibility on to somebody else he gets a Select Committee appointed. Leakage Commission 1 and I am looking for something to come out of it, but it has not come out of it yet. No good result will come out of this Committee if it is appointed. I want to tell the poor fellows outside that the motion is simply put up to make them believe that a certain section of the House want to do something for them. That has been my experience in the past of this sort of thing, and I have had enough of it. Some honourable members have said, "" If we get this Committee, much good must accrue,"" while another section say, "" There may not be anything done at a l l . "" The honourable member for Lang admitted that there might not be anything done-that there might not be any necessity to give an increase of wages. Are this House and the country Select Committee for the purpose of finding out that nothing need be done? I have always thought that honourable members had a good case when they came to the House and asked for the appointment of a Committee. member knows more about moisture in butter than about the Military Forces. Neither he nor I can know the cost, but I am surprised when I look at the cost of Royal Commissions and Select Committees. I hope that when-honourable members move for the appointment of any such body, they will have some sound reasons to give the House. Why do they not point out the glaring cases, and show where they exist?

115,Mr Laird Smith,"The honorablemen were suffering under, and I should expect the House to assist me to get the wrong righted. Hindmarsh very clearly put it, we are not dealing with the postal, or any similar Department. We are dealing with the Defence Department, which is altogether different in its management from all the others. If it were not so, how is it that the government. If I voted for the appointwhole of the Defence Department has not been placed under the control of the Public Service Commissioner? cause the House and the country desire to throw the responsibility on to the Minister. 1 have every confidence in that gentleman, and the moment I cease to have confidence in him I shall say so. If the Minister is to be hampered by irresponsible people inquiring into the working of his Department, it will cause no end of dissension throughout the Commonwealth. If , for instance, the Committee reported that a certain section of the non-commissioned officers were under-paid, and the responsible officers of the Department did not feel inclined to recommend an increase, in what position would the Minister of Defence be, and what condition would the Defence Forces find themselves in? Should we be likely to have that discipline which is essential for to see them treated differently from any the carrying out of any proper Defence scheme? The Committee, if appointed, would not achieve the effect which its supporters say it would. member believe in these men joining a union to secure better rates of pay? the Defence Forces is altogether different from employment outside. If the men in the Defence Forces formed themselves into a union, and were called out for the defence of the country, and just about the same time took it into their heads to strike, what able member is, I think, going beyond the position would we be in? members say these men are justified in forming a union, then I am logical in saying that they would be justified in striking if they did not get their just dues from the Government. It is for the Minister of Defence to take the responsibility of seeing that ""the men get their rights. If the Minister does not do so, it is for us to express our want of confidence in him, and compel the Department to do justice to the men who defend the country. allow this to be a non-party question? Government allow this to be a non-party As the honourable member for question? The present Minister of Defence has a policy altogether different from that of his predecessor; and if he made a mistake, would the question not be a party one then? Such must be party questions so long as we have responsible ment of this Select Committee, I should be simply expressing a lack of confidence It is simply bein the Minister. I desire the men in the ranks, and the non-commissioned officers, to understand that there is no one in the House more desirous than myself of giving them proper conditions; but a proper means to that end must be adopted. I oppose the motion, for the one reason that it will not benefit those whom we desire to benefit, namely, the lower-paid men in our Defence Forces. am pleased that this motion has been submitted ; and it has my hearty support as one directed to the betterment of the conditions of employees. I regard the members of the Military Service as employees of the Government; and I do not desire public servants. I , therefore, suggest that the Government be requested to bring tiie members of the Defence Forces under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and thus afford a true soluhonorable tion of the problem. If these men are underpaid, as suggested, it is our duty to see that they are given a fair return for their labour. The honourable member for North Sydney will, I think, support an amendment in favour of legislation to bring these men under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. If honourable motion. oppose the motion, because I do not see why a Select Committee should be appointed to inquire into the payment and conditions in any particular public Department. paid of all-that is why. to see that every public servant has a fair can only make recommendations; and if",38,Smith Shoul D Not The To Be Dealt With In Common Fairness To The

124,Mr Riley,"The Government oughtthe Government oppose the appointment of a Select Committee, what chance is there of having anyrecommendationcarried into effect? In our Defence Forces we employ engineers, blacksmiths, carpenters, painters, and so forth; and if outside employers have to pay a certain wage, and observe certain conditions under an Arbitration Court, I do not see why our military employees should be deprived of the benefits of our industrial legislation. The conditions at Thursday Island arid atQueenscliff, for example, are vastly different; and as any Select Committee would have to travel in order to obtain evidence at first hand, I do not see how their work could be completed during the present session. During the recess, however, the Minister will have an opportunity to obtain reports from the different centres; and next session he may be in a position to introduce a Bill to bring the Military Forces under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and thus settle the conditions for all time. I understand that these men have grievances connected with their food, clothes, accommodation, and so forth; and, under the circumstances, I suggest that, the honourable member for North Sydney should withdraw his. motion,, and rely on the Government to see that justice is done. If I were a member of the Military Forces, and received a miserable wage, I should leave the service. says that! cuse if they are underpaid. There is a demand for labour all over the Commonwealth ; and if they are men, they ought to fight for their rights, or leave the service. Honourable members who are supporting the appointment of this Committee do not, some of them, interest themselves in the welfare of the lowly-paid man in outside employment. Any Select Committee appointed would have a wide field to cover; and, as I have already pointed out, the Minister of Defence, in recess, could consider the question of housing, food, clothes, holidays, canteens, and the class of liquor supplied, and so forth. All these form part of the military organization, and call, I suppose, for investigation. I might further suggest that honourable members should visit Thursday Island and other military centres with benefit to themselves and to the country. 'The honourable member for North Sydneyhas been connected with the Military Forces' for a number of years;and, consequently,, he has the comparatively easy task of talking "" shop."" But other honourable members, myself included, are not fighting men, and it would be well if the Government could arrange such, visits of inspection as I have indicated. I agree with the honourable member for NorthS ydney that the men of the Permanent Forces should be fairly remunerated and properly treated, and no doubt the result of the debate will be to cause the Minister of Defence to look carefully into the whole matter. We, on this side, are at all' times ready to do everything that can be done to better the condition of the community, and the employee's of the Commonwealth. As such the men of our Military Forces have nothing to lose by putting themselves in the hands of the Minister of Defence. I object to the motion on the same ground as the honourable member for Parramatta, considering that the party possessing a majority in the Chamber should be morelargely represented on the proposed Committee than the minority. I do not remember any instance in which on a Committeethe bigger party in the House had not a majority of at least one representative. always change-. jection to the motion. There are more officers and men in, and passing through,, my constituency than in any other constituency, because Melbourne has only one member, while Sydney is divided into four electorates; but I have not yet heard either officer or man make a complaint about pay. The last speaker referred to the food supplied to our Permanent Forces, and to the clothing. As an Australian, ancl a member of this House, I say that the uniform that is good enough to fight in should! be good enough for attendance at banquetsand the like. The honourable member for North Sydney, who has risen to the important post of colonel, knows that theuniforms, chess and undress, of an officer of high grade cost not less than ,£50. that a staff-officer's uniform costs nearly £100.

A Court dress would have cost at least £2,0. and might have cost .£1:20. By appearing in ordinary attire on that occasion the representatives of this Chamber anc! the Senate set a great example. We hope that our Defence Force will be one of the lighting forces of the world, and that in its simplicity, verve, ancl splendid discipline, it will vie with the most patriotic Parliament that soldiers shall be told off to army the world knows, that of Switzerland. As it is proposed to finish this session by Christmas, though I cannot see how that can be done, it would not be wise to begin the inquiry which the honourable member for North Sydney asks for, but the Minister might take the debate as an instruction to obtain data as to the cost of each army unit in the world. In Sir Edward Owen's classic work 011 the Swiss Republic, there is a comparison of the armies of Europe, and I think that, whereas a unit in Great Britain costs .£65, one in Switzerland costs o n ' y £ l Tbat great authority, who was, and is still, I think, an officer in His Majesty's Forces, showed that Switzerland could mobilize 250,000 men in three days, a thing which Great Britain could not then do in six weeks. What we need is a fighting force; we do not want frivolous giltspurred roosters, to use a phrase that has become famous. We know that bright facings are marks for which render gay uniforms dangerous to their wearers. No time in a soldier's life is more glorious than that in which he is taking part in the defence of his country, ancl the uniform in which a man is willing to face an enemy, ancl in which, if necessary, lie would be prqud to die, should be good enough for meeting the mightiest man in the Empire, even the King himself. I ask the honourable member for North Sydney would it not be better to withdraw this motion, and obtain an inquiry into all the grievances of the military. Take the question of salaries. Major-General Sir Edward Hutton received ,£1,500 a year and allowances. When a member of the State House, I endeavoured to ascertain what the allowances covered, but could not get the information. Our Ministers would not refuse any information that members might ask for. Count von Moltke received only £ 1 , 5 0 0 a year when leading 750,000 Germans triumphant through France. non-commissioned officers and men. I purposely made no mention of officers. parison will be made between professional ancl amateur soldiers. In my opinion, promotion in the Permanent Forces is often blocked unfairly, men not being given a proper trial. It was told ine -within .the last three days that an -orfiGer has the right to take any man as an orderly, and that orderlies do not 'have as much drill as other soldiers. It is not the intention of run errands, and do work that a boy could do. I must vote against this motion, but if a proposal is .made for an inquiry into thc .grievances of the Defence Forces, with a view to securing better pay and conditions, should that be necessary, it will command my support. orable member for Denison put forward some strange reasons for opposing the appointment of Select Committees and Royal Commissions. Although his experience is as little as mine, he contended that the inquiries of such bodies do no good. But we know that over 60 per cent, of the recommendations of the Postal Commission have been adopted by the Postmaster General. mended would have been made in any case. that. Grievances must be laid bare before notice is taken of them. The Postal Commission's inquiry certainly did good. Last session a. constant agitation was kept up, more particularly by the representatives of Tasmania, for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the alleged Tasmanian Customs leakages, and it is, to say the least, peculiar that one of the representatives of that State should now assert tliat these inquiries are of no use whatever.

Does he think that the personnel of the Royal Commission is in keeping with his statement to the House, as quoted above, on the 21st ultimo. That was the statement that the Commission was to be non-political and free from all political bias. He repliedYes; but I do not think it would have been humanly possible to select any person as a member of the Commission whose mind was wholly free of any political opinion. No one suggested that he could, or would, do so. He has certainly not done so. The honourable gentleman went on to sayThe intention of the Government as expressed in my previous announcement was that the selection of the members of the Commission should be non-political in character, or, in other words, should be preferably chosen from other than members of the Federal Legislature.

If we had now an open choice, and had to determine who should be selected, the occasion would be a proper one to debate the qualifications of the gentlemen for this position, their freedom from bias, the absence of political motives, and other questions of the sort; but it is now too late to do so.

167,Mr Deakin,"Anticipatin g that suchthese gentlemen, I should have endeavoured to acquaint myself with the general circumstances of their career and opinions, but I recognise that they have been appointed by the Government, and at present constitute the Royal Commission. My purpose tonight, therefore, is to start from things as they are, without saying what they ought to have been. I may point out that, although the Commission has formally commenced business, it has so far taken only a few steps j so that, if the Government is to fulentertained political opinions of another fil to any degree the statement made by the Minister that the Commission was to be non-political and free from party bias, there is only one way of doing so. I do not suggest that it should be done by adding men of opposite political opinions, because political opinions should not be taken into consideration in such a choice. I regret to find that all the members of the Commission, excluding, of course, the Judge and Chairman, have more or less definite political leanings. My present suggestion is simply that if this Commission is to be formed on the basis which we have been accustomed to see accepted both in the State and Federal Parliaments, it will be necessary to add to it two or three members distinctly outside the political sphere, but qualified to undertake an investigation of this kind with strict impartiality. If that were done, the Commission could still be brought, to some extent, into line with the Minister's own statement. If it is not done, the position is hopeless. We are face to face with the facts which, as the Minister said, ""are probably as stated."" I think they are evidently as stated-that Mr pointed in the States or in the CommonHinchclifTe is an active member of his own party, and still actively associated with and interested in it ; that Mr Shannon has been a selected Labour candidate j and that Mr tical opinions of the Government of the Robert McC. Anderson is quoted as having said in the Sydney Daily Telegraph that it is well known among his friends that Labour and its representatives have had his sympathey for many years past. man. Mr Crawford, another member of the Commission, stood for Parliament as a Liberal candidate, although the Minister of Trade and Customs did not commit himself to an endorsement of that fact. However, as it has not been challenged, we may take it as being correct. Fusion candidate against the honourable member for Herbert at the last election. was a candidate, but am taking it as indisputably proved. While I do not think that should disqualify him, I think it is unfortunate that at least three of these gentlemen should have already taken an active part in political affairs on the same side as the Government and its supporters, that another member has expresed his entire sympathy with them, and that, excluding, of course, the Judge, the solitary individual who has colour is Mr Crawford. member imagine any Commission whose members would not have very strong political ideas of their own? the Government should have attempted the impossible task of discovering persons who had no political opinions. But to select people who are qualified to act on a Commission and who have political opinions is a very different thing from making the majority of the Commission consist of active politicians-me n who take an active part and interest in public affairs, who stand as candidates, and who are pledged to a particular party-givin g them the absolute majority on n. Commission. Even now this can be remedied if two or three other relatively non-political persons, with no active political career behind them, or' who have not taken part in public affairs, are selected to sit with those already appointed. If you looked over tbe list of the Royal Commissions, so far as I remember them, apwealth, you would find a Commission of this sort consisting of a majority who probably shared in some general way the poliday, or agreed with their policy on the particular question involved, and a minority, usually only one less than tlie majority, although it might be two less in some special circumstances, who, without being active politicians, were known not to share those opinions, to some extent. This is a question in which, unfortuI .am not denying it. nately, the political element cannot be ignored, because the party represented by Ministers and members opposite in this House has on this very question a distinctly pronounced opinion, which must affect the inquiry about to be instituted.

In the circumstances, if the Judge himself. this Conunission, without addition, is allowed to enter upon its task, honourable members opposite and the Government will be to blame for having constituted it in such a way as to evoke suspicion and distrust, and provoke challenge, even before its work is commenced. Of course, it will be by their work that the members of the Commission will be judged, and properly so. But it is most unfortunate that public opinion should be biased in this way at the very outset by the creation of a Commission in which the proportions are _ so unusually in favour of one way of thinking ford is not still a nationalizer-h e may represent their conclusions to Farliament tain his old faith or have embraced a new one-bu t at all events the Commission commences its inquiry without that support from public opinion, and without that confidence which Royal Commissions should enjoy. harder. assisted to their ends by a onesided Commission. It may even prove that Mr Crawford still retains some of his old views. If so, the whole Commission, excluding the chairman, is of one political colour and complexion. In the choice of the chairman the Government appear to have made a very wise selection. a gentleman of judicial attainments, and who, in addition, enjoyed a long political career, with Ministerial experience. He therefore brings very valuable knowledge to bear upon the subject, which I am sure he will handle in accordance with judicial principles. I do not think ithe Minister has heard a word of . challenge of that gentleman from any quarter. I understand the secretary of the Commission has also been appointed. spector of the Customs Department. Is he of those who know the industry, the two a good man? tary as well? appoint him. pay him. tions of international law? with that. That is an arrangement with tween the Commission now appointed and the Commission we proposed to appoint eighteen months ago. There are two classes of Royal Commissioris-on e the expert Commission, on which we seek to obtain the services of persons identified with an industry, who are to make a searching investigation and then present results to be dealt with by the Legislature in a more or less judicial fashion. The other is the more familiar kind of general Royal Commission. The purpose then is not to appoint experts or those engaged in an industry. They take evidence, and then As I have said, the universal practice in the Mother Country, and, I think, in the Commonwealth and all the States, has been to take care that the minority was always sufficiently strong in numbers to be able to press Its task will be so much the its inquiries as thoroughly as the majority, The Government will not be and also to present, on any particular points, a minority report, setting forth their grounds for not agreeing with the majority. There is no such balance in the present Commission. The Commission we proposed was to consist of a gentleman recommended to us as the best expert in all the processes of dealing with sugar, from the growing of the plant until it was turned into the refined article; and another said to possess an unexampled knowledge of the financial side of sugar-the cost of all the processes, values, and so forth. The Judge was then to acquaint himself with all these general matters which are necessary to complete the case, and to present a purely judicial report. The two gentlemen to whom I have ton. Their names and reputations were all that were known to the Cabinet, and, therefore, we had, -and have, no knowledge whatever of their politics.

But the honourable member for Ballarat said at the Melbourne Town Hall, as reported in the press, that a Royal Commission had been appointed by his Government, and that the present Government cancelled the appointment, and refused to allow the Commission to proceed. As a matter of fact, that Royal Commission never was appointed by the late Government. The honourable member, from the time he promised to appoint a Royal Commission, was in office six months; and, during that time, he never reached the final stage in the appointment. Names have been mentioned, and it is said that certain members of the Commission that has now been appointed hold political views favorable to the Government.

I really do not know sufficient to say, but I think he is still a member of a worker's organization.

When the political antecedents of the Commissioners, honourable enough in themselves, though, in my humble judgment, debarring them, because of their political complexion, from accepting positions on a non-political, unbiased Commission of Inquiry, are pointed out to the Minisister, what is his reply? It is that he ""is not aware."" What sort of a Minister is it who recommends gentlemen for a Commission and is not aware of their antecedents ? Are Royal Commissioners appointed as if they were crossing-sweepers, taken on for a casual job? The Minister was whip and secretary of his party. Is any man who holds such a position ignorant of the political antecedents of prominent standardbearers of the party in any State of Australia i unionists. The Minister may shelter himself behind the statement that he is not aware, meaning, I suppose, that he is not aware officially. He seems to be aware officially of very little when it suits him to be ignorant. He tells us that the Commission has been appointed in accordance with his promise, saying thatThe promise was that the Commission should be preferably chosen from other than members of the Federal Legislature. No one takes exception to the Judge who is to be chairman of the Commission, but, apart from him, every member of the Commission is a self-confessed politician. The Minister contends that the Commission is non-political and unbiased because the Commissioners are not members of this Legislature. If we are to have a Commission of politicians, why not select from the cream? Why not choose politicians who have been elected by the people to deal with national concerns ? Why go into the hedges and byways to seek politicians who are not in the front rank? enough to dispose of the Minister's causistry. I wish to point out, in regard to an answer to a question to-day, that the Minister seems to be singularly uninformed about the utterances of one of the Commissioners appointed to this allegedly unbiased and non-political body. The gentleman to whom I refer is not only a prominent Labour leader in the State of Queensland, but sits in the Legislative Council of that State in the Labour interest. This man, who is supposed to be unbiased and non-political, and to be ready to consider with an open mind questions affecting not only honourable members opposite, but every producer in the sugar industry, and every consumer of sugar in the Commonwealth found. man, nor one with a more open mind ! Let us hear what he said on the 26th July last, when dealing with only one side, and, to my thinking, the least important side of the subject. Speaking in the Queensland Parliament about one of the interests involved, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, he saidI certainly think that if it was for this reason is preference to alone, it was a misfortune that the recent referenda proposals of the Commonwealth Government were not carried, as they would have enabled the Commonwealth Government to put an end to this huge monopoly which is coercing the small man, and making the workers suffer as they have suffered. This is the impartial Commissioner! A man who has nailed his colours to the mast! member think that the Commissioners must have no convictions, and no views? have views on this subject, but the Minister, in appointing politicians, has not carried out his promise to make the Commission an unbiased one. such as the honourable member suggests? a moment. T ask honourable members opposite whether it is proposed to use the Commission for propaganda work in regard to the constitutional changes which they favour ? ber will not be in order in proceeding on those lines. I think I have said Hinchcliffe; the fault lies with the Minister in appointing him to a body that was to be impartial. Mr Hinchcliffe told the Queensland Legislative Council that he was sorry that the referenda proposals were not carried, because they would have enabled the Sugar Refining Company to be dealt with. He has prejudged the case, and, curiously enough, in the direction ardently desired by honourable members opposite. I am",49,Tration Court Award Old Ag E And Invalid Pensions

I do not want to go too closely intothis particular matter, because it is not within our province ; but this gentleman, and the Minister whom we all have in mind as having mentioned his name to the Minister, are very fortunate in their mutual friendship. If the statement attributed to Mr Anderson is correct-and I have no reason to doubt its veracity-the n it could not have been unknown to members of the Federal Ministry that his leanings had been in the direction of Labour for years past. With regard to the other two members of the Commission, I think it is equally deplorable that either of them should have been politicians on one side or the other. My desire was that there should be appointed to this Commission men who would be as free as any persons could be from leanings in any particular political direction. The difference between a chosen politician and a man who is not a politician, but has, necessarily, political leanings in the one direction or the other, is this : That a man in the political arena who has declared himself emphatically on the one side or the other, loses, to a large extent, political caste if he changes his opinions. It is well known that the moment a member of Parliament changes his political views he is howled at and denounced member is now going beyond a reasonable discussion of the question. so. I remind you, sir, that I am not now discussing the actual personnel of the Commission. I am discussing, rather, the question of whether a politician can change his views with as much freedom from attack as can a. man who, while having political leanings, is not a politician. It will be conceded by every one who knows his subject that apolitician is in a singularly unfortunate position in this respect; and for that reason I have been anxious all along that the men appointed to conduct this inquiry should be absolutely free from any professed political views on one side or the other-that , in fact, politicians should not be appointed. If the Government and their supporters insaid after the report has been presented? sist upon the appointment of politicians, why not appoint to this Commission persons who are responsible to the authority that has to foot the bill for whatever we do in this regard-the people of Australia? Why should not they select first-class politicians if we are going to take politicians at all -me n who are responsible. to the people for the proper administration of matters relating to the sugar industry throughout Australia ? Why appoint men who are just as bound to one side or the other as we are, but who are not trusted by the people who will have to foot the bill ? . would angle for votes. politicians in Australia who would angle for votes, and are, therefore, not fit to sit upon a Royal Commission? That is the most extraordinary reflection on the Federal Parliament we have ever heard ! It would be unfortunate to appoint members of the Federal Parliament to such a Commission, but it is still more unfortunate to appoint men who, without speaking disrespectfully of them, are, in actual political eminence, second-rank politicians as contrasted with the Federal politicians of Australia. An effort will be made by honourable members opposite to make this a question of whether or not the Colonial Sugar Refining Company should be sat upon. The question, however, is infinitely larger. The question of whether or not the Colonial Sugar Refining Company should be sat upon is relatively small when we consider the many complexities of this problem. We have, in the first place, to consider the producers, the sugar-growers, the refiners, tlie jam and preserve manufacI did not intend to do turers-wh o must use sugar in their manufactures-the men they employ, and the fruit-growers. The price of sugar enters largely into the question of what profits fruit-growers will get from selling their fruit to jam manufacturers. We have also to consider the beet-growers, who are entitled to have considered the question of whether or not the whole sugar industry of Queensland is worth keeping at the price. We have, further, to consider the general taxpayers, who will have to foot the bill under any nationalization scheme; and also every buyer of sugar throughout the Commonwealth, who naturally wants to get his sugar as cheaply as he can.

That is a big problem affecting every Australian constituency. I have heard honourable members from Western Australia and Tasmania advocating the remission of the duty. Are not the people of Tasmania, who must buy sugar to make their jams, entitled to have their views concandidates have to suffer. sidered ? cated the remission of the duty. duction of the duty. a proper subject for discussion in connection with an inquiry of this character. It is of no use to have an inquiry if only one side is to be consideied, and that a side on which tlie Commission have already made up their minds. If we are to have an inquiry, let us have an inquiry throughout; and for that purpose we require a Commission Australian, non-political, and unbiased in character. The personnel of this Commission is absoknown and admitted that mistakes havelutely out of keeping with the promises often reiterated to this House by Ministers. It is a public misfortune, when we consider the ramifications of the. industry and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company do not play a predominant part, that the Commission should have been appointed in the way it has been. I make no reflection upon any particular member of it. The man whose inclinations or aptitudes have drawn him into the political arena cannot be blamed for being outspoken on one side or the other; but the moment any man declares his measured conviction upon one side of a special problem, he puts himself out of court as a judge upon it. This Commission, in spite of Ministerial promises, has interests are in been constituted upon those lines; and I deeply regret that the Minister holds out no hope of making any alleviation of this bad state of affairs by appointing new members who would help to divorce it from its political and partisan character.

His coach, a man of very high education, was satisfied that a mistake had been made somewhere in connection with the English paper, for which the young fellow was "" plucked."" He asked if it was not possible for the candidate to come for the public Departments, and not with to Melbourne, and peruse the paper to see where he had made a mistake.

If a man is asked where Timbuctoo is, and replies that it is somewhere in the Stilly Islands, it is known at once that he is wrong, and points can be deducted. suppose it is somewhere near China.

At school she was looked upon as one of the best; and in her first Public Service examination she got nearly the maximum number of marks for her handwriting, though she was lower in the other subjects, and, while she passed, she just missed being called upon. At the next examination she was ""plucked"" because her handwriting did not satisfy the examiner. Now, if this girl's handwriting was good for, say, 250 marks on one occasion, she ought to be deemed good enough in this respect for the Public Service. Parliament and the Minister should not allow students to be penalized, but, rather, ought to assist them in passing their examinations. I should like to know why the candidates cannot see the examination papers after the examinations are over. Can any reason be suggested for refusing this request ? Then, if the reader at an examination does not make himself audible, is it fair to "" pluck "" those candidates who are furthest away, and have difficulty in hearing ? Of course, if the Minmonopoly in the manufacture of the three ister does not agree with me in the views I have expressed, I cannot help it ; but something ought to be done. During the last eighteen months I have heard complaints in the case of fifty or sixty young candidates I take no notice of parents, who think all theii "" geese are swans,"" or of '' coaches ""-wh o have been '' plucked '' for some disability over which they have no control. I should now like to bring under the notice of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence the peculiar system of payment in the Defence Department. In the Stores Branch, at Victoria Barracks, both permanent and temporary labourers are engaged; ancl the pay is 8s. a clay. On the ocshows, in my opinion, that the Judge did not casion of the last camp at Kilmore, the permanent employees who went there received as expenses 8s. a day for the first week and 6s. a day for the subsequent weeks; but the temporary men were allowed nothing. Is it possible for a Labour Government to conscientiously say that that is fair ? If Ministers are satisfied with an arrangement of that kind, I am afraid that a number of their followers are not. I have endeavoured to have this grievance redressed by the Minister, but I have not succeeded; and I must simply keep hammering away until I do. I do not like mentioning these matters; but I consider it my duty to do so, and I shall take advantage of every opportunity to obtain fair terms for these men. desire to bring under the notice of the Government a grievance which arises from a portion of a recent award in the Arbitration Court in connection with the shearing industry. Without wishing to cast any reflections, I must say that I do not think the Judge can have fully realized the consequences when he gave that award. The award of Judge Higgins contained the followingThe minimum rates for woolpressing to be paid to members of the claimant organization shall be (if the Ferrier press or the Rack and Pinion press or the Adelaide box press he usedI f rations not foundGreasy wool-by hand, 43d. percwt., or is. 3d. per bale; by hand, if dumping included, 6d. per cwt., or is. 7£d. per bale; by power, j d . per cwt., or g j d . per bale; by power, if dumping included, 4c!. per cwt., or is. i d . per bale. The portion of the award to which I particularly desire to call attention isFor pressing by any other presses, id. per cwt., or 3d. pei bale extia. It will be seen that this really creates a presses mentioned; and that, of course, is not desirable. The manufacturers of other presses employ a large number of men, as will be realized by any honourable members who have visited the works where the Kurtz press is manufactured in Sydney. Who is going to buy a Kurtz press when he can buy a Ferrier, a Rack and Pinion, or an Adelaide box press, for a little more money, in view of the fact that he will have to pay more if the first-mentionedpress is used ? this condition? realize that hi; was really giving a monopoly to three firms. Mr Justice Higgins saidThe claimant asks me to discriminate between the presses which are fast and the presses which are slow, and to prescribe a higher rate for the latter. This demand seems to be reasonable as regards piece-work rates; for if the payment is to be by results, the employees should get higher rates where slow or imperfect appliances are used. That would apply if there was an unlimited quantity of wool to be pressed, but that is not the case. Where there are only a certain number of shearers, say, twelve or eighteen, the quantity of wool shorn can be easily pressed by a Kurtz machine. that the honourable member is discussing a recent award in an arbitration case?",54,Tration Court Award Old Ag E And Invalid Pensions

He may do that only on a specific motion Nothing beyond a reference is permissible otherwise. the consequences of an award which is a serious matter for many engaged in pastoral pursuits, and for all manufacturers of wool presses other than the Ferrier, Raclc and Pinion, and the Adelaide box press. Attention should be paid to the remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney, who pointed out that a recent award of the Arbitration Court would throw the manufacturing of wool presses into the bands of two firms. If that happens, these firms will be able to form a ring or trust, and increase prices.

They should not be put at the mercy of -manufacturers by an award which had no such intention.

No one more ardently wishes to see pensions paid to deserving persons than I do; ancl it should be our aim to increase the rates, if possible. But we need a sane business basis, so that both those who are now in receipt of pensions, and those likely to need them, shall be sure of relief.

407,Mr Atkinson,"It is about time thatWe have made so many inroads on the liberty of the subject by way of legislation that I think we might well go a step further and impose on society some scheme under which those who could afford to do so would be required to assist to maintain those who cannot help themselves. Some more satisfactory reply should have been made to the indictment by the Leader of the Opposition in respect of what would seem to be the very partial Sugar Commission appointed. It is unfortunate that this House has to take in hand the duty of criticising the personnel of that Commission. We are proud to believe that the whole of the people of Australia take a keen interest in politics. It is one of the healthiest signs of the vitality and virility of Australian people that they are not only conducting their enterprises with energy and ability, but are taking that interest in the affairs of their country which is so necessary if the laws passed by the National Parliament are to be a true reflex of the people's will. the Government benches. Labour party managed to "" fluke a victory "" at the last general election, but the people were only twelve months in recognising that they had made a huge mistake, and they availed themselves of the first opportunity to show that they had come to that conclusion by rejecting the Labour referenda proposals. recent Western Australian elections? claimed as a victory, since Western Australia was the only State that polled a majority in favour of the referenda. The people of that State last month simply affirmed the vote which they had given at the referenda. the recent Liverpool Plains election, in New South Wales. Wales, Labour won one seat and the Liberals won the other. To return to the question I was discussing when interrupted, it is most unfortunate that the executive power of the Government was used for the purpose of making what appear on the surface to be partisan appointments to the Sugar Commission. No Commission has been appointed by this, or by any other Parliament, in connection with which it was more vitally important that men of thehighest standing-me n who were, at least, outside the active region ot politics, and had not declared any political bias-shoul d be selected. Although we know that it was impossible for the Minister to select men free from all political bias, he could, at least, have avoided selecting men who had been openly expressing their political views, either as candidates for Parliament or through the public newspapers. The field of selection was so wide and broad that it would have been quite possible for the Minister to choose men in whom every section of the community would have had the utmost confidence. It is most unfortunate that the Commission should have to set out on its work of investigating the conditions of what is the largest single industry of the Commonwealth with the public mind already biased against it? the public cannot have in this Commission the confidence that it ought to have. mission appointed by the honourable member for Ballarat?

The public policy of a Government can be, and should be, criticised in a proper way. We know that the policy of this Government is decided, first of all, in some other place before it is submitted to this Parliament.

420,Mr Sampson,"I am not. Just asside this Parliament-that it should be of an absolutely judicial character, and one that would have the confidence of every section of the community-shoul d have adhered to that decision. The previous Government took steps to appoint a Commission on a basis that has been advocated for some tune by a member of ' the present Ministerial party. For nearly two years the honourable member for Capricornia has consistently and sedulously advocated the appointment of a Commission that would be representative, of the five important interests involved. If the Government had carried out their oft-repeated promise that the Commission would be so constituted as to represent impartially every section of the community we should have known that, upon receiving its report, we could mete out justice. The industry affects every householder in the community. It is one of the most important industries in the Commonwealth, and is already in the hands of one important trading company. We want to ascertain, by means of the Commission, whether the consumers of Australia are paying too much to support the sugar industry. same time. I believe that we, as the National Parliament, should so frame our laws that they will cause industries of the widest variety to spring into existence, so that we may establish a truly national system of production and, at the same time, a self-sustaining community. With our tremendous resources we can establish in this great continent every industry that is necessary to supply the needs and services of the highest type of civilization. It is possible that, under present conlieen levelled against it. It would have ditions, the people of the Commonwealth may be paying far too great a price for the support of the sugar industry. We wanted exact information on that point, but the Government and Parliament agreed that it could not be properly obtained by appointing a Commission of members of this Parliament, because such a body would smack too much of party politics. I believe that is the reason that Parliament decided that the Commission should be purely non-party, with a. judicial chairman, capable of imparting a judicial, as well as a practical, character to its investigations. We hoped that its report, when presented to the House, would be so representative of every important interest affected by the industry, that this Parliament would be able to evolve from it a complete and comprehensive policy on the question. Unfortunately we have now a Commission which shows on the surface that there is political bias in connection with its members. It is unfortunate that that should be the case when the Commission is starting on its career of investigation, but the matter is one which, in the interests of Australia as a whole, might reasonably be discussed here free from party considerations. It is a most unfortunate blunder on the part of the Executive that it should have been made possible by the appointment of the members of that Commission ing, sir, as to whether the honourable member for Wimmera is in order in discussing the personnel of the Royal Commission in the way he is doing.

It is left to the good taste of each member to decide At the how far he shall go.

In the present circumstances it is not possible for this Commission to escape the criticism which ought to be levelled against it.

425,Mr Sampson,"I bow to your rulits duties in the way that has been allowed to-night. I wish to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Wilmot in respect to old-age pensions. I am one of those honourable members who have always believed that old-age pensions should be entirely freed from the taint of charity. I believe that our so-called charitable institutions are only regarded as charities because we have not reached that altitude in our Christian civilization which would remove the taint of charity altogether from them, and cause them and their support to be regarded as part of the economic, as well as the ethical, duty of every citizen in the Commonwealth. able member vote for the Surplus Revenue Bill? able member apparently has the same erroneous idea with respect to my attitude on that matter as he had when he said the Age had called me a bogus protectionist. The honourable member should verify Wis quotations before be levels them at honourable members on this side. cluded the honourable member amongst them. member can produce the passage with my name mentioned, and not bunched in a general reference to a number of others, I shall be prepared to take some notice of it. There will never be a better opportunity than the present for the Government to introduce a scientific scheme of old-age pensions, building up a fund, and giving encouragement to merit, thrift, and industry on the part of the people of Australia. It is an extraordinary thing that in all British communities there is a disinclination on the part of Governments to bring in an old-age pensions Act, based on thrift as well as on Government assistance. A scientific scheme can be introduced by which the people, during their years of strength and vitality, could build up a fund that would help to pay them the allowances, gratuities, or honorariums due to them when they reached a certain age. From about T.88O, until the pensions scheme was passed in the last session of the present British Parliament, about a dozen Royal Commissions reported on the question. The various Friendly Societies were made use of, and experiments were tried, but, so far, it has not been found possible in Great Britain to place old-age pensions on a scientific basis. With an ""over-flowing Treasury, and greatprosperity throughout the Commonwealth, the present would have been a golden time : for this Government to lay the foundation of an old-age pensions scheme that would' be largely self-supporting, encourage thrift and industry, and be infinitely more universal in its application than the present system. In view of their professions, this is peculiarly a question that might be undertaken by the present Government. I havein my mind a case which I believe is typical of hundreds, if not thousands, of others. A couple began to purchase a house sometwenty years ago in one of the suburbs of Melbourne. They have paid off nearly ,£660, and still owe about ,£100 on it. Thethrift, self-denial, and industry they havedisplayed to secure a home for themselves ought to be commended and encouraged, but' the amount of .£600 which they havepaid brings them nearly up to the margin: fixed in both cases, and they are allowed a pension conjointly of, I think, only 2s. 8d. per week. A margin of .£310 is allowed by the Act, but why should any deduction be made from the pensions in a case of thatkind ? There is a very grave and seriouscan earn nearly up to ios. per week, and can receive a pensiou of an equivalent amount, but if he has property worth ^310, which is regarded as equivalent to the capital upon which ios. per week could be earned, he is cut off from the chance of getting a pension. Such a provision discourages people from providing themselveswith a home, and discounts tliat thrift and industry which the Government ought to be the first to encourage. Mv. PAGE Why not make tlie pension universal ? to be said in f avour of that view, but it cannot be done unless we revise the whole existing scheme. We could establish a universal scheme on a thoroughly actuarial and; scientific basis, like that of Germany. In Franee, Belgium, and other European countries, scientific systems on a sound economic basis are being successfully carried out by municipalities. The municipal-form of government has lieen made use of on the Continent in many important directions, which we have not yet followed in Australia. The London County Council extends its operations considerably beyond anything done by municipalities in Australia, and that tendency is even more marked on the Continent. We could institute a universal system",59,Tration Court Award Old Ag E And Invalid Pensions

430,Mr Sampson,"There is a great dealof old-age pensions in Australia in such a way as to remove all possible taint of charity or pauperism from it , and so enable the old people to claim, as a matter of right, the pensions which they themselves have helped to build up during their years of health and vigour. There is not a citizen who has helped to make this country what it is, either as a servant of the State or in his seeing that he has just returned from his private capacity, who would not be able to draw a pension in a spirit of independent enjoyment that would be impossible if it were provided entirely by the State. Germany the system I am advocating goes like clockwork. I speak on the authority of a comprehensive report presented two or three years ago by Sir John Cockburn, who attended the International Conference of Workmen in Rome, and was able to obtain invaluable data at first hand. This report shows that it is possible for the State, while had the advantage of it , would have made contributing only a minor portion of the combined fund, to build up a system that is universal in its application. In Germany only some of the big traders and largersalaried officials, who are compelled to take out policies, are excluded. ployer devolves the duty of deducting the contributions from the wages, and he has to add double the amount thus collected. All these individual contributions are placed in a separate fund, so that each person has a separate account. seventy years of age a pension of ^,13 a year is paid, and this is probably regarded to be quite equal to £ 2 6 in Australia. So large is the element of thrift, and so great is the accumulation of money, that it is possible in Germany to pay ^£13 a year, to which the State contributes only £ 2 ios. Under a scientific actuarial system, to which everybody contributes; whereas in Australia the whole of the old-age pensions is paid out of the public Treasury, and a large number of the most deserving people are excluded from participation. and the Acting Treasurer credit for an efficient and sympathetic administration of the Act; but the Act itself requires amendment. I know of no better opportunity than the present to bring this matter under the notice of the Government j because I feel that a much better system could be evolved at a cost much smaller than that we at present bear. The whole basis of the old-age pension system ought to be altered and extended in such a way as to cover double the number of recipients, while, at the same time, encouraging thrift, and altogether removing from it any taint ef [80] charity, and at a much smaller cost to the State. To say that I was surprised at the praise o i our telephone system by the honourable member for Denison is but to mildly describe my feelings. HadI not known something of the subject, I might have believed him, travels through the world, and that he started out with the knowledge of an electrical engineer. I cannot In think that the honourable member really believes, as he most forcibly told us he did, .that we have the best possible telephone system. I can prove, without difficulty, that there are other systems very much ahead of what we enjoy here. I am in possession of some little information which, had the honourable member him less certain in many of his statements. The Daily Telegraph of Sydney, of 3rd November, 1910, contained an article on the subject. It is very fortunate that I happen to have the information which I am On the emabout to read, because otherwise the House might have been misled by the honourable member for Denison, who I understand is the political electrical authority of the CommonwealthThe result is that at AnVOCACV OF THE AUTOMATIC NO LISTENING EARS. Must the 'Phone Girl Go? Los Angeles, California, has more automatic telephones than any other city in the world. Over 28,000 are in use where six or seven years ago there was none. A hundred other American cities have the system also. People who have had experience say the automatic will ultimately supersede the manual system. They say the time is near when we will never again hear a feminine voice say, ""Yes, this is Central."" Mr Arthur Holliday, a representative of the Los Angeles Examiner, the Chicago Examiner, and other American newspapers, who is in Sydney, endorses the statements of a corresponI give the Treasurer dent published in the Daily Telegraph yesterday morning pointing out advantages of the automatic system. He said business people had found it very much more satisfactory than the old system, principally on account of the quickness in raising a number, and on account of the absolute secrecy of the conversation. "" From my experience in Los Angeles and other cities, I think the automatic system would exactly meet the requirements of a big hustling city like Sydney."" Points of Advantage. Mr J. R. Bainton, M.I.E.E. , electrical engineer, who spent eight months in America recently studying the telephone systems, said there were many reasons why the automatic telephone must take the place of the manually-operated system. An unlimited number of subscribers",60,Moloney Th E Age In Anomaly In The Act In This Way Tha T A Man
431,Mr Hedges (Fremantle) [10.19],"could be connected with the automatic system, whereas 10,000 was about the greatest number that could be comfortably connected with an exchange on the manual system. After 10,000 the. manual exchange became unwieldy, but even with 100,000 on the automatic the simplicity of the system would not be affected. "" There are no operators' salaries to pay,"" he continued, "" nor replacing of the switchboard lamps, as on the central battery system. No cords nor plugs nor jacks are required. Tliere can be no rush of work during busy hours of the day, because each subscriber connects himself. Confusion in the operating-room is thus avoided. The automatic system is popular because of its absolute secrecy. There is no chance of a conversation being interrupted or overheard nor of an attendant at the exchange listening. The operation of calling up a number is not only simple, but quick, and since you are not dependent on any one else, if your number is engaged you know immediately. A subscriber can test his own line for himself. He can call up his own number, and the "" busy "" signal will ring. That shows that his line to the exchange is in good order. Furthermore, at the main exchange a 10,000number board can be tested in half-an-hour. On the manual system it takes about three hours. Another important point is that the wear and tear on the automatic system is inconsiderable. One .very great advantage of the automatic system is that with it you can justly charge on a flat rate basis. Since there are no attendants, there is no extra expense from a large number of calls, so that the toll rate is unnecessary. There is no need to record the number of calls."" It is most important that Parliament should have this information, which shows that there are in other parts of the world systems which are as good as, if not better than ours, and less expensive. enabling subscribers to have communication without the intervention of telephone attendants would lead to a great saving of temper -"" Mr W. H . IRVINE -Ho w is the system operated? that. The article continues-^ Mr Sainton instanced Columbus (USA.) as a city where the automatic system had given great satisfaction. He said that subscribers who had had experience with both the automatic and manual system very much preferred the former. The population of the city was 185,000, and a few years ago the Citizens' Independent Telephone Company was formed to bring about their own independent installation, which is now on the automatic system. They have at present actually -connected 17,000 telephones, charging forty-five dollars {£$) a year, and so forcing the Bell (manual) Company to reduce its rates to the same figure from ninety-five dollars, which they were previously charging. Business men now had the two systems connected with their offices, and they could generally make a call with the automatic in onelliird of the time required by the manual. The icasun why the Bell Company continued to carry on was because it had been so much longer established, and had long-distanced lines throughout the country. "" I visited the main exchange at Columbus,"" said Mr Bainton, "" ancl there, where the bulk of the calls passed through, I found that the total number of people looking after the automatic apparatus was fifteen. Yet here in Sydney, with only 7,000 telephones, there are 150 on the staff."" I hope that the honourable member for Denison is listening to what I am reading. There are not more than 7,000 telephones in Sydney on one board. telephone subscribers in Svdney. 7,000 telephones on a board, there is a staff of about 150, but at Columbus, with 17,000 telephones, only fifteen operators are employed. To continue the quotation"" We arrived at Honolulu when the system had been installed about three weeks. It was a holiday, and we thought it would be a good opportunity for the exchange officials to be putting everything in good order. But there were only three people in the building, though there were 2,300 subscribers connected with the exchange. The board was installed for 5,000 subscribers, the building is fireproof, and the arrangements were the best df any system we sow."" "" The cost of equipment for small boards on the automatic system,"" said Mr Bainton, "" would be considerably more than that of the manual boards, but the cost per subscriber is almost a constant figure, whereas with the manual system board the cost per subscriber increases as the size of the exchange increases. Any system In a city like Sydney the cost of the automatic system would be a little greater than that of the manual system."" The automatic system had been put before the Commonwealth Chief Electrical Engineer( Mr John Hesketh), who was impressed with its advantages. Mr Bainton stated that it was surprising to note the interest being taken in automatic telephones by Continental engineers. The German Government had recently appointed a commission to inquire into the system, and finally placed an order for 30,000 instruments with a large manufacturer in Berlin. The French Government appointed a commission to study the question in the United States, and it was practically decided to call for prices for a large order. Let me now give the opinion of a London expertThe London Times bf July 20 last prints, in its engineering supplement, a report by Major W. A. J. O'Meara,. chief engineer of the British Post-office, dealing wilh the automatic telephone. The major is cautious, but it is obvious that he is impressed. "" We have yet to learn from actual experience,"" he writes, "" whether the automatic and the semi-automatic equipments provide sufficient flexibility to cover the wide range of requirements of the British public, how far the mechanism is reliable in the care of such men",61,Sydney Telephones
432,Mr Hedges,I am about to explain,62,Sydney Telephones
433,Mr Laird Smith,"There are 33,000",62,Sydney Telephones
434,Mr Hedges,"In Sydney, with onlyas we can train to maintain it, and how the cost of first installation and the annual charges in respect of depreciation, maintenance, and traffic operation compare as a whole with similar costs in respect of existing types of installaabout, is on the next shelf to the old magneto. tion. Clearly, if the new designs of equipment on testing out actually ' prove in ' there can be no doubt as to the course we must be prepared to adopt. "" I have to confess that I was much impressed with all that I saw in the fields of automatic telephony, and I feel that infinite credit is due to the manufacturers of the plants for the efficient manner in which the staff detailed to maintain the switch equipments have been trained. "" As an instance of the great flexibility of the automatic system, I may mention that whilst I was at Urbana it was demonstrated to me that so far as the selecting devices are concerned, it is possible to arrange for a practically unlimited number of subscribers to be connected to exchanges in a multi-office area. The operation of calling a subscriber, No. 2,401,104, was performed in my presence, the line used being made up of junctions from the Urbana exchange via the University and Champain (Illinois) exchanges and back, via the University to Urbana. "" Perhaps of all the interesting questions which were discussed, the most important is that relating to the development of the automatic and semi-automatic equipment. It was my good fortune to see no less than five different types oi switch equipment, designed to provide automatic and semi-automatic telephone service, and I also had the advantage of discussing the question of providing service by means of these new types of equipment, not only with those who advocate these systems, but also with those who are opponents of the automatic systems. A matter which has been much debated,"" he continues, "" is that relating to the probable attitude of the public towards a service provided by means of f u l l automatic systems. The question naturalty arises whether the public will take kindly to the task of calling their correspondents when once the novelty of the apparatus has worn off. I think the non-committal answer of "" wait and see "" is the safest at the present moment. Tme, at the present time, some 200,000 f u l l automatic stations are in operation in North America, and the advocates of the system point to this fact in support of their contention that the public prefer this system. "" On the other hand, the opponents of the system claim that it is the novelty of the thing which appeals to the public, and suggest that the users are also stockholders in the operating companies, that the pleasure arising from a feeling of ownership in the plant is responsible for the enthusiasm, where such exists, and that as soon as the plant begins to age, and the service in consequence shows signs of deterioration, the present feeling of satisfaction will give place to one of disgust. The whole question certainly requires the serious consideration of telephone engineers in this country."" Mr A. Da Costa, writing to the editor, saysSIR,-You r Honolulu correspondent suggests a proceeding which would be of considerable value to the Commonwealth, namely, the introduction f an automatic telephone service. The installation would doubtless be expensive, but the [80]2 maintenance would be a decimal only of the present cost of our two obsolete boards, in Sydney, at any rate. It may not be known to the public that the city board, so much talked Many people talk about the common battery board now being installed, but few ask why it is not extended; fewer still, perhaps, know it is a back number. Why not make one bite of the cherry, and get up-to-date machinery V T he automatic system is worked in this wavSuppose a subscriber wants to get into communication with No. 1871. He places his finger on the number one and rotates the movable plate of the dial until stopped by the projecting bar. In turn he places his finger on the numbers 8, 7, 1, moving the outer dial as before to the projecting bar. Then he takes up the receiver, and finds he is in communication with No. 1871. The whole operation can be performed in four seconds. This system entirely dispenses with the telephone girl, and obviates any delay. I propose now to give the Minister of External Affairs my authority for the statementA representative of the Daily Telegraph secured striking testimony yesterday in favour of the automatic telephone system from Mr W. O. Brain, Chief Electrical Engineer of the Tramway Department. Mr Brain must be regarded as an unbiased authority, as he was specially instructed by the Chief Commissioner for Railways to investigate tlie matter of automatic telephonic communication during his recent visit to Europe and America, when he represented the department at the International Railway Congress held at Berne, in Switzerland, in July last. Has the Commonwealth Government troubled to send even a telephone operator to England or America to make inquiries ? No; they have tried to force on us the obsolete system in which the honourable member for Denison so strongly believesMr Brain, when interviewed, was very hesitant in regard to making a statement, and it was evident that he did not wish to reflect in any way on the management of the local telephone service. "" I went over the whole of the Telephone Exchange in Columbus (Ohio, USA.), where, I believe, is one of the largest equipments of automatic telephones in the world. There was plenty of evidence of the automatic system giving complete satisfaction. This is best evidenced by the fact that the system is being rapidly extended in that city. In Columbus there are altogether about 17,000 telephones connected with the exchange and automatically operated, so that it will be seen that the system can be successfully applied in larger towns than Sydney, where there are only about 7,000 subscribers. In that city their main central exchange was connected to a number of branch exchanges. The absence of attendance upon the instruments enables them to make a larger number of branch exchanges, and so reduce, the length of line. The automatic system is simple in operation, and prevents any possibility of delay. As soon as you have manipulated the outer dial you are in communication with the telephone of the person you wish to reach. In the city of Columbus both the common battery system and the automatic system are in operation, and the automatic system is preferred by the general public, as it guarantees an immediate call-althoug h I must say that the attention given under the Bell telephone service in America is excellent I also saw the installation at Honolulu, described in to-day's issue of the Daily Telegraph; and was informed by the manager that it was displacing an up-to-date common battery system which had only been installed a matter of four or five years. It really takes American spirit of enterprise to ' scrap' a new and costly instaldetails are set out, and the Government are lation like that, but it shows that they realise that the automatic system had important advantages."" I should like the honourable member for Denison to allow this information to soak into his mind, so that when next he speaks of the wonderful system in use in the Commonwealth, he will propose its displacement by the automatic system. Four or five members of this Parliament who returned Canada and the United States, speak in yery high terms of the automatic system in use there, and tell me that they experienced no trouble whatever in getting into . touch with subscribers. They consider the system is far ahead of anything we have in Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative. In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed page 2118). Divisions i to 5 (Home Affairs), £824,915. is one item in these Estimates to whicli I wish specially to refer, and that is the proposed vote, "" Federal Capital at Canberra, towards cost of establishing, £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . "" It is true that the Minister of Home Affairs said last night that of this amount only ,£66,043 w as m respect of new service, j£33,957 being a re-vote; but the fact remains that we are asked to vote, altogether, £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 for this purpose. we reach the item? made two speeches last night, and I am going to deal with this question now. There ts one peculiar feature of the Estimates relating to the Federal Capital which I desire to bring under the notice of the Committee. We find that the proposed votes in respect of the Northern Territory and Papua are dealt with under a separate heading, and details are set out; whereas in the case of the Federal Capital we have an item covering a lump sum, and giving absolutely no details. On the last page of the Works and Buildings Estimates honourable members will find a division relating to the Northern Territory, in which are set out items relating to alterations to the Darwin hospital, artesian water bores, roads, fords and bridges, and so forth. All the bound by the items given. Then, again, in the General Estimates, the cost of administration is specified in every case, and details given. In connection with the Federal Territory, however, we are asked to vote a lump sum of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 under these Estimates, and we are told that that lump sum includes £ 1 5 , 0 0 0 in respect of administration and survey. I take strong exception to the cost of administration being included recently from England, vid in a vote for Works and Buildings. Why is it not included in the General Estimates, as is the case in regard to the cost of administration of the Northern Territory and Papua? Why, also, are not the works and buildings to be carried out at the Federal Capital distinctly specified? ferred to, so far as the Federal Capital is concerned, relates to the officers conducting the necessary works. the administration of the Territory; but from ist 'November, vide why should the cost of administration be included in a lump sum with the Works and Buildings Estimates? member include the cost of the engineer of the proposed railway? penditure are set out in the Estimates in regard to Northern Territory works. Every officer is specified, and the works themselves are individualized. I think the same should be done in connection with Federal Capital works ? any officers in the Federal Territory ? night the severest criticism in connection with this subject came from two New South Wales members, one of whom is particularly rabid on the question of the Federal Capital. I refer to the honourable member for Wentworth, who admitted that it was necessary to approach the question of expenditure on the Federal Capital with an eye to "" rigid economy.""

But we really do not able, but because certain works could not be pushed forward for lack of a railway. It was found to be ruinous to pay for the cartage of material, and therefore works were stopped pending the construction of a railway. on last year's Estimates. connection with the purchase of lands. The route of the railway would probably traverse private lands, and the Government wanted to take possession of the whole of the lands, instead of taking some piecemeal. This year we were told that it is proposed to expend money on a weir on the Cotter, a bridge over the Murrumbidgee, a pipe line, a temporary railway, a power plant, a brickmaking plant, a road making plant, and timber. But we do not know how much money is to be spent on each of those works, though full details are given, with regard to the Northern Territory. For instance, there is £500 for the Pine Creek railway. Surely, we have just as much right' to ask for details regarding extakes place is this: A sum of money is penditure in the Capital Territory. We ought not to vote hundreds of thousands of pounds without knowing how the money is to be spent. There ought to be a Department for the Territory, and a clear idea ought to be given to us as to what the Government propose to do. This idea of giving a free hand is totally unsound. I can quite understand honourable members who are desirous of seeing the Federal Capital established beginning to get alarmed and to fear that the country will object to this South Melbourne. Between the present wild expenditure. I am quite prepared to join with any other honourable member in taking a stand for the express purpose of compelling the Government to come down with clear and distinct estimates of expengo back into the Treasury on 30th June diture, with particulars as to how much they propose to spend on particular works, and how long a period the expenditure is proposed to cover. We must put an end to this blank-cheque business. As £50,000 was voted last year without any details being furnished, we can hardly blame the Government for asking for £100,000 this year. I should not wonder if they asked for £250,000 next year. There is a rebate of £33,000 on account of last year's vote. addition to the balance of last year's vote? erected in his constituency ! £100,000 is in addition to the £16,000 know what is being done, how much is being spent, or how many years the expenditure is to be spread over. [10.56J I wish to say a few words with regard to expenditure on the erection of post offices. The Treasurer went into this matter yesterday, and I listened with pleasure to a certain portion of his remarks. But1 wish to be particularly clear as to what is to be done. We have items of expenditure amounting to £700,000. and then there is another item of £600,000 to be allocated to Trust Funds. than one financial year. We shall bring down a schedule. that. In the first year after I was returned to this HouseI was very much surprised that men experienced in parliamentary affairs should have allowed such a silly system to continue as that which we have had in connection with expenditure. What placed on the Estimates for building a post office, say, at Croajingalong, or Buckley's Crossing. On 30th June, after the expenditure is authorized by Parliament, the unexpended balance of the vote goes back into the Treasury. I am inclined to think that the Treasury looks upon these unexpended balances as a kind of nest egg with which they are able to inflate their revenue for the next year. On the present Estimates, there is a sum of £1,000 for a post-office at time and the end of the financial year, not more than that sum may be required to be paid to the contractor. Buti f the full amount is not expended, the balance will next, and between that date and the time when Parliament votes the necessary money again, either the contractor will be deprived of the cheques that are due to him, or the work will have to be stopped. I trust that the Home Affairs Department and the Treasury will come to an understanding so that even if the whole of a sum voted is not spent at the end of the financial year, the works for which the money was voted will not be suspended. very lucky if he is to have a post-office",64,Estimates Additions New Works And Buildings

Last year it was £ 1 , 5 0 0; this year it is his land. Many land-owners there have £1,000. score, because I am aware that not more than £1,000 will be required to be paid to the contractor before the end of the premortgage arranged for, in view of the sent financial year. I shall be rather pleased if the £600,000 mentioned by the Treasurer is devoted to works of that character, so that there may be no stoppage of operations. The Prime Minister has already said that it would be used for works extending over many years, instead of closing them up at the end of one financial year. That is the common-sense way in which all Commonwealth works should be carried on. I have never been able to thoroughly grasp why the other system has been followed so long. We-have found Treasurers coming down for asort of indemnifying vote years after moneys have been expended. The right honourable member for Swan on one occasion objected to certain moneys being passed for payment, and it transpired that some of the amounts had been spent during his own regime some two years before. The idea now put forward by the Treasurer is a good one, and I hope it will be extended, always on condition that a complete schedule is presented that will bring the Post and Telegraph. in each case, so that we may know what the money is being used for. I hope the Treasurer will take into consideration the adother year for the continuance of those visability of coining our own bullion in Australia. He says that we lose nothing by having it coined in Europe, but we have three mints in Australia, and the present staffs, with additional hands and more machinery, could coin the whole of our money, and we know that the demand for silver and copper coinage in Australia will increase every year. That work will give a great deal of employment, and involve a great saving, because it must cost many thousands of pounds to have our coinage produced in other countries. It is not my intention in the future to oppose any votes for the Federal Capital site at Canberra, because I recognise that it has been selected, and that we shall have to make the best of it, bad though it may be. We are, however, not treating the land-holders in the Federal Territory properly. They are under great disabilities, which ought to be immediately removed. The land of some of them is partly in the Federal Territory, and partly in New South Wales, and in those cases they do not know what to do. Perhaps the part cut out is the worse part of a man's holding, but if he sells it cheaply it may be taken as the value of the rest of I make no complaint on that their ""property mortgaged, and the mortgages are falling due. It is a matter of great difficulty for them to get a new present insecure tenure.

My cxpenence is that all the arrangements made with the Government this session for the early termination of debates have simply resulted in letting loose a flood of eloquence on the other side. Honourable members opposite seem to be as dumb as oysters until some arrangement has been entered into with this side, and then they flood the chamber with oratory as though they would never stop. I do not understand that sort of thing at all. As regards this sitting, I do not see what the Government have to complain of. We discussed grievances for two hours only grievances for two hours before complaints began to be made. Had we on this side appointed the Sugar Commission, honourable members opposite would have discussed the appointment for days, not for hours. Really, it is time that they stopped these mock heroics which they are getting up every day. It is coming to this, it seems to me, that the Opposition will not be expected to speak at all. But I am afraid that we shall have to do a little talking, despite the Caucus. "" We do not settle things beforehand, and so we have to do our talking in the House. There seems to be a spirit abroad on the Government side that, because they have an overwhelming majority, therefore nothing should occur on this side. The sooner they get that silly notion out of their heads, the better for us all, and the better for the good temper of the House. I said nothing about the Sugar Commission to-day. I had some notes prepared, and was quite expecting to speak, but when the debate had proceeded till io o'clock, I waived my right to speak on the subject. And this is the reward we are getting.
