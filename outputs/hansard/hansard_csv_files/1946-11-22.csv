In accordance with the undertaking given by the Government in response to a request by the industry, action is now being taken to constitute the Joint Dairying Industry Advisory Committee on Production Costs.

I shall look into the matter in order to discover what exactly is the position so that I may give a ruling. The matter is covered by regulations which I administer. MEAT PRICES. Mrs. BLACKBURN -In view of the exceptionally high profits made during the war years by graziers, why was tbe recent increase of tbe price of meat permitted by the Prices Commissioner? Is it a fact that the Prices Commissioner considered the increase to be unjustified, but necessary, with the consent of the Queensmade necessary by the fact that meat had brought such, high prices at the saleyards that butchers had been compelled to sell on the black market to recover their outlay? Could not the black market in meat be eliminated by acquiring all meat "" on the hook"" at a reasonable price, and allocating it to butchers at a price fixed by the Prices Commissioner, instead of permitting it to go to the highest bidder? Is it reasonable that graziers who are making high incomes from the sale of their products on the world market should 1)0 allowed to sell at uncontrolled prices in Australia while the wages of workers remain pegged ? to refer the matter to the Minister for Trade and Customs with a request that the fullest possible information be supplied. RE-ESTABLISHMENT. previous occasions tried to find out what progress is being made with the establishment of a special school in Brisbane for the vocational training of electrical linemen, some hundreds of whom have registered, and are anxious to go on with their training. Can the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction make a statement on the subject? 13th November, the honourable member asked me, without notice, to make inquiries into plans for a re-establishment training scheme in Queensland for electrical linemen. The position is that we are well on the way to commencing such a course in Brisbane. In order to train ex-servicemen for this occupation, two different aspects of the proposal had fÂ® be considered. The honourable member will know that the licensing of electrical linemen is controlled l.\y State legislation which, except in the CUSP of skilled operatives from other branches of the electrical trades, imposes a minimum twoyear period of training on the ground before the examination for a full license for overhead operations can be attempted. In order to satisfy the existing demand for approximately one hundred of these tradesmen as quickly as possible, it was land Government, to issue a regulation nnder Section 4'6 of the Re-establishment and Employment Act of 1945 to override the normal provisions of State legislation, in the special case of ex-servicemen trained under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme. The issue of such a regulation is at present being negotiated. When agreement had been reached on the terms of the regulation, it was necessary to arrange a suitable course of intensive full-time training to condense the knowledge and experience normally acquired during the two year period referred to into approximately six months. A proposal by the Brisbane City Council to set up a school for this purpose was received by my department and submitted to the training authority under the scheme for examination. Technical school training is, wherever",13,Royal Australian Navy

22,Mr Dedman,"by leave-On thepossible, administered by State educational authorities. All courses wbich involve tht use of private training institutions are scrutinized very carefully from tbe poiat of view of finance and also of the educational standard offered. Approval of a private training institution is contingent upon the institution's ability to submit a satisfactory syllabus of training and co-operate in the approved method of financial settlement, which requires the division of the course into a number of units, payment for which is made as the course proceeds, fn this way, the Commonwealth is protected in cases of discontinuance during the course. The original proposal of the Brisbane City Council was for a 22 weeks' course with a capacity of twenty trainees at a per capita charge of Â£65. This was considerably in excess of tbe amount charged by other private training institutions for comparable instructional services, and further details were requested by the training authority. During these discussions the availability of this course of training in a Government institution was examined. It was found that similar instruction had been given by a Commonwealth department to the Army at a per capita fee approximating Â£26, but this amount was for tuition only and was exclusive of administrative and overhead expenses incidental to the conduct of courses. This figure was mentioned to the Brisbane City Council as a basis for tbe computation of the instructional fee. After negotiation, a per capita fee of Â£52 for uhe course, to include cost of instruction, materials, use of premises and apparatus, was submitted to the Central Reconstruction Training Committee for its approval, which was accorded at the November meeting. The present position is that as soon as agreecause of war conditions and neglect on ment has been reached as to the terms of the necessary regulation, training of electrical linemen in Queensland will commence. FOB EMPLOYEES-SUPPL Y OF TELEthat adequate materials are not available sions, without success, I have brought to the Postmaster-General ascertain whether the notice of the Postmaser-General the need to provide better accommodation f OT employees at the post office at Marnoo, Victoria. Now, in a recent report, the -local medical officer for health, Dr. J. E. Thomas, statesThe Marnoo post office was inspected by the shire health inspector. It was noted that the rear room at the back of the post office, size 10 f t . x 12 f t . approximately, was used to accommodate a switchboard, and to provide sleeping accommodation for the male operator on night duty. In the daytime tlie switch is operated by a female telephonist.

No representations have been made to me lately, although I am aware that negotiations on the subject were conducted by the Commonwealth Actuary, Mr Balmford, of the Capital Issues Branch.

As far back as last July, the Commonwealth entered into negotiations with the trustees of Manchester Unity with a view to arriving at an amicable settlement for the purchase of this property, or, alternatively, for a lease covering a period satisfactory to the Government. In August, I received a number of representations on behalf of the trustees, asking me to defer the decision in order to afford Manchester Unity an opportunity to negotiate with the Government for a long-term lease. I agreed to defer action, but when negotiations eventually failed to yield a satisfactory result, the Government confirmed its previous decision to acquire the property. FOOD SUPPLIES.

The Government is anxious to resume large holdings upon the expiration of their leases, so that they may be subdivided and made available to new settlers. The honourable member's third question relates to the land settlement of ex-servicemen. Apparently, he missed the Government declaration on this matter. I recall dealing with the Government's policy on the settlement of ex-servicemen in the Northern Territory on the adjournment of the House one day during the last Parliament. The honourable member for the Northern Territory was present on that occasion. Other announcements of the Government's intentions have been made, and there has been no alteration of policy since. day, when referring to the danger of a grim possibility, both in the New World floating mines, the honourable member for and in the Olda possibility against Parramatta ( Mr Beale) asked whether I which we must.guard with all the inwould inform the House of the actual telligence, all the realism, and all the number of mines sown, in the Barrier energy that we can muster.

I therefore, the crucial importance to Aushave had an opportunity to consider this tralia of a policy of planned immigration. matter, and I do not think that it would be in the national interest to reveal the actual number of mines sown, but I can say that it runs into some thousands. The object of sowing the mines was to block passage through the Reef, leaving only channels for use by Allied shipping. In consequence, vessels of the allied nations were able to proceed in safety for a distance of 1,000 miles, protected by the Barrier Reef itself, and by tbe mine-fields. for Information and Minister for Immigration) -by leave-Al l shades of thought agree that Australia's security, economic stability and destiny as a major upon the success of the Commonwealth's immigration programme. No country needs immigrants of the right type more urgently than does Australia. And no country has taken more energetic steps to Territory will be made in secure them. Few countries can offer as much as ours to the new settler, and to few countries can the new settler, in turn, give so much in terms of security and economic expansion. We Australians are a young and virile people and our national heart beats strongly. But tbe body, of which that heart is the motivating force, is a huge land mass, an island continent of some three million square miles with 12,000 miles of coastline. Before a body of such vast dimensions can be operated at full efficiency, its heart must beat strongly and be fed by the extra life-blood which only new citizens can supply. There was a time just four years ago when Australia faced its gravest peril. Armies recruited from the teeming millions of Japan threatened to overrun our cities and broad hinterland.

45,Mr Calwell (Melbourne,"Ministe rit is with great pleasure that I am to-day able to review, for the benefit of honourable members, the substantial progress that has already been made in bringing our plans to f r u it i o n. Tn the forefront of our entire immigration programme are the free anrl assisted passage schemes designed to bring to these shores a steady flow of the best possible immigrant types from the United Kingdom. So far, shipping difficulties have made it impossible for the Commonwealth and the United Kingdom Governments to declare these schemes open; yet inquiries already registered at Australia House, London, from people in the United Kingdom total 63,700. These cover approximately 153,000 people and disclose 866 occupational categories. Even so, the figures give no more than a token indication of the flood of applications which can be expected once the schemes come into operation and our publicity to encourage migration is intensified. The date for the opening of the free and assisted schemes w ill be determined by the United Kingdom and i be Commonwealth Governments as soon as possible. entirely dependent on the ability of both governments to reach agreement with British shipping companies as to the fares to be charged during the currency of both schemes. Nevertheless, I am hopeful that they w ill begin early in 1947. Apri l of this year, I made a statement to this House covering the terms of the agreements for free and assisted passages which had been completed between tbe United Kingdom and the Commonwealth Governments. Four months later, I gave a further review of the general immigration position. At a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers at Canberra on tbe 19th August, all aspects of immigration were discussed at length and certain recommendations were accordingly submitted to the Premiers Conference on tbe following day. The All the States indicated their complete support of the Commonwealth Government's plans, which will be carried out as a co-operative and coordinated effort between the Commonwealth and the State Governments. The Commonwealth Government, will be reresponsible for the recruiting, medical examination, selection, and transportation of all British migrants brought hereunder the free and assisted passage schemes, and for placing them in employment. The State Governments have undertaken the responsibility for their reception and accommodation on arrival and for their aftercare. In connection with accommodation, the States have agreed to bear the cost of the migrants' maintenance, where necessary, for a period of seven days after their arrival. The fares of migrants from the port of disembarkation to their final destination will be borne by the Government of the State in which they are settling, except when privately-owned transport has to be used. In that event, 50 per cent, of the cost w ill be met by the Commonwealth Government and 50 per cent, by the State Government concerned. It wa* agreed at the Premiers Conference that the Commonwealth and State Governments would jointly meet the capital expenditure on governmental establishments in which migrants will be temporarily That date, however, is accommodated after their arrival. ""With regard to capital expenditure by existing or new voluntary organizations for tbe accommodation of child and youth migrants, the States agreed to contribute one-third of this expenditure on items approved by the Commonwealth GovernOn the 5th ment and the State Government concerned. It was left to the Commonwealth Government to determine how the remainder will be shared between it and the organization seeking financial assistance. Generally speaking, the Commonwealth will contribute one-third. A t this stage. I emphasize once again that Government assistance is uniforml y available to all religious and secular organizations wishing to introduce child migrants and youths into this country. The question of the maintenance of B r i tish, child migrants introduced under the result was highly successful. a.uspices of voluntary migration organizations was also considered and determined at the Premiers Conference. The States agreed to pay 3s. 6d. a week for each child up to the age of fourteen years, and to continue this payment up to the age of sixteen years if the child were still at school. These contributions will be subject to the payment of Commonwealth child endowment of 7s. 6d. a week, and to the United Kingdom.

As child migration is in a special field of its own, it is essential that governmental cised to ensure the well-being of migrant children brought to Australia. Honourable members will recall that, before the last Parliament closed, the I m migration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 was passed. Under that Act, which w ill come into operation before the 31st December of this year, the legal guardianship of British evacuee children still remaining in this country, and of migrant children who will be brought out in the future, is vested i u the Minister for Immigration. does not apply to immigrant children who come to Australia with , or live under the care of, their parents or relatives, provides that the Minister may delegate his powers of guardianship under the Act to State authorities, and it is proposed that this shall be done. This delegation may be revoked at the discretion of the Minister. Suitable persons or representatives of any authority or organization may be granted the custody of evacuee and migrant children. Generally speaking, those who sponsor the admission of such children will be granted custody of them. Regulations under the Act, and delegations of the power of guardianship to State authorities, are now being prepared. In the early stages of the free and assisted passage schemes, many more immigrants are likely to be offering than can be carried in the shipping which will then be available. It w ill , therefore, be necessary to introduce a system of priorities for passages. The categories approved by the Premiers Conference were1. Nominated migrants who can be accommodated by their nominators and are classed as essential workers for Australian industry. 2. Nominated migrants who can be accommodated by their nominators and can be readily employed. Mr Calwell. 3. Children for existing child migration organizations which have accommodation vacant for them, e.g., farm schools. -1. Nominated migrants, single persons, who cannot be accommodated by theiT nominators but who are classed as essential, workers for Australian industry. -5. Single migrants, without nominators or assured accommodation, who are classed as essential workers for Australian industry. (i. Nominated migrants, married and with or without children, who cannot be accommodated by their nominators, but who are over-sight should be exerclassed as essential workers for Australian industry. 7. Married migrants, with or without children-, but without nominators or assured accommodation, who are classed as essential workersfor Australian industry. S. Single migrants, and married migrants, with or without children, nominated, but accommodation not assured, who can be readily employed. 9. Single migrants,, without nominators or assured accommodation, who can be readily employed. 10. Married migrants, with or without children, but without nominators or assured accommodation,, who can be readily employed. The legislation, which 11. Single migrants, and married migrant* with or without children, nominated, with accommodation available, but with no special employment prospects. 12. Single migrants, and married migrant? with or without children, nominated,, but accommodation not assured, with no special employment prospects. .13. Single migrants, without nominators oi assured accommodation, who have no special employment prospects. 14. Married migrants, with or without children, but without nominators or assured accommodation', who have no special employment prospects. The foregoing order of priority relates to individual migrants, and can be varied when circumstances demand. Where the transfer of groups of workers is proposed for defence or other projects, such groups will be given a high priority of shipment, based on the urgency of the project. Any system of priorities needs to be flexible in order to meet special cases or circumstances. In the early stages, preference w ill be given to single persons over family units within each category, solely because of transport and accommodation difficulties in relation to familv units. Later, it may be practicable to grant family units priority over single persons. The PremiersConference agreed on tbe procedure to be adopted betwen the Commonwealth and the Statesi n handling nominations by persons or organizations or industrial concerns in Australia wishing to introduce migrants under the free and assisted passage schemes. nominations will be submitted to the State immigration authorities, who will satisfy themselves as to bona fides of tlie nominators, particularly as to their ability to accommodate their nominees. Tho States will then forward their recommendations to the Commonwealth for approval, and upon this being given, particulars of the approved nominations will be forwarded to the .Migration Branch, High Commissioner's Office London. Arrangments will then be made for the nominee to be medically examined, and, if he is adjudged a suitable migrant from health and other aspects, he will be accepted, and arrangements will be made for his passage. In the care of group nominations, where individuals are not named but only the number of persons required is stated, the Migration Branch, London, will recruit migrants in accordance with the specifications of the nomination. Immigration publicity is most imporbe enabled to do so, stocks of personal and tant.

These surveys have nowtralian Government representatives overbeen completed. The facts are being seas. Special facilities have, also been collated, and will be submitted to a conference of Commonwealth and State These Ministers which it is proposed to hold in Canberra next month. In general, however, Commonwealth service establishments which are no longer required, or hostels that were established during wartime by the Co.mimonwealth, will be used by the States for the temporary accommodation of migrants after their arrival. In some instances, State establishments will be renovated for this purpose. A detailed estimate of the capacity of the States to absorb migrants has been made for each industry, and for individual occupations -within each industry, so that when the Ministers meet rhey will have a comprehensive picture of Australia's requirements for 1947, and will be able to determine the number of migrants in each division of industry which may be allotted to each State for that period. So that persons or organizations wishing to nominate British migrants may Realizing that British service personnel the States, in the fruitful field for immigration, I agreed tralian Government representatives in given to Allied servicemen, particularly if the United States and the Netherlands, to encourage them to remain here or to return to the Commonwealth after receiving their discharge in their homelands. Over 1,000 American servicemen have been granted their discharges in Australia, and in addition considerable numbers have been given permission to return to this country after discharge In the United States. Many Dutch servicemen and some Norwegian naval personnel have also been permitted to remain here permanently upon production of a satisfactory discharge. Erom the date of their arrival, the Commonwealth Government will make social service benefits available to British migrants under the free and assisted passage schemes, on tlie basis that they would be ordinarily resident in Australia. The question as to whether the application of these benefits may be extended to all categories of migrants is now being examined. Provision has also been made by the trade categories named by the DepartCommonwealth Government for United ment of Works and Housing.

They are, however, not eligible for preference under the Re-establishment and' Employment' Act 1945, and this fact isemphasized in all immigration literaturedistributed in the United Kingdom, so that there will be no misconceptions in. the minds of intending migrants. This statement would not be completewithout a reference to the 600 building tradesmen from the United Kingdom, all ex-servicemen, who are being brought to Canberra by the Commonwealth under special arrangement with the United Kingdom Government to engage in the large works-and-housing programme in the Australian Capital Territory.

When the Prime Minister( Mr tralia under troopship conditions, beginthe Australian High Commissioner in during 1947 will fall considerably below available for the United Kingdom-Auscould be made available, are advanced as reasons for tlie new low estimate of the number of migrants who can be brought here next year. The United Kingdom Government views the problem of shipping in a global sense rather than from tbe strict limits of its implications to Australia. It holds that the requirements of British military necessity must be met, and that at least skeleton civilian traffic must be maintained. It emphasizes that every vessel available is fully employed, and that any alteration to these plans for some months to come would involve major disruption. The Australian High Commissioner is, however, making every effort to secure a much larger allocation of shipping for migrant purposes than is at present proposed. The Government is considering the practicability of constructing large passenger vessels, suitable for the carriage of migrants, by shipyards in Australia and the United Kingdom. Inquiries have also been instituted in the United States as to whether any .suitable vessels could be obtained there either by purchase or charter for the carriage of migrants. Other avenues, too, are being explored, such as the use of aircraft carriers and the practicability of procuring foreign-owned passenger vessels to pick up migrants at United Kingdom ports. In view of the acute shipping position, the Government has also indicated to the Australian High Commissioner in London that it is prepared to consider contracting with owners to use ships under troopship conditions for a period of up to five years. At present there are many Australians in the United Kingdom awaiting passages to their homeland, including 115 wives and widows, 44 children, and 426 fiancees of Australian ex-servicemen. The Australian High Commissioner is doing his utmost to obtain early passages for these categories, especially the ex-servicemen's relatives, and it is expected that they will be provided with berths in the near future. I might here mention that to date, 3,290 wives, 94 widows, 1,179 children and 396 fiancees of Australian servicemen have been, brought out to Australia, from the United Kingdom. In this statement. I have so, far dealt mainly with British migration from the United Kingdom, which is first and foremost in our plans. However, we are not unmindful of the fact that many thousands of desirable people on tbe European continent are anxious to settle in our land. It is hoped that the governments of these countries will be prepared to participate in plans on the lines of the free and assisted passage schemes which have been entered into between the governments of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Tbe Australian Minister to The Hague has already been requested to enter into negotiations with the Netherlands Government for an assisted passage scheme. The Swiss Government has no diplomatic representation in Australia, but the question of Swiss migration to this country has been discussed by the Secretary of the Department of Immigration, Mr T. H . E. Heyes, with the Swiss Consul-General, and these discussions are being pursued. Negotiations with other friendly European governments will, I hope, be opened at an early date. When our plans for encouraging migrants from the European continent are developed, action will be taken to establish migration offices in appropriate foreign centres, so that facilities and encouragement may be accorded to those who want to make Australia their permanent home. Then there is the tragedy of Europe's army of displaced and persecuted people. As honourable members are aware, the various Allied governments have been subjected to strong pressure at international conferences to accept large quotas of these unfortunate men, women, and children. The Government, having regard to its responsibilities to Australian ex-servicemen, and having in mind the grave housing shortage still persisting throughout the Commonwealth, is not under present conditions in a position to commit itself in this matter; nevertheless, it considers that Australia should on humanitarian grounds make some contribution to the relief of certain of the distressed peoples of Europe. Approval has therefore been given for tbe admission of a limited number of these people, provided they are nominated by relatives in Australia who are in a position and willing to accommodate and maintain them. The granting of vises to the holders of landing permits has been so arranged that such persons must embark in non-British ships from continental ports. The limited accommodation, at present available in British ships will continue to be reserved for returning Australians, for the wives and families and thefianceesof ex-servicemen, and for British migrants whose services and skill wo urgently need. While on the subject of foreign migration, I would like to emphasize that the Government's immigration policy is based on the principle that migrants from the United Kingdom shall be given every encouragement and assistance. It is my hope that for every foreign, migrant there will be ten people from the United Kingdom. Only time will tell how far this hope can be realized. We have already given indubitable evidence of our preference for the United Kingdom migrant by entering into agreements with the United Kingdom government for the granting of free and assisted passages to suitable people from the United Kingdom. Aliens are and will continue to be admitted only in such numbers and of such classes that they can be readily assimilated. Every precaution is taken to ensure that they are desirable types, and they must satisfy consular or passport officers and security service officers that they are people of good character before their passports are vised for travel to Australia. In my first statement as Minister for mittee are: Mr Haylen, M.P. (ChairImmigration, on the 2nd August, 1945, man) ; Professor R. C. Mills, Director of I emphasized that too little regard has the Commonwealth Office of Education; been paid in the past to the assimilation Mr John Horgan, Assistant Secretary of aliens whom we admit as settlers.

The booklet, written in simple part of the general community and took language, will give the alien an outline their proper share in the affairs of this of our historical and cultural background, country. I repeat the words I used on our social structure and mode of governthat occasionWe have been too prone in the past to ostraand what Australia stands for as a nation. cize those of alien birth and then blame them It will bring home to him the privileges for segregating themselves and forming foreign and benefits which derive from Australian communities. generally responsible for this condition of affairs. 'Fortunately, in Australia where non-British migrants have monwealth. tended to congregate in considerable One of these is in Shepparton, Victoria, the seeond is in the Tjecton-Griffith irrigation area cedure connected with the taking of the Mr Calwell. of New South Wales, and the third is on the northern canefields of Queensland. That these people can be absorbed into our community life in the course of one generation is proved by the fact that the Australian-born children of most foreigu-born parents have played their part in the fighting services in the defence of Australia in this war and regard themselves as Australians, having equal citizenship rights and bearing equal national responsibilities with every other Australian. Honourable members must agree that a policy which allowed foreign migrants to be regarded with indifference, or with veiled hostility, cannot serve the best interests of Australia. We propose to take action to remedy this state of affairs. Among the steps which I contemplate is the setting up at an early date of an advisory body to deal with all matters affecting the immigration of aliens to Australia. I hope to utilize the services of such members of the Immigration Advisory Committee as are available and willing to serve on this advisory body. It will be recalled that the Immigration Advisory Committee, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), after the conclusion of the International Labour Conference in September, 1945, inquired into the question of immigration to Australia in the north-western countries of Europe. The committee, which is to prepare a booklet on the lines of a similar American publication for the benefit of alien newcomers, will commence its labours at an early date. The members of this comment, an appreciation of our way of life, It is we, not they, who are citizenship, and will better fit him to take we have only three areas his place as a partner in our great Comnumbers. It is my belief that the present prooath of allegiance by applicants for naturalization leaves much to be desired. At present, the prospective new citizen merely attends his local courthouse and takes the oath before a magistrate or a clerk of courts, f t seems to me, however, that such an occasion calls for a dignified induction ceremony that would serve to instil into the minds of applicants a proper appreciation of the value of the new citizenship, which carries with it certain obligations and responsibilities as well as privileges and benefits. Such a ceremony, based on the American practice, would, I feel sure, produce the same excellent results as have been achieved in the United States. I propose to give this question fuller consideration in the near future, and will submit plans to the next conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers on immigration, and seek the cooperation of State authorities in carrying out this plan. With regard to children from Europe, who may be introduced under the auspices of any denomination or non-denominational voluntary migration organization, the Government has decided to pay the cost of their transport from the port of embarkation to Australia. Arrangements for Maltese migration to Australia will in due course be made with the Government of Malta, but, 'because of the small population of that island, it is not likely to reach large proportions. subjects, whose record during the war was a magnificent one, and their compatriots who have settled in Australia in the past have proved themselves industrious workers and good citizens. It is the Government's intention to continue with the efforts it launched during the last Parliament for the removal of the disabilities endured by married women under existing nationality laws. As Minister for Immigration, I appointed a committee to consider the practical and legal difficulties involved in the posses; sion by husband and wife of different nationalities, and to suggest what steps might be taken to overcome or minimize these difficulties. The committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Dorothy Tangney, comprised the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), and representatives of the National Council of Women of Australia, the women's committee of the Australian Labour party, the Australian Country Women's Association, the Attorney-General's Department, and the Department of Immigration. In its report, the committee recorded its endorsement of the proposed legislation agreed to by members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, to provide(i) that a British woman on marriage to a foreigner, whether she does or does not acquire his nationality under the law of his country, shall not lose her British nationality unless she takes active steps to renounce (ii) that a foreign woman on marriage to a British subject shall not automatically acquire British nationality, but shall have the right to apply for it, subect to the exercise by the Minister concerned of a discretion as to the granting or refusal of such an application. The committee also reeommended that(i) an approach be made to the appropriate authority in the United Nations Organization for tbe universal adoption of the principle that a married woman shall be free to determine her own nationality; ( i i) action be taken to abolish the rule that a child born on British soil of The Maltese are British an enemy alien father is not a natural bom British subject, if (n ) he was born in a part of the British Dominions which at the time of his birth was in hostile occupa tion; or (6) his father was imprisoned as a prisoner-of-war or interned as a matter of precaution. Honourable members will recall that before the expiration of the last, Parliament I introduced a bill to provide that a British woman who married a foreigner in Australia shall in this country be regarded as having retained her British nationality, whether or not she acquires her husband's nationality. This act was proclaimed to commence on the 7th November, .1946. In passing I may mention that the women members of the committee referred to above sponsored a vote congratulating the Government for having introduced this bill, which, in the words of the honourable member for Darwin, ""means a big advance so far as the -national status of married women in this country is concerned "". Parliament also passed an act to enable residents of the Territory of New Guinea to become naturalized British subjects in Australia. This legislation will prove a boon to many worthy residents who have doue so much to develop the resources, and improve the conditions, of the native inhabitants of a territory so closely linked with this country. A conference of nationality experts of countries of the British Commonwealth will be held in London early in the New Year. Australia's representatives will be Mr John Horgan, Assistant Secretary (Restricted Immigration) in the Department of Immigration, who will act as technical adviser, and the SolicitorGovernment for intending migrants. General, Professor Kenneth EE. Bailey, who will act as legal adviser. Erom a nationality point of view, the matters to be discussed at the conference will be of r,he highest importance to all members of the British Commonwealth. These will include problems arising from the recently enacted Canadian Citizenship Act, questions relating to the national status of women and children, and the granting of Empire-wide naturalization to residents of mandated territories, including the Territory of New Guinea. The administration of the Government's immigration plans represents, not only a heavy responsibility, but also a very considerable expansion of my department's activities. venience of the public, and to facilitate the handling of immigration in all its aspects, branch offices of the department have been established in all the States except Tasmania, where an office will be opened shortly. Attention has been paid also to the Migration Branch at Australia House, which has been re-organized and augmented by the appointment from Australia of a number of permanent officers from the Commonwealth Public Service. In addition, some Royal Australian Air Force personnel, who were officers of the Commonwealth Public Service before the war, took their discharges in London, and Mr Galioell. were transferred from their old departments to the staff of the Department of Immigration in England. The migration staff now at Australia House should be sufficient to cope with the huge volume of inquiries being received there from prospective migrants. A highly skilled officer, with an extensive knowledge of industrial and trades union matters in Australia, has been appointed to the London staff. His appointment was endorsed by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, and among his duties are the advising of intending migrants on industrial conditions in Australia, their eligibility to join trade unions on arrival, and all matters affecting their trade qualifications. A senior medical officer has also been sent from Australia to London to see that no departure is made from the medical standards laid down by the ""While these standards will ensure that the migrants accepted for Australia are good physical types, they are not such as would defeat our aims of inducing full scale migration to this country. Honourable members on both sides of the House will agree, in the light of the facts which I have placed before them, that the Government is planning immigration thoroughly and imaginatively, and is doing its utmost to induce a large flow of newcomers to this country. As with all large projects of a national character, progress is not always made as quickly as we would desire, particularly when retarding factors exist over which we have no control, such as the For the conpresent dearth of shipping. We are, however, progressing as rapidly as circumstances permit, and I make no idle boast"" when I say that Australia's planning in this post-war era is far ahead of that of any other country inside the British Commonwealth of Nations, which is interested in encouraging settlers to its shores. This fact is generally recognized overseas. The vital necessity for considerably increasing the population of this country, from both the defence and economic aspects, cannot be too greatly or too often emphasized. If we are to take our rightful place in world affairs; if we are to -ensure the future security of our nation, our population must be greatly augmented, both by natural increase and by planned immigration. Nevertheless, the ""Government also 7-ea.lizes that any attempt to bring great numbers of migrants into Australia without adequate provision being made for their reception, accommodation and employment, would only react against migration to this country and defeat the very objectives at which the Government aims and which it is determined to achieve. The days of our isolation are over. We live in an age when the earth's surface seems to be contracting under the influence of scientific discoveries that almost baffle -our imagination. The call to all Australians is to realize that without adequate numbers this wide brown land may not be held in another clash of arms, and to give their maximum assistance to every effort to expand its economy and assimilate more and more people who will come from overseas to link their fate with our destiny. BecauseI believe these things, I regard the portfolio of immigration as being as important to the defence of our nation as is any service portfolio. In this spirit, I shall continue to address myself with all the energy and enthusiasm 1 possess to the discharge of my ministerial responsibilities. I ask for, and expect from, all Australians of goodwill the same understanding and appreciation of the problem of building up our national strength as was so generously given by them to the governments of the war years in their great task of ensuring the maintenance of our Australian way of life and our very national existence.

77,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"this morning, if the debate were adjourned now, I would be prevented from referring to the subject-matter and the basic principles of this measure during the budget debate. I have given specific consideration to the very elements that are contained in this bill, and I propose to offer some criticism of it, if only for the purpose of drawing the attention of home builders, borrowers and the public generally to what I consider to be the financial principles which should be adopted by this Government. Under the original legislation governing the housing agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, authority was given to the Government td raise by way of loan and the issue of treasury-bills a maximum amount of Â£15,000,000 for the building of houses. The purpose of the measure is to authorize the raising of money to be made available to the States for housing. The Government now seeks to increase the amount that can be raised by way of loans or treasury-bills by Â£10,000,000. We are told that of the Â£15.000.000 granted approximately twelve months ago, Â£6,795,000 had been advanced to the States at the 30th June last, leaving a balance of Â£S,205,000 available towards the current year's expenditure. in August last the Loan Council approved a works programme which included Â£12,565,000 for rental housing under the housing agreement; and that the provision of Â£10,000,000 which is now sought will cover expenditure to the end of the -current financial year, and, in addition, enable the building programme to continue in the early months of 1947-48. It appears from the Treasurer's statement of consolidated revenue for October Inst, the latest figures available, that the it is the Government's policy to borrow sum of Â£4,260,000, made available to the 'States for housing, may have been raised by the issue of treasury-bills. I do not know; the position is obscure. Loans for housing to the States are shown at Â£4,260,000, and it may be purely a coincidence that there is also shown a -treasury-bill raising for works of exactly -that amount. The specific point I make is that treasury-bills carry interest at the rate of 1 per cent., and according to the statement just made by the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) a Mr Fadden. substantial proportion of tbe finance required for housing will be raised by the issue of treasury-bills. Is the Commonwealth raising money by the issue of treasury-bills, which carry interest at the rate of 1 per cent., and loaning that money to the States at a rate of interestthat, according to a reply given to a question I asked on the subject, has not yet been determined with resnect to treasurybill raisings, but in respect of loan raisings is 3^ per cent -the rate which the Commonwealth pays in respect of its loan moneys? The Government of Queensland is loaning money to home builders, and in respect of such loans has reduced the rate of interest from 4 per cent, to 3$ per cent. WhatI want to know is this: Is the Commonwealth borrowing money at 1 per cent, and lending that money to the State governments for housing at a rate of interest not yet determined, but, at the same time, is allowing the State governments to lend that money to borne builders at a rate of 33 per cent.? That point must be clarified, because it is obvious that tlie cost of building homes must be kept to a minimum. If the Government can raise money at 1 per cent., it cannot justify on any ground whatever a. system under which home seekers are obliged to pay We are also told that interest at a rate of 34 per cent. Costs of building materials of all kinds are sky high. As a matter of fact, the whole subject, of tbe cost of building homes calls for thorough investigation. A discrepancy is apparent which is out of all proportion even t.o the increased cost of materials during the last few years; and this discrepancy should be fully investigated. Interest is a substantial element in the costs which home builders are obliged to meet. I want to know whether money by way of treasury-bills at a rate of interest of 1 per cent., and allow the States to relend that money at a rate of 3f per cent., on which basis, of course, the States will make a handsome profit? it is impossible to follow the tortuous reasoning of the right honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) who is reputed to be an outstanding expert on finance. In bis remarks on this subject, which is highly technical but not",29,Second Reading
78,Mr Burke (Perth) [12.10],"I findvery difficult, he has displayed an amazing lack of knowledge of elementary facts which are available to any one who wishes to study the subject. I shall not pursue that aspect further. There are a number of other aspects. The first is the present grievous shortage of housing, whioh we inherit as a legacy from past administrations. accentuated during the war when we were unable to build houses. It is not sufficient for the Government to point only to those facts. It must make every effort to build more homes; and I am confident the new Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) will overcome all remaining obstacles and speed up the construction of homes. The present shortage of houses is not due to lack of purchasing power in the community. Indeed, as the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) pointed out last night, the demand for houses has become most accentuated during the last few years as the result of the transfer of greater purchasing power to those sections of the community which were less favoured in that respect under past governments. The problem of housing is of the first magnitude. I am confident that the Government w ill soon remove all obstacles that stand in the way of speeding up home building, and that it w ill not be content to rest upon any laurels which itmay have earned up t.o date. Already, steps have been taken bo cheapen the cost of building homes by substantially reducing interest rates, an announcement to this effect having been made by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) within the last few days. The provision of loans at reasonable rates of interest will reduce building costs. However, as the result of talks I havc had w it h the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Sheehy) and other honourable members who have an expert knowledge of the subject, I am convinced that the major element in the present high cost of housing arises from the shortage of building materials. Obviously, contractors must budget for possible delays at every stage of construction, and every possible cost must be included in their estimates or tenders. member for Boothby( Mr Sheehy) laid his finger upon the real problem. That may offer the greatest opportunity to reduce costs. Factors which make it vital that building costs shall be reduced are: first, the costs are too great for the average wage-earner to meet; secondly, interest payable upon this inflated value must remain a constant burden upon the earnings of the worker; and thirdly, as conditions return to normal, competition The shortage was alone w ill depress to-day's inflated values. The person who purchases a new house at the present time stands to lose a considerable part of his equity in it during the next few years. For those reasons, I urge the Government to carry on with its vigorous programme to overtake the housing shortage and make, as I know it intends to do, an all-out attack upon tbe deplorable slums and sub-standard tenements that exist in all our major cities. adjourned.

I shall be a member of the House of Representatives for a long while to worry him. Indeed, he and some of his friends have every reason to feel profound concern about another face in this chamber which is very close to him. By saying those words, I have probably invited interjections from honourable members opposite during the remainder of my speech. However, that prospect does not disturb me. In my opinion, the Labour Government may be described as ""something in a woollen overcoat with the word "" Labour"" printed on the back "". Perhaps the principal plank of the platform of the Labour party is the attainment of a high standard of living for the people. But this Government's policy does not seek that objective. In order to improve the standard of living, we must have the maximum production of goods. Without that, we cannot get proper distribution; and without distribution, the people will not enjoy a high standard of living. To support my contention, I quote the words of Mr F. P. Walsh, a stalwart of the Labour movement in New ZealandI t is Labour's responsibility to work for tlie maximumproduction of goods and services, was nothing more or less than excessive and anything which stands in tlie way is contrary to the best interests of Labour. Therefore, I agree with the remark by the honourable member for Reid( Mr ceded by the Government only paid back Lang) on the Address-in-Reply, that the present Government is insincere. Other honourable members have already referred Mr Hamilton. to the widespread industrial unrest, and I do not intend to add any comment, other than that while any government, regardless of its political beliefs, condones industrial stoppages, it is not acting in tbe best interests of the people. Whenever a stoppage occurs, not only wages but also goods are lost. That encourages black markets, and reduces the standard of living, and such conditions cannot be restored to normal in a short time. Honourable members who represent constituencies in the eastern States could profit from what is now happening in Western Australia. The President of the Arbitration Courtis seriously considering the I am not in application -of the strong arm of the law by imposing fines on those persons who are wantonly causing chaos in industry. If we are to obtain maximum production of goods and services, which.is supposed to be the aim of the Labour party, the people must be anxious and willing to work. We must also endeavour to encourage business people to expand their enterprises and increase their efficiency.. Is the Government doing that to-day? I say that it is not. In fact, its attitude is diametrically opposed to any such scheme. It is most alarming to meet in the streets people who say, "" I am having a holiday to-day. I am not going to work because the greater portion of the reward for my efforts is going to ' Chif' "". This attitude is most exasperating to men who returned to this country after five or six years' service in the armed forces, and particularly to prisoners of war returning from Malaya and other Japaneseoccupied countries. This state of affairs still exists, and so long as the Government permits it to exist, incalculable harm will be done to the people of Australia. What is the cause of absenteeism to-day? Last year absenteeism on the New .South Wales coal-fields cost this country 1,300,000 tons of coal. That is quite apart from the huge loss caused by stoppages. The cause of the absenteeism taxes, and absenteeism to-day in almost every industry is clue to tbe same cause. The last reduction of income tax conto taxpayers the amount that the Government had received in excess of its expected revenue from this source. This budget provides for a reduction of indirect taxes, and whilst I agree that these taxes should be reduced, I ask the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) how these concessions can possibly result in the production of more goods. There is only one way to increase production, and that is to induce people to work harder, and to encourage business organizations to extend their undertakings. This country experienced six years of war, but in all that time, it was not hurt materially one iota. Because of its geographical position and its importance in the South-West Pacific theatre of war, Australia was called upon to increase its industrialization, with the ,1,'esult that our development during the war years was as great as it would have been in 30 years of peace. To-day, however, production is stagnant. We cannot get coal, power, timber, nails, screws, giass, cement Queensland is getting those. The shortage of the materials that I have mentioned means that homes cannot be built. There is also a scarcity of food and clothing. When the people of this country realize that food producers are ploughing their products back into the ground, they will wake up. Eruit is being allowed to fall to the ground. In my electorate alone, dozens of orchardists have allowed fruit crops to rot, and this year, thousands of cases of fruit will meet a similar fate; yet it is difficult for the people of this country to buy fruit. One orchardist alone, living within 30 miles of Perth, allowed 2,000 cases of oranges to rot because he knew that if he harvested them, the return for his work, after purchasing cases and paying transport costs, would not have been more than one week's wages. The budget gives no indication of early reductions of direct taxes. I suggest to the Prime Minister and to the Government, that the only way to get the people of this country to work contentedly is to reduce the direct income tax. They do not regard indirect taxes as a burden. In fact, many of them do not know what indirect taxes are levied. They become dissatisfied only when their purses are R0] ' i touched directly. I wonder whether the Prime Minister has been studying recent happenings in Western Australia. Over there we have a racehorse named "" Taxation"". Up to date this horse has not returned any profits to its backers. It has only given them headaches like those caused by direct taxes. Like the taxpayers of this country the followers of that horse are waiting for the day when it will be favourite. No doubt the Prime Minister and members of the Government will be pleased when they hear over the air the people shouting with one voice, "" Come on ' Taxation'-yo u beaut"". In regard to the housing problem, 1 only wish to suggest to the Minister for am sure he will accept the suggestion because he is a Western Australian and not one of the alleged ""wise men of the East""-that in any future home-building programmes, an adequate area of ground be allotted to each dwelling. I would suggest nothing smaller than quarter-acre blocks. There should be adequate space for children to play and for gardens. Before leaving the subject of taxation, I should like to say something about the reduction of Id. a gallon in the price of petrol. When the Federal Aid Beads Agreement came into operation, the object was that main roads boards and local governing authorities should be given financial assistance for the maintenance of existing roads and the construction of new ones. Last year, the Government collected Â£10,000,000 by means of the petrol tax, but gave to the States only Â£3,000,000 for the construction and maintenance of roads. To-day, particularly in Western Australia, and, I believe, also in New South Wales, local-governing bodies are finding difficulty in keeping existing roads in a reasonable state of repair. I urge the Government to allocate a larger proportion of its revenue from the petrol tax direct to local governing authorities, so that they may provide the roads that are necessary if producers are to be enabled to reduce their costs of production. Being a primary-producing country, we cannot make any real progress until the financial position of our primary producers is sound. I favour the creation of",31,Chieley

These authorities should not be of the kind constituted by the former Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. Growers' representatives should be elected by the growers themselves, and should be responsible to the growers for their actions. Such boards should .advise the Government on costs of production, marketing, appraisement, and the financial assistance required by various industries. They should also consider such important matters as the stabilization of primary industries through international agreements, compulsory pools, and any other methods that may be desirable. Primary producers, particularly those engaged in export industries, do not desire to go back to the pre-war system of disposing of primary products. In fact, I am afraid that a reversion to pre-war methods would mean open revolt. able members opposite. would put these industries. interjection by the honourable member for House with the assistance of the Australian Country party, because it leads me to speak of the effect of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act. That is the most insincere piece of legislation ever passed through this Parliament. member is the most insincere representative of the wheat-farmers in this chamber. able member's type. In 1937, Labour party candidates at the elections promised the wheat-growers that, if they were returned to power, they would immediately introduce legislation to give effect to stabilization plans that the growers had been advocating ever since the commencement of the depression. They made that promise in the knowledge that the wheat growers were willing to accept stabilization only on the basis of the cost of production, plus a margin of profit. tralian Country party do for the wheat growers when it had the power to help them? Â£30,000,000 to the wheat-growers during the depression, but.the Labour party did not give them even a penny during the four years in which it was in power. It robbed them. Anti-Labour governments had many problems to solve, and when we asked for a stabilization scheme, we were told that the cost to the nation would be too great. However, when a Labour government had the opportunity to implement a plan which would not have cost the country a penny, it failed to do so. It robbed the wheat-growers. ments would not help the wheat-growers. wheat when the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) was Prime Minister, and I sent the right honourable gentleman a "" collect"" telegram asking for help.

A Labour government introduced legislation for wheat industry stabilization, providing for a guaranteed minimum I welcome that price of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. at ports, and to use the words of the Minister for Works and ' Housing, it was a case of "" take it or leave it "" . At the moment, I am not concerned with the other provisions of the act. That was the basis of the legislation, and anything founded on a weak basis will topple. The scheme is toppling now. I charge the Labour party with having deliberately introduced the legislation in the knowledge that the Legislative Councils of the States would reject I know the honorthe complementary legislation which must be passed by the State parliaments before the scheme can come into operation. The Government said that vested interests "" squealed"" when they introduced this legislation, but the Government threw the wheat-growers to the wolves. Honourable members interjecting, Order!

95,Mr James,"He is very provocative.he is a new member. Chifley Government knew that the scheme would be overthrown by the State parliaments. That is why it included the marketing question in the 1946 referendum proposals. It knew that this would cause the people to reject the proposals. Tbe next objection to the stabilization legislation is that it fixes a period of five years for the operation o.f the scheme. Will any supporter of the Government say that five years is long enough for the plan to be thoroughly tested? Another nasty provision is that, should any wheat grower stop producing wheat as tbe result of unforeseen circumstances during the period of operation of the scheme, he would not be permitted to withdraw from the stabilization fund any money that he had contributed to it. His only hope would be that he might be allowed to share in the distribution of the fund should the scheme be terminated at the end of five years. That would be a very faint hope. When one realizes that a man who grows a miserable crop of 3,000 bushels a year will be obliged to contribute an amount of Â£150, or Â£3 a week, as a contribution to the fund vernment does not know what it is. After compulsorily acquiring the 1945-46 wheat crop under national security regulations, the Government had the audacity to include it in the stabilization scheme. I dare any member of the Government to go to any group of trade unionists, whether they be coal-miners, waterside workers or timber workers, and say to them: "" Listen, comrades, we will stabilize your wages for the next four years, but in order that we may do so you must give us three-tenths of your earnings for this year "". That is what the Government did to the wheat-growers. In order to stabilize the industry for four years, it took the 1945-46 crop away from them. I have heard a lot about concessional prices. We oppose the fixing of concessional prices for wheat. If the Government wants to give concessions to men struggling in a small way, such as poultry-raisers, why did it take Â£500,000 away from such men? It should be consistent. It is supposed to represent I repeat that the unionism. I remind it that in Australia there are farmers' unions and a A there are farmers' unions and primary producers' associations. There are similar organizations in New Zealand. The former Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr .Scully) was asked whether the Commonwealth Government had made any arrangements with the Government of New Zealand about wheat sales, as announced by Mr Sullivan, a member of the New Zealand Government. The Commonwealth Minister said one thing; the New Zealand Minister said something else. Both could not be right, nor could both be wrong. I am prepared to believe the statement of my fellow unionist in the New Zealand Farmers Union, who saidI t would appear to uie that your Labour Government has assisted our Labour Government to the detriment of the producers. In other words, one union was pitted against another in order to defeat the farmers of New Zealand, who were holding out against their Government for an increased price of 7s. Id. a bushel for their wheat. I say that an arrangement was made between the Commonwealth and New Zealand. The Government says that it is anxious to protect the interests of the wheat-growers. AlthoughI have been rather caustic in my criticism of the Government during the last few months, I also hope to be constructive. I tell the Government now that, if it introduces legislation for a stabilization plan based on the cost of production, plus a margin of profit, it will have 100 per cent, support from the wheat-growers of Australia. While wheat can be sold at the prevailing high price, such a scheme would not cost the taxpayers of the country one penny. I beg the Government to introduce the legislation while it has the chance to do so. The farmers are determined to have such a scheme. They want it to be introduced now while prices are good, so that they may establish a reserve fund and not be obliged to come to the people, cap in hand, should prices fall again as they did in 1929-30. Here is a golden opportunity for the Government to act. We heard something about a "" golden era "" during the budget speech. Sitting suspended from. 12.45 to 2.15 p.m.",34,Chieley

In common with 60,000 other wheat-growers, I am very much in favour of the stabilization of the wheat industry. But we want a scheme based on these factors: Cost of production, plus a margin of profit, for a period of ten years so that tbe scheme may be well tried out-to my way of thinking, ten years is the shortest period in which such a scheme can be balanced; the exclusion of any crops which may have been acquired compulsorily under National operation of which, I understand, may be extended in relation to wheat; the right of equity of the farmers in the stabilization fund to be established, and no concessional prices. We have no objection to the Government supporting smaller industries if it wishes to do so, but we do object to one section of the community being called upon to bear tbe cost of keeping other industries in a flourishing condition. I shall now touch on rehabilitation. As honourable members are aware, the rehabilitation of the ex-service man and woman is governed by tbe Re-establishment and Employment Act. One of the main reasons for .alarm among ex-service personnel is that when they want to re-establish themselves in businesses, although the act says that they may apply to the prescribed authority, which in this instance is the Repatriation Commission, for a loan, they have to wait for a considerable time before receiving any response to their applications. nately, the act contains a section which says that an applicant is not an eligible person unless he or she was engaged in an occupation of a similar type prior to enlistment. That sort of thing is a definite bar to progress in this country. There are only two other categories of persons who might obtain loans; they are those who are suffering from disablement and those who enlisted when they were"" under the age of 21 years. Persons in those two categories are entitled to the best treatment that we can give to them. But we have to bear in mind that thousands of Sfr. Hamilton. I suggest to the young people who enlisted at about the age of 21 or 22 years, perhaps had not at that time found their feet industrially. Having witnessed the application of modern ideas, why should they be debarred from receiving assistance under the Re-establishment and Employment Act, and being enabled to give to the people of Australia the benefit of their ideas? The case of a man who had had consider able, experience has been published in the West Australian, Perth. Reciting his experiences, he saysI joined the 10th Light Horse at the beginning of the war and transferred to the Australian Imperial Force in 1941, enlisting as Security Regulations-the a private, and was discharged with the rank of captain. I am one of the few survivors of the original members of tlie Inter-Allied Services Bureau which later became known as "" Z "" Special Unit and Services Reconnaissance Department. I spent many months in Japanese-occupied territory. I organized and ran in supplies both by sea and air to Dyak guerillas in Borneo. In 1942 I took part in operations in the Netherlands East Indies. In 1943 and 1944 I was in New Guinea and spent many months in the Sepik River area, and in 1945 I saw service again in the Netherlands East Indies and also in Borneo (Sarawak) and Malaya. I organized and established at Garden Island a midget submarine base and was responsible for the supply and despatch of the ill-fated Rimau expedition which set out from Garden Island to raid Singapore harbour. Later, on the instruction of General Sir Miles Dempsey, G.O.C. Malaya, and with the full authority of Lord Louis Mountbatten, I led an expedition to the Riouw Archipelago in search of the party and returned with the first authentic account of the fate of the Singapore raiders.

I say to the Government and the people of this country that when that man enlisted at the beginning of the war he did not have to prove to the defence authorities that he had had experience in murder or sabotage. That is the reception which this man has had from a supposedly generous Government since his return to this country. The Ministry of Post-war Reconstruction issues trash of this sortJ i ll was a country g i r l . Her father kept a general store in a small country town, and, as her mother was dead, she kept house for him and helped in the store. When war broke out her father wanted to enlist immediately, but he couldn't leave J ill by herself. WhenJ ill was eighteen WA.A.A.F. and her father joined the army. Unhappily, he was killed in the New Guinea campaign. In February of this year J ill was discharged. She wanted to go back to the country town where she had friends, but there was no job there for her. J ill found the solution to her problem after an interview with a rehabilitation officer, who suggested she should apply for full-time training in dressmaking, as she would be eligible under the "" under 21 "" category. Unfortunately, when Jill approaches the Repatriation Commission to borrow money with a view to establishing her own business in her home town, her application will be rejected because she had not been a dressmaker prior to her enlistment. I cite these cases with a view to showing what is in the minds of ex-service personnel, and having the conditions altered. Admittedly, the provisions of the Re-establishment and Employment Act, as Government members have often said, are better than those which operated after World WarI . I can speak from experience, having participated in both wars. Why sbould they not be better? We have had 25 years in which to effect improvements. It would be absolutely disgraceful to offer to the man or woman who had fought for this country anything like the conditions that were provided for under the old repatriation scheme. On the subject of loans, 1 wish to say that before I returned to Australia. I distributed some of the propaganda put out by this country, such as ""Jobs for a l l "" ; ""farms for a l l "" ; and ""Â£1,000 to go on the land"". My first comment is that Â£1,000 is far too little for any man who intends to engage in wheat and sheep farming. Until the last campaign started a couple of months ago, the son of a* farmer who, by reason of his youth, could not fulfil the obligations that were necessary to place him in the stipulated category, was unable to obtain any advance. On the 20th August, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) issued the statement that anybody who had had six months' service and any experience at all on the land, was eligible to apply for the advance. That does not alter the position one iota, because prior to that statement everybody was eligible to apply. Ex-servicemen desirous of training she enlisted in the under the Re-establishment and Employment Act have to make application for it, but those administering the act are given a certain instruction by the present Government. Here it is: "" Training under this scheme is not to be considered a reward for services "". I , on behalf of ex-service personnel, tell the people of Australia that we do not want any reward from anybody for our services. What we want, and are going to fight for, is the right to get back into civil life as quickly and as satisfactorily as possible. After filling in a form, applicants for training are confronted by the absorptive capacity clause. The capacity of an industry to absorb them is determined by a trade union representative on an Industrial Advisory Committee. I say nothing about preference to-, ex-servicemen. I think there sbould be preference only when the general qualifications of the applicants are equal. If the trade union representative should be unsympathetic towards the ex-serviceman, there is little opportunity to surmount the hurdle which the absorptive capacity clause presents. We have beard a good deal about bringing tradesmen to Australia from Great Britain to work in the building trade. In Western Australia, there are 2,000 applications from returned men who desire to learn the building trade, but they cannot receive training or even get an intimation when they will be trained, despite the fact that they have been accepted as eligible and declared suitable. This hold-up is due to the operation of the absorptive capacity clause, but I contend that absorptive capacity cannot be measured accurately. One of the reasons advanced why the training is not being given is the shortage of building materials. I hate to think what will be the position if that shortage has not been avocation. overcome before tbe expiration of the period of four years which will be occupied in the training of these men. When we have plenty of tradesmen, there is competition and we get good work. These men should be trained, for they would then have in their pocket a piece of paper worth more than its weight in gold. Many of the men would have been much better off had they not gone to the war, but had stayed home and contested the 1943 elections. I ask the Minister for Post-war Reconances are not salaries or wages within the struction to call for the production definition in the act, that there is no of the papers relating to applicapower to compel deductions, and that, tions by ex-servicemen for training if thetrainees protest against them, an for the watchmaking trade by Dunkamendment of the law should he sought lings Proprietary Limited in Western to authorize them.

The death of Mr Curtin left a void in our public life, but it has been the fortunate experience of British communities that they have always been able to find a worthy successor to a great leader. At this stage, I wish to pay tribute to Mr ""Ben"" Chifley, our present Prime Minister, upon whom the mantle of John Curtin fell, and who finished the job which Mr Curtin so well began. Now that the war is over, it becomes the duty of tbe Government to stabilize the economy of the country, a task almost as difficult as that of winning tJhe war. Just as I supported Mr Curtin during the difficult days of the war, I now wholeheartedly support the present Prime Minister in these difficult days of peace. The present Leader of the Opposition and the present leader of the Australian Country party demonstrated their inability to govern, and were repudiated by the Parliament. elections of 1943, the peopleemphatically endorsed the action of the Parliament. In tbe following elections, on the 28 th September, was one of the first Labour supporters to be elected, although I was opposed by the capitalist press and by powerful financial institutions. ever, behind me there was a great army of supporters which could not be defeated. Instead of bein? defeated, I won by an absolute majority of 1835, a marked improvement over tbe elections of 1943, when I required 425 votes for an absolutemajority. My victory in Hume was one of the most outstanding achieved in any part of New South Wales. The Australian Country party could not have put a stronger candidate .into the -field. If ever a -man worked in order to bring victory to his party, Mr but also to assist in maintaining peace Warren McDonald did. I was also opposed by a Liberal candidate. The press which supported the Opposition candidates endeavoured to introduce personalities, but I refused to descend to their level. I won a victory for the Labour party, in spite of everything that my opponents could do, and in spite of their being backed by the capitalist press and capitalist institutions. Mr Fuller. Most of us here have seen the country pass through two of the worse wars in the history of the world. We were told that the first world war was a ""war to end war that we were fighting for a new order, a new world in which every one would enjoy the measure of happiness and economic security to which he was entitled. But before many years had passed that dream was shattered. Thousands of people were thrown out of employment, and Australia had the greatest army of unemployed that it had ever known. At one stage 550,000 men were fighting a war, not in blood and Jiud against an enemy, but a war for existence. No one can deny that. At that time the primary producers of Australia could not secure for their produce sufficient to meet the cost of production, and the people generally suffered untold misery. Eventually, the world was thrown into a second World War more terrible and devastating than any that At the general had preceded it. Fortunately, the democratic nations triumphed over those which, bad they succeeded, would have abolished all the freedoms that are so dear last, I to us. That is history, but it is still vivid in our memories. To-day, due largely to their sufferings during two wars and a depression, two major matters Howare exercising the minds of the people. They want to know, first, what can be done to prevent future wars, and, secondly, how to ensure economic security so that future wars may be prevented. In the Speech delivered by His Royal Highness at the opening of the Eighteenth Parliament the Government's victories attitude towards these problems was set out. A perusal of that brief statement gives a good idea of the splendid basis that has been laid by the Government not only to provide for the safety of Australia throughout the world. I turn now from wars and defence to point out that our main concern must be to improve the social and economic conditions of the people. I have every confidence that, so long as Labour remains in power in the Commonwealth, Australia will not return to the awful conditions that prevailed between 1932 and 1939. Already the Government has piloted through the Parliament legislation designed to achieve some of the objectives to which I have referred, and as a consequence all sections of the community have benefited. For the first time in the history of Australia, primary production has been placed on a sound economic basis and primary producers are receiving a fair return for their labour, ber should tell that to the wheat-farmers. House an electorate consisting largely of farmers. would not give to the Commonwealth Government power to deal with the organized marketing of primary products, and so that problem remains. In this connection, it is to the everlasting disgrace of the Australian Country party that during the election campaign, when outside pressure from speculators and financial and commercial interests was brought to bear on them, its members twisted, and opposed proposals for which they voted in this Parliament. Naturally, thousands of farmers are disappointed at the result of the referendum. There was a time when the Leader of the Opposition advocated the granting of increased powers to the Commonwealth, but even he could find no virtue in the Government's proposals because the pressure from outside sources was too strong. Like many others, the right honourable gentleman had to bow to the will of his masters. As late as 1942 he saidI do believe that full nationhood requires greater powers at the centre, for greater responsibility cannot be discharged without them. According to the Sydney Morning Herald of the 10th October, 1939, the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), who is Deputy Leader of the Opposition, went so far as to advocate the abolition of all State parliaments, but, like his leader, he could not agree to the granting to the Commonwealth Parliament, of which he himself is a member, the additional powers sought. Evidently, the honourable member has little faith in his ability to legislate in matters of a national character. The sudden concern of members of the Australian Country party for the welfare of the man on the land is rather amusing when one reflects that for years, when governments supported by them were in power, they did nothing to assist primary producers or to place primary industries on a sound economic basis. During the last twelve months we have heard from Opposition members a good deal concerning the need for increased production. Listening to their speeches one might be led to believe thatAustralian industries are not forging ahead. That contention is not borne out by the facts. Referring to this matter, a bulletin published on the 11th November, last, by the National Bank of AusUnfortunately, the people tralia contained the following:Although the alarums and excursions of industrial labour have occupied the centre of the stage during the past month, neither they nor the large demand which remains unsatisfied should be allowed to obscure tlie fact that in many instances the trend of output is upward. The article went on to point out that the production of bricks, tiles and cement was increasing, and that larger supplies of timber were being won from the forests. After pointing out the difficulties of securing certain commodities, it continuedNevertheless, industry is slowly making headway in meeting the accumulated needs of the Australian public. That hundreds of new factories have commenced operation shows not only that investors have faith in the Government, but it also indicates the progressive policy of the Government towards secondary production. The improved position is reflected in the number of persons employed in factories to-day compared with June, 1939, the respective figures being 770,000 and 230,000. Admittedly, there is a shortage of goods throughout Australia, but that state of affairs is prevalent throughout the world and has been brought about, first, because during the war period the production of civil goods was curtailed and people could not then secure requirements, and, secondly, because people to-day are better off than they have ever been before. To-day, there is practically full employment in Australia, something unheard of in the past. Every provision has been made not only to rehabilitate our ex-service men and women but also to ensure that our youths will have an",39,Chieley

I am informed These men. say that portions of the area are more suitable for the growing of fruit than is the district of Batlow. At present one timber mill, owned by Wallace McGee and Company Limited, operates from the Tumut end of the existing road. I understand that the output from that mill is at present taken to the railhead at Tumut, thence to Dubbo, where it is seasoned, and then despatched to Broken Hill, where, I believe, it has stood the test of the severe climatic conditions existing in that area. I remind honourable members that those who sat in Opposition in this Parliament twenty years ago advocated that an advance of Â£200,000 be made for the construction of this road. It must be constructed. In the area which it will serve it will provide employment for 1,000 Australians; and it will open up one of the most suitable areas for closer settlement as well as some of the best scenic country in the Commonwealth. It will also encourage the production of eucalyptus oil, and develop bee-farming on a large scale. From such industries substantial benefit will accrue to the Treasury. Therefore, I appeal to the Government immediately to summon a conference of State and Federal Ministers to investigate this project thoroughly. In conclusion, I congratulate the Prime Minister and Treasurer on the budget. It is a better budget even than that which was forecast during the election campaign and induced the people to return the Government to office. The Government has tackled its financial problems in an effective manner. The burden of indirect taxes weighed heavily upon the community as a. whole, and I am proud that the Government has made such substantial reductions of indirect taxes in order to give relief to those sections of the community most deserving of relief. Progress reported. That the House do now adjourn. Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of tbe Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [3.7] -This morning the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) asked me a question relating to the establishment of a guided projectiles range in Central Australia. I shall now make the statement which I then promised I would make on the subject. Owing to the lengthy period necessarily occupied in the consultations between the United Kingdom and Australian Governments on the proposal for a guided missile range in Australia, and the fact that the Government has only recently been able to make a. decision on. this matter it has been impossible for an authoritative statement to be made earlier on this project. In the meantime, there have been reports and criticisms of a speculative and to some degree uninformed nature. I now propose to make a brief statement in order that honourable members and the people of Australia may be acquainted with the fullest information that can be given regarding this project at the present stage, because it is one of such vital importance to the security of the whole of the British Commonwealth. As recently announced by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), the Government has approved the proposal to set up in Australia, as a joint venture with the United Kingdom Government a range and other facilities for the testing of guided missiles. The firing point will be in the vicinity of Mount Eba in South Australia, between the Trans-Australian and North-south railways. The direction of the centre line of the range is such that, if prolonged, it would pass roughly midway between Broome and Port Hedland in Western Australia, that is in the middle of the Ninety Mile Beach. The first step is to build a short range of about 300 miles designed to be capable of extension at a later date, and to reserve the necessary area. The Government has also approved the reservation of the Salisbury munitions factory for use, to the extent required, for the developmental work to be undertaken in Australia. The Government has further approved the proposal made by the Government of the United Kingdom that Lieutenant-General Evetts, in a civilian capacity, should come from the United Kingdom to Australia, with a small technical staff, to",41,Chieley

119,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister forcollaborate with tbe. Australian authorities concerned in the detailed planning and execution of the project. It would probably assist honourable meuibers if , at this stage, I briefly recapitulated the history of this project. Because of the limited area in the United Kingdom and its density of population, tbe authorities there have long realized that it will be impossible to carry out in the British Isles the full-scale testing of guided missiles. After investigation, it appeared that Australia was the only place within the British Commonwealth, taking into account climatic and other conditions, where an area suitable for a range of this sort could be found. The Government of the United Kingdom, with the consent of this Government, earlier this year sent a mission to ascertain whether suitable facilities existed in Australia. To collaborate with this mission an Australian committee was appointed, consisting of representatives of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, the Department of Munitions and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. The report of the mission to the United Kingdom Government was the result of its investigations in collaboration with Australian committee. In the investigations undertaken by the committee and mission there was full collaboration also with the Governments of the States of South Australia and Western Australia. The Australian committee, in its report, endorsed the technical aspects of the conclusions reached by the United Kingdom Mission. Apart from checking up on certain aspects, such as availability of water, it was inappropriate for us to take further detailed action pending the receipt of formal proposals from the Government of the United Kingdom who, it will be recalled, initiated the project. Now that the project has been approved, consultations between the two Governments on its implementation will proceed. Research and development on guided missiles has been under way for some time in the United Kingdom, whilst, so far, Australia has done no work in this field. For some considerable time, by far the greater portion of the scientific staff required for the trials or research and Mr Dedman. development associated with them must be drawn from the United Kingdom, who have already considerable experience of the work involved. Discussions are taking place with the Government of the United Kingdom in regard to questions of major policy, the machinery required for the control of the project, and the basis on which it is to be financed. The capital cost of the immediate project of the range head and the first 300 miles of the range is Â£3,000,000 and the eventual annual maintenance cost of the range project is Â£3,000,000. If the development work is expanded, considerable additional capital and maintenance expenditure will be involved. Except for a few pastoral leases at the firing point end in South Australia, the central aboriginal reserves and a few more pastoral leases adjacent to the Ninety Mile Beach in Western Australia, the area of the range and that which it is proposed to reserve for eventual extension, is largely uninhabited. It will be necessary to resume some leases by arrangement with the State authorities in South Australia and possibly later in Western Australia. this I mentioned earlier that the range at first will be limited-^-and this will be for some years-to a point short of the central Australian aboriginal reserves. During this period, it is expected that accuracy of control will be largely perfected, and that the risk to tbe aborigines, when the range is extended, will be negligible. The probability of a missile falling on them would be extremely remote. The area is vast, and the average density of population is probably about only one native in every 50 to 100 square miles. It is suggested to me by those most competent to judge, that the accident risk to the aborigine will be less than that taken by the ordinary citizen of one of our cities in crossing a city thoroughfare or from the danger of an aircraft falling from the skies, Reports that huge areas in central Australia will be blasted by explosives are highly-colouredfigmentsof the imagination. For various reasons, one being the costly nature of these projectiles, it is expected that they will be fired on the average not more than about one a week, and when it comes to long range work, probably even less frequently. Until the control is perfected, none but non-explosive missiles will be fired. And, if and when explosive missiles are fired, they will be directed to a safe area. However, in regard to the limited number of observation posts which may later have to be established along the line of fire in the reserve, I am very conscious of the need to do everything possible to safeguard tbe aborigines from contact, or encroachment on any area of special significance to them, and instructions have been given that the Australian committee, to which I have referred, shall consult with the Director of Native Affairs and other authorities concerned in aborigine welfare and report on the measures necessary to ensure their safety and welfare. In the Governor General's Speech, it was stated that Australia will make a larger contribution towards the defence of the British Commonwealth, and that the Government had agreed to set up machinery to ensure Empire co-operation in research, design, development and production of munitions and aircraft. This project is a step in that direction. It will not only increase the capacity of Australia to defend itself with the latest weapons-that is important in view of our small man-power and large territorybut also strengthen, the security of the British Commonwealth by providing for the dispersal of its resources. Defence Science Conference, held in London, fully considered and endorsed this proposal, which is so vital to our defence and security. Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [3.16]. -On e important matter has been overlooked in this proposal to conduct tests with guided projectiles in central Australia. I have received a letter from an old member of the Australian Labour party, who asks me to direct attention to this omission. My correspondent writesAs the Labour party differs from certain other political parties in the emphasis placed on human values, should not the Australian Labour party make itself the jealous guardian of the human rights of those who, in such a crisis as .this may pTOve to be, have no possible means of defending those rights? Also, I remind -honourable members that, under the terms of the Atlantic Charter, certain common principles are enunciated in the national policies of the United States of America and Great Britain. Article8 of the Atlantic Charter states that the governments of those two countries believe thatAll of the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons, must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten aggression outside their frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments. The establishment of the range for guided projectiles will certainly violate the spirit of that article of the Atlantic Charter. As arrangements for the preparation of the range appear to have progressed to a stage where little can be done to halt them, I can only protest, and hope that more protests will be registered by the Australian people against the proposal. Question resolved in the affirmative. The following papers were presented :Air Force Act-Regulations-Statutory Rules 1946, Nos. 162, 163.

120,Mr Dedman,"On the 7th November,Hutchinson) asked for information showing (a) the total staff engaged in administering and policing petrol rationing and (&) the annual amount of salary or wages involved. The Minister for Supply and Shipping has supplied the following information:(a) The total staff engaged for petrol rationing is 419 persons comprising 384 -employed f u l l time and 35 State officers -employed part time. (6) The current monthly salary and wages bill is Â£7,400, equivalent to a rate of Â£88.872 ;per annum. notice1, What was the amount of tax collected -between the 30th June,-1040, and the 31st -October, 1046, in respect of the Â£42,403,804 of tax assessed and debited in the ledger .accounts of the Taxation Department at the 30th June, 1946, but unpaid at that date? 2. How much of the arrears of tax iiiiasscssed at the 30th June, 1940, which the Treasurer stated on the 16th July, 1940, could possibly be Â£50,000,000 had been collected up to the 31st October, 1940. -of the collections of income tax revenue which would enable the information required by the right honourable member to be supplied. However, it is safe to assume that all but a small proportion -of the tax assessed and outstanding at the 30th June, 1946, would be collected before the 31st October. It is equally safe to assume that .a much smaller proportion of the tax assessed since the 30th -June, 1946, would be collected by the 31st October, because the time allowed for payment of tax (normally sixty days) would not by that date have expired in respect of assessments issued during the months of September and October.

126,Mr Holloway,"Statistic s for thisthe honourable member for Wilmot( Mr and other climatic factors on river gauging Duthie) asked the following questions:1. Isi t a fact that a royal commission has inquired into the practicability of implementing the Bradfield irrigation scheme to divert tbe rivers of eastern Queensland westward into the rivers flowing into the Lake Eyre area for the purposes of irrigation ? 2. If so, when will the royal commission's report be made available to the House? 3. Will this report be the last word on such :i scheme, or will alternative schemes to combat the disastrous erosion of Central Australia be investigated? T'he answers to the honourable member's -questions are as follows:1 to 3. Mo royal commission has been set up to investigate, the Bradfield scheme. The proposal has. however, been the subject of investigations by a number of existing authorities including Queensland State authorities, the Rural Reconstruction Commission, an expert committee under the chairmanship of the Director of Meteorological Services, and Anally the Northern Australia Development Committee. The late Dr. Bradfield's proposals have been investigated from a hydrological and meteorological point of view, and it would appear they are not practicable. The hydrological investigations, which have been carried out by the Queensland State authorities, indicate that the figures of cost are too conservative while the estimates of water discharged at the distributing end arc much in excess of what would actually be available. A detailed examination of the meteorological aspects of the scheme was made in November, 1044, by an expert committee under the chairmanship of the Director of Meteorological Services, whose report deals with the influence of the proposed reservoirs or lakes upon the rainfall of the interior of Australia. The majority of opinion was that(Â«) no material increase in the rainfall of the regions concerned is likely to accrue from the implementation of Dr. Bradfield's scheme, and (ft) the climate of the regions concerned is unlikely to be materially affected only reasonable offer received was that of Mr either immediately or ultimately. The views of the Rural Reconstruction Commission are set out in Chapter4 of the Eighth Report, entitled, "" Water Conservation, I r r i gation and Land Drainage "". In commenting on the cost of the project, which is estimated to be of tbe extent of Â£40,000,000, the Rural Reconstruction Commission, though of opinion that inadequate information was available on which to make a satisfactory appraisal of the merits of the project, stated that such expenditure is too great to warrant entering upon such a scheme without every prospect of success. The commission goes on to say that further investigations should lie made into soils and species of crops and pasture plants suitable for irrigated farming in this particular climatic zone. Furthermore no effort should be spared to collect data on rainfall and catchment efficiency so that in due course the matter can be viewed more clearly. On the basis of the above information, the Northern Australia Development Committee considers that the use of the water on suitable lands adjacent to its origin and in the basins from which it is derived will be much more efficient and investigations to .that end are being vigorously pursued by the Queensland Government. These will include control of Hood waters and any hydro-electric possibilities which would be of use in future irrigation. asked by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) on the 20th November, concerning the disposal of motor vehicles and allied equipment at Mataranka in the Northern Territory, the Minister for Supply and Shipping has furnished the following information :When the Army declared surplus to tbe Commonwealth Disposals Commission the motor vehicle park at Mataranka, action was taken by that commission to market the best of the vehicles through the normal trade channels in Adelaide and a large number of vehicles was sold in this way. In regard to the balance, action was taken by the commission .to sell on the spot as many of the remaining vehicles as could be sold. The sale was advertised in the daily press throughout the Commonwealth. It is emphasized that these vehicles represented trucks in such a condition as did not warrant the commission itself moving them .to Adelaide. A total of Â£0,558 was realized from these individual sales at Mataranka. The commission was then faced with the problem of selling the residues and every endeavour was made to obtain bids for these residues. The Jolly of Â£3,100, and in the light of the condition of these residues, the majority of which were wrecks of trucks and of machine gun carriers, this offer was accepted. Photographs showing the condition of these wrecks are with the .departmental file and the Minister for Supply and Shipping would welcome the honourable member for Warringah or any other members inspecting these photographs which show that in the main the residues are such as did not warrant their removal from Mataranka, which it is pointed out is some 700 miles by road from Alice Springs which, in turn, is 1,000 miles by rail from Adelaide.",46,Industrial Unrest

128,Mr Dedman,"In reply to a questionThe buyer has beeu endeavouring over the las.t ten months to sell his stock and I underthe disposal of motor vehicles in the stand at the moment is actually trying to sell by public auction at Mataranka. In addition to the stock purchased by Mr The Minister for Supply and Shipping Jolly at Mataranka, he also bought large stocks of vehicles and par.ts at Darwin and elsewhere, mainly it is understood with tlie object of obtaining the .equipment necessary for reconstructing the broken down vehicles bought by him at Mataranka. Any return that Mr Jolly would .therefore ultimately receive would not be related merely to his purchases at Mataranka but would also take into consideration the expense of maintaining an organization in the Northern Territory over a period of twelve months and the extremely high cost of movement to southern markets. The spare parts and allied equipment at Mataranka have been sold by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission by auction sale for approximately Â£22,000. From the above it will be seen tlia.t the Commonwealth Disposals Commission has made every endeavour to realize the maximum amount of money from the surplus Army stocks at Mataranka and that the total amount obtained is very considerable. Finally, i.t should be emphasized that irrespective of the original cost new of any equipfinal plans for production of aluminium are ment in capital cities, the only value of worn out residue is represented by their actual value as and where they are, taking into consideration the condition and the location at the time of sale. On honourable member for Cook Sheehan) asked a question concerning the proposed release of valuable motor cars by the Department of the Army. The Minister for Supply and Shipping has supplied the following information :At present the Disposals Commission has practically no vehicles at all for sale. The commission has already sold approximately 80,000 motor vehicles, practically all, however, the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr being trucks and there is no indication of any large number of motor cars being still available from the Department of the Army. Any motor cars that are declared to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission are processed by that commission first to Government departments and second through the trade to priority buyers nominated by the Department of Transport in each State. The Department of Transport gives preferential treatment to ex-servicemen, doctors and similar urgent priority requirements. Department of Transport is in the best position to judge the needs of priority buyers, it is not proposed to disturb the existing arrangesene and other products received into Ausment. On the 20th November the honourable member for Cameron) asked a question concerning Northern Territory. has supplied the following information:The Commonwealth Disposals Commission has no knowledge of any instances where dealers bought tractors and other motor vehicles in the Northern Territory and on their being brought south had them commandeered by the Government. If the honourable member will furnish any more specific information on the matter, further inquiries will be made. the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) asked a question concerning tbe cost of production of aluminium in Australia. The Minister for Munitions has supplied the following information:As some work remains to be done before decided, it is not possible at this stage to give a reliable estimate of cost of production. The Australian Aluminium Production Commission considers, however, that production should be established on an economic basis and it the' 20th November, the is pursuing its investigations to that end. ( MrI t is known that the pre-war price of aluminium has fallen but from information received, it appears that the present world parity price is Â£A.02 per ton, North American ports and not Â£A.75 per ton as stated. Williams) asked a question concerning the quality of kerosene being sold to farmers. The Minister for Supply and Shipping has supplied the following information:No complaints have been received that kerosene of inferior quality is being sold. Because of the continued need for controlling allocations of petroleum products within the sterling As the area there is, of course, not the same freedom of selection of production sources now as in pre-war years but the quality of power kerotralia is watched closely and there is no reason to believe that the average quality now supplied is not equal to the average quality preBarker( Mr Archie war.",47,Commonwealth Disposals Commission Motor Vehicles
