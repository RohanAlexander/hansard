There is, however, no definite information that a general election will follow this crisis in the Canadian Parliament. If an election has to be held, the date of the Imperial Conference may have to be reconsidered. Doubtless this matter is now receiving the attention of the British Government. ister say how many , of the States have accepted the Commonwealth offer of a grant for road construction, and when the House may expect a statement by him in regard to this matter? Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia have definitely indicated that they propose to take advantage of the Commonwealth offer. I understand that the Government of South Australia intends to adopt a similar course, but the intentions of the Government of New South Wales have not been indicated. The Commonwealth's proposals will form part of the financial policy of the Government to be stated in the Treasurer's budget speech. (Hon. Sir Littleton",14,Setup

Isi t true that the new court, when appointed, will deal only with general matters and not with specific plaints? If so, will not the work of the court become greatly congested within the next six months? Will the Attorney-General consider the advisability of introducing a small amendment of the Arbitration Act to allow the two deputy presidents to deal with cases already listed, the hearing of which otherwise might be delayed for a considerable time ? tration Act provides for the continuance of the powers and functions of the deputy presidents of the Arbitration Court, in order that they may determine part-heard cases; but it is not correct to say that the new court about to be constituted will deal only with general matters. It will function under the act until amended, in accordance with the existing constitutional powers of this Parliament, or with the further powers which the people are to be asked to confer upon this legislature. In the circumstances, there is no honourable member has suggested. bate in this House, the Minister representing the Minister for Home and Territories promised that consideration would be given to the suggestion that distinctive names should be attached to those areas now known as Northern Australia and Central Australia.

Mr Lazarus, who formerly was associated with the Herald, was selected in accordance with the usual custom to accompany the Australian delegation to the forthcoming Imperial Conference in the capacity of publicity officer. It is a practice dating back fo many Conferences to select an active member of the press for this purpose rather than detach the regular Commonwealth publicity officer from the Prime Minister's Department, whicb. is naturally always considerably weakened during the absence of an important delegation.

To clear up misconceptions, I will narrate the exact facts that gave rise to the suggestion. In the year 1924, exchange difficulties became intense, and transfer of money from London to pay for the sale of Australian products overseas cost about £5 in every £100. This was serious, but worse was threatened because it appeared that exchange was likely to break down altogether, so tliat the money could not be transferred at all. In these circumstances, the Commonwealth Bank came to the rescue, and undertook to lend to the other banks, if necessary, a sum not exceeding £15,000,000, the banks to pay interest to the Commonwealth Bank at the Bank of England rate of the day. The exchange position immediately was relieved, and money was transferred from London to Australia in payment for primary products at a cost of £3 10s. per cent. If this action had not been taken by the Commonwealth Bank, it seems clear that the sale of primary products would have had to be susto be brought from America. Then, ontlie resumption of sales, the primary producers would have been compelled to pay an extravagant rate to get their money from London.

When the debate .was adjourned last night I was about to reply to two questions asked by the honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( M t . Charlton) and the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley). The honourable the Leader of the Opposition said that much of the land in this country was not put to proper use, and when I asked why, he replied, "" Because the owners will not put it to the best use."" The honourable member for Darling then interjected, "" There is a lot of good agricultural land in the electorate of the honourable member for Wakefield that is used for rearing sheep, but is admirably suited for agriculture."" In 1923-24 Government led the way towards the resumption of the most valuable of the estates in South Australia, which were being used for rearing sheep while hundreds of farmers were wanting land within the rainfall line. ment made a very successful move, which was anything but pleasing to the holders of the resumed estates, but they, however, soon recognized that, in the national in terests, it was right that their lands, which were of good qualitv. with excellent rainfall, should be made available for subdivision into relatively small areas. A t that time, there was not much to choose between producing wool and wheat. Wheat was as low as Is. 9d. a bushel, and wool, certainly not of the best quality, was being sold at from 4d. to 4 i d . per l b . The State Government bent its energies to the subdivision of the large estates, which were progressively subdivided as the demand + arose for smaller holdings. In almost every in stance they were acquired, not by compulsion, but by arrangement. The temper of the people demanded the change, and the owners wisely realized that they were not able to resist the pressure of [141] public opinion. But the position to-day is entirely different, for there are no squatters' estates l e f t in the Wakefield electorate. Indeed, there is not a big pastoral estate held by a squatter within the rainfall line in South Australia. The electorate of Wakefield, in common with other districts within the rainfal l area, has world-renowned breeders of stud sheep, and we have no longer to demand that these estates shall be cut up, but we have to think very seriously whether we have not gone too far in cutting up the valuable preserves of the breeders of the best stud stock in the world. Honourable members know that wool and wheat, particularly wool, carried us through our troubles during the long period of the war. I wish to inform the honourable member for Darling that five or six breeders of first class stud sheep are selling large areas of the remaining portions of their estates because costs are so high that they cannot show a profit on their business. These breeders are taking up a mere song, enormous areas farther back in Western Australia, and they have taken the best of their sheep with them. They have thus given an impetus to the development of the woolthe South Australian producing industry in Western Australia. That move is of great importance to that State. It would be a calamity if the Government went beyond reasonable bounds in interfering with the breeders of stud stock, for that might result in The GovernAustralia losing the type of carcass and merino wool sheep for which this country is famous the world over. It has been stated by intelligent men that we are doing wrong in allowing our best stud stock to be sent from Australia to other parts of the world. Some of the mosj valuable merino rams that this country has ever produced have been sold to the Government of South Africa. ever produced. able member for his correction. It is contended that we are stimulating the production in other countries of a quality of wool which will run Australia out of the market. means that' they must constantly introduce new blood ? they have not the right type of country.

A f t e r three or four years' growing of the clover, however, this country carries eight or nine sheep to the acre for three-fourths of the year, and the value of the land has risen from £2 10s. to as high as £15 and £16 an acre. The south-eastern portion of South Australia contains millions of acres of wet, sour land, and I suppose that 4 acres of it would not carry one sheep under the old conditions. Subterranean clover is now extensively sown in that district, and land that was formerly regarded as next to worthlessyields splendid returns, astounding everybody, and making the possessors of those wide areas rich men. In my opinion there is ample room in Western Australia for progress in agriculture and sheep-breeding, and if the work is done on up-to-date lines, the growth of the clover in that State should prove most remunerative. It contains huge areas of sour land that is too wet for agriculture, but treated w it h heavy dressings of superphosphate, and planted with this clover, it should give a large production of wool. Such success is promised that the past struggles of pastoralists in that State should soon be forgotten. The scope for the settlement of migrants :n Western Australia is so great that within 20 years that State should be able to absorb most of the settlers that GreatB r it a in proposes to send here under the present agreement, provided that the new arrivals receive reasonable treatment at the hands of the Government of the State. For some years Western Australia has had a community settlement; but honourable members w ill recollect what Mr Wignall, a member of the House of Commons and a frontrank man in the British Labour party, said about it . He was specially commissioned by the Imperial Government to It visit Australia, and he obtained first hand information regarding the conditions of those settlers.

No doubt, the good seed sown by h i m is bearing , f r u it to-day, judging by the earnest desire of Imperia l statesmen to do all that is humanly possible to transfer the surplus population of the Old Land to Australia and other dominions. Of all parts of the Commonwealth, Queensland, the richest Stats, probably has the greatest future. Tho regrettable thing is that it is not controlled by a sane government.

It is a State of almost infinite possibilities, and I shall be disappointed if it is not in a position to take a considerable number of migrants, and treat them well. The way in which new settlers are dealt with ties will be of the utmost importance. I propose to refer again to the community settlement in ""Western Australia. A number of migrants were brought out from the Old Country when the government of that State was led by my old and esteemed friend, Sir James Mitchell. He had the heart of a lion, but was possibly weak in discretion. No doubt, if he had an opportunity to launch the scheme again, he would do it on right lines. It is the failures of the past that point the way to success. wheat belt in that State was not a failure. community settlers were paid good wages to work upon their own blocks, although they were creating their own wealth. not settle individuals on individual blocks; he placed groups of individuals upon groups of blocks. and other preparatory work was done at enormous cost, and the large overhead expenses with which the blocks were loaded made it impossible for the selectors to succeed.

He was impressed by their cheerfulness, which may have been due largely to delight at meeting h i m ; but, although he investigated the settlements intelligently, and formed a good estimate of their possibilities, he did not realize their inherent drawbacks as f u l l y as he would if he were here to-day. It is much better to leave men to do their own pioneering work. The most successful settlers have been those who were not spoon-fed by a government, but, starting without a penny of capital, slept under wire fences, and stuck to their job, u n t i l they created an asset for themselves. New South Wales is the one Statei n the Commonwealth that has declared that it has no room for the State authorithe immigrants who are to be brought to Australia under this scheme; yet a few years ago Sir Joseph Carruthers roused the people of New South Wales with his slogan, "" A million farms for a million men.""Perhapsi t is just as well that New South Wales is not adopting this scheme at present; but when that State comes into line with the others, it will offer as much chance of success as any other State. Asf o r Tasmania, the excellent report of Sir Nicholas Lockyer, a hard-headed business man, stated that that State needs more people to carry its burden of debt and development, and of the until it has a larger population it will not find a way out of itsfinancial difficulties. In proportion to its size, Tasmania has extensive areas that are still in a state of nature, and it offers great opportunities for settlement and development. The application of science to industries throughout the Commonwealth during the last 25 years has doubled and trebled the yield of wealth per acre, and there is still great scope for further development along those lines. Victoria is a garden State, a rich and fascinating part of the Commonwealth, which, in proportion to its area, has three times as much land in the good rainfall area as has South Australia: But, because the latter State has a big percentage of Scotchmen in its population, it has flourished in spite of natural disabilities. Victoria has undoubted possibilities, and can be lef t to work out its own salvation. I In the River Murray valley, if anywhere, scientific brains are needed. The great locking and irrigation scheme along that stream was started with a capital of about £4,000,000, which has been increased to £8,000,000. Before long the money invested in it will be £10,000,000, and ultimately perhaps £12,000,000, but this great undertaking is being handled by competent men.

Australia has in 25 years in creased its population by 2,000,000, despite the intervening war and its immense liabilities. Canada has during the same period increased its population by 3,750,000, although it had a much bigger initial population and is closer to Great Britain. every year largely by men from the TJnited Kingdom who visit the Dominion for that purpose, and then return to their own country. Canada has in that way an enormous 'army of advertisers in the United Kingdom. given by the Canadian-Pacific Railway and the Canadian Government have largely brought about that country's development and growth of population. Lord Strathcona, who was chairman of that railway at the same time as he was H i g h Commissioner of Canadai n the United Kingdom, was one of the most distinguished citizens of the Empire. He was beloved both in Canada and in Great Britain. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company under his management was always prepared to construct lines to precede settlement. Australia, without any special facilities at all. has been able to increase its population so considerably during the last 25 vears. The bill provides for the development of Australia and migration thereto, and for . the appointment of four persons to a commission with extensive duties and great responsibilities. Althoughi t has not yet been determined what salaries shall be paid to the commissioners when appointed, I should say that the chairman will receive not less than £5,00 0 a year and the other three commissioners not less than £3,000 a vear each. The commission will have the right to obtain the advice of experts, who,' of course, will be paid high fees. I should say that at least £30,000 w ill be the annual cost to the Commonwealth to put the machinery of this scheme in motion. It is extraordinary that the Government should be so desirous to r i d itself oif responsibility by placing' it on the shoulders of other bodies. The Prime Minister himself admitted that the Government was not competent to carry out the immigration scheme, and it had therefore decided to place the responsibility upon the shoulders of a commission. The commission, when considering matters such as the development of the sugar lands in Queensland and the cotton lands in New South Wales, will no doubt call in numerous experts to advise it , and I suppose that they in turn will be able to recommend the appointment of special in vestigators.

I have no doubt that Great Britain would be prepared to make available, not £34,000,000, but hundreds of millions if it could get relief from the extraordinary conditions existing in that country to-day. British Government is spending something like £60,000,000 a year to supply its people with food, clothing, and shelter and to avoid a revolution. It has had an extremely hard struggle since the war, and it would be a great relief to it if for every £1,000 of the £34,000,000 it is lending, one British could be sent to Australia. not sure that the commission w ill be able to administer the immigration scheme successfully, and, therefore, I oppose the bill. I quite appreciate the attitude of some of the supporters of the Government. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Poster), enthusiastic as he is, is not too sure of the b ill, and advises caution. He said that the Government should be careful to see that the scheme is carried out properly: sideration the way in which the returned soldiers of this country were settled on the land"" settled "" in more ways than onei-w e can see that the same bribery and corruption which took place then mav take place under the commission provided for in this bill. to take place under the commission. because those who managed the soldier settlement were the officers of the Lands Departments of the different States, and they knew the quality of the land they were handling. The British Government lays down an important qualification, that for every £1,000 of the £34,000,000 to be made available one man must be settled on the land. We did not obtain such a result with soldier settlement; in fact, we found that we could not do it for £2,000 a settler. The cost of settling returned soldiers on the land has been anything up to £3,000 for each settler. Certain States -including , I frankly admit, Statesi n whioh Labour governments are in power -hav e accepted the scheme, and have undertaken to settle migrants on the land at a cost of £1.000 each. I do not think it can be done. The honourable commission may be, we cannot reasonably expect it to do something that no one has vet been able to do. A State may accept a loan of £5,000,000 and may submit a scheme which the commission may accept. The scheme may include a proposal to construct a railway at a cost of, £3,000,000, with the object of opening up The certain lands. A f t e r that £3,01)0,000 has been spent, the State borrowing the money will have to show that the required number of men has been settled on the land.

I would When we take into conrather they came from. B r it a in than from any other country. The Government that brought down this bill to provide more employment and to create openings for more workers is the Government that did so much to send employment out of this country. Honourable members will recollect how this Government, in a burst of patriotic sympathy with It will be more likely the Mother Country, decided to send £5,000,000 of the taxpayers' T h a t may be so, money to Englandi n order that the unemployment, starvation, and degradation of the workers of the Clyde and the naval shipbuilding yards at Home might be, to some extent, relieved. While sending work from Australia to the unemployed of the Clyde, the Government left the iron workers of Australia unemployed. If that £5,000,000 had been spent in Australia, it would have helped to provide work for many of the unemployed in this country. This Government, with consideration for all countries but its own, decided to send that work abroad. Every government's responsibility is first to its own people, before even the people of the Mother Country.

It needs to be emphasized that Australia is among the foremost nations of the world in the matter of increase of population. The right honourable the Prime Minister stated the increase of the population of different countries over a period of 20 years. He said that in that period the population had increased by 30,000,000 in the TJnited States of America, by 3,750,000 in Canada, by 41,000,000 in China, and by 13,000,000 in Japan. He did not state the percentage of increase, and to that extent his figures were misleading. A f t e r quoting those figures, he referred to the paltry increase of 2,000,000 in the popuI t was quite improper of him to paint such a picture to the disadvantage of this country.

I believe that in less than ten years huge international air liners will be operating, which will be of great advertising value to Australia, and will lead to a rapid increase in her population. But even at the present rate of increase it is estimated that in 1986 our population will be 20,000,000; in 2026, 40,000,000; and in 2056, 80,000,000. Although we shall not be worrying about vital statistics in 2056, we must recognize that the period between 1926 and 2056 is inconsiderable in the life and development of a nation. This Government is confirmed in the habit of appointing boards to take over the responsibilities which it should carry. In the course of this debate I have jotted down at haphazard, as they have occurred to me, particulars of various government boards that are operating. My list is as follows:-Commonwealt h Shipping Board, whioh has taken over the management of the Commonwealth Government line of ships and the Cockatoo Island Dockyard; Nauru Island Phosphates Commission, though its appointment was in evitable, and I do not blame the Government for it ; Meat Council; Repatriation Commission; Tariff Board; Federal Capital Commission; War Service Homes Commission ; Northern Territory Commission; Dairy Produce Export Control Board; Dried Fruits Export Control Board; M u r r ay Waters Commission: the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research; the Deportation Board, of which I should like some information, by the way; and the Commonwealth Board of Trade, in addition to which we have our representative on the boards of Amalgamated Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. 1 have no doubt that any honourable member, after a few minutes' thought, could add a dozen more boards to the list that I have given. In my opinion, we shall act most unwisely if we take any steps that might lead to large numbers of migrants coming here indiscriminately. Years ago the Government of. the TJnited States of America, at the behest of its commercial magnateswho desired to get rich quick, encouraged any kind of migrant who was: healthy and could work to settle in the It is difficult to say -whether the that country. No inquiries were made as to educational attainments, mentality, or morality; a man was sufficiently , qualified for admission into the country if he would work. But thinking people in America have long foreseen the inevitable result of such a policy, and the whole nation is to-day confronted with a most serious position in consequence of it . The nationals who migrated to America years ago did not .become Americanized, but set up settlements of their own in almost every big city. It is quite easy, in the iron and steel, and also the coal districts of America, to find colonies of Greeks, Maltese, southern and northern Italians, and numerous other nationals, who were brought to the country merely for exploitation purposes. This motley multitude of mixed nationalities constitutes a grave problem in the TJnited States of America. In order to prevent any addition to the difficulties that they are facing in this regard, and to ensure that, in the future, the great proportion of their immigrants shall be of the Nordic race, the Americans have instituted a quota system, similar to that which we have in operation, to control immigration. They decided, first of all, to take the 1892 quota, but soon dis. covered that that would not give the results that they desired, and so they are now taking the 1881 quota. In my opinion, Australia, in the future, w ill be faced with a position similar to that which confronts America unless extreme care is taken in controlling her migration policy. I realize, of course, that the proposed board could easily be prevented from permitting undesirable migrants from coming here, for Parliament could l i m it its power in that direction, or even disband it . The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr. Wireless Limited and the Foster), in a characteristic speech, has argued that we should agree to this b ill , for it would enable us to help the Old Country to solve her problems. Ever since I have been in this Parliament, the honourable member has given expression to similar flag-flapping sentiments, and I am informed on reliable authority that he has done so throughout his whole political career. He would be well advised to give his own country a little more attention and other countries a little less, -for, as the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) aptly pointed out last night, he is supporting a government that exports work but imports workers. The honourable member, on at least five occasions in the last three years, has accused the bricklayers of Australia of .going slow, and has said that they lay -50 per cent, less bricks in a given time than did the bricklayers of twenty years -ago. If he would read a little more about industrial happenings in other countries, he would find that, with notable exceptions of the Leverhulme, Ford, and Fry type, capitalists in every land are accusing the workers of their own country of going slow. article on English industrial affairs in which it was alleged that the workers of that country were constructing less, winning less coal, and generally producing less in a given time now than they did ten years ago. The bricklayers there also were accused of doing less work than formerly. One wonders whether, if these British workers concerning whose welfare the honourable member for Wakefield come to Australia, he would accuse them of going slow just as he now accuses our own people of doing so. To my mind it is unpatriotic of honourable members opposite to constantly attack the Australian workman. Minister( Mr Bruce), prior to and during the last election, did this for political purposes, but immediately after the election he admitted that Australia was comparatively free from strikes. That fact, however, had not prevented him from bringing down his ludicrous Deportation B ill . I maintain that Australia is more free from strikes than any other country. Trade unionists, whether their party has been in or out of power, have been able by the weight of numbers, to secure industrial conditions unparalleled in the history of civilization. The policy of the Labour party on the subject under discussion is clear and definite. We believe that tlie present immigration policy of the capitalist governments is directed to flooding the Australian labour market, reducing working class standards, and the providing of cheap labour to sweating employers. We' arc emphatic that public money should not be expended for these purposes. Afr. Blakeley. We declare that Australia is capable, under good government, of supporting in happiness a mueli larger population; but to protect our fellow workers from being deluded from false statements into leaving home and kindred merely to become tools of sweaters, we insist tliat land, housing accommodation, and employment be provided for overseas immigrants before they are invited to come to Australia. ment before migration. the Labour party is in a minority in this House, its policy regarding i m migration has the approval of, not only the workers, but also a large number of other people. But, even if support of that policy were confined to Only recently I read an the industrialists, no immigration scheme could be carried out successfully without the cordial approval and co-operation of Labour. The appointment of commissions and the creation of cumbersome machinery w ill not solve the problem. First of all, there must be no doubt that those who desire land will have itmade available to them. A t Darlington Point, New South Wales, a few days ago, there were over 4,000 apis so interested, were to plicants for one 'block. A t Grafton, a few weeks ago, 4,000 applications were received for a few blocks, and there has been equally keen inquiry at Narrabri, Nyngan, Moree, and other places in New -South Wales. I realize that the applicaThe Prime tions were not all made by bona fide land seekers; but, if we reduce the figures by 25 per cent., we obtain a f a i r l y correct estimate of the number keenly desirous of getting land. Since there is no need to bring large numbers of immigrants to Australia for defence or any other purposes, I oppose the bill in its entirety. prised at the attitude assumed by members of the Opposition. They are apparently tryin g to make this all-important measure a party one, although no bill should be further removed than this from party politics. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) made many It statesgood points, such as the necessity for a searching inquiry as to the area of suitable land available for settlement. Australia cannot be expected to remain in the possession of the comparatively small population of 6,000,000, in view of the overcrowded condition of other countries at no great distance from her own shores.",26,Second Beading

I was interested to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), who pointed out that there are large areas of land available for settlement in various parts of the Commonwealth, and I agree with him that experts should be appointed to ascertain the acreage available, its locality and value, and the purpose for whioh it is suitable. In Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, there are millions of acres of good land awaiting settlement. absurd to say that those parts are useless. If reasonable facilities, such as roads and railways, were afforded, water provided, and markets found, it could be turned to profitable use. large estates have been re-purchased in the Roma district, in Queensland. Water was thought to be scarce there, but artesian bores have revealed the presence of inquiry should be held into the number and nature of developmental works that might be carried out advantageously, because I take it that the money available could be spent in various directions, such as on road construction and water conservation. Much has been said about the d r if t of the population to the cities. As I pointed out in this House a few days ago, it is largely caused by the legislation that has been placed on the statute-books by past governments, both in the State and Federal arenas. cial character that has resulted in the building up of the cities at the expense of the country. legislation "" ? hours and pay ancl conditions of labour of those engaged in secondary industries. If these rates of pay and conditions were applied to rural industries, the cost of production would be so great as to render the exportation of many of our p r i mary products impossible. I agree w i th the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) that, if the country had been as well catered for as the cities, that d r if t would never have occurred. When we hear of a dairyman, whose assets are worth £1,600, obtaining an income of only £170 per annum, out of which he mustsupport a family, while his son, who is single, earns £312 a year in the city, there is something radically wrong. If the wages and hours of employment in the country could be made as attractive as those in the cities, there would be no talk about an exodus from rural life. At present 96 per cent, of our export trade is represented by primary products, and it would be impossible to retain that trade if the artificial conditions that obtain in the secondary industries were It is applied to rura l pursuits. The opposition of the Labour party to this migration scheme is explained by the proceedings at the Labour conference now being held in England, and the meetings of the various Several trade and labour councils from which honourable members opposite take their directions. All parties receive more or less direction from the organizations with which they are associated. unlimited supplies of it . An The workers' opposition to migration is founded on the fear that the new arrivals w ill compete w i th them in the labour market. I would be the last to support any policy that would have that effect; but I sincerely believe that if our population were doubled by a well organized and carefully-regulated scheme of migration, every worker in Australia would be infinitely better off. The misfortunes of some of the soldier settlers have been advanced as a reason for abandoning migration and land settlement. W h a t legislation? Honourable members w ill credit me with having some knowledge of the conditions and requirements of the man upon the land, and I say that governments w ill be simply courting disaster if they attempt to establish men in primary production under the conditions that applied to many of the soldier settlers. There is very little truth in the statements that have been made that exorbitant prices were paid for land for closer settlement. The cause of the failure of many of the soldier settlers is ""to be found in the conditions under which they started. To the cost of, say, 150 acres of land worth £10 per acre had to be added expenditure on fencing, the building of a house, the making of yards, and the purchase of a small dairy herd and implements.

A few estates and isolated farms may have been purchased at excessive prices, but the majority of the re-purchased -areas, if submitted at auction, would realize more than the prices paid for them by the Government. Government has assisted materially those soldier settlers who were threatened with failure, and I hope that the State Governments will do likewise, because I regard the Australian-born as the best settler. It is a source of deep regret to me that so many sons of farmers, who thoroughly understand the rural indus* tries, are coming to the cities to seek employment.. The reason why they arc leaving the land I have already indicated. The rural producer requires from State and Federal Governments more sympathy and scientific guidance. The primary industries present problems that are just as difficult as those associated with the secondary industries, and as they are paying almost the whole of the interest and sinking fund in connection with the uatioual debt, the Commonwealth should co-operate with the States in trying to put them on the best possible footing. I am very pleased that this Parliament came to the assistance of the dairying industry, by giving to those engaged in it complete control over the export of their produce. As a result of the new administrative machinery brought into existence, the quality of the butter has increased to such an extent that it is now quoted in the British market at only 2s. per cwt. less than Danish butter, whereas until recently it was 6s. lower-in price. This is due to the adoption of the Kangaroo brand, uniformity of grading, and the general improvement of the conditions relating to export. sive development of the dairying industry is essential to any scheme of migration and land settlement. I believe that fully SO per oent. of the dairy cows' in Australia should he spayed. The average annual production of butter-fat per cow is about 160 lb., whereas it should be nearer 300 lb. By promoting the expansion of this and other rural industries, the Government can increase the scope for immiMr Cook. grants, as well as the Australian-born. As a practical man, I tender my advice for what it is worth. I am convinced that it is impossible for any mere association to bring about a general improvement in an industry. For the last 20 years, I have been on the executive of the Butter and Cheese Factories Association, and I am one of the three memThe Federal bers of the Victorian Dairy Advisory Board. During that time, I have been working incessantly to raise the standard of the industry in the manner I am advocating to-day; but our progress has been tediously slow, and has been retarded by the apathy of Ministers and Government ofiicers. ""We should aim at attaining a standard nearer to that which obtains in Denmark. A Federal council is now working in co-operation with the State advisory boards to promote fodder conservation, herd testing, the improvement of herds, the production of a better quality of butter, and the establishment of colleges for the education of factory managers. We are now asking that this committee of experts shall be given statutory recognition, so that it may have greater authority to place the important dairying indnstry on a better footing. If that policy is pursued in the near future, Australian dairy produce will be worth nearer £80,000,000 annually instead of only £40,000,000 as at present. Tobacco cultivation is another industry which has been shamefully neglected. We frequently complain that the manufacturers that has been do not bring science and the latest machinery to their aid in order to improve their output and make better use of their by-products. The application of science to primary production is equally essential. Australia is"" sending £3,000,000 per annum to America for tobacco leaf, and the percentage of the locally-grown article used in Australian manufacture, Progresnotwithstanding that its quality has been affirmed by experts abroad, and has improved considerably in recent years, has been reduced from 14 per cent, to 6 per cent, in the last four years, Australia should supply at least 50 per cent, of its requirements of tobacco leaf, and that would give profitable employment to 5,000 growers. The Government should, through the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, come to the aid of tliia very neglected industry. The export of meat is another industry that cries aloud for serious attention. The following statement shows the imports of frozen and chilled meat into Great Britain:YEAR 1924. Imported.

The imports of pork products into Great Britain represent, roughly, 10,000,000 pigs yearly, which is, approximately ten times the total number of pigs in the Commonwealth. Australia's share of this enormous trade is nil. The high cost of production in Australia makes it impossible for us to compete successfully with other countries. The firm with which I am connected accepted an order recently for 500 pigs, and immediately it attempted to buy, the market advanced 10s. a head. Climatic conditions'are all in our favour for pig-growing, and yet so soon as pigs fall below 7d. per lb., dressed weight, growers will not continue in the business. shall include the following:New Zealand produces pork at from 5d. to 5^d. per lb. The pork industry should be placed on a similar footing to that of other rural industries, and thus enable us to multiply enormously our exportation of pork products. Some honourable members seem to think that our population is sufficient, and that we should be content to rest on our laurels. would be playing a very dangerous game. With the assistance of scientific research -and co-operation, we can add considerably to our primary and secondary industries. Although the secondary industries are receiving great benefits under the tariff, yet they provide only 4 per cent, of our total exports. I am pleased that the Government is appointing a council of scientific research. We cannot expect an immediate improvement from its operations, but I believe that it will ultimately be of great benefit to the primary and secondary industries, and thus help to absorb immigrants who are willing to work in this country.

Their practical experience would prove of great assistance to the commission. Much has been said about the powers of the commission. Eor the benefit of my constituents, I shall quote two clauses of the bill. Clause 13 readsThe powers and functions of the commission (a) In relation to the development of Australia(i) the consideration of matters in relation to the development of the resources of the Commonwealth, whether by co-operation between the Commonwealth and the several States, or otherwise; (ii) the investigation of the condiThat tion aud development of existing industries, whether primary or secondary, in the Commonwealth, and of the possibility of establishing new industries therein; (iii) the conduct of negotiations, whether within or beyond Australia, for the establishment of new industries in Australia and the development of existing industries therein;",29,Second Beading

To develop Australia on sound lines, we must give effect to a practical scheme of immigration. The most important thing to do is to make a searching; investigation to determine the area, of Crown lands available. I do not advocate the purchase of freehold land, except in special places, because it is too dear: but there are millions of acres of Crown lands the suitability of which for settlement has not been determined. Detailed information about the land available, and the kind of holdings required, should be -tabulated. "" It is imperative that we should do that before we attempt to settle migrants. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) correctly stated that the mistakes and failures of the past had tended to educate us. The States are now in a better position to handle the problem of land settlement than they were before the settlement of ex-soldiers was attempted.

That commission will be entrusted witJh the development of this country, and will lxi charged with the duty of attracting population from oversea. Both those objectives are desirable; but the question is, "" A r e we prepared, at the present time, to hand this work over to a commission?"" There are in this country six State parliaments and the Commonwealth Parliament, in whioh there are experts like the honourable member for In d i , who are well versed in all matters connected with the land. To hand this work over to a commission is a reflection on the parliaments of this country. If migrants are brought here, will they be settled on the land or employed in the secondary industries? Great Britain cannot afford to lose any of her rural population. If she desired to develop her own countryside, she could employ the hundreds of thousands of acres of virgin land that is now used for hunting and other sports of the wealthy. If she wished to solve the problem of feeding her population, she could develop those idle lands. cannot feed the whole of her population, but she is not even trying to do anything towards that end. throughout GreatB r it a in is, "" We must find an outlet for our surplus population."" Australia has plenty of land, and I should be the last person in this House to refuse to assist those who wish to come here. An y man or woman who has the courage to go 12,000 miles oversea to make a new homo is a good class of migrant. The. dull and indifferent usually remain at home, but those who come here have courage, and w ill make good citizens. Thc Labour party takes a logical stand. It is not opposed to populating this country with migrants from GreatB r it a in , but it says that, before they are brought here, we should, by a comprehensive scheme of development, provide a market for It stands alone in their labour. Honourable members of the Opposition have pointed to the opportunities that the Govenimeut has to use the tariff to promote secondary industries. This country is still We are only trifling w i th the tariff. Enormous quantities of manufactured goods are being imported, and the tariff I am merely provides the Government w i th revenue. Members on this side do not look upon the tariff as merely a source The -bill of revenue. It should rather be regarded as a means of establishing local industries. We are prepared to pay a bounty on the growing of cotton, but we would not stop at that. When the cotton has been grown, there is a great opportunity to employ Australians to manufacture it . Therefore, we would give a. bounty for the manufacture of cotton yarn. Over £12,000,000 worth, of cotton goods is i m ported annually into this country, and if we wish to increase our population, the establishment of this industry presents a means of doing so. The paper-making industry could employ thousands of work people. This party considers that this country should also manufacture all its requirements of glassware, and of many other things. If this Government establishes secondary industries on a sound footing, population w ill come to this country without any expensive scheme to bring it here. I was a member of this House when the Fisher Government adopted a policy for the development of this country. It built the transcontinental railway, it built cruisers in this I admit that she country, and it carried out a vigorous policy in the Postal Department. The result was that the population increased The cry rapidly without any wholesale scheme of immigration. £50,000 a year in development, and the rates for migrants were reduced almost to nothing. It s policy was an active i m migration encouragement policy. MrE . RILEY But it did not borrow money for the purpose, and the migrants came here without an expensive migration scheme. It undertook the responsibility of development, and this Government should do the same. We could attract population to this country by a system of effective protection.

The Prime Minister's speech said nothing about the duties of the commission. I know very little about land problems, but I know that at present migrants are being brought here without any preparation whatever for them. they are fortunate they are met on arrival by a few interested ladies, who give them a cup of tea and say to them, "" You go up into the country and you will be quite all right. "" They go into the country, but they are not all r i g h t ; and^ after finding it impossible to get work, they return to the cities. Honourable members will bear me out when I say that one of our worse experiences is interviewing men who, having come to this country with high hopes of success, find themselves totally unable to get work and have to beg for a crust to eat or a place to sleep. I suppose we have all asked such men, "" ""Why did you come out here?"" and have been told about the wonderful advertisements of high wages and good conditions in Australia that fchey read in England. The fact is, as bhe honourable member for In d i ( Mr Cook) has told us, tliat the good wages are £ 1 a week, and the good conditions their keep. I am opposed to the adoption of any immigration policy which does not include the provision of work for the migrants to take up as soon as they arrive. If we had a number of farms with houses, implements and seed already on them that we could hand over to immigrants with families, there might be something in this scheme; but that is not the case. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Poster) said that that would be spoon-feeding the migrants; but surely even he believes that this scheme involves Government assistance for those who come here. I contend that the State Governments, which control the land, are far better able to initiate an effective policy of land settlement for migrants than the Commonwealth Government is. I trust that the commission will be a success, but that will be impossible unless its first care is to establish public works for the migrants to engage in on their arrival.

This commission should spend a couple of years in establishing works for migrants before it does anything to bring them here.

It appears to me that their view of the urgency of the question is out of perspective. In my opinion, the matter is urgent, not only from the point of view of population, but also of defence. The time is rapidly approaching when we shall have to put aside our domestic ideas as to the wisdom or otherwise of adopting a comprehensive migration policy. A f t e r Senator Drake-Brockman's return from Geneva, where he represented Australia at the F if t h Assembly of the League of Nations, he delivered a speech in the Senate which I commend to honourable members. He said that he had sensed an unmistakable desire on the part of the representatives of the nations there assembled to l if t the question of migration from the plane of domestic, on to the higher plane of international politics; and he stressed its great importance in affecting the relations of different nationals. Honourable members w ill remember having seen quite recently in the press the report of the sensational debate on our White Australia policy that occurred at an international Labour conference held in London. The majority of representatives there from the Orient, as well as the rhajority of those who represented the British Labour movement, strongly opposed our policy; but I am glad that Dr. Evatt, a member of ment, who is visiting Great Britain, took up the cudgels on its. behalf, and It should be procaused the conference to take a more reasonableview of the matter. That incident indicates that we must look at this as a question of international politics. Reference has been made during the debate to the possibility of this scheme enabling us to assist Great Britain to solve her acute unemployment problem. I trust that we shall not lose sight of that aspect of it . We owe our very existence to Great Britain, and it ill becomes us to sneer at her, for we should look to her at once in any time of national disaster. In that circumstance, if we can possibly help herto solve her problems, it is in If we make the conditions cumbent upon us to do so. Whatever may be the position of the other self governing dominions in the Empire, it cannot be denied that Australia and New Zealand are absolutely dependent upon I have the goodwill of Great Britain. Our position is entirely different from that of the Dominion of Canada, which has at her back for defence purposes the whole American continent; and we are also in a different position from SouthA f r i c a , where, I am sorry to say, there seems to be a desire to "" cut tbe painter.""

If by any reasonable means we can introduce into this country migrants of the British race, and relieve Great Britain to some extent of a pressing responsibility, we should by all means do it .

The population of Australia increased during a given period by 2,000,000, and that of Japan increased during the same period to the extent of 13,000,000. But while Australia's natural annual increase is only 140,000, that of Japan is almost 1,000,000. remains exactly the same in each case. over deaths in Australia is practically insignificant, and therefore it is necessary for us to look for a suitable class of m i grants. preference to people of our own k it h and kin, and it is regrettable that the various schemes that have' hitherto been introduced for migration and development have almost without exception failed to produce the results expected, sometimes on account of the inhospitable "" views publicly expressed, but more often, perhaps, because of unsuitable officials. am quite prepared to give credit where it is due, and I have no hesitation in saying that under the present scheme the problem is now being tackled in an earnest endeavour to meet the needs of the nation. plan is that the commissioners will be appointed for seven years, and if they are not successful it will be impossible to dispense with their services. pect of the matter. We have the privilege of showing preference to British migrants, bub if we refuse to admit any migrants at all, we may be faced with the necessity of accepting the nationals of other countries whether we like them or not. It is useless to say that the League of Nations would come to our rescue. The claims of other nations have to be considered by tlie League. A certain proportion of the present population of Australia is composed of people with oriental ideas, and they do not favour the White Australia ideal. If we do not solve the problem of keeping Australia white, others will do it for us. That would mean an influx of migrants that we could not control, and a position might arise somewhat akin to that obtaining in the TJnited States of America. Reference has been made to the anxious eyes cast upon Australia by Southern' European migrants. I think that the honourable member for Darling referred to "" Italians and the dregs of Europe""; but Australia must be prepared to deal with the problem of this migration. I am familiar with the conditions under which Italian migrants live in Australia, and I take no exception to them because of their nationality. I do And the house room not object to Italians on the score that they are not white. They have been white men from the day's of the Roman Empire that existed before the British Empire was dreamt of. If we are to judge nations by their achievements in art, science, and literature, I suggest that the Naturally, we desire to give Italians occupy as proud a position as any white race in Europe. If one thinks of the name of a great"" personage of British nationality, he can easily conjure up the name of some Italian who has similarly contributed in a large measure to the advance of oivilization. It is unfair, therefore, to regard Italian migrants as in any way inferior to British migrants. I The Italians themselves do not ask for preference over other migrants, but when they conform to our immigration laws, they expect to be treated at least as well as other nationals. I have no objection to the admission of a certain proportion of foreigners of white extraction, irrespective of their nationality, provided they conform to all the requirements of our immigration laws. Now that the people of Latin races have been prevented from entering the TJnited States of America to I shall come to that as the same extent as previously, other outlets must be found for the surplus population of Southern Europe, and if this Parliament is not prepared to assist in bringing Australia to a f u l l state of development, pressure w ill assuredly be be made on it from such directions that it w ill not be left for Australia to determine what quotas of foreign nationals are to be admitted. When Mr. Gillies was Premier of Queensland, and a number of It a l i a n migrants were about to land in that State, he telegraphed to the Prime Minister peremptorily requesting h i m to prevent their entrance.

The Lender of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) did not appear to be particularly happy in his remarks about this measure. He seemed to forget the fact that, when supporting the North Australia B ill , he said that it would be an excellent idea if a certain proportion of the money to be made available under the migration agreement could be used for the development of that part of the Commonwealth. For the rest he merely laid emphasis upon what he regarded as the economic menace of flooding the country with i m migrants. There is no intention on the part of the Government to flood Australia w i th new settlers to such an extent as to cause a serious menace to the workers. necessary, as the honourable member for South Sydney( MrE . Riley) pointed out, to develop our secondary industries vigorously. But between primary and secondary producers I draw no distinction, since each section is dependent on the activities of the otlier. Despite our tariff wall, Queensland in the last ten years has absorbed only an additional 1,600 employees in its secondary industries. ""While the population of the State has increased by only 14 per cent, in that period, its taxation has increased by 280 per cent. responsible for that. Mr ""WEST -Railway construction has helped in that direction. enter honourable member concerning the Queensland railways. is losing £2,000,000 per annum under the The secondary industries are indispensable as a means of providing markets and lucrative employment for our people. Unfortunately, most Australian rural occupations are seasonal. annual crops of wool, wheat, and sugar are being garnered, there is abundant employment at high wages, and the workers are happy and contented; but when the harvesting period is over, great numbers of people slide down the great plane that leads to the cities, and temporarily, at least, are unemployed. Unless and until the Commonwealth develops schemes such as that outlined in this bill, we cannot, even with the aid of a protective tariff, develop our secondary industries sufficiently to give profitable employment to our people, and provide a home market forprimary produce. I listened with interest to the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr. Lazzarini) relating how he, when an incipient primary producer, was compelled to leave the land, whereas had the leasehold system been in operation he would still be indulging his natural predilection for a life on the land, instead of representing an important constituency in this House. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker M'olonev) stated that on one occasion 4,000 persons applied for one block of land.

The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) never misses an opportunity to talk of the returned soldiers, and condemn the present Government for its action towards them.

The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) seems to be terrified by the powers that this bill will confer upon the proposed commission. He need not fear any commission that is composed of men of the calibre of Mr Gepp. Even the honourable member for Wannon referred to him as the master mind of Australia, and if the Government can induce four of the master minds of this country to direct its immigration and development policy, Australia must benefit substantially. Crown, giving only part of his time to a particular subject, must remain a tyro in respect of it ; and the country will fare much better if experts are appointed to devote the whole of their time to the development of migration and development in co-operation with the States. No honourable member can point to any board appointed in the past that has not justified its existence. I am confident tliat when a commission is concentrating upon this great problem and working in collaboration with the States, a sound and practical scheme will be evolved which will mean much to the development of Australia. I should like to see the provisions of the bill broadened so as to cover the development of the Mandated Territories.

134,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES (Boothby)ber is surely not contending that under this bill migrants can be introduced from countries other than the TJnitedK in g dom? the bill, migrants from foreign countries, as well as from the United Kingdom, may be admitted. There is nothing to suggest that migration refers only to British migrants; but if , as I believe, that is the intention of the Government, it should be expressly stated in the bill . an agreement under which £34,000,000 is to be advanced to the Commonwealth by the British Government. orable member wil l not find in the bill any phrase which would prevent a migration agreement from being made with some foreign country. agreement as well as the bill , and the agreement provides for an advance of £34,000,000 to be expended in bringing migrants from the United Kingdom. the honourable member realize that reference is made in the bill to other migration agreements? principal migration agreement is that between the Commonwealth Government and the British Government. not exclude any other agreement, and I speak as one who has had some small experience in studying the draftin g of bills. I may be wrong, but, if so, I prefer not to be interrupted while my remarks are unfinished. No doubt, under the bill the Government intends to provide chiefly for British immigration, but the fact that it relates to development and migration indicates, in the absence of an excepting clause, that the control of ail immigration is contemplated. That being so, I am perfectly free, and tbe honourable member for Herbert( D r . No t t ) took the same view, to deal w it h the whole subject of immigration. commission would take over the complete management of immigration. point which I wish to put to the Ministeri n charge of the bill. It appears to me that there is a certain vagueness in its terms. That is quite right and proper so f a r as the intention is to prevent the adoption of any cut-and-dried scheme before the commission has been appointed; but there is an unA s I read desirable vagueness about certain of its provisions. Although the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) does not agree w it h my view of its scope, I think that he w ill probably agree with me that, if this bil l is to apply to foreign as well as to British immigration, it is well that the House should know that fact in advance. never agree to the bill if the amount of The hon£34,000,000 were to be used to bring foreign migrants here. matter wns first mentioned by the honourable member for Herbert, but I propose to go further into details than he did. I wish to deal w it h several general points. The first is whether the commission is to have any say respecting the immigration of people of foreign descent, even if that say is limited to the giving of advice. In other words, is this commission, when formed, to have the right to say to the Government, "" We wish to express our views on the immigration of foreigners "" ? If it is not to have the right, and if its work is to be confined entirely to B r it is h immigration-althoug h I see no indicaT h a t does tion of that in the bill-honorabl e members w ill agree with me that its scope is relatively limited. If , on the other hand, the commission is to have a say in regard to immigration generally, another question arises, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Herbert, and also by Senator Drake-Brockmani n another place since his return this year from the meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations. I regret that a parliamentary rule prevents me from quoting from his exceedingly interesting speech, and I shall, therefore, refer to the speech that I delivered in this House last year, when the Immigration*Bill was being discussed. The few opinions that I tried to establish at that time have been more than amply confirmed by what has occurred since. I hope that I have made it clear to the T h a t is a House that I am now considering the general subject of immigration. I wish to refer to three points that I put forward last year.

146,Mr Duncan,"HUGHES Thisthat the people of Great Britain had shown themselves somewhat lukewarm about the principle of White Australia. That is confirmed by an extract from Foreign Affairs-, an American quarterly review, issued in October, 1925. That review contains a very interesting article on the White Australia policy, written under the nom de plume of "" Sydney."" It is of no use to blink facts which are patent to every one outside this chamber. A new situation is gradually arising, which we ignore, or at least do not discuss. This subject is being discussed in the press, by the man in the street, and is being dealt with in review articles. It is well, therefore, that it should be' raised in this House, and that I should carry a step further what I said last year. The writer of this article, discussing the fact that more interest is now being taken in the general theory and principle of the White Australia policy than formerly, saysBut tlie main reason is that Australians have realised the change which has taken place in their relations to the rest of the world, and in particular to the other members of the British Commonwealth. To-day it would not be (if it ever would have been) sufficient to ask the British nation to take a policy upon trust and to join unquestioningly in defending the people responsible for it. A nation burdened with debt and with taxes incurred in an exhaustive struggle may still be ready to maintain its obligations whether of interest or sentiment but could not be expected to do so without knowing that the claims upon it were founded, not on selfishness, but on justice and on an ideal in which all democracies are interested. A policy, participation in which may add to the annual expenditure on defence, must be explained with sufficient clearness to a democracy which is deeply and primarily concerned with the alleviation of poverty at Home. Again the new status of the dominions, ill-defined as it is, carries with it the obligabelieve that the attitude of Australia w it h tion that the convictions and claims of one member of tlie partnership shall be justified to the others. More especially is this true of a policy which through injudicious defence or careless administration may be interpreted as placing the people of Australia and India in opposition. The possibility of misconstruction has been disclosed on many occasions. I do not agree with every statement the article, but it is obviously by a man possessing a full knowledge of the subject, and appears in what I think the first review on foreign affairs in the English-speaking is published in America, and is therefore brought to the very doors of the people of the contributed spondent presumably residing in Sydney. When such things are being said at large, it is not wise for this House to ignore them. The second point that I wish to refer to is that, in spite of the mixture of blood which has taken place in America, if British people had to mate with those of any other nation, they would prefer those of the United States. Some people claim that the American nation is not a nation in the ordinary sense, but with that opinion I disagree. The American people-and I know a little about them-hav e a strongly-developed sense of nationhood. The late John Morley, in Notes on Politics and History, published in 1913, referred to the absorption by a population of new modifying elements, and ended with this sentenceYet the political nationality of the United States, their high and strong self-consciousness as a nation, is one of the supreme factors in the modern world's affairs. That seems to me to confirm the argument which I used in this House last year. My third point is, perhaps, the most important: it is that we should not be Unreasonable in our attitude towards European races. I urged last year that if the quota system which was laid down under the Immigration B ill , then under discussion, was to be put into effect, that should be done reasonably, and we should be particularly reasonable in our dealings with the peoples of Western Europe. I do not say that any unreasonable quota has been applied under that legislation, because I am not in a position to know. I hope that the M in ister will give some particulars about that before the debate ends. But, generally speaking, the people of the western world regard to foreigners is not reasonable. Any one who has closely read the newspapers must know that to be so. I read in yesterday's Argus the following report of some remarks by Sir Roderick Jones, the chairman of Reuter's News Agencyin Expressing his approval of the White Australia policy, Sir Roderick Jones said that he written considered that emigration from Europe would -be beneficial so long as the migrants were hard workers and prepared to observe the laws of the country. If Australia did not take as world. The magazine many white people as it eould get, it would excite the cupidity of peoples who were not -white. It was for the people of Australia to maintain the white standard of living. United States. The article was That is a terse, sane, and sensible by an Australian correway of looking at the matter;",39,Second Beading
147,Mr Duncan,"Hughes.it assumes the White Australia point of view. sonable in these matters. If honourable members want further evidence of the feeling which is growing overseas, they need read only the reports in the newspapers during the past week of the World Labour Migration Conference. That conference was representative of Labouri n all countries. The British representatives included Mr Ramsay MacDonald, Mr Arthu r Henderson, Mr George Landsbury, and Mr C. P. Cramp. The Australian representatives at that conference informed the Australian Press Association that there was opposition to the White Australia policy, and that was only to be expected at a congress at which only five English-speaking countries-Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa,-were represented, as against seventeen European and Asiatic countries, including India. If there are seventeen representatives of coloured races to five representatives of white races, does it not follow tlhat, even in a purely Labour conference, the division of opinion on such a matter w ill be in the ratio of seventeen to five ? Australians are relatively few in number when compared with those who do not approve even of tbe first principle of a White Australia, and any man is foolish who does not take that fact into account. A sub-committee of the conference was appointed to consider this matter, and, according to the Argus of the 28th June, they managed, after a bitter fight, to formulate this declarationThat the inrush of migrants into immigrating countries, sueh as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa, might in certain cases endeanger workers by depressing wages and lowering conditions. affirmed that it was ihe duty of all governments to solve migration problems in a manner conducive to international peace, good-will, and the protection of the interests of the migrants. I am forced to ask at this point whether the attitude of the Opposition in opposing this bill can possibly be imagined, even by honourable members of the Opposition, to be "" conducive to international peace, good-will, and the protection of the in terests of the migrants "" . That is a formula which was arrived at after much discussion,' and it throws on every one some responsibility to t r y and see-to state it shortly-that a f a i r thing is done. Is the attitude of honourable members of the Opposition in opposing the migration, Australia should not be unreaeven of British people, likely to be conducive to a kindly feeling by those people for Australia? Before the sitting is suspended for dinner, I wish to come to the point up to which I have been working. I consider it my duty to warn honourable members, and the people at large, that, unless we are reasonable in the way we control and prohibit the migration of people who have claims to come here, we may eventually have to choose between the League of Nations on the one hand and a White Australia on the other. That w ill be a difficult choice, which, it appears to me, is coming nearer to us. There are many people who say that in such a crisis they would stick to the White Australia policy and abandon thc League of Nations; but would that be of any avail to this country unless GreatB r it a in and the rest of the Empire endorsed our view ? That is somethingfor my honourable friend from Adelaide to answer. perhaps, makes it all the more essential that the honourable member should j u s t if y his attitude regarding the immigration of others, who, like himself, may some day become useful members of this House. Sitting suspended from. 6.28 to 8 p.m. make quite clear my attitude in regard to our White Australia policy. I am a believer in a White Australia, and a disbeliever in a black Australia. I do not believe in mixing the black and white races, nor do I believe in a pseudo "" White Australia."" Some advocates of Nevertheless, it the policy seem to favour excluding other people from Australia irrespective of their similarity in culture, type, and general outlook. I said here a year ago, and I repeat now, that the old distinction that we drew was largely racial, but is becoming economic, and the tendency is to push it to such an extreme that the policy may be totally defeated. By being reasonable, we may retain an essentially White Australia; but by being unreasonable, for economic considerations, we are in grave danger of losing everything.

On that point, I direct-the attention of honourable members to a paragraph in John Stuart If the passage money of Mill' s Representative Government, published some sixty-five years ago, which seems to me to be a very lucid statement of the case:But while it is essential to representative government that the practical supremacy in the State should reside in the representatives of the people, it is an open question what and household actual functions, what precise part in the machinery of government, shall he directly and repayments being made personally discharged by the representative The league underbody.

Those administering large businesses have quite sufficient to do in coping with the inquiries of the Tariff Board without being troubled unnecessarily by those of a second body. Personally, I consider that the powers conferred under clause 13 are too wide, and should be limited, so that the commission could obtain all the information it needed without adopting an inquisitorial attitude towards employers. flicting recommendations by the two bodies. necessarily wide at. the outset.

Last evening the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) remarked that he was speaking, not to this House only, but also to the general public. I submit that every speech delivered in this chamber on this bill is, in the larger sense, addressed to the world. WhileX do not imagine that the eyes of the whole world are necessarily always riveted on. this. Parliament, at the present time. I realize that, owing to the vastness of Auswith a migration scheme, the object betralia's empty spaces, and the importance of the problem of dealing with the surplus population in other parts of the world, the attitude, of this Parliament on the general subject of migration, whether it happens to be of British or foreign stock, is being keenly watched. What is said in this debate will be noted on the otlier side of the world, and, therefore, I hope that honourable members opposite will realize that the matter should be kept out of the arena of party politics. The attitude of Australians towards other countries will be judged by the action that this Parliament takes on the present proposals. If the fate of the White Australia policy rested with the honourable member for tralia would not be safe from the menace of coloured labour. Presumably, the honourable member has been influenced to some extent by another South Australian politician, who has strongly advocated the introduction' of coloured labour. The writings of Mill, .whom the honourable member quoted, infatuated me in my young days, but Mill had no policy suitable for a progressive country like Australia. The object of the bill seems to be to deprive this Parliament of the control of the finances and destiny of the Commonwealth. I compliment the honourable member for Boothby upon the matters that he has brought under the notice of the Government,' and I am indeed glad that he has seen fit to point out, as I have done on numerous occasions, the danger of appointing boards or comforeign to those of the people generally. Since the Government takes little notice of suggestions from honourable members on the opposition side of the House, it was particularly refreshing to me to hear the honourable member express opinions entirely in accord with my own. The Government's attitude cannot be said to be flattering to the Imperial authorities, who, in their anxiety to flood Australia with immigrants, are evidently unable to formulate a policy that will enable Britain profitably to employ its own people. Owing to the inability of the -British manufacturers to .keep their industries going, they suggested to the Baldwin Government that it should lend to the Commonwealth £34,000,000 in connection ing to foist British goods of that value on the Australian people. When the Treasurer was speaking, I interjected that the money would be sent to Australia in the form of goods, and he replied that it would come as cash. I am surprised that he should attempt to mislead the House by such a statement, because it is common knowledge that all exchanges are effected by credits, and -that not a threepenny-piece crosses the ocean except in the pockets of travellers.

Repeatedly when he was a private member the honourable gentleman protested against the policy of borrowing abroad instead of within Australia, and so retaining the interest in this country. Apparently he now subscribes to a policy which is a continuance of the principle he denounced, and involves the flooding of Australia with British goods, to the detriment of local secondary industries. It is a remarkable fact that when honourable members opposite change from the back benches to the Ministerial bench their views change with chameleon-like rapidity. son) that he should not follow the example of some of his colleagues, but should be loyal in ofiice to the principles he professed as a private member. For the information of honourable members, I quote this criticism of the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Government's immigration proposals"" Borrowing abroad clashes with our policy of protecting our own industries,"" said Mr balance of 35,000 by immigration. Great Pratten recently, "" and our national policy of protection is not complete unless we are self-supporting in regard to our public finance."" There is nothing ambiguous about this. It is a clear and definite statement of a fundamental truth. It is the most important truth that Australia has to learn to-day. The £34,000,000 migration loan is no different from other loans. Britain is not going to send us money-sh e is going to send us £34,000,000 worth of manufactured goods. If Mr Pratten favours tliis loan, he goes back on his definite statement quoted above. If he does not favour it, ho should not silently acquiesce in it. It is up to Mr Pratten to say just where he stands. The Minister for Trado and Customs is continually advocating that Australia shall be self-contained. If our protective policy were really effective, very little money would be raised by the Customs Department j but some honourable members who profess protectionist principles act as if they were free traders. I never do anything to belittle this land of my adoption. I suspect that behind this enthusiasm in certain quarters for immigration is some scheme which is not in the interests of Australia. What is the need for the haste that is being shown other than the desire of the British and Commonwealth Governments to help the British manufacturers? The honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) quoted a speech made in England by the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce). Such remarks should never have fallen from the lips of any Australian, and as PrimeM i nister the right honourable gentleman should have placed the interests of Australia first and l e f t other parts of the Empire to look after themselves. The development of Australia has been remarkable. W it h in 140 years a large and prosperous community has been established here, with conditions of living, traditions, and ideals, that are an example to the rest of the world. A t the end of the eighteenth century the population of Australia totalled only 5,000. One hundred years later it I suggest to the new Minister had increased to 3,765,000, and at the end of the first quarter of the 20th century it ' was nearly 6,000,000. Those figures indicate very rapid progress, especially when regard is paid to the fact that our people enjoy conditions better than obtain in any other country. Since the census in 1921, the population of the Commonwealth has increased at the rate of 117,000 per annum-7 0 per cent., or 82,000 by natural increase, and the gold discoveries have caused the rapid influx of people to other countries, but the settlement which followed was not of bhe permanent character of that in Australia, and the prosperity was only ephemeral. Some honourable members have made extravagant statements about the d r if t of population from the country to the cities. That evil is not peculiar to Australia. If I were a GermanI should naturally wish to see Berlin, and if I lived in the French provinces I should want to go to Paris. The gregarious instinct of mankind, and the desire for gaiety and life, are responsible for much of the d r if t from the rural areas to the great centres of population. Another fact to be remembered is that, owing to the development of mechanical invention and the application of advanced knowledge and science to industry, fewer hands are employed now than formerly in connection with the production of foodstuffs. I suppose that fewer men are employed in the primary industries to-day than when I was a boy. Immigration to America reached such proportions that Congress was compelled to limit the influx. Of the 3,036,789 square miles in the TJnited States of America, 1,500,000 square miles is utilized for farming. I understand that the American Congress acted on the",44,Second Beading
161,For Markets And Migration ( Mr Pater,"principle that every nation should be .able to feed itself, and that it is economically unsound for population to increase at a rate disproportionate to the production of foodstuffs. Congress had a national stocktaking. It surveyed the land that was not suitable for the production of foodstuffs-the surface of rivers, lakes, and swamps, and land too steep for cultivation or occupied by railways and cities-mad e allowance for the area that must be devoted to pastoral purposes, and came to the conclusion that, as there was not, in the TJnited States of America itself, a very large area capable of producing foodstuffs, the country could not be overrun with immigrants if provision was to be made for the natural excess of births over deaths among the American American writer recently declared t h a f more of the good things in l if e should be Melbourne, gave evidence before a comleft for those already living in America, mission that half of those who were comthe idea being that an inrush of immigrants, which might possibly interfere with the existing standards of living, would deprive the ipeople of America of some of the privileges enjoyed by them. A t a recent function in London, at which Lady Cook, the wife of the H i g h Commissioner, was present, Miss P. Taylor, of Melbourne, said that Australia needed women with capital to take up land settlement. how this lady came to make such a statement. I do not think that women would succeed in the arduous task of tryin g to make virgin land productive. In New South Wales, a gentleman who occupies a position in. the Upper HouseI call it the Chamber of Fossils Groom) -The honourable, member should not speak disrespectfully of other legislatures in the Commonwealth. Mi-. WEST . ^ As the House of which I am speaking is not elected by the people, I do not regard its members as legislators. tors, and as such are entitled to respect. of that body put forward a scheme for 1,000,000 farms, on which he proposed to settle 1,000,000 people. men who make proposals like that ought to be in mental hospitals. This gentleman is a large land-owner, and some time ago was mixed up in land transactions. There has been more scandal in New South Walesi n connection with land resumption than in connection with any other phase of the State's development. Land has been resumed at a value which rendered it quite impossible for the purchaser to make a livin g on his block, and at the same time pay interest on his capital outlay. We are told by Mr. Allan, the Premier of Victoria, that there is no need for the Migration Commission to look for land in his State, because it is not available. Yet honourable members say that there is any amount of land available in Australia for the settlement of immigrants. It is time steps were taken to make it known overseas that the land is not available for this purpose. people themselves. One Quite recently, some people who are connected with the charity organizations of pelled to seek their assistance were immigrants who had come Ao Australia within the previous twelve months, and that some of them were not mentally fitted to compete w i th Australians in the employment market. Facts like these rivet themselves on my memory, and it is no wonder that I do all I can to prevent people from coming to Australia to occupy the unfortunate position of those I cannot understand who, through their inability to compete w it h active, lively, energetic Australians, are compelled to walk the streets of our cities and be a burden on the benevolent institutions of the States. I come now to the probable cost of the scheme proposed. British manufacturers are always willing to lend money to those countries to which their goods are sent. I have no desire to frighten honourable members, but I think the taxpayers will put an end to the scheme when they realize what it will cost and what damage it will do' to Australia's industries. I presume that the interest payments w ill gradually increase u n t i l the tenth year, when the amount payable will probably be £1,360,000.

We cannot prevent the d r if t to the cities. This House would be wise the British Government a loan of £34,000,000 for immigration purposes. The whole scheme has apparently been undertaken at the instigation of the British Government, which, in view of the difficulties surrounding it in the matter of unemployment in Great Britain, believes that as a result of this agreement it will be relieved of some responsibility. I do not think for a moment that the authorities in Great Britain consider that the scheme will be the success which tJhe Prime Minister and some of his supporters anticipate. spend loan money in bringing new settlers to Australia, as the debt thus incurred will have to be borne by the future generations. adopt the policy of the Labour administration of 1910 to 1913, when over 87,000. immigrants were brought to Australia yearly without the expenditure of one penny of loan money. I inquired if the proposed expenditure could be investigated by the Public Accounts Committee, but was informed that as a question of policy was involved no such investigation could be made by that committee. I desire to remove the impression in the minds of many persons that honourable members on this side of the House are opposed to i m migration in any form. We are only op? posed to immigration schemes under which large numbers of persons are brought to Australia for whom no employment is available on arrival. Wheni n Sydney a few days ago I was informed that from 400 to 500 men were awaiting work where the construction of the Kyogle to South Brisbane railway is to be commenced. Those men are not loafers, as some would suggest, as many of them possess credentials from foremen of government departments or private contractors. A good deal of preliminary work has to be undertaken before a start can be made with the construction of the line. State Government 1 the State Government, as the 'amended agreement submitted by the Minister for Works and Railways( MrH ill ) was only, ratified by this House on Friday last. I am objecting to the action of the Government in bring more people to Australia when so many deserving Australians are vainly seeking work. The proposals of to refuse to accept from the Government are so unsatisfactory that I trust honourable members will oppose the second reading of the bill. -Although this is really a machinery measure it is, I think, one of the most important which has been submitted for the consideration of Parliament. The bill embodies a serious attempt to provide machinery to deal in a practical manner with the population and development of Australia, which are two of the most pressing problems we have to face. Honourable members opposite who have adverI t is a pernicious system to sely criticized the b ill , still appear to be obsessed with the idea that every wage earner brought into this community will be a competitor for work of which they The Government should sav there is insufficient for those already here. The idea rests upon fallacy, as it is a well-known economic maxim that increased population means an increased demand for products of labour, and is a contributing factor to increased general prosperity. to the land. Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON Of course. They must have access to the l a n d ; and in Australia there are millions of acres awaiting development. We cannot expect a community consisting of only a handful * of people to be allowed to continue indefinitely, without molestation, to occupy this vast continent. Hitherto our protection has been the might of the British navy, which alone has stood between us and the danger of losing this country. Our limited population, which occupies only part of the fringe of our coastal area, would be quite inadequate to protect this country against any powerful foreign nation that was looking for vacant land upon which to settle its surplus population. Not far from our shores there are over-peopled countries whose increase is in a very much greater ratio than our own to the area, of the country. The true basis of comparison as to the growth of countries is not the It cannot be the fault of percentages quoted by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley), but a percentage based on the figures showing the increase in population in comparison with the acreage of the country. Judged by that standard, we are in a very serious",46,Second Beading

We must, if we intend to preserve this nation, take effective steps to develop the land of this country and to fill the vast, empty spaces, which are the envy of many people who realize that we have failed to make use of the magnificent heritage which we have received from the British nation. The idea that bringing more workers into the country will prejudice the interests of the wage earners here has been exploded. H a l f a century ago the same idea prevailed in the TJnited States of America. When that country had a population of 25,000,000, attention was drawn to the large numbers of immigrants from Great Britain and other parts of Europe, and the cry was raised by the industrialists that the local labour market was being flooded, and that the chances of employment of American workmen would be proportionately lessened. But when the population had increased to 50,000,000, the general prosperity of the country, and of every individual in it , had relatively increased, and, when the population had increased to 100,000,000. the conditions of industry were better still. factor ? Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON main factor, because every unit added to the population creates a demand for the production of several other units, so that if more units are added to the community the demand for the production of the workers must be increased. fore, the introduction of more labour into a new country, instead of being a menace to the workers, benefits them by increasing the demand, and expanding th« market for their production. migrants are absorbed into industry. agree with those honourable members on this and the Opposition side of the House who hold that we should first provide means of employment for those who are here, and that we should not continue to bring migrants into this country unless we have the means of profitably utilizing their labour. The question of natural opportunity arises here, and in my view the main function of any Government is primarily to see that, so far as possible, equality of natural opportunity is provided for every one; and, secondly, the preservation of law and order and constitutional government on sound principles. I agree with the view that, so long as the natural resources of the country are monopolized by a few persons to the exclusion of those who desire to develop them, so long shall we have to face the problem of poverty of a section of the community; but with equality of opportunity I have no fear of the effects of introducing more labour into this country. I believe that the Government, in bringing forward this bill, is desirous of organizing migration scientifically, and in the best interests of the country. The idea that the British Government is advancing this money merely to get r i d of the unemployed and unemployable of that country, is a mistake. According to the Herald of this evening, that point was raised at the Empire Press Union Migration conference, which is now in session. The report of the proceedings statesThe Dominions Secretary ( Mr L. S. Amery) pointed out that it was a false perspective to regard migration as merely relieving Great Britain's unemployment, which must he solved in Britain. The true basis of partnership of Empire communities was the fully developing of each and not overstocking the I s population the only dominions' labour markets. The press should not paint Eldorados and unduly emphasize failures, but give knowledge interesting to poor It is the men and ambitious middle-class families. Those remarks show that the British Government is alive to the importance of not sending migrants here for the purpose of overstocking our labour market. To do that would be disastrous; Therebut we have our trade unions, which, I should say, can be trusted to look after that aspect of the matter. prevent the labour market from being glutted if migrants are dumped into the country. majority of the migrants who come here will be, of course, wage earners, and will probably be absorbed into the different trade unions, which will then be able to exercise a beneficial influence on the conditions of employment. Further than that, we have our arbitration courts, wages boards, and other tribunals for the regulation of wages and for ensuring to tbe workers a standard of living compatible with the dignity of Australian labour.

The Labour party is accused of being opposed to the development of Australia, yet it stands for a tariff which will do much to make the country self-supporting. By developing our secondary industries, we shall make it possible for large numbers of immigrants to be absorbed. England w ill not rob herself of agricultural workers in order to send them to Australia. Most of those who will come here from the Old Country will be artisans, and if we are to treat them properly we must develop our industries to provide employment for them. Members of the Labour party love their country, and desire to see it expand and progress. No one knows better than does the honourable member for Wakefield, who has been in the political life of South Australia for many years, that in the early .days of the Labour party in that State it advocated the subdivision of large estates. The honourable member for Wakefield must admit that it was the agitation by the Labour party for the bursting up of large estates, and the force of public opinion behind their policy, that led to thousands of contented families being settled on country formerly used for raising a few sheep.

How was this country first colonized? Captain Cook took possession of it in the name of the' King, and, later, its value as a place for the investment of the surplus wealth of GreatB r it a in was realized. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) w ill recollect an estate in South Australia that was administered by the late Mr C. C. Kingston and his brother. In the early days of Australian colonization two old ladies, conducting a little store in Shoreditch, sent out £25 or £30 to be invested in land in South Australia. A portion of the land they acquired is in the suburb in which I live. The story of the unearned increment of that investment reads like a f a i r y tale. The original investors never came to Australia, nor did the following generation, and the third generation, who also are absentee landlords, are still drawing a huge revenue from it . Australia was not settled by GreatB r itain under any definite scheme of colonization and development. tion that GreatB r it a in gave to us with what we might have received from France or Germany. ber is asking me whether I would sooner be a foreigner or a Britisher, I must proclaim my loyalty to the race to which I belong; and if our virtues are to be measured by other people's vices, some of us may be classed as angels. Australia was annexed to the British Empire, but no set scheme of development was propounded; no special inducements were offered to people ' to come here and settle. But when cheap labour was required, the Old CountryI am not prepared to sent'out convicts, and a lot of good men went to their graves bearing unjustly the brand of the criminal. to South Australia. tralia generally. W ill the honourable member deny that the manner of AusI am as loyal to the tralia's colonization was such as I have of my birth as is any perdescribed? B y the labour of the convicts, and the initiative and energy of the pioneers, we have built Up a nation that is Great Britain's second-best customer. Each year we send to her from £20,000,000 to £30,000,000 as interest on loans in addition to the amount paid to keep her factories going and to alleviate the problem of unemployment. When we ask GreatB r it a in to protect Australia, are we not asking her to' safeguard her own interests? I s a British squadron maintained in the China Sea for the protection of Chinamen? No: it is to protect the moneyed interests of Great Britaini n the Orient, and surely we, as scions of the British race, have at least a sentimental claim upon the guardianship of . the Mother Country should trouble arise. The statement that we are under an obligation to the British Fleetf o r the protection it gives to us w ill not stand analysis in the light of common sense and f a i r play. Has not Australia played its part in tbe Empire's bothers and troubles? When the Soudan trouble occurred, Australia did not stand aloof; it could not do much, but, in proportion to its resources, it sent a contingent to help the Mother Country.

214,Mr Yates,"I am speaking of AusBritain, and our Own people incurred a debt of £300,000,000, tbe interest on which will be for many years a burden upon them. The honourable member for .Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson) may say that we cannot expect the British Navy to stand by us always; but Great Britain would bring eternal infamy upon herself if she allowed Australia to be menaced by any other country. When honourable members speak as they do about the defence of Australia, their tongues are in their cheeks; they have in mind the White Australia policy. If I understand the feeling of our people, that policy is to be maintained, and those with whom we are associated must be made to recognize that we have borne the heat and burden of the day to make this country worthwhile for the white races. ber surely does not claim that the Labour party is the only one that has stood for a White Australia? MrY ATE SI No; but it is the only party that has not at some time either opposed that policy or The Labour party stands for a White Australia, and for the maintenance and, if possible, the improvement of the conditions obtaining in Australia. If there is any opposition to that policy, it does not come from us. honourable members opposite, but from their supporters. that statement, because, although I have attended many conferences of the Labour party-Federa l and StateI have never yet heard any serious argument raised at those conferences against the development of Australia under the White Australia policy, or any statement that the application of that policy is likely to bring about vide £200,000,000, and had the war conthe dire results forecast by honourable members on the other side of the House. I do not approve of any portion of the agreement with the British Government. I am opposed to the principle of borrowing money outside the Commonwealth, because I claim that, if it is necessary to borrow money for the purpose of settling immigrants on. land in Australia, the money should be raised in Australia. If the people in Australia who have money to invest will not lend it for that purpose, then I suggest that we should establish credits, as was done when the safety of the Empire was threatened. It is useless to say that it cannot be done. People can do anything they make up their minds to do. When the first war loan was proposed to be raised in Australia, we were rather timid as to what could be done. Mr Fisher, the then Prime Minister, was afraid to go ahead. As a matter of fact, the circumstances were sufficient to shake the confidence of any man in a proposal to create credits in the name of the nation. However, he conferred with the leading financiers of the various States in connection with his proposal to borrow £20,000,000 locally, and he was advised by them to take the money in instalments of £5,000,000, as they were required. The idea was supposed to be a good one, because it was considered that, by the time the first £5,000,000 had been spent, the money having percolated through the ordinary channels of trade, would again be available for investment. Mr Fisher adopted the proposal, and Parliament accepted it . A t that time, the damned it with faint praise. right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) declared that Mr Fisher was well advised to accept the advice of the bankers to take his loan in £5,000,000 instalments, for the reason that there was not £20,000,000 of working capital in ihe Commonwealth. He said that if £20,000,000 were obtained from Australian investors, it would mean the destruction of commerce, aud would result in industrial chaos. Events proved that, although the right honourable gentleman had, a few months earlier, been Treasurer in the State of Victoria, he knew nothing of the financial resources of the Commonwealth. The very source from which he said £20,000,000 could not be obtained was subsequently able to protinued for another' nine months, could have provided another £200,000,000. However, I am suggesting now that if it is neeessary to borrow money to place people on the land, we should borrow the money locally, and engage Australians to construct roads and bridges at the rates at which immigrants are to be employed. If , then, we need more people, we can easily open the doors, aud give them any assistance we think necessary.",55,Second Beading

He was then State Treasurer. but necessity knows no law. The money, may not have been available when the right honourable member for Balaclava tried to get it in London, but what happened during the financial deadlock, when,, at the outbreak of war, the Bank of England and other banks closed their doors? The British Governmeut issued a paper currency, using thc credit of the nation to support it . In the same way, in Australia, we utilized the credit of the nation to enable us to carry on the war, and I am suggesting that we should do it again for the development of Australia. some day. come when we shall adopt that sensible course. A few weeks ago, a visitor to Australia said that ours was a land of borrow or burst. We are placing an' enormous burden on posterity. We are anxious to develop Australia, to people it , aud to make the progress that rightly we should make, but there are other means of doing it than by going cap in hand to the British money lenders as we have been doing in the past, W h y cannot we utilize the money we arc borrowing to place our own citizens on the land, particularly those men who went overseas to fight for us, or their sons? No t unti l we have opened up profitable avenues of employment, should we invite immigrants from Great Britain to come here to enjoy our prosperity. I have tried to visualize in what way we can effectively settle immigrants in this country. There is only one scheme that is likely to be of any use, and that is the group settlement scheme that has been adopted in Western Australia. The Premier of South Australia ( Mr Gunn) was very timorous about the migration agreement. appointed three commissioners, including an official from Roseworthy College and the Secretary for Lands in South Australia. They were sent throughout the length and breadth of South Australia to ascertain what land was available for settlement. I do not think that their report has yet been submitted. visualizing the situation, the only available land for settlement is in the outback country, and the bulk of it would show a loss on the first three years' operations. We have had the experience of our soldier settlements. We borrowed and T h a t is quite possible, spent millions of money on that scheme; and what is the position to-day 1 We are writing off millions of pounds. Some of thp RfittlemHTits have benn successful, bui there is no market for the produce. We are up against a blank wall respecting the soldier settlement scheme. I ask any honourable member supporting the Government to put forward a concrete and sound scheme of land settlement. Our returned soldiers were fleeced in respect of the prices that they paid for their land. They were fleeced by the patriots who flag-waved them when they went to the war. In the district.represented by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) £ 1 1 8s. an acre was the minimum price obtained for the Canowie estate, and the great bulk of that land was I hope the day w ill soon bought by the persons who lived adjacent to it . turned soldiers, the Beerburrum lands? ' Government of South Australia bought land known as The Pinery at £ 2 1 an. acre. A valuer was called in , and he assessed it at £ 6 an acre. He reported that it was too wet for farming, and too dry for fishing. The sale of the Beerburrum land . may be a similar instance of imposition. The man who sold Tho Pinery"" sold "" the returned soldiers. If ' we make a success of settling strangers on the land and a failure of settling our returned men, we shall be disgraced in the eyes of the world for all time. The Labour party is not opposed to the prin ciple of immigration, but before we agree to the bill we' should like to know whether better methods of settlement are to be adopted, and whether the people who come out here to go on the land will be thrown on the industrial market, and He thus accentuate unemployment.

Ordered to be printed. That the House do now adjourn. I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government has yet come to a decision in regard to the payment of a bounty on Queensland cotton. I have received a letter from the secretary of the Central Queensland District Council of Agriculture, in which he statesThe District Council regrets that the announcement is so long delayed, as the delay threatens to have an effect on the acreage to be planted during the coming season. It is now that preparations. for planting' should be made in order that a good seed bed might be in readiness to receive early planting. With the air of indefmiteness as to what might be offered in the shape of a bounty, caution will certainly be exercised by the growers in determining the acreage to prepare. This matter is of great importance to central Queensland, which produces 75 per cent, of the cotton grown in Australia. The cotton growers naturally want a definite pronouncement from the ' Government respecting what bounty it is prepared to give them. The Government announced when the session opened, in it s . policy speech that it had decided to substitute a bounty for the guaranteed price. There is no justification for the delay, because the Tariff Board submitted its report on this subject nearly two months ago. and the Government has since had the matter in hand. As a representative of the cotton growers in Queensland, Z ask the Prime Minister to disclose his intentions,if not now, at least within a few days. ister *nd Minister for External Affairs) f 11.01 I have already informed the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr. Forde') and other honourable members representing Queensland who have raised this question, that the Government is at present giving the most careful consideration to the payment of a bounty on cotton.

I have received constant representations from Queensland senators and from members of the House of Representatives-particularly the honourable member for Moreton( MrJ .
