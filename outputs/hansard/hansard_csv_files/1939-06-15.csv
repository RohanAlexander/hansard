S » HENRYGULLETT I was asked by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) on the 9th June, whether the Government would indicate its views on Australia's interest in the proposed Anglo-iSoviet agreement in Europe and the relation of such an agreement to the countries bordering the Pacific. From the beginning of the negotiations for the inclusion of Soviet Russia in the European anti-aggression group, it was clear that the effects which an eventual agreement might have on Japan could not be disregarded. This was especially so when a stage was reached which envisaged a direct defensive agreement between the United Kingdom and the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics. As I have already stated, the Commonwealth Government has expressed its support of the efforts of the United Kingdom Government to secure Russian participa15 June, 19S9. tion ou the most effective terms possible, and this support extends to the conclusion of a direct defensive agreement. effective terms Russia would accept!

7,Sir Henry Gullett,"Not at all.which the settlement of recognized differences by discussion and not by force or under the threat of force is the ruling principle, the political and economic benefit will be felt in every part of t.he world. Out, of such a settlement Japan cannot fail to secure profound general relief. It is certain that Great Britain and France and the countries associated with them in these endeavours will never commit any act of aggression or attempt by any means to offer hostile obstruction to the legitimate aims of any State. It has been emphasized that the present efforts are not an attempt to "" encircle "" any particular country, and allegations to this effect are entirely without foundaJapanese. erected live-wire and bar.bedtion. It is in this light that the Commonwealth Government regards its own relations with the countries bordering the Pacific, in particular, Japan. The objective of the establishment of an enduring peace, the Govermnent is. convinced, is best advanced under conditions of stability and order 'between the great powers. In giving its support to the present efforts in Europe of the Government, of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth Government feels confident that this will prove the quickest and most effective way to forward its own policy of peace in the Pacific region. the honourable member for Deakin( Mr British Concession, at .Tientsin is not, in Hutchinson) asked me a question concerning Japanese actions in Tientsin. The Commonwealth Government has had no official information regarding recent events there, hut it is clear from press reports that a situation has arisen which threatens a serious clash .between British and Japanese interests. . As the result of the murder last April of a Chinese official in the Japanese-controlled administration, the Japanese military authorities at Tientsin demanded the surrender from the British Concession of four Chinese alleged to be responsible .for the murder. This demand has been refused on the ground that no evidence has been forthcoming against these individuals and that therefore their surrender would create a_ precedent detrimental to British influence in all of the China treaty ports. The Japanese have now announced their intention of instituting a blockade of both the. British and French Concessions.. Tha blockade is said to be intended to bring, to a standstill, external trade, to prevent, exit or entrance except for official purposes, and to cut off. everything except supplies of food. This situation''is the latest example of methods employed by the Japanese military authorities who control Tientsin,which have heen a source of friction from the time the city was first occupied in the course of the present hostilities. It will be recalled that' in February last the wire fences around the British Concession/while for many months British com-, mercial interests at Tientsin have been consistently hampered, Thje Government of the United Kingdom,, ori the necessary occasions, has protested strongly to >the Japanese Government against these measures, and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs again declared on the 12th June, that the Government *of the United .Kingdom was not indifferent to such treatmentof ""British interests by the Japanese. He added that, the Govern^ ment could hot forget the rights which had been acquired for -British nationals under .treaty and-could not. accept the Japanese excuse that ,the measures taken were necessary on military .grounds. It can be said that the hostility displayed by the. Japanese against the fact, justified by any action or inaction oh the part of the British authorities. Inhabitants of the' Concession were, indeed, recently reminded by the Municipal Council of their duty to maintain strict neutrality through the present conflict, and the Japanese have not been aible to produce any evidence to support their charges that the Concession is being used as a base for anti-Japanese activities."" I may add that the Commonwealth Government is making inquiries from the Australian Government Trade Commissioner at Shanghai as to the recent developments. It is understood that there are no specific Australian local interests at Tientsin, .but a considerable volume of Australian exports to China, particularly flour, has for some time been passing through the port.'",10,Anglo Russi An Negotiation S

I propose to give a comparison in order to show that the number of unemployed is gradually overtaking our previous record in this respect. Apparently the Government will refuse to budge until the position becomes so serious that it will be forced to take action. Even then it will go only so far as to help the States to supplement their provisions in respect of the dole and relief work. We shall never make any substantial contribution towards the solution of this problem by tinkering with it in this fashion. The figures supplied by the trade union organizations for the December quarter of .1.987 show the percentage of unemployed as 8.7 and the number of trade unionists as 37,558. For the March quarter of 1939 the percentage of unemployed was 9.S and the number of trade unionists registered as unemployed was 46,611. showing that within fifteen months the percentage of unemployed increased by '.I -.6. The actual increase of the number of unemployed is approximately 35,000. That is an alarming position and this Government will be recreant to its trust if it does not give the serious position revealed by those figures immediate consideration. To-day there are approximately 200,000 persons unemployed in Australia, and as the census figures reveal that there are usually four times as many out of employment as are disclosed in the trade unions' returns, the position is extremely serious. It is remarkable that in the sister Dominion of New Zealand there is no unemployment problem. Indeed there is an increasing demand for additional manpower, particularly skilled artisans, to carry out the important work which the Labour Government in that country has in hand. It is to be regretted that this Government cannot adopt a policy under which greater economic security can be given to the industrial section of the community. Moreover, the Government of New Zealand has sought the services of persons in other dominions, including Australia, to assist it in providing better wool prices are very low the community housing accommodation and in generally improving the facilities of the people. vernment is taking hundreds of men from morning I desire to place the position of this country. unemployed in Australia is increasing. There must be a striking difference between the policy adopted by the Labour Government in New Zealand and that of the Dnited Australia party in Australia. The first and chief responsibility of a government is to ensure a happy and contented community, and the second is to provide a strong, virile race. Such conditions are essential in any country, and they can be secured by honouring the promises made by this Government. It has been said that this Government, like the one which preceded it, believes in full-time employment, improved honsing conditions, and generally a higher standard of living. Those engaged in the industrial life of this country have a right to some economic security, but many who are in permanent employment overlook the hopeless position of others engaged in ordinary industrial pursuits who are always wondering how long their job is likely to last, and, if they should lose it, when they will get another. There is no economic security for the average working man. The Government should make an immediate attempt to improve the industrial position at the earliest possible moment, as has been promised by the Prime Minister and other members of the Government.

A comlow price of wool, there is a gap between pensating aspect of the present, condition the cost of production and the price of the wool market, is that while the price realized which renders the position inf f wool is low its use tends to be extended creasingly difficult, During the last ten Sir Marie Page. of interest charges as compared with ten wool were sold for £33,900,000, and in committee, dustry can meet the market by selling That committee consisted of The only occasion on which there has Australian whole clip during the war period. During into account interest fact that countries such as Germany, wool and other commodities. and the product is better placed to compete with substitutes; but, of course, the iudustry cannot be carried on when the price of the product is less than the cost of production. What does the future hold? If war comes, there will be no question that the wool industry will receive a tremendous impetus because of the demand for wool for the manufacture of uniforms and other war equipment; but if war does not come, and we all, naturally, hope that it does not, what will happen? International trade must sooner or later be restored and wool will be absorbed at better prices with a general return of prosperity; but restoration of trade will not occur spontaneously with a restoration of international goodwill. It can only be brought about by arrangement of trade treaties between the different countries, country by country. The most important Australia agreement, so far as the Australian wool . trade is concerned, is the United States of duced by 50 per cent, to, say, 17 cents per America. Australia and the United States of America would ensure a large increase of the total world trade in wool, because, despite the fact that the United States of America has a bigger national income per capita, both absolutely and relatively, than any other country the per capita use of wool in that country, the winter climate of a great part of which is inclement, is small, about one-third of that of Great Britain and about one-half of that of Australia, a much warmer country generally than the United States of America. That state of affairs is due largely to the fact that the United States of America has high import duties against raw wool and manufactured woollen goods. Attempts are now being made to reduce those duties. The Anglo-American agreement has been instrumental in' reducing duties and the price of the manufactured article. If the American duties on Australian wool can be reduced I believe that it will be a good thing-for 'both countries. The relatively' low consumption of wool in the United States of America is largely due to the fact that high duties are imposed upon both the raw material and the finished woollen products. These high duties have been considerably reduced, in respect of some items by the AngloAmerican trade treaty, and this must result in an increased use of British manufactured woollen goods in the United States of America and also in increased efficiency of the American manufacturers. The biggest obstacle to the encouragement of the wide use of woollen goods in the United States of America, however, is the prohibitive duty of 34 cents per lb. on raw wool imported into the United States of America. The duty is equivalent to I7d. per lb. sterling and represents about 200 per cent, on the present price of Australian wool. Every one will agree -that such a high duty must inevitably defeat the aims of the protectionist policy of a country. The Lyons Government attempted to negotiate an AustralianAmerican treaty with the object of assisting the people of the United States of country with which America 'to obtain cheaper and better could reacha trade woollen goods. We suggested that the duty on the raw material should be reA trade agreement between lb. which is equivalent to 8£d. per lb. sterling. Our request was stated in these apparently modest terms for the reason that the President of the United States of America cannot, under his treaty-making powers, agree to a reduction of more than 50 per cent, of the existing duties in any treaty that he negotiates. However, a reduction to 100 per cent, of the duty ou Australian wool would have a good effect, which would be shown in the price of clothing and woollen goods generally in the United States of America. It would undoubtedly lead to the increased use of wool by the lower paid and poorer people of the United States of America. . If the consumption of wool in the United States of America could be increased from 4 lb. a head, which is the present figure, to 5 lb. a head, which would still be only half the average Australian consumption, it would represent an increase of between 400,000 and 500,000 bales of wool. If the Australian graziers could place that increased quantity of wool on the American market it would undoubtedly rehabilitate the industry and stabilize prices. I therefore ask the Government to do these three things: First, to grant the request of the wool industry for an inquiry into the whole situation by the Tariff Board, thus enabling those engaged in the industry to state their case fully and publicly; secondly, to give an assurance that no fresh taxation will be imposed upon those engaged in the pastoral industry while they are in their present dilemma; and, thirdly, to push on with the negotiation of treaties with the United States of America, Japan, and other countries which are great users of wool. If these steps are taken it will undoubtedly have the result of restoring the health of our great woollen industry which has been the basic foundation of Australian development. pressed condition of the woollen industry must cause a serious loss of employment in practically every other Australian industry because it involves such a heavy reduction of the purchasing power of our people. propose to say a few words on this Supply Bill, which, as honourable members know, is a bill to grant authority to the Governwarning is a hardening of the rate of ment to spend the revenues for three months of next year ibefore Parliament meets again.

A Australia. big item, and, because expenditure on defence is so readily agreed to by all sechow great a check is being kept on the tions of the community, a great financial danger is created.

Without any carping criticism, I think that experience has shown to us that the military, naval or air force mind is not an economic or careful mind. The training of military and naval men is training of destruction and not of economy or of construction. I recall that in the depth of the depression A continuation of the deI experienced difficulty as Prime Minister in obtaining anything like a reasonable approach to economy in the Defence Department. We made economies in that department! Some of the extravagances were obvious. One, for example, was in the cost of training the few army and navy officers that were being turned out. That was altered. I am not satisfied that we are not starting again on the wrong track. Another matter about which I issue a interest. These are ominous signs of which heed must be taken. Every precaution must be taken to prevent the rates of interest from rising. A high rate of interest is a real death blow to all enterDefence expenditure is the question which should he considered at the next meeting of the Loan Council is borrowings by authorities outside the Loan Council. That sort of borrowing is increasing and it can be asked whether the Loan Council is being too lenient in its dealings with outside bodies. I am not advocating that we should curtail useful and necessary works, because such works provide employment; but we must ensure, particularly in defence works, that we are. getting value for every pound that we spend. Loan Councili f it does not control borrowings? has the power to control, and 1 suggest that it should exercise that power.

75,Mr Scullin,"The Loan Councilincreased taxation and credit expansion. I am not altogether quarreling with three of these methods, but with overseas borrowing I do quarrel. I believe that loan flotations on the overseas market are only meant to cloak the fall of our London funds. I submit that our London funds should not be bolstered by borrowing overseas. checked and regulated by regulation of the imports of this country. That is the only sound way in which the London fund can be handled and controlled Credit expansion for useful work and utilization of idle resources and manpower can be quite sound and eminently desirable. Labour and material that are unemployed can be converted by a method of credit expansion into production of goods which, if pace is kept with the expansion, will not produce inflation, that munity. What the banks do is to create is, inflation of prices, which is the only serious thing that we have to consider; for every honourable gentleman knows that inflation of prices is really a reduchere, only the other day in the course of tion of the standard of living of the people, in that it reduces the purchasing power because of the increased prices of the goods that have to be purchased. Methods can be used for credit expansion by the central bank, the Commonwealth Bank, going on the market and buying bonds, by drawing cheques against itself. Those cheques find their way to the private banks. We find in the financial columns of the newspapers that the cheques are being utilized by the private banks to build up cash reserves and on that basis to create further credit for themselves. That is what we have to watch. We must ensure that the credit the Commonwealth Bank creates will not be used by the private banks to create more credits and more profits for themselves. If credit on the overseas loan the Prime Minister expansion is to be used for useful purposes it should be used only by the public authority of the Commonwealth, namely the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank may charge the same rate of interest as the private banks, but it is only a book-keeping entry. The profits made by the Commonwealth Bank go back to the people in many ways. Buti f the credit expansion of the Commonwealth Bank is merely to increase the basis for further credit creation by the private banks at higher and ever-increasing rates of interest, we shall not derive much advantage from credit expansion as a means to finance government. I repeat that credit expansion for useful works to utilize the unemployed and the idle material resources is sound and desirable and, to the limit that it is sound That fund should be and desirable, it can be utilized, but not as I say by the banks, private and otherwise, to implement an inflationary policy to the detriment of the standard of living of the workers of this country. A safeguard against that would be comprehensive banking legislation. The private banks have too much freedom in the creation of money, really, because the creation of credit means the creation of money, although I do not actually subscribe to that phrase. Credit belongs not to the banks, but to the individual or the combank credit against the nation's credit or the individual's credit and get a pretty big reward for doing so. It has been said debate, and over and over again, that local expenditure, whether it be for defence or for anything else, comes from the production of the country. Of course, overseas borrowing comes from the production and everything else of the people overseas. the other fellow's assets? assets you have credit. However, I am not embarking on a dissertation on that question. I raise these matters as a. warning that we should not get into the wrong channel in pursuing a desirable course. Last week when there was a discussion ( Mr Menzies) made an extraordinary statement, particularly, for a Prime Minister and Treasurer. He said that had the Labour party been in oflice the loan would not have been underwritten. When he was asked to produce authority for that statement, after having had a few minutes for reflection, he said that no authority whatever had come to him from the underwriters, but that he had made the statement on the basis of the known facts of Labour's financial record. At this stage I am not concerned about",20,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40
76,Mr Beaslet,I s that not credit on,21,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40
77,Mr Scullltsr,"Yes, if you have the party aspect; what concerns me is the national aspect. The repercussion from a statement like that is serious from the point of view of a nation's credit. It only needs a statement such as that made by the Prime Minister, to the effect tliat a change of government might result in loans not being underwritten at all, to destroy the credit of this nation overseas; I regret that, and I emphasize its importance because it is essential that the good name of our country should be preserved here and abroad. I remind the right honourable gentleman that his statement was aimed at a potential government of this country, and for that reason, it strikes at the very root of the good name and credit of Australia. In answer to that statement. I wish to place on record the loans undertaken hy the Labour Government which were not only underwritten, but were also actually floated successfully. In 1929, the Scullin Government floated a £10,000,000 loan for public works. In 1930 it floated another ioan of £12,440,000 for public works, and in the same year, two conversion loans' amounting to £78,000,000 were successfully undertaken. I point out that these loans I have mentioned were carried out in the depression year of 1930. In 1931, the Labour Government undertook a conversion loan of £536,000,000, at an interest rate which represented a reduction of 22i per cent. That loan was successful'! and it was the biggest financial undertaking up to that date in the history of the world. The honourable! son) referred to this gigantic undertaking and claimed that it had been supported by all parties in this House. I submit that that is not an effective answer. A Labour government was in office, ancl had that government not had the confidence of people, it could not have accomplished what it did. The effect of that huge conversion loan was a saving of £7,600,000 a year to the Commonwealth and State Governments as well as a saving in private loans. Up.to date, approximately £60,000,000 has been saved to the governments of this country by that transaction. In addition to the loans I have already mentioned, in 1930 the Labour Government successfully conr verted a. small £3,750,000 loan overseas. Jl/r. Scullin. At times such as this nothing should be said that might seriously affect Australia's good name in the future, because within the next four years loans amounting to £40,000,000 will fall due, and will be subject to conversion. Party politics should not be allowed to enter into this matter, because Australia's credit and reputation might be seriously impaired. listened with interest to the informative speech made by the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), and I should like to follow up some bf his arguments. I agree with the right honourable gentleman that we should hesitate before embarking upon a heavy loan programme abroad. I wish to deal particularly with semi-governmental borrowings, because in this matter we have reached a serious stage. I do not, in any way, protest against the spending of loan money by the semi-governmental bodies, because possibly they are in a better position to spend the money more effectively than the Commonwealth or State Governments, but I wish to draw attention to another aspect'of the matter. Under the Financial Agreement Act the Loan Council meets every year to consider proposals advanced by the various State governments for the expenditure of loan money during the ensuing year The Loan Council considers the applications made, and ascertains what amount of money can be borrowed at what might be regarded as a satisfactory rate of interest. What is considered to be an equable distribution of the available loan funds is then made to the States. It is possible, however, for States to accept the decision of the Loan Council with regard to the allocation of funds, but then immediately to speed up semi governmental borrowings with the result that there is in reality no equable distribution of loan expenditure throughout Australia. Let me indicate just how serious this matter has become. In 1934-35, the borrowings of semi-governmental bodies in Australia amounted to £6,308,000. By 1937-38, the total had grown to £15,539,000. As a matter of fact, in 1937-38, borrowings by semi governmental bodies, exceeded that arranged for the State governments by the Loan Council. That is the serious aspect which I wish to emphasize. I",21,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40
78,Member For New England ( Mr Thomp,,22,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40
79,Mr Jolly (Lilley) [12.25],"I have referred to this matter on numerous occasions, and, in fact, as far back as 1927, when I was Lord Mayor of Brisbane, I urged that semi-governmental borrowing should come within the jurisdiction of the Loan Council. Competition on the loan market between semi-governmental bodies has the eflect of increasing the rate of interest on money available to the Loan Council on public loans generally, and unless some definite action is immediately taken to deal with this inatter, the operations and objectives of the Loan Council will become futile. To-day we have the spectacle of semi-governmental borrowings amounting to more than is actually borrowed by the Loan Council. of interest. this matter in 1927, and the then Premier of Queensland promised that he would have the matter brought before the Loan Council at an early date. agreed that it was in the best interests of the people of Australia that something should he done. The position is even more serious to-day. interest rates is not, solely confined to public borrowing. job of borrowing money on the public market in 1927, when the Brisbane City Council endeavoured to raise £1,000,000. We were told to keep off the Australian market and we had to go to America to get the money. Had we insisted on raising the money in Australia, thc result would have been an increase of the interest rate on money made available to the Loan Council, meaning, in effect, an increase of the interest rate generally. I hope that the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Spp.nder) will indicate later on how the amount of money at present being ;isked for compares with last year's total. eS.S24.000, including a Treasurer's Advance of £2,000,000 only. An additional £500,000 for Treasurer's Advance was made in September of last year. usual custom to introduce a supply bill providing for the carrying on of the caxm try's services from the end of the financial year until September, 1 suggest that when it is introduced, corresponding figures for the previous year should be given. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the Auditor-jGeneral's report, I regret exceedingly that this House has not been given an opportunity to discuss that report, which deals with important aspects of public finance. Members of this House did not receive the report for the year ended June, 1938, until May of this year. That is a very unfortunate state of .affairs, and I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) if he would take steps to ensure that in future the Auditor General's report for a financial year was made available before the budget for thc ensuing year was disposed of. An item in the latest report, to which 1 wish to refer, is that referring toinvalid pensions in New South Wales. Not only in this report, but in previous reports also, the Auditor-General has He drawn attention to the fact that invalid pensions in New South Wales were out of all proportion to those in other States. He points out that, at the 30th June, 1938, there were 149 invalid pensioners in hardening of New South Wales for each 10,000 of population, whereas the average of other States was only 109. It appears to me that there is a different basis of examination of applicants for invalid pensions in New South Wales from that in other States, because the Auditor-General has suggested that a permanent medical officer be appointed to examine applicants in that State. I should like to know whether or not any action has been taken as the result of the Auditor-General's comment. I do not suggest that the applications in New South Wales are unduly high, but I do think that the whole of Australia is entitled to be put. on the same basis. I point out that of a total of 86,000 invalid pensioners in the Commonwealth, approximately 40,000, nearly 50 per cent., are in New South Wales. I trust that the Minister will see that some attention is paid to this matter. I should like to make an appeal to the Minister in connection with the proportion of money to be spent in the various States on public works during the coming financial year. I. realize, of course, that, the",22,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

I urge, however, that in the preparation of the budget for public works this year, some favorable consideration should be given to the other States to ensure that, as far as possible, there will be an equable distribution throughout the whole of Australia. That is essential, in the interests of the balanced development of this, country.

I am sorry that the Government has not yet announced its intentions in regard to the proposed reconstitution of the Public Accounts Committee, concerning which I have a motion on the notice paper. mittee will be reconstituted soon after .Parliament re-assembles after the recess. statement. It is impossible, under existing conditions, to consider the budget calmly, either during the budget debate or while the Estimates are under discussion, and unquestionably all such expenditure should be examined carefully. I agree with the right honourable member for Yarra that a closer examination is desirable of the various items of our huge defence expenditure. I am pleased that the Government proposes to reconstitute the Public Accounts Committee. The occasion of the introduction of a Supply Bill gives members an opportunity to discuss a variety of subjects. I have a notice on the business-paper relating to the appointment of a select committee to inquire into anomalies in the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. As it will not be possible for private members' business to be discussed prior to the coming recess, I take this opportunity to make some general observations upon the whole subject. I might use as a text for my speech the following paragraph which appeared in the leading article of a Melbourne newspaper last weekThe Ministry of the day is the. lender of tlic House, it is true; but it should not attempt to be its driver. The power of members to criticize Government, proposals and to submit amendments presupposes a right not only to have their criticisms respected but also to have their amendments accepted if such amendments be inspired by fairness and buttressed by sound logic. The subject of repatriation is above party considerations. It is a very human matter. I say this advisedly because when it was discussed very briefly recently honourable members of all parties I had in view. I have no desire, in this connection, to attack either the Government, the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Harrison), or the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia. I know that my desires can 'be achieved only by legislative action. The Minister cannot, of himself, rectify my complaints. I was Minister for Repatriation for an all-too-brief period, I am sorry to say, hut I know that any Minister who holds that portfolio is more of a rubber stamp than any other Minister. He cannot make changes. He can only follow the course .that has been set. Changes must be made by legislative action. Successive governments have administered the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act fairly generously ; but, unfortunately, the measure is, in many respects, out of date. It has been amended from time to time and I myself have'taken part in the introduction of a number of reforms; but its terms are altogether too rigid for present day conditions. While they might have been suitable to the circumstances of 1919-20, they are entirely unsuited to those of to-day when many ex-soldiers, well into middle age, are finding great difficulty in establishing that the various shall deal with one only. I ailments in respect of which they are making applications for pensions can be really attached to war causes. A certain amount of misunderstanding has occurred in respect of what I desire to do. It might have been thought that I hnve taken this matter out of the hands of those who should be dealing with it. But a private member of Parliament has",23,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

88,Mr White (Balaclava) [12.35],"his rights, and has a definite responsibility to correct injustices if he can. I am a member of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia and of some other ex-soldier organizations, and know what good work the league has done for returned men. I am also one of the founders and a pastpresident of the Legacy Club, which has been a buttress for the league and has also done a great deal for the dependants of ex-soldiers. In addition, as w i th every other honourable member, I receive numerous letters in the course of the year concerning anomalies in our repatriation procedure. It is to adjust these matters that I have taken certain action in the approved parliamentary way. indicative of the anomalies that need attention, I shall mention some specific items. Aft e r hearing what. I have to say I am sure that all honorable members will agree that justifiable grounds exist for asking for the appointment of a hon-party select committee to inquire into and report upon the whole subject. First let me direct attention to the following statement issued by the Victorian branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia under date the 29th May, 1939 :Select Committee on Repatriation -Sub branches will have read that the League is opposed to the setting up of a Select Committee to examine the Eepatriation Aot in connection with reported anomalies The suggestion is opposed because it can be a two-edged sword. Not every member of Parliament has a proper appreciation of the needs and claims of the ex-soldier. Very few have anything but a cursory knowledge of the act. Recommendations based on cloudy knowledge might be dangerous; thc League would prefer to be without them. In any case, the League itself is constantly making recommendations and these recommendations are adopted from time to time as circumstances permit. Since 1920 there has hardly been a year without some additional repatriation benefit being made available-consequen t upon League representations, and upon a need being disclosed by League representatives. Honourable members and many returned soldiers w ill disagree with the opinion expressed in that memorandum, knowing that my intention is not to .take away benefits, but to obtain recommendations for a better deal for returned soldiers under the Repatriation Act. Although we are aware of the good work that the the league has done, it is a fact that at present it represents less than half, of the ex-soldiers in our community. I admit that it is an authoritative body, yet some of its sub-branches and numerous returned soldiers, in letters to members and the press, disagree with the views expressed by the federal president in his letter to the Prime Minister, as well as the statement. I have read. This divergence of opinion alone emphasizes .the need for inquiry by the proposed select committee. One matter that I wish to have investigated is the position of soldiers suffering from tuberculosis. The anomalies in the Repatriation Act with respect to these men are remarkable. In As this connection I direct attention to the following statement that has been signed by a large number of ex-soldiers at Cresswell State Sanatorium at Mont. ParkThis is to certify that the soldiers whose signatures are hereon are all inmates of thc Cresswell State Sanatorium, Mont Park. Wo consider even though absolute proof may not be forthcoming, that we should receive the benefit of any doubts regarding OUT tubercular state as due to war service. At present most of us are practically destitute excepting for the usual invalid pension. After our discharge, if at all, from Cresswell is it right and just that we should be thrown on the mercy of the world next door to penniless after our honest duty for King and Country? After all the promises of sincerity made on . our behalf, does it not seem unjust that because of some technical point which we have no power of surmounting we should be turned down for a war pension?/ The financial worry alone is enough to retard our progress towards the return to health and strength. We appeal for renewed efforts and sympathy on our behalf. I have in my hand my acknowledgment to the above, sent to the name heading the list at Creswell State Sanatorium, Mont Park. The letter was returned to me unclaimed because the unfortunate addressee had died before it could be delivered. I have no desire to harrow the feelings of honourable members by discussing, in too much detail, the nature of the anomalies that need rectifying ; but I urge that these should he made the subject of early investigation by a. select committee. Another anomaly relates to men who served in places where it was difficult to keep a. complete record of their medical history. units had no trouble at all in this regard. Every cold and minor ailment could be easily noted, but men who were serving in places remote from head-quarters often ignored those matters or found difficulty in having them recorded. When they were demobilized and had put aside their khaki they thought they had done with the whole busiuess; but now that they have reached middle age and feel their disabilities, they realize the difficulties that confront them in showing that it is "" due to war service "". honourable member desires the onus of proof to be placed upon the department. ought also to be a presumptive section in the act. This is particularly desirable so that the widows of ex-soldiers who apply for the widows' pension may be able to substantiate their claims to a widow's pension of two guineas a week. Under present circumstances, unless they can support their claim with a certain amount of documentary evidence, which, in many instances, it is impossible for them to obtain, they must be satisfied for the rest of their lives with their portion of the war or service pension of their deceased husbands, which amounts to only 17s. a week for the service pension and may be considerably less if a war pension. In all the circumstances, such treatment is often unjust and paltry. Another class of ex-service men who find difficulty in attaching their disabilities to war causes are tliose who were prisoners of war. Having been one, although I have suffered less, I sympathize with these men greatly. It may surprise some honourable members to know that 4,104 Australians were made prisoners of war. Of that number 3,861 were imprisoned in Germany, where 385 died. A total of 196 Australians were taken prisoners by the Turks, of whom 60 died. The remnant of the 4,104 who are still alive and suffer from disabilities find the greatest difficulty in satisfying the authorities that their disabilities are associated with their war service. I can say of my own unit, the Flying Corps, that of the 44 men who were taken prisoners, only six survived. There were nine Australians among them, of whom only one is now alive, and he is a sick man. The men attached to base RecentlyI appeared before the Entitlement Tribunal to give evidence in support of the second application by the widow of a light-horseman who had been imprisoned by thc Turks during the war. Actually much delay had been caused because the department had written to Turkey to find out how the man had been treated. Oould anything be more ridiculous? It is stated in a paper which was presented to the British House of Commons, after a wide inquiry, that of the 13,000 men who were taken prisoner after the siege of Kut-el-Amara approximately only 3,000 survived their captivity. The man in connection with whose case I appeared Avas one of four There who were exchanged by the Turks because he was seriously ill with dysentery, a disease common amongst Turkish prisoners, whilst he also had malaria, which was rife among those who served in Palestine or Mesopotamia. He died, leaving a widow and five little children, and for the last eighteen months or thereabouts the widow has been trying without success to obtain a pension. This is a glaring instance of the injustice that can be created by the lack of flexibility in the act. Even the enemy showed the man some compassion, but for eighteen months his own country, for which he fought, has denied justice to his widow. The tribunal, which hears appeals from theRepatriation' Commission, rejected the claim because there was no evidence that the man's death was due to war serviceI t was stated that he had died from a heart affection which the specialists said was common in middle age, but the causeof the affection in his case could not be demonstrated. When I appeared before the tribunal at the request of the widow,. I found that another witness, who had also been a prisoner of war, had stated that the soldier in question had been a very sick man while in Turkey, and had been exchanged. Had that witness not heen available, and had T been unable to give evidence, the widow would have had Little chance of obtaining a pension. sion yet? case, is to some extent, sub judice, and perhaps I should not say anything about it, but this is the only opportunity I shall",24,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

The department is run very economically, but the act is too rigid, and should be overhauled. Consideration should be given by the Government during the recess to this matter. ago I strongly suggested that something should be done in the matters that I have related, and during recent years I have made frequent attempts to have improvements ettected. I have received shoals of letters from every part of the Oommonwealth asking that the act bo amended. Unless action in this direction is taken many worthy people will be denied justice and be deprived of their rights. honourable members feel strongly on this subject. They appreciate that successive governments have tried to do the right thing, and that the officials are administering the act in the only way they can; but it is the act itself that is at applies for a pension, he has very little fault. At present, the returned soldiers are not receiving the help and the sympathy to which they are entitled. believe that Parliament, given the opportunity, would widen the scope of the Repatriation Act very considerably, so as to make it easier for those who are trying to obtain justice for themselves and their families. this Parliament have had repatriation cases brought before them. I have several soldier settlements in my electorate, and I come into contact with a large number of persons who have claims before the department. Recently, I have received a great many letters from returned soldier clubs in my electorate, and' from individual returned soldiers, protesting against the statement of Sir Gilbert Dyett that there was no necessity for an amendment of the Repatriation Act. is not putting the matter fairly. Sir Gilbert Dyett did not object to the amendment of the act. He objected to the appointment of a select committee. attempt is made by members of this The annual repatriation vote House to secure justice for the returned soldiers, Sir Gilbert Dyett, and every one else interested in the matter, should applaud the effort. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) was at one time Minister in charge of Repatriation, and I have no doubt that, even then, many things could have been done by him to relieve the condition of those who Over two months were promised practically everything under the sun when they went to the war, but actually obtained very little The efforts of the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) to obtain an expression of opinion from honourable members on this subject should be applauded by every ex-member of the Australian Imperial Force and, indeed, by every citizen of Australia. In the repatriation hospitals there are hundreds I know that other of ex-soldiers suffering from tuberculosis who are receiving pensions of only £1 10s. a week. Deaths among them are frequent, but the department persists in its attitude that their disability is not due to war service. When a tubercular soldier chance of success unless his application is supported by medical evidence. would be slender. appeared before the Entitlement Tribunal as an advocate knows that the act is too rigid, and should be amended. Under the act as it now stands, it . is Most honourable members rvf impossible in many cases for applicants to prove their claims. A little while ago I interviewed the then Minister in charge of Repatriation (Senator Foll) on behalf of a man who enlisted in 1915 and who, upon his discharge, received a 50 per cent, pension because of war injuries consisting of injuries to both his legs. Some time later he went into hospital at Randwick, and was afterwards discharged, being told that one leg was well. On the strength of that, his pension was reduced by 25 per cent. He continued to receive treatment for the other leg. Eventually, the leg which was supposed to be sound became bad again, and it is now necessary that an operation be performed on both legs. The Repatriation Department, however, will recognize the disability in respect of one leg only, so that the man will have to go into Randwick for three months for an",26,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

Sitting suspended from 1 to 2 p.m. pension of the sitting I was dealing with the administration of the Eepatriation Department. I could give many more instances in addition to those which I have already outlined, showing that it is almost impossible for large numbers of returned soldiers to prove that disabilities from which they are at present suffering are due to war service. The Government is not giving to this departmenit the attention which it deserves. The Minister in charge of it is also Postmaster General. partment is receiving the maximum of attention. ing in any way about the Minister, but am simply pointing out that it is impossible for one Minister to handle two such important departments. the Minister is doing his best in respect of each of those departments, but I suggest that the combined job is beyond one man. If Parliament were given an opportunity to review the Eepatriation Act it would undoubtedly broaden the scope of that legislation in order to enable large numbers of returned soldiers to obtain justice in cases of the kind which [ have mentioned. This Government has made no attempt to deal with the problem of unemployment which is daily becoming more acute. In my electorate thousands of people have had no employment excepting relief work during the last four or five years. Unemployment is primarily the responsibility of the national government. thing might be said in favour of the youth employment scheme initiated some time ago, but I point out that in New South Wales, at any rate, up to last December very if ew young men obtained jobs under that'scheme. Those who were successful had first to find someone who would employ them. That is not the basis on which to tackle this problem. The CHAIEMAN -The honourable man told me member has exhausted his time. 1 should be the last honourable member to criticize officers charged with the administration of the Eepatriation Department. However, so many years have now elapsed since the termination of the Great War that it is imperative that we alter our policy towards those returned soldiers whose disabilities are almost certainly the result of their war service, although no official records exist to prove that claim. Because these men cannot prove definitely that their disabilities are the result of war service they are denied any benefits under this legislation. I am not criticizing the Government or the department in this respect, but I urge the Government to call a conference of representatives of those interested in order to see what can he done to remove anomalies of this kind. Not only are the men themselves to be considered; we should also bear in mind the welfare of their dependants, because it is obvious that, owing to their disabilities, returned soldiers, as a general rule, are not able to provide for their dependants or survivors as fully as can breadwinners who enjoy complete Undoubtedly health. A system under which a returned man is treated by the departmental doctors for one complaint, which is directly due to war service, but is forced to seek medical attention elsewhere for another complaint from which he is also suffering, is ridiculous. Eveni f the latter complaint were shown definitely not to be due to war service the repatriation authorities should treat it in the general interests of the returned man. That course would be far more sensible than the one now followed. It has heen stated in this debate that, generally, medical evidence tends to show that disabilities of returned soldiers are due to war service. It has been my experience that it is very difficult to get the Eepatriation SomeDepartment to accept the opinion of eminent outside medical men when that opinion conflicts with that of the departmental medical officers.",27,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

One, for instance, who was a member of the Army Medical Corps contracted what he thought to be a minor skin disease. As he did not think it was serious, he did not seek treatment for it while on active service and, consequently, no entry concerning his complaint was made in his record. To-day, however, that man is suffering a very great disability as the result of the development of that complaint. He is hardly able to walk, but because he is unable to furnish a medical record covering the time he was on active service, he is refused a penin the search in Gippsland, and, accordsion. I know that man well, and I feel certain that he is not trying to ""put over "" anything on the department. More sympathetic consideration should be shown by the department in cases of this kind. I am not blaming the authorities in this respect. Indeed, I pay a tribute to the efforts which successive governments have made in broadening the scope of the Repatriation Act. As time goes on, however, we must treat claims of this kind with increasing sympathy. AgainI urge the Government to call a conference of interested parties with the object of overcoming some of the anomalies to which I have referred. is something Another matter to which I wish to refer concerns the development of our fisheries. A research vessel is engaged in. surveying the waters off the north coast of Queensland. I believe it is doing good work. I suggest, however, that it should not confine its operations to any one locality for too long a period. 1 understand that it will be engaged off the north of Queensland for about two years. The experts might easily justify this arrangement, but I suggest that greater encouragement would ..be given to the extension of the fishing, industry if the services of this vessel were made available for varying periods in other localities around our coast. One spot to which it might direct its immediate attention, temporarily at any rate, is in the vicinity of Port Fairy on the south coast of Victoria where, incidentally, the largest fishing fleet in Australia is operating. Undoubtedly, large quantities of fish exist in these waters, and 1 know that various interests are considering the establishment of enterprises there in connection with the industry. However, they do not feel inclined to go ahead with any proposal until they have been able to obtain certain information which could be supplied by this research vessel. I trust that the research vessel will be transferred, 'at least for a time, to other parts of the Australian coast, instead of allowing it to operate in only one section. I also urge the Government to increase its activities in the search for oil, in localities other than those in which investigations are now being made. I am awaTe that the Government is assisting ing to the reports received, good work is being done. There is, however, an area in the vicinity of Portland, in the western district of Victoria, where seepage of oil and material cast up on the shore suggest the possibility of oil being obtained. A company which has been formed for some time has expended a considerable sum in the search for oil, and, as I understand that it has now qualified for governmental assistance and is submitting an application, I trust that the Government will afford it some help, because it is making a genuine endeavour to discover oil in that part of Australia.",28,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

109,Mr Scholfield,"That is so. I[2.16] I support the opinions expressed by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) concerning the disabilities experienced by many returned soldiers in the mutter of war pensions, and also his remarks concerning the unfortunate position of many South African war veterans. I ,am wholeheartedly in agreement with the honourable membeT for Balaclava that the Repatriation Act should be amended in order to afford more ""assistance, to many hundreds of returned soldiers who are unable to receive a w j r pension or to secure the necessary medical treatment. Hundreds of returned soldiers interview me seeking advice and assistance, but, unfortunately, owing to the way in which the act has been framed, help cannot be afforded. I do not blame the members of the Repatriation Oommission or the members of the Entitlement Tribunal, all of whom are returned soldiers, because I believe they carry out their duties faithfully to the degree that the law permits. The honourable member for Balaclava has, on several occasions, endeavoured to introduce a private bill to amend the existing act, but 'an opportunity has not been afforded. The Repatriation Act will have to be amended before these unfortunate men will be able to get the assistance to .which they are entitled. During the last two months, numerous cases have been brought under my notice of men appealing to the board, then to the commission, and then to the tribunal, but because they cannot furnish fresh material evidence-that is the stereotyped reply which they always receivetheir applications for a pension have been rejected. Unfortunately, it is difficult to of the Government the position of some obtain fresh material evidence. As stated by the honourable memher for Wannon( Mr Scholfield) they would have to travel all over Australia searching for men who were memhers of the same unit to support their claims. a widow, who, in many instances, does not even know the unit. so. I knew a big robust man who before he enlisted was doing labourer's work, and who on returning from the war told me that he was suffering from what, appeared to be a severe cold. I suggested that he should see a doctor, but he said that he wished to get out of his uniform and back to work. His condition became worse and instead of consulting a doctor, he went to a chemist who treated him for an ordinary cold. Eventually he died, leaving a widow and four or five children, but when his wife applied for a pension her application was rejected because -it was said that he did not die as the result of war disabilities. We endeavoured to ascertain when the cold which eventually developed into tuberculosis first attacked him, but the files did not disclose that he had ever suffered any disability in that or in any other respect. There is no doubt, however, that his death from tuberculosis was due to war service. Eventually we secured ,about a dozen sworn affidavits from men who worked with him prior to enlistment and on his return from the war, all of whom declared that he always enjoyed good health. The onlyintimation we received was that a pension could not be paid unless there was fresh material evidence to show that his death was due to war service. His widow is not receiving a pension. Provision should be made in the Repatriation Act, whereby a woman on the death of her husband, can receive some financial assistance. I congratulate the honourable member for Balaclava upon the action he has taken in this matter, because I believe that he has the support of an overwhelming majority of returned soldiers. For some time past, I , and other honourable members, particularly the honourable member for Lang( Mr Mulcahy) ancl. the honourable member for Watson( Mr Jennings), have brought under the notice of the South African war veterans. The inatter was raised when the Estimates were last under consideration, and several days ago a deputation representative of every State in Australia waited on the Minister for Repatriation, urging the Government to assist those few unfortunate men who, up to the present, have not had any relief. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he sympathized with the request and would place the whole matter before Cabinet. As the result of representations made to the Government two or three years ago, it decided that on the death of a South African war veteran £10 should be paid towards his funeral",29,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

I plead with the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Harrison) to do everything that, he promised to do in this direction. proposal is merely that the SouthA f r i can war veterans receive a service pension at the age of 60 years instead of the okl-age pension at 65. endorse the appeal made by the honorrevenue in South Australia and, as the able member for Brisbane( Mr George honourable member for Brisbane pointed Lawson) on behalf of the South African out, the balance of the fund that wa? war veterans. referred to by myself and others on its original purpose. many occasions in this Parliament and it waa the subject of a recent deputation it was transferred to the patriotic fund.

The Minister for Eepatriation of the South African war veterans and I hope that he will arrange for them to have access to the repatriation benefits, including service pensions. The Commonwealth Government already grants amounts of £10 t'o meet the costs of the funerals of South African war veterans who die in poor circumstances, indicating its acceptessential services, loss of orders to facance of its moral responsibility towards these ex-service men. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has referred to anomalies in the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. from persons affected by that act, but I have been given to understand that the Minister for Repatriation is arranging a consultation with the returned soldiers' organizations throughout Australia in reference to the Repatriation Act. I will await with interest the report on this conference. It would appear from the remarks of some honourable gentlemen that they feel that the borrowing activities of semithem a great deal of concern. The governmental bodies should be curtailed. L hope that that will not happen, because, if it did, the adverse repercussions on employment would be tremendous. I realize the difficulties in connection with loan requirements of several bodies and a regulation of the system to prevent a hardening of the interest rate. Every State has important nationa] works in hand, but it may be argued that most of them are in New South Wales. It must be realized that two-fifths of Australia's population is concentrated in New South Wales, and that there must necessarily be more development in that State than in any other part of Australia. The establishment of large industries at Port Kembla, Newcastle, and elsewhere, entails the provision of amenities, including water, sewerage and housing, which can be provided only by a sturdy financial policy. The entry of semi-governmental bodies into the loan market cannot be blamed for the hardening of the interest rate. The semi-governmental bodies control many national reproductive works. The Sydney Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board has 6,000 men employed on full-time work. The Newcastle Water Mr Jennings. Board employs 1,600 men. At Broken has investigated the claims Hill 400 men are engaged in water-works, and similar works in other parts of the State employ about 2,000 men. Housing schemes are urgently necessary at places such as Port Kembla and Captain's Flat, as well as in metropolitan areas. Curtailment of the financial resources of semi-governmental bodies would result in a stoppage of reproductive works and tories, curtailment of industries, with an extension of unemployment and a recession. The Minister for Works, Mr Spooner, in the Government of New South Wales, said that the lives of more I have received complaints than 20,000 workers would he affected by curtailment of the activities of semi governmental bodies, and I urge that the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Spender) give earnest and sympathetic consideration to the aspect which I have placed before him. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) a few days ago referred to the postal workers' award. The postal workers are a loyal and efficient body, but the award has given Postmaster-General( Mr Harrison) already has the facts, and I hope that he will give earnest consideration to the position placed before him. r The first matter to which I wish to refer involves the practices of the .States in administering their unemployment relief schemes. In Victoria and, I presume, in the other States, the practice is to deny unemployment assistance to persons whose family income exceeds what is called ""permissible income"". In determining permissible income everything that is received by members of the family living under the same roof is counted-eve n the old-age pension that is paid to the father or to the mother, or, perhaps, to both, and the invalid pension that is paid to an incapacitated member of the family. This means, of course, that the invalid and old-age pensioners are contributing out of their pittance to the maintenance of unemployed members of their families. It is quite true that they could say to the unemployed members of their families, "" Get out of the place and apply for relief on your own "", but that",31,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40
125,Mr Blackbuen (Bourke) [2.41],"is not human nature, and it is very unfair that pensioners should be burdened with the maintenance of their unemployed adult children, as they are in Victoria. I suggest, as I have suggested before, that this matter should be taken up with tbe States. It seems to me that it would not be beyond the competence of this Parliament to pass legislation in respect of invalid and old-age pensions to provide that the States shall not adopt tbe practice to which I have referred. The next matter to which I wish to refer is a long-overdue agreement for reciprocity in pensions between Australia and New Zealand. In 1913 an agreement was made between New Zealand and Australia. That agreement was set out in a schedule to an act passed in New Zealand in 1913, namely, the Old age Pensions Reciprocity Act. agreement was reached between the Fisher Government in Australia and the Massey Government in New Zealand. The Massey Government introduced legislation to give effect to that agreement, but it has never been adopted in Australia. tiations are proceeding between the Governments of Australia and New Zealand for a reciprocal pensions scheme on lines more favorable to Australia, than the scheme that was agreed upon in 1913. I have not seen printed in any paper here the text of the 1913 agreement, but I find the text in a speech made last year by the Minister for Pensions in New Zealand, Mr Parry, when presenting the New Zealand Pensions Department's annual report. He saidWith the permission of the HouseI will read tlie principal part of the proposed agreement to which we are still awaiting a reply:(a) In the case of an applicant who iseligible otherwise than by residence on or before the 1st January, 1930, for a Commonwealth pension and who has been in residence in thc Commonwealth for twelve months immediately preceding his application, residence in New Zealand to count as residence in the Commonwealth. (6) In the case of an applicant who is .eligible otherwise than by residence on or before the 1st January, 1930, for a New Zealand pension and who has been resident in New Zealand for twelve months immediately preceding his application, residence in thu Commonwealth to count as residence in New Zealand. (c) Each country to accept financial liability in proportion to the respective period of qualifying residence by the pensioner in each country as at date of first grant of pension. In the event of any person in receipt of a reciprocal pension becoming eligible by residence for a pension in the country in which he is residing, f u l l financial liability to be then taken by that country. This matter has been under consideration since July last, but nothing has been done, l n reply to a question which I asked recently, the Minister for Social Services( Sir Frederick Stewart) stated that the agreement had not yet been completed. That was almost the same reply as was given by the late Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) to the New Zealand Government in February of this year, when he said that the proposed agreement That was receiving consideration, but had not been finally settled. This matter is very important in view of our nearness to New Zealand. One of the greatest embargoes on the free movement of people between Australia and New Zealand is the feeling that they will lose their penI understand that negosion rights. ""We should ensure that people who leave Australia and take up residence in New Zealand, or vice versa, will be able to carry on their incomplete rights to a pension until those rights are completed at the expiration of 20 years' residence in either of the two countries. The agreement which has been proposed by New Zealand seems to me to be entirely fair. I understand that it is much more favorable to Australia than the one which was drawn up in 1913, but was subsequently abandoned by us. For a long time. I have been of the opinion that the Pensions Department is not administering the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act according to its legal content. There is no appeal from the commissioner's decision. The commissioner interprets the provisions of the act according to his own sweet will. The act provides that, with the exception of blind persons, nobody shall be entitled to an invalid pension unless he or she is permanently incapacitated for work. By regulation the phrase ""permanently incapacitated for work"" is expanded to mean, "" totally and permanently incapacitated for work "". The view taken by the Pensions Department of"" the phrase "" totally and permanently incapacitated for work "" is that it is not sufficient that a person's incapacity debars b i m from obtaining work at whicb he can earn a Jiving, anything at all. He must be totally and permanently incapacitated for all physical exertion in the nature of work. Let us take, for instance, the common case of a person suffering from small epilepsy I have many such cases in mind. Such a person is totally unemployable, because ho one knows at what time he or she may be subject to a fit. Girls suffering from that disease cannot obtain employment as domestics because, being overcome by a fit in the course of their duties, might result in thc breakage of articles or the frightening of children. For that reason no one will offer them employment. Yet, while at home w i th their families, relatives, or friends, these unfortunates are quite capable of performing general household duties. The department takes the view that these persons are not totally and permanently incapacitated for work within the meaning of the act. give special consideration to cases such as that. done. have not been successful in securing pensions for such persons whose cases I have brought under the notice of the department. I have received many letters from the department stating that people suffering from .small epilepsy are not recognized as being totally and permanently incapacitated for work. What happens is that a case is referred to a departmental doctor-in Victoria, we have some very conservative doctors-wh o certifies that the person concerned is not totally and permanently incapacitated according to the department's interpretation of the act. I submit that this rigid view of the law is wrong. There is similar wording in some of the Workers' Compensation acts. In ' t h e New South Wales Workers' Compensation Act there is the phrase '-'permanent That, I should say, is on all fours with the phrase "" permanently and totally incapacitated "" in our pensions regulations. The meaning of the former phrase was dealt with by the H i g h Court of Australia in 1933 in the case of Wicks v. The Union Steamship Company of New or for that matter earn Zealand Limited. The six judges of that court united in giving a judgment which included the following statement:The commissioner was, therefore, called upon to decide whether the worker had been permanently and totally disabled, an expression which, iu our opinion, means physically incapacitated from ever earning by work any part of his livelihood. The condition is satisfied when capacity for earning has gone except for the chance of obtaining special employment uf an unusual kind. I submit'that if an in j u r y sustained by a person is such that he is debarred from earning by work any part of his livelihood, then he is permanently and totally incapacitated, even though there is some special employment-whic h he is not likely to find-at which he might earn his living. For instance, a gir l suffering from epilepsy might secure work for an hour or two during the day, but she could not possibly earn her living. That i's the natural meaning of the phrase "" totally and permanently incapacitated "". 1 endeavoured in this Parliament to have ,an amendment made to the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act to remedy that anomaly, but I was informed that it would cost too much. In my opinion, personally many people who are entitled to invalid pensions are suffering because of the view of the.law taken by the department. would approve of a partial pension foi 1 partial disablement? would require an alteration of the act. All that I am asking for now is that the actual words in the existing statute should be more liberally interpreted so that a pension would be granted to persons whose incapacity prevents them from earning any part of their livelihood. It is not sufficient that in some hypothetical or imaginary case, not likely to occur, a person may possibly be able to do some work. and total disablement"". partially incapacitated might obtain intermittent employment. seeking is that the English meaning of",32,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

Another .matter to which I wish to refer is also the legal interpretation of that section of the act which provides for the withholding of pensions from people who deliberately divest themselves of their property in order to make themselves eligible for a pension. The department goes beyond that and says that if at any time an applicant for a pension has voluntarily given property to a child or some other relative that property may for all time be regarded as the property of thc applicant. It may be that ten years ago a person who had no thought of ever applying for a pension disposed of a house, or some other property to a child or relative. In course of time, circumstances may have changed and that person may have had to apply for a pension -The department says ""While we do not suggest that you divested yourself of that property with the object of qualifying for a pension, and we are prepared to believe that you never contemplated wanting a pension,for the purposes of this act it is our practice to regard that property as still being your property"". member's time has expired. attention' to the fact that in South Australia there are quite a number of borderline cases which should be thoroughly investigated. It often happens that the departmental doctors do not agree with opinions expressed by an outside doctor. side doctors. many cases of that nature. I know personally of quite a number of cases in South Australia in which pensions have been withheld from deserving people. The position of many dependants of deceased soldiers is also deplorable. When a conflict of opinion occurs between the departmental medical officers and private practitioners, the Repatriation Commission almost invariably disregards the opinions of the private practitioners. ThisI consider to be quite unfair. pensions are instructed by the department to consult private practitioners. tliose who have had considerable dealings with the department have formed the opinion that the word of the departmental officers carries far more weight than that of the private practitioners. The benefit of any doubt should be given to the applicants. they shall be given the benefit of the doubt. observed in that respect. I plead for a more sympathetic investigation of cases by the Repatriation Department. I wish now to refer to the urgent need for consistent investigations into the possibility of making Australia more self-contained in regard to its oil requirements. It is estimated that about 400,000,000 gallons of petrol a year is usecl in Australia. Scientists and geological experts have declared that the world's known sources of petrol supply are being rapidly exhausted, and it is predicted that they will he utterly depleted within the next twenty years. honourable resources should be investigated. able member. If power alcohol can be economically produced from sugar, grapes or other'raw materials, the production of it should be encouraged. In 1936 this Parliament authorized the opening of the Petroleum Oil Search Trust Account, with a credit of £250,000, to encourage the search for oil. Although a small amount of money has been expended from that account in Victoria, practically nothing effective has been done. We should not confine our search for oil to an examination of the contours of the country by the use of aeroplanes. A much more intensive activity is essential to success. I agree with the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) that a great deal more could be done to encourage the extraction of oil from coal. While I was in Sydney recently I inspected a plant established there for this purpose. I do not suggest that it was the best plant that could be obtained, but it appeared to me to he doing good work.

Australia has very extensive deposits of brown coal, which, I believe, could be utilized for the production of oil. The trust account to which I have referred could be drawn upon to assist experimentation in this regard. The motorists of Australia paid £10,668,000 in taxes in 1937-38 through the impost of 7d. a gallon on petrol, plus primage. Unfortunately, practically the whole of this amount of money is taken from Australia. important and merits the closest attention -by the Government. The answers I have received to questions I have asked Ministers on this matter have not been satisfactory. The Defence Department could, in my opinion, do a great deal more than it has done hitherto to encourage the local production of oil in one way or another. support the request of the honourable memher for Balaclava, ( Mr White), the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr George Lawson) and other honourable gentlemen who have urged the Government to introduce an amendment of the Repatriation Act to liberalize its provisions. public generally is of the opinion that far soldiers' organizations. more returned soldiers are drawing pensions than is actually tbe case. According to the last returns available, the number of Australian ex-soldier pensioners is 77,315 and their average pension is £1 19s. 6d. a fortnight, which is less than the amount paid to invalid and old-age pensioners, who are in receipt of the full pension. It is admitted by medical officers attached to the Repatriation Department and also by eminent private practitioners that the average life of ex-soldiers has been shortened by ten years in consequence of their war service. Eor this, reason these men are entitled to the most favorable consideration possible. Fortunately many ex-soldiers are enjoying good health and do not need pensions; -but those who apply for pensions should be treated f avorably and be given the benefit of any doubt as to whether their dishonourable gentleman overhaul it while abilities are actually due to war service he was in office? or not. As the honourable member for Balaclava pointed out, ex-prisoners of We should also war must, in the very nature of the case, find it almost impossible to demonstrate South that their disabilities are due to war experiences, yet every reasonably-minded man must surely agree that those who had to live under the appalling conditions that existed in the concentration camps in Germany and Turkey during the war must inevitably have suffered an impairment of their health. It should not be necessary to argue that point. The great majority of the officials of the Repatriation Department are sympathetic to returned soldiers, and, as far as the law The subject, therefore, is allows, treats them with every consideration, but I fear that the Entitlement Tribunal, on which there are two legal gentlemen, is too apt to search for legal reasons for not granting pensions. man cannot know the chairman of the Entitlement Tribunal or he would not make such a statement. of the Entitlement TribunalI feel that it deals with the business that comes before it in too legalistic a way. the Entitlement Tribunal it has been considered by two other boards, the whole of the members of which are returned The soldiers or the nominees of returned not dismiss the feeling that the Entitlement Tribunal is unduly influenced by the legal outlook.

I do not see how any reasonably-minded man with a knowledge of the facts of that case can deny that the disability is partly, due to war service. I direct attention to the case of another .man who has a piece of shrapnel in his thigh which has caused serious trouble in his leg. A local doctor and an officer of the Repatriation Department at Caulfield X-rayed him. He has rapidly become worse. He applied to the Department for consideration and after waiting a fortnight without a reply he communicated with it again, and was informed that the department was not in the habit of communicating direct with applicants; it communicated with their medical advisers. Consequently, he had to consult a doctor at his own expense. The doctor communicated with the department, which replied that the case was being considered. A month passed, during which the man heard nothing, and in the meantime he became bed-ridden. Hecommunicated with me, and I got in touch with the Deputy-Director, who said that the matter was finalized, and would shortly be considered by the board. He said that he would communicate with ine-' further on the subject, but I have heard nothing more. The man was X-rayed on the 26th April, and practically a month went by without his hearing anything more about it.' It was admitted, of course, that he had been wounded by shrapnel, but he was not informed whether' he would be admitted to a military hospital for treatment, or whether he would have to eo to a public hospital. All inquiries should have heen completed -within a week or ten days. [07. 1 I tfgree with what was said by the honourable member for Brisbane regarding the claims of the South African war veterans to service pensions. There are very few of these men. left now, and their request is reasonable. I have several in my own district who are anxious to receive this concession, so that they may obtain a pension as a right instead, of having to apply for the old-age pension, which might be regarded as a charity. I should like to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General( Mr Harrison) the position of returned soldiers employed in the Public Service, particularly in the Postal Department. I have been told by reliable persons that when temporary employees have been in continuous employment for nearly the full period that would entitle them to permanentappointment, they are put off for a while, so that they lose their qualifications. Sometimes, when there is only a fortnight to go they are put off, whether deliberately for the. purpose of depriving them of their qualifications, I do not know. the honourable member will furnish me with particulars of specific cases. the kind referred to me on previous occasions, but, upon investigation, it :was found that the facts were not just as stated. ister is sympathetic, and I hope that some action will be taken to ensure that the men are treated justly.. desire to bring under the notice of the Government the serious position of the wool and wheat industries, the two most important industries in Australia. The prosperity of the whole Commonwealth depends upon those industries, and no national government can afford to neglect them. The prices of wool and wheat in the world's markets to-day are below the cost of production, and that is why difficulty is being experienced in raising both internal and externul loans, and why the rate of interest is rising. Much greater attention is beinggiven, in this",36,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

It seems possible to obtain money and attention for industries not nearly so important as the ones I have mentioned. The wool and wheat industries are of the utmost importance, not only to those directly engaged in them, but also to every one in Australia. The financial stability of the country depends upon its exports, which provide the income on which every body lives. It is pleasing to know that our new Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) recognizes the importance of these great primary industries, and the seriousness of their present condition. He has promised that an attempt will be made to solve the problems associated with them, 'but it should not he left until next harvest; action should be taken now. There seems to be little prospect of anything being done during the present sittings of Parliament. The problem facing Australia in connection with wheat is the same as that which faces all wheat-exporting countries, but that does not make it any the less serious from our point of view. The wheat industry is one of the greatest employers of labour in Australia, and it ia a big factor in the decentralization of population. No less than 97£ per cent, of the national income from exports is derived from primary industries, and of -these wool and wheat are the most important. It may be said, indeed, that they constitute our first line of defence. It is of little use creating defence forces if the is only common sense to assume that the economy of the country is crippled to such an extent that we are unable to finance military operations. In ""Western Australia, we are not blessed with many rivers, and the problem of a water supply is a serious one in many townships. The cities everywhere are well off in this respect, but the people of the back-lblocks have difficulty, in a low-rainfall year, in gotting sufficient water for household purposes. Watersupply systems are needed in districts along the Great Southern line, and north of the Coolgardie pipe-line, and I hope that sympathetic consideration will be given by the Loan Council to requests for loan moneys for this purpose. In common with other honorahle members, I desire to urge upon the Ur. Prowse. Government the need for more generous treatment of returned soldiers m the matter of pensions. I know that the Eepatriation Act has been amended so as to give more generous treatment than formerly, but many deserving applications are still being turned down because the applicants are unable to produce the. evidence required. One returned soldier whom I know was wounded and gassed, but, with his youth still upon him, he did not apply for a pension when he returned home. He went to work, but in a short time his health broke down, and then the question arose whether his condition was due to war service. His brother, who had practically the same period of service, and who had also been wounded and gassed, applied for a pension on his return because his chest, happened, at that time, to -be a little worse. To-day, he is in receipt of a pension, although his condition is no worse now than that of his brother, who receives no pension at all. It so happens that tbe records of the doctor who examined him upon his return were destroyed by fire, and now, because the doctor cannot turn <up the relevant papers, this man, who is not able to work more than one day a week, has been refused a pension. In this way, men of sterling worth, who served their country faithfully, and whose records are clean, are being allowed to suffer real want because .they cannot supply the proof demanded by the department. Surely it condition of a man who served for four years overseas, who suffered from wounds and gas, and whose health has now broken down, is almost certainly due to war service: That is much more reasonable than ,to assume that his condition is due. to life in. the sylvan glades of Western Australia. The department should) be more generous in its treatment of such men. wish to justify an interjection which I made a little while ago with regard to the administration of the Eepatriation Department. It will be a sorry day for the returned soldiers if the chairman of man Mighell, is replaced by any other man. Because of his great kindness and his knowledge as to how far he can; go",37,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

163,"The Eepatriation Commission, Mr Nor","under the act my only regret is that he is not also chairman of the Entitlement Board. I know that he has stretched the act in order to do justice to many returned men. I voted against the establishment of both of these tribunals, and I do not think that I shall ever be sorry that, I did so. Any man ""who went to war in perfect health physically and mentally should not now be denied a pension when lie suffers certain disabilities due in part, at least; to his war service. I know of many men who were perfect physical specimens when they enlisted, and who, since their return from the front, have not worked in city areas where it might be said they have contracted complaints peculiar to congested industrial life. Nevertheless, these men are to-day dying on their feet, and when they ask for 'a pension they are told that they must prove that their complaints are due to war service. The departmental doctors are to blame more than anybody else for the unsympathetic treatment meted out in eases of this kind. Our repatriation legislation sliould be liberalized, particularly in thc direction of giving, greater recognition to outside medical opinion. For a number of years I have been urging the Postmaster-General's Department to build a post office at Collinsville. The other day I asked the following questions on this matter:1. How long have thu premises used tor the post office at Collinsville, Queensland, been out for a higher rental, knowing that there leased by the department? 2. What' is the weekly rental ? 3. Does the lease expire in October. If so, is it proposed to renew the lease or to proceed with the erection of a new building? The reply I received was as follows:1. Since the Srd October, 1927. 2. f l . S. Yes. The question of renewing the lease of the present premises, or arranging for the provision of another building, is receiving consideration. More than £600 has been paid.in rent by the department' for this building which at no time would have brought more than £150 by auction and possibly would not bring more than £70 at a sale to-morrow. When Mr Corbett was Deputy Direotor of Posts and Telegraphs in Queensland he endeavoured unsuccessfully to have repairs effected to this structure. The owner, Mrs. Fiddler, said that the rent she received for this place represented the major portion of her income, so she could not afford to keep the building in proper repair, although under the terms of the lease she is required to do so. 1 again urge the Postmaster-General to provide a new post office at Collinsville. Not more than a few hundred pounds would be involved. A new post oflice would be more than justified because Collinsville is the centre of a rich little coal-field and the township itself gives every promise of expanding. Furthermore, when the town was surveyed an area was set aside as a site for a permanent post office. Nevertheless, the department has decided against the erection of this building, preferring to continue to pay £1 a week for the shack it now uses. The building is not more than 25 feet hy 50 feet, yet it accommodates a postmaster, three male assistants and a telephonist, all of whom work in the one room because there are no partitions. Records are kept in fourteen benzine boxes which were installed for the purpose by the postmaster. Surely' the department will not tolerate this state of affairs. To continue paying rent for such a building is a wilful waste or public money. Successive deputy directors in Queensland have turned down the proposal to erect a new postoflice in thi? town on the ground that no money is available. I understand that the present lease will expire in October, when, from all appearances, Mrs. Fiddler will hold is no other available place in the town. Furthermore, the department would be involved in considerable expenditure in transferring its equipment. I urge the Postmaster-General to give this matter further attention. For some time the Cane-growers Council at Ingham has been endeavouring to secure a right-of-way on property owned by the Postal Department. I urged that that request be granted, but was told by the Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs that it was the policy of the department to retain all of its land. However, some time ago when the present Minister for the Interior (Senator Foll) visited Ingham a deputation from the Cane-growers Council waited upon him and renewed its request, and on the Minister's return south it was granted immediately. I am pleased that the Cane-growers Council was given that right-of-way. I cannot see that any harm or injustice was done to the department in that direction. WhatI complain about, however, is that whilst the fixed policy of That would mean a production of 1,000 the department can be waived when a Minister makes a request, it is quite a different thing when an ordinary member makes the same request. I have been endeavouring to secure a piece of land now held by the Postal Department as a site for a new Commonwealth Bank building at Ayr. The Postmaster-General said to-day that it was the policy of the department to retain possession of all the land now under its control. I point out that there is sumcient land available between the drill hall and the postmaster's residence to build another post office, and that the department could easily spare about a quarter of an acre of its land. After all, the Commonwealth Bank is as much a government institution as is the post office. stance was cited in the report of a place The area owned by the department covers from 3 to 4 acres, and I do not suppose that it will need all of that land within a thousand years. Nevertheless, it refuses to surrender any portion of which I have mentioned. I brought this matter under the notice of the honourable member for Barker( Mr through the oil strata into water, and Archie Cameron) when he was Postmaster-General and he told me that he would investigate, it. So far, however, nothing' has, been done. ""When I was in Sydney recently, the bank officials told me that things, were moving in the right direction. I point out that the bank's lease of its present premises will expire, next year. I have no doubt that the landlord will take the opportunity to squeeze a greater rental out of the Governnecessary for various licence-holders to ment. I ask the Postmaster-General to expedite the investigation which his predecessor commenced. The present postmaster at Ayr has been obliged at his own expense to clear this land of weeds, because the property which faces the main street of the town is an eyesore. I urge the Government to give immediate effect to the recommendation of the Oil Advisory Committee contained in that committee's, report in December last with respect to. the development of the Lakes Entrance oil-field. Briefly, that report stated that boring had proved that the field contained at least 150,000,000 gallons of oil, on a conservative estimate. barrels of oil a day for seven days, a week for nearly twelve years, a quantity,. I suggest, sufficiently great to claim our attention when, oil means so much to us from a defence point of view. It was pointed out that over most of the field there is insufficient gas pressure to bring the oil readily to the surface, although when I visited the field recently in company with the then Minister for the to thesurface under natural pressure. The committee, pointed out that great success has attended methods which have been adopted in other parts of the world in dealing with similar conditions by artificial pressure, or as it is called, repressuring. One inon the Mediterranean, where, by the use of the repressuring system, the daily output had been increased from H tonB to 300 tons a day. Considerable expenditure is involved in preparing a field for the land for the purpose repressuring. On the Gippsland field there are a number of old bore holes which unfortunately have been sunk the report indicates that it will be necessary to seal up at least some of these holes before repressuring can be commenced. The report goes on to state that the committee strongly, recommends that governmental assistance should be given to seal up these old bore holes and to aid the work of repressuring. It further points out, however; that before such assistance could be given it will be agree, to a system, of unitary control, because it is obvious that a repressuring scheme would be unsatisfactory if some persons were: operating on, a given area-, and just across an. imaginary border line others were rendering that plan of campaign ineffective.

The Petroleum Research Act, passed in 1936, and amended in 1.937, confines assistance to be given to companies searching for oil, but tbe Advisory which was made available in December last, recommended that assistance be given beyond the point of mere searching for oil, because oil has already been discovered in that locality. About ten days ago the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior gave notice of his intention to ask for leave 10 introduce a bill to amend the Petroleum Research. Act, with, I hope, the object of overcoming the difficulty 1 have mentioned. As no further action has been taken, I asked last week if the Minister would endeavour to introduce an amending bill before the House rose, but he was. unable to give me a definite reply. I trust that the Government will pass that small non-contontious measure before Parliament rises to-morrow. I do not think that any honourable member would oppose the insertion of the few words necessary to enable assistance to be given to these small companies in the direction recommended by the Oil Advisory Committee. If such an amending measure be not passed before the House rises, there will be a further delay of possibly three months, at a time when development of this oil field could be proceeded with. We are expending millions on defence. That is necessary, but I do not think that any honourable member will dispute the fact that fuel 011 is justas essential for defence purposes na is any other commodity. millions on defence if we have not an said it would not be needed for one adequate supply of fuel oil. in practically all mechanized equipment. able member for Herbert is not acquainted In these circumstances, I urge the Goveniment to introducethe measure I have mentioned and thus avoid unnecessary delay. master-General and Minister for Repatriation) [3.52] I desire to take this opportunity to reply to some of the observations made by honourable members concerning the administration of the Postmaster-General's Department and the Department of Repatriation. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens) referred to the replies he had received to questions concerning post office buildCommittee's report, ings and postal matters generally in his electorate. I shall give very careful consideration to the suggestions he has made concerning the post oflices at Collinsville and at Ingham, and shall, if possible, see to what degree his wishes can be complied with. The honourable member also referred to the land held by the Postmaster-General's Department at Ayr, but I would remind the honourable member that for some time it has been the policy of the department to retain the control of land that is likely to be of use to the department. The honourable member spoke of the block in question as if it were considerable in area, whereas it has a frontage of 264 feet to one street and 165 feet to another street. The area is only small, and, in view of the possible development which must eventually occur in that district, it is reasonable to assume that in time it may be necessary to establish an automatic telephone exchange to serve the surrounding district. In those circumstances the area would not be too large to accommodate a post office and an automatic exchange. The honourable member complained because the land has not been made available for other purposes, but by retaining the land the Government is getting the benefit of its increased value. If the land were disposed of and the township of Ayr developed considerably, the Government would be compelled to purchase another site at an increased cost and the honourable member would be the first to complain. thousand years.",40,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

I remind those honourable members who have spoken of the provisions of the Repatriation Act that I was once in the position which they now occupy, and on many occasions I too have criticized the provisions of that act. If honourable members could analyse the position, as I am now forced to do, they will find that our repatriation law is possibly the most generous in the world. To remove thc anomalies and to meet cases of hardship such as those which have been mentioned, would virtually mean scrapping the present act, and paying a minimum pension to every returned soldier, and a higher pension to some according to disability. meinber for Balaclava was once in control of the Repatriation Department ber of governments for almost a record been turned down by the department, and period. for many improvements in the act. that.

If the honourable member checked up the cases he has brought before the House with the departmental records he would find that the statements made by him do not always coincide with the records on the files. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) only the other day stated a case. I turned up the file and showed it to the honourable gentleman who assured me that he had heen misled by the returned soldier who had made representations to him. I do not want to state the cases in detail, but I have them here, and, if honourable members were'to hear them, they would realize that cases stated on the floor of Parliament-in all sincerity, I believe, and 'with a sense of truth behind them-ar e often cases that are not in accordance with the facts, although the honourable gentlemen who state them honestly-believe them to be so on the assurance of the persons for whom they speak.

182,Mr Harrison,"The interjectionsman makes application for the pension. I impress upon honourable members that the applicant goes before a board which is made up of returned soldiers, and on which the returned soldiers themselves have a direct representative. It is not suggested, surely, that a board constituted thus would be lacking in sympathy? Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia does not speak for rhe rank and file. letter from the federal secretary of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia stating that all of the State presidents are in accordance with the views of the federal president. are not. letter from the Legion and other bodies which endorse Sir Gilbert Dyett's views. They are representative bodies. The interjection has made me depart from my point. If the application made by the returned soldier is rejected by the board, the applicant then goes before the Repatriation Commission, which again consists of returned soldiers, and which has in its personnel a nominee of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr the result of war service, the departMartens) paid tribute to the chairman of that commission, Mr Norman Mighell, who is a humane man of infinite wisdom. That commission never disallows an application for a pension unless it unanimously decides to do so. There is no such thing as a majority docision. Shouldi t not be able to come to a decision on the evidence of the applicant and the panel of repatriation doctors, specialists are called in. Men with special knowledge in medical science are called in whenever there is the slightest doubt. 'Should the commission still be unable to reach a unanimous decision, the case goes before the War Pensions Appeals Tribunal, a body which was appointed by this Parliament and lifted away from political control. We have no power over that tribunal, which also consists of returned soldiers and -a nominee of the returned soldiers themselves. That tribunal sits in judgment and sometimes reverses the decision of the' commission. in my experience. assure the honourable member that that is so. The War Pensions Appeals Tribunal gives the widest possible interpretation the to the Repatriation Act in analysing the claims that are made' by returned 3oldiera for pensions. All honourable members must have the widest and greatest sympathy for the sufferer from pulmonary tuberculosis, a disease about which medical science know* very little, but honourable gentlemen must recognize that if we so widened the repatriation legislation as to grant a pension to all returned soldier sufferers from that disease, we should also have to grant pensions to sufferers from all other diseases. One cannot differentiate between diseases and we cannot accept all cases of tuberculosis as being due to war service unless we treat other diseases similarly. Nevertheless, if an applicant for a pension in respect of tuberculosis can establish that any illness which he suffered in service was a contributing factor in bringing about his tubercular condition, his disease is accepted as a war disability. If a man can establish that he contracted tuberculosis as ment gives him free treatment and a service pension and he is also permitted the invalid pension up to a limit which honourable gentlemen well know. The Repatriation Commission has departed to a degree from the act passed by this Parliament in respect of service pensions, which laid it down that in order to qualify for a service pension a man must have served in a "" theatre of war"". The commission accepts as a "" theatre of war "" any part of France, even a military base. The honourable memher for Boothby spoke about the necessity for a wider interpretation and a liberalizing of the whole repatriation scheme. Honourable gentlemen are aware that we expend about £7,750,000 a year on repatriation. In the year ended the 30th June last, we expended £7,725,963 on repatriation. interest paid to war-bond holders.",42,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

Honourable gentlemen know the commitments that face the Government. We cannot draw money from the ambient air, -as the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) would probably say. war the Government would not stop at £7,000^00 a year. my opinion about that before. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr George Lawson) and other honourable members have mentioned the need for repatriation benefits to SouthA f r i plaints in regard to Neurological cases and, can war veterans. I have already met representatives of those war veterans and I have told them that I will give consideration to the establishment of a service pension and some medical treatment for them. I intend to investigate that possibility and I hope to be able to report something when Parliament reassembles. Honourable members have spoken about anomalies in the repatriation legislation and have cited individual cases and, as I point out, those cases are useful because they allow of investigation by the Repatriation Commission, but they are not cases generally which substantiate anomalies. My first action on my being appointed Minister for Repatriation was to establish contact with certain of the bodies of returned soldiers. I want them to meet me in conference in order to enable us to discuss the alleged anomalies in the repatriation act. They surely will have a greater knowledge of what constitutes an anomaly in that legislation than the individual who picks up individual cases. I intend to explore the whdle field of the Repatriation Act, and if it should be shown to me that 'there are anomalies bearing unduly on the returned soldiers, and if it is possible to alter the act to relieve those anomalies, remedial action will be taken. being done. oflice I told the honourable gentleman who interjected that if he would give the Minister time the Minister would endeavour to rectify the anomalies. Some honourable gentlemen have suggested the establishment of ""committees to investigate the Repatriation Act. Such committees have been appointed in other countries and their recommendations have. not reacted to tbe benefit of the returned soldiers. The consequences of such committees are perhaps best .expressed in the words of Brigadier-General Ross, the president of the Canadian legion in a report to the British Empire Service League. Apropos of a suggestion made at the last Conference that Empire, head-quarters should endeavour to secure expert opinion as to attributability of certain conditions to war service, we may say that this suggestion was advanced by another organization, before this committee, as a means of dealing with commuch to our regret, was accepted. In the result, the fears expressed by our representatives at the last Conference have been, more than justified; and we have now a document which practically precludes the allowance of any further pensions in these casei'. ' That was the result of a special committee appointed to inquire into the Canadian act. The anomalies of which honourable gentlemen complain will be best adjusted through the organizations which represent the returned soldiers and not indiscriminately by bodies set up by Parliament. -The subject that I particularly want to deal with to-day concerns the Minister for Customs( Mr John Lawson), and I hope that the Ministers who are at the table will be good enough to impart to him what I have to say, with some result, I hope, before the adjournment to-morrow. The matter which I propose to mention has been the subject of discussion in this Parliament for a number of years. It relates to the question of placing an embargo or some form of tariff duty on ships built outside Australia. Agitation has been forthcoming from many quarters, but particularly from the trade unions engaged in the construction of ships in Australia. Deputations have waited upon the Government; inquiries have heen made;",43,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

194,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [4.15].,"many'suggestions have been .put forward; but time is marching on, and nothing has been.idone. The position nowreached is such .that the trade unions themselves have taken action which, they hope, will force a decision by the Government. Following upon repeated representations made in this House eight or nine months ago, the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) directed that an inquiry should be carried out by omcers of ""his department. Just what omcers were assigned to those duties I have been unable to ascertain, but I understand that a report was submitted to the Minister, and that it has been in the possession of the department for many months. Admittedly, ministerial changes have taken place, but it does not seem reasonable that a decision in this mailer should have been delayed so long. As the result of the inquiries made, the officers of the Trade and Customs Department no doubt made certain recommendations to the Minister. November last. Minister for Trade and Customs will give me credit for having repeatedly urged that this matter should be finalized, and that an indication of where the Government stands should be given. Apparently, the matter is not considered by the Government to be of sumcient importance to warrant an immediate decision, a position I very much regret. As I have indicated, it is the policy of the Government that has forced thc trade unions to take action. It. is unfortunate that that state of affairs should have arisen, but the patience of all concerned has heen sorely tried. The metal trades organizations have decided that an embargo should be placed on the carrying out of repairs to any: vessel which was purchased outside this country that could reasonably have been built, here, The object of that action is threefold: to direct public attention to this .matter; to force ship-owners to have their vessels constructed iu Australia, and thus show some patriotism towards their country, and to bring the matter forcibly under tbe notice of the Government, with a view"" to' getting a decision. The metal i (A o. 1) 1939*40;T 1961) tradesdecided to apply the embargo on and after the-30th April, 1939. Many months' notice of the embargo was igiven: Other trade unions-I refer particularly to those -engaged on ship repairs,' such as painters, dockers, &c., have decided to apply a similar embargo on and after the 1st July, 1939. The first vessel to which the embargo by the metal trades organizations has been applied is the North Coast Company's ship, the SS; Bangalo, which was constructed on' the other side of the world, despite the fact that it Could have been built in Australia! That vessel is in need of repairs, and steps were taken by the company to have 1 them effected, but the metal trades refused to do the work. Some un official talks have taken place between representatives of the unions and of the North Coast Company, and I believe that the attitude adopted by the company indicates that it is sheltering behind the failure of the Government to arrive at a decision in this matter. The company holds the view that the unions are asking it to do something in which the' Government is apparently largely disinterested. If the company feels that the Government is not very much concerned with whether or not ships are built in Australia, then it is not likely to be indifferent to the attitude of the metal trades, which can very well be the cause of considerable amount of industrial trouble. . Five weeks hence, the Hunter Biver Company will bring to Australia a new vessel for the purpose of engaging in trade on the Australian coast. This vessel haa been built in China. It will probably need repairs, docking and adjustments when it arrives, but in accordance with the decision of the trade unions, this work will not be carried out. All of this trouble has been caused by the failure of the responsible authorities, namely, the Government, to deal with the matter and to arrive at a decision. On all occasions on which I have been privileged to hear speeches made on the launching of vessels constructed in Australia, reference has been made to the Government's alleged policy of fostering the shipbuilding industry in Australia, and high praise has been paid for the workmanship displayed in the vessels'.",44,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40
195,Mr White,The report was made in,45,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40
196,Mr Beasley,"I think that the exI t has also been claimed that, as Australia is an island continent, isolated from carried out. The owners of these vessels other parts of the world, great importance must be attached to having its own mercantile marine, and shipbuilding industry. Apparently, these speeches have merely been empty phrases, because no practical steps have been taken to put the Government's expressed desire into effect. There is, however, a limit to such things, and people listen to speeches only for a reasonable time. If the Government does not live up to its declarations the time will come when steps will be taken to force it to do so. On the question of the comparative costs of vessels built in Australia and overseas, some interesting evidence has been produced at interviews. It has been pointed out that, after meeting commitments in connection with exchange, the provision of a crew to bring the vessel to Australia, member has exhausted his time. the return of its members to their homeland, and many other costs incidental to the importation of a ship, there is not very much difference between the total cost of a vessel purchased overseas and one built in Australia. It does seem, therefore, that this matter is one on which the Government should make a very definite declaration. Not long after the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Spender) came into this Parliament, somewhere in his electorate, he made a speech which dealt extensively with the shipbuilding industry and received a considerable degree of publicity in the week-end newspapers. thought, at the time, that there was certainly no harm in a new recruit feeling so keenly on a subject, so long as he would subsequently endeavour to have his ideas carried into effect. Nothing, however, has been done. I suggest that, now that the honourable gentleman is a member of the Government, he should play his part in an endeavour to have the Government arrive at a decision. According to present indications, to-morrow afternoon Parliament will go into a recess which will probably last two months. In the meantime, more vessels, which have been purchased overseas instead of in Australia, will be arriving in Australian ports and may be put into dockyards for repairs. According to the embargo which has been decided upon by the various Mr Reaslcp. trade unions, these repairs will not be will no doubt realize that it was not a sound policy to have their ships built outside Australia, because the small amount which they might have saved by so doing will be lost when their vessels are tied up alongside the wharves. I hope that the Government will be prompted by this state of affairs to take some action. This matter has a very important hearing on employment, and also has some association with a measure which has not yet been finally disposed of by Parliament, namely, the States Grants (Youth Employment) Bill 1939, because there is no industry which offers such a wide range of, employment for apprentices as does the shipbuilding industry. honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) drew attention this afternoon to the need for amending the Australian Soldiers Eepatriation Act in its relation to disabilities and pensions generally. The Minister( Mr Harrison), in his reply, suggested that the measure was satisfactory in its present form, and that the Repatriation Department has adequate power. I disagree with that view. Cases are continually coming under my notice which. indicate that the act needs amending. I have, in mind the extraordinary case of a young man who, on the advice of Sir JohnI Monash, went to America to complete his education. While there, he was stricken with tuberculosis. His case was considered by two of the largest medical associations of America, and each declared that his condition was due to war service. A special board of inquiry dealt with the case upon his return to Australia and his application for a pension was rejected. Such cases make it clear that the act needs amending. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) had something to say about the problem of unemployment, but he, like a good many other honourable members of the Parliament, rarely gives any consideration to the cause of unemployment. The honourable member for West. Sydney( Mr Beasley) has just made certain demands upon the Government in",45,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

The high tariff policy of Australia has had a great deal to do with the seriousness of its uncouragement given to, our wool and wheat employment problem. I have, year after year, referred in this Parliament to the value of our export trade.

Our high tariff policy has undoubtedly hindered the development of our agricultural and pastoral industries. Our markets abroad have been limited because our high duties have made it impossible for manufacturers overseas to sell goods in this country. I .admit that the Government has attempted, by means of the flour tax, to help the wheat industry; but a far more comprehensive scheme for the stabilization of wheat prices is essenmoney through the Commonwealth Bank. tial. I hope that some further proposals will be advanced hy the Government in the.near future for the assistance of the \vhe..t-growers to enable them to carry on their operations profitably and avoid the destitution with whicli they are threatened. The help givpu under the flour tax is too small in view of the present low price of wheat. Wo must increase our export trade if we are to provide the money needed in this country for public works and general developmental projects. In Great Britain and Germany money can be obtained in ways not open to Australia. Great Britain, for example, is a wealthy country with many foreign investments. The accumulated surpluses of many years and the reserves that have been aggregated there are available for periods of stress. I remember reading just lately a report which caused a good deal of comment in my own district tp the effect that Herr Hitler was able to obtain money from the Reich Bank free of interest. I .took some trouble to ascertain the facts and I learned from Report XII. of the League of Nations, covering the period 1928 to 1935, that Herr Hitler in 1934 floated a 4$ per cent, conversion loan for 300,000.000 reichmarks at 95 per. cent. In 1935, a 4^ per cent, loan for 500.000,000 reichmarks was over subscribed. The price at issue was 98 per cent. A second series of loans covering 500.000.000 reichmarks issued at ii per cent, was taken up entirely by savings banks and clearing banks, and another 4i ner cent, loan for 200.000,000 reichmarks was al«o issued. dicate that Herr Hitler was able to obtain unlimited sums of money through Mr Gregory. the Reich Bank, but in actual fact he had to consolidate this short term indebtedness by converting it to long-term loans, for up to June, 1936, long-term loans covering 3,400,000,000 reichmarks was issued of which 1,500,000,000 reichmarks was raised by public subscription; 1,125,000,000 by savings bank subscriptions; 700,000,000 by insurance companies; and 75,000,000 by co-operative societies. This should be a complete answer to certain honourable members who think that the Government of this country could raise unlimited sums of That kind of thing cannot be done in a debtor country.. I wish to say that I approve of the policy the Commonwealth Bank has adopted as a central bank. It has provided for some extension of credit. An examination of the bank returns for some years ago indicates that prior to the* bank operating as a central bank amounts aggregating 60 per cent, or 70 per cent, of deposits were advanced. In the last few years, however, advances up to 95 per cent, of deposits have been made. In one year, advances aggregating 105 per cent, more than the total bank deposits were made. This could be done only because the Commonwealth Bank acted as a central bank. I suggest to the Government that it should make provision in the Commonwealth Bank Bill shortly to be placed before Parliament for the Commonwealth Bank to fix the maximum rate of interest to be paid on deposits and the maximum rate to he charged for advances. Although this policy might not receive unanimous endorsement, it would, in my opinion, be wise. Some years ago the Savings Bank of Tasmania offered 5-J per cent, interest on deposits .with the result that the trading banks lost a good deal of their business. The Savings Bank of Western Australia at one period offered 5 per cent, interest to depositors.

If the Commonwealth Bank, as the central bank, were clothed with power to determine maximum rates of interest for This might indeposits and maximum rates of interest for advances it would be in tbe best interest of the whole country, for it would have a tendency to depress interest rates. That is very desirable at present. I congratulate the Commonwealth Bank Board upon its work in the last couple of years in keeping interest rates at a low figure. This, with the existing exchange rate, has done a good deal to assist our export trade. In conclusion, I urge the Government to give close attention to the devising of ways and means to assist our wool industry which at present is suffering severely from the growing competition of artificial fibres and also from the effects of restricted markets due to our high tariff policy. The wheat-growers also deserve more consideration than they are receiving, and the Government should introduce a comprehensive wheat stabilization scheme without delay and so ensure a greater degree of future security for this industry -prescribed for doctors in that country? desire to discuss what many honourable members might regard as a ticklish subject, namely, the policy of this Government, which it inherited from the previous Government, of admitting 15,000 Jewish refugees to Australia during the next three years. I do not wish to be misunderstood. My opposition tp this proposal is far stronger than if the immigrants were of the Nordic race, and came from Northern European countries, from the north of Italy or from Jugo-Slavia. People from those places would help to develop Australia. I recognize that many Jews have rendered signal service to humanity, and this is true of the Jews in Australia also. To sueh men as the late Sir John Monash, and the ex-Governor General, Sir Isaac Isaacs, we must all lift our hats. It seems true, however, lhat if we want people to come to this country, we want people who will help to develop it. already sufficient people here in business and in the professions-in what may be regarded as the more sheltered jobs which should provide the natural openings for educated young Australians, and goodness knows there are enough of them. The Jews, on the other hand, are essentially a trading people. I do not say that disparagingly, but I point out that we Iiave plenty of trades and business people in Australia, now, and the Jews who are coming here will be of no help to a producing country like. Australia. Thousands of young Australians who have passed the leaving examination are looking for a chance to enter the professions. Nevertheless, at this very time, legislation is being passed in New South Wales to give refugee doctors from Austria the right to practise without passing any medical examination. A certain number of them is to be absorbed every year. I maintain that there are plenty of Australians fitted for such positions, and that for every Jew who is given a professional job in Australia an Australian will be shut out. It is true that Jewish doctors are to be examined by a medical board which will certify as to their attainments, but what chance would an Australian doctor have of being allowed .to practise in Palestine unless he first passed the examination I make bold to say that his chance would be very slender. The unemployed problem in Australia is most acute amongst unskilled workers, and we want our educated lads to be able to go forward to the professions. During the depression, I interviewed the Director of Education in Victoria on behalf of an applicant for a position as a junior teacher in the Education. Department. In order to secure the position, it was necessary that an applicant should possess a leaving certificate, which represents a fairly high standard of education, but the director told me that . there were already .1.50 young people on the waiting list who had not only ' passed the leaving examination, but had also passed it with honours. ' Those youths had been unable to get into otber professions, and were seeking to become teachers. I know boys in the country, at the present time, with leaving certificates, who are carting wood, and yet we are There are bringing professional and trading people from overseas, who vvill use their special talents to create trusts and combines, for which they have a peculiar genius. Why is it necessary for the Jews to leave Europe? I have no anti-Jewish feeling, and no racial hatred. I"" recognize that the Australian-born Jew and the Britishborn Jew have as much right in Australia as we have ourselves. They have the same ideals as we have, but the Jew born",47,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

Ward Price, who was German correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, has written a book called I know these Dictators, in which he discusses this problem. I am not trying to excuse Hitle r for his persecution of the Jews, but it is only f a i r to point out that there may have been some reason for his wishing them to go elsewhere. It is interesting to point out that Canada refused to make itself a haven for J ewish refugees; it, was left to Australia to open its arms to them. Mr Ward Price wroteIn the confusion after the war a. fresh Jewish invasion of Germany took place. It came from Poland and Galicia. The cause of this migration was the collapse of German currency, whicli gave the Jews of neighbouring uountries u chance after their own hearts to make big profits. Any one coming to Germany at that time with foreign funds could buy up businesses, houses and other properties at fantastically low oost. The Jew who left Lemberg or Cracow, witb tiie equivalent of a few hundred pounds found himself, on reaching Berlin, a capitalist with the financial resources required to give his ability full scope. And while these meaner elements of the Jewish race were exploiting Germau depression, the intelligentsia of tlie same stock were getting a stranglehold on the learned professions. Although the statistics of synagogue membership showed the Jews as forming only 1 per cent, of the total population of Germany, 45 per cent, of the professors of Berlin Faculty of Medicine were Jews when Hitler ciwue to power, and the Jewish practitioners of the three chief municipal hospitals of Moabit, Friedrichstein and Neukolln are reeorded to have formed 50, 63 and 67 per rent, respectively of the whole staff. Jewish doctors and surgeons were numerous even in Catholic hospitals. Under the Republic the public-relations officials in three of the principal German Ministries were Jews. The proportion of Jewish lawyers varied from 29 per cent at Dortmund to 64 per cent, at Frankfurt, 00 per cent, in Berlin, and 67 per cent, at Brcslau. Jews -'nnrinated the Berlin Stock Exchange. Of 234 theatrical managers in Germany. 50.4 per cent, were Jews, and in the capital Jewish predominance was four out of five. The ready-made clothing and multiple-store business nf Germany wns practically a Hebrew monopoly. Most intolerable of all from the Nazi point of view was the fact that tlie popular press and publishing-houses were largely staffed and controlled by Jews, with the two outstanding nonwrns of TJUetein and Rudolf Mosse at their heads.

Jew, and one would not expect him to be anything other than an apologist for the Mr C. Jews, the people who are trying to dominate Australia. Does the Minister suggest that in Germany, a country where the people are of high intelligence, the Jews were of such outstanding intellectual .ability that for that reason alone they were able to dominate the learned professions ? reason for that. Jewish fathers were able to put their sons into the professions, although we know that there is always sufficient taleni among the working classes to fill professional positions, provided educational facilities are available, as has been demonstrated in this country and elsewhere. I have not the time to discuss this matter f u l l y , but I desire to point out some examples of Jewish influence in Australia. Most of the cut-price tobacco shops in the suburbs in Melbourne and elsewhere are run by Jews, most of them recent arrivals Australian tobacconists have told me that the ordinary practice is to obtain their tobacco through an -intermediary, and the retailers are not allowed to sell below a fixed price. The cut-price shops, however, which are controlled by alien Jews, obtain their tobacco by the ton from the big companies. Thef u r shops are completely in thc control of Jews. Even little shops for the mending of stockings, some of them a mere hole in the wall where a little Australiau gir l can be seen working, have behind them a Jew who controls the business. The mantle shops, where mantles priced atten and twenty guineas, allegedly exclusive models from Paris, are for sale, are also Jewish-owned, though the Jew's name does not, appear, of course. The practice is to import one or t w o Paris models, and then bave them copied in Australia. There is a well-known mammoth emporium in Melbourne which is controlled by Jews. When trade is slack, the workers are told to take a couple of weeks",49,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40

So far as Australia is concerned they are not required here; we have enough exploiters among our own people, but these other people are the kings of exploiters. I shall take an opportunity to continue my remarks later. wish to supplement my previous remarks relating to the administration of the Repatriation Department. SinceI last spoke, the Minister( Mr Harrison) has replied to the general debate on this matter. I regret that he was not present when I was speaking. The representations made by other honourable members and myself were based on humanitarian grounds. Nothing we said could be construed as an attack on the Government, the Minister or the Repatriation Commission. The Minister stressed a few obvious facts. All of us know that the act is a good one, and that it provides benefits for thousands of returned men. However, the Minister did not tell honourable memhers that pensions are paid to only 77,000, whereas over 300,000 men enlisted, or that the average pension works out at £1 19s. 6d. a fortnight, which is a little less than the old-age pension. He adopted a rather contemptuous attitude. He suggested that 1, as the honourable member who had introduced the subject under discussion, should have cleared up the anomalies complained of when I was a member of the Government. When I suggested that 1. had heen Minister for Repatriation for about two months he replied that I had been a Miniater for many years. I have always practised, not only by word but also by deed, the principle of preference to returned soldiers. It is, perhaps, not irrelevant to mention that because I had In that business Australian no need of it I surrendered my own pension, realizing that many who were entitled to it needed it more than I did. Indeed, many men who are entitled to the pension have not yet succeeded in getting it. The Minister has not sufficient perception to realize that the act needs overhauling. I suggest that he would alter his views if he studied his files or honourable members receive from returned men on this matter. The Minister has That classic challenged what I did, or failed to do, as a member of the Cabinet generally in respect of repatriation matters; but this is not a question of what I or any other individual Minister did or did not do. Cabinet as a whole had this question at heart. The honourable memhers for Moreton( Mr Francis), Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) and North Sydney( Mr Hughes) and I brought forward many reforms and assisted in putting them through/including the restoration of commuted pensions and the initiation of the service pension. Indeed, the last was brought within the bounds of financial possibility through my suggestion that it should be paid to men who had served in a theatre of war. I also suggested paying the old-age or service pension for nurses at the age of 55. When the present Attorney-General was temporarily out of the Cabinet, I persuaded the Repatriation Commission to adopt a more sympathetic and practical attitude in its treatment of ex-prisoners of war. Over 4,100 of our soldiers were prisoners in Germany and Turkey, yet some of those who survive to-day cannot possibly secure evidence concerning their state of health while they were held prisoners. adopted a very contemptuous attitude.

The case is rendered more pathetic still when many of these' women have the' impression that on the death of their husbands they will receive a pension automatically. The fact that only about 77,000 men out of a total enlistment of over 300,000 are receiving pensions is evidence that tlie department is not prodigal in the granting of pensions. Returned men are not mendicants. we might find one who is not deserving of sympathy, hut in the main they spurn charity. Indeed, it is because of that attitude that many of them find themselves now unable to qualify for a pension under the existing law. On their return they discarded khaki, and said that that was the end of it. In middle age, however, when ill health, arising often from their war service, afflicts them, and fhey see that a sum of over £7,000,000 a. year is being paid in repatriation services for returned soldiers, they naturally believe that they are entitled to every consideration, although they have had no cause to apply for it over the course of years: The Government should insert in this legislation a presumptive clause.

In that way, the legislation would be made humanitarian as well as judicial, and would thus render to returned men their true rights, as some compensation ih keeping with the promises made fo them when they enlisted. ; propose to deal with an answer supplied in' reply to a question which I asked the Minister for Defence( Mr Street) with regard to the defence of the northern part of Queensland. I first discussed this matter with the Minister, who was very sympathetically disposed towards my view, when I suggested that something should be done to improve our defences in that area. Subsequently I asked him on notice whether he was aware that north-eastern Australia was not only vul-' nerable, but also undefended. Inhis reply the Minister set out reasons why "" my statement was without foundation"". It is to reply to this -statement that I now rise. As' specific Occasionally measures, that were being taken for the defence of Queensland^ and Northern Australia he mentioned the improvement of the fixed coast defences at Brisbane and the provision of air force squadrons at Brisbane and Townsville. I remind him that Brisbane is one thousand miles from Cairns, and 1,500 miles from Thursday Island. One would think from the Minister's reply that air force squadrons had already been established in the centres mentioned, whereas at present not one member of the permanent air force is 'stationed in Queensland. I have received a copy of a letter which the Minister for Defence forwarded to the town clerk of Cairns, who asked for the establishment of an aerial squadron at that centre to enable some* of the youths of the Cairns. district to receive instruction in aviation, in which it is . stated that those desirous of being trained in such a squadron would first have to attend ordinary drills in order to become eligible. Apparently the authorities overlook the fact that they could be drilled only at Townsville, which This is 200 miles south of Cairns. Tf wpuld appear that the Minister and those advising him are not very conversant with thc geography of Queensland. Many persons in that State realizing the unsettled state overseas are vitally concerned with their defenceless position. The Minister for Defence also said the defence of Queensland would be assisted by "" the development of Darwin as a naval and fuelling operational base"". Apparently ' the Minister and those advising him overlook ' the fact that Darwin is approximately '500 miles west of Thursday Island, and that in the absence of direct railway communication and efficient roads, water transport is thc only means",51,Supply Bill No 1 1939 40
212,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [5.12],"Iof communication between Queensland and Darwin. Surely the defence experts realize that an attack upon Australia from the north would he made not on Darwin, but on some portion of the Queensland coast, where an army could obtain all that it required. That coast, which extends for over 1,500 miles, is not defended in any way hy aircraft or antiaircraft guns, and in the opinion of the Government, the security of the State is assured by the natural protection afforded by the Great Barrier Reef. But is the Government admiralty charts of that reef are hopelessly obsolete and that the representatives of a certain northern nation who risit the Queensland waters frequently know every navigable opening in it? Their charts of Queensland waters are up to date. It has been suggested that the openings in that reef could be mined, but although the defence authorities do not know all the openings in the reef they are all known to a potential enemy. The argument may be advanced that no foreign power would risk bringing even a portion of its fleet through the barrier reef, but that is ridiculous because interstate vessels negotiate certain channels almost daily. Some adhere to the recognized .steamer routes, but there are others which do not, because they know the waters surrounding thc reef as well as a Sydney Harbour pilot knows Port It is useless the Minister and his advisors saying that the Great Barrier Reef will afford all the protection necessary, because in the circumstances I have mentioned, it is only reasonable to assume that the openings in the reef would be used by those fully conversant with them. The residents of Cairns, Townsville, Port Alma, and Gladstone, as well as thosn inland, the defence of Queensland, because in they could not offer any resistance. It is useless to speak of what our naval force, depleted as it is, could do, or of the assistance which could he afforded by the Royal Australian Air Force to such a remote and unprotected part of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, the activities of these two important services are concentrated in New South ""Wales or Victoria, to the detriment of the northern State. Mr Riordan. The Minister also said that Queensland could be defended by the ""provision of mixed posts and anti-aircraft defence "". The only coastal defences provided in Queensland are in the vicinity of Brisbane. In referring to "" local seaward defences "", I suppose the Minister means anti-submarine devices or mines, but had war occurred in September last, the nearest mine depot was at Swan Island, some thousands of miles away. Unless supplies have been despatched recently, I do not believe that aware that even the one mine is available in Queensland and there are no anti-submarine devices in that State. The Minister also said that ""fortress troops and a mobile garrison at Darwin"" would assist. Surely the authorities realize that the only effective means of communication with Darwin is by water. This suggestion is ridiculous. The Minister also mentioned "" the erection of a strategic wireless naval station at Darwin"". That might be of service, but only as a means of facilitating communication between various points. "" Provision of two air force squadrons at Darwin"" is another alleged means of defending Queensland. That port is being developed to operate in conjunction with Singapore, which was fortified for the protection of Britain's trade with China, a trade that has Jackson. now largely disappeared. If a northern power should become hostile to Austra-;< Iia, Singapore will be challenged despite what has been said as to its impregnability. I feel very strongly on this matter, and object to the way in which representations concerning the effective defence of Queensland have been disregarded. The fortification of Darwin would be of no benefit whatever to northarc deeply interested iu ern Queensland, because an attack on Australia would be made not at Darwin the event of an invasion, but on the north-eastern coast. Many organizations in Queensland, including chambers of commerce, shire councils, returned soldiers' organizations and branches of the Australian Labour party are annoyed at the inactivity of the Government, and believe that in the event of war Queensland would become a second Manchukuoa base from which the enemy could operate. Should an enemy land in Queensland, the most fertile portion of Australia, it would not be long before the whole of Australia would have to surrender. If the Government is sincere in its endeavour to protect Australia it should take immediate steps to safeguard that 1,500 miles of unprotected coastline of, Queensland, and in that way afford some security, not only to those on the coastal strip, but also the others in the western portion of Queensland, whose interests are now jeopardized.

If a returned soldier applies for a pension he has first to appear before the commission, and if his application is rejected he can then approach the board and finally the Entitlement Tribunal. I submit that the applicant for a war pension has to go before too many boards and that if the Entitlement Board, the Assessment Board and the commission it self were merged into one substantial body the interests of the returned soldiers would be better served because the almost interminable delays which applicants experience in having their applications determined would be eliminated. result of a multiplicity of boards generally is injustice. professor said the other day that the medical profession had no cure for 224 diseases, and cures for only seven. mentioned that faot to the chairman of a repatriation board recently and he told me that I would interfere with the prospects of the man for whom I was appearing if I made such statements. I replied "" I have nothing more to say to you as chairman because you are not administering this legislation in the way in which the community expects you to administer it. You are here to help the soldiers and not to be prejudiced against them "". On another occasion, I sought permission from a. repatriation tribunal to accompany the returned soldier whom I was representing before the doctor who would examine him, but permission was refused on the ground that no doctor would examine any one in the presence of a layman. I asked one of the leading medical men of Sydney, a friend of mine of 30 years standing, if this were so and he said that he had never been in favour of allowing a layman to be present when he was examining a patient. The presence of 'the soldiers' advocates at medical examinations would be helpful to the soldiers concerned and steps should be taken to make that possible. If the advocates know what is happening, I am soldiers get a f a i r deal.

236,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [7.30],"it is necessary that the growers, numbering approximately 3,000 in Queensland, should know in a week or so whether the bounty is to be continued at the same rate, whether it is to be increased or whether it ia to be reduced, so that they may decide whether it will pay them better to continue to grow cotton, or turn their lands to some other use. The existing legislation, which was introcarry on very successfully. For 193S, duced in 1934, provides for the payment of a bounty at a basic rate of 4id. pei lb. on raw cotton when the Liverpool prion of American middling cotton is 6d. per lb., and the rate of the bounty goes up or down as the Liverpool price goes down or up. It is of great importance to Australia that we should produce, in this country, sufficient raw cotton for our own requirements. Unfortunately, we are not doing so at the present time. ""We need 18,000,000 lb. of raw cotton, or 36,000 bales, a year. In 1938, Queensland produced 4,773,936 lb., or 9,548 bales at about 500 lb. to the bale. The acreage under cotton for 1939 was 46,000, making an average of 15 acres for each of the 3,000 growers. It is clear, therefore, shows that difficulties have been that this is a small man's crop. State that grows cotton? During the season the cotton-growing industry provides employment for 2,000 pickers and 1,200 field workers. oil mills employ ahout another 100 persons. Seeing that we did not grow enough cotton to meet our own requirements last year, we had to import 13,357,291 lb., which is the equivalent of 26,714 bales. I hope that, with proper encouragement, we could grow in Australia all that we need. The secondary branches of the cotton industry provide direct employment for 2,600 persons. According to press reports, one of the largest cotton-spinners, Davies Coop Proprietary Limited, intends to establish a mill in Adelaide with a capital of £250,000, another in Sydney with a capital of £500,000, and another in Queensland with a capital of £250,000. In the next two or three years we shall need not less than 52,000 bales, or 26,000,000 lb. of raw cotton. The cotton-growing industry is in need of further assistance which can be given in various ways. First, there should be a generous bounty system announced at once, before land has to be prepared for the next crop. Secondly, by means of irrigation the growers, in some districts could treble their production. If they could produce one bale, or 500 lb. of cotton, to the acre they would be able to the growers averaged only one-third of a bale to the acre. That accounts for the lack of prosperity in the industry, and makes difficulties and hardships for those working on wages. Most of the growers were themselves working for wages a short while ago. They acquired blocks of land on which they first grew cotton and later put cows and raised pigs, besides growing 1.5 to 20 acres of cotton. They are working men in the best sense of the word, and they would be willing to pay decent wages to those they employ if the industry could afford it. The fact that there has been no substantial increase in the quantity of cotton produced encountered, some of them due to lack of rain at the right time, and others to inadequacy of the bounty. This could be largely overcome by means of irrigation. The Government should at least continue the bounty at the present rate, if it is not prepared to make an increase. I am of opinion that a good case could be made The cotton ginneries and cotton out for more generous assistance. The Minister for Trade and Customs should take the matter up with Cabinet, and the Prime Minister could arrange with the State governments to make money available for expenditure on irrigation schemes. Farmers with 50 acres of irrigable land-and there are many such in the Dawson Valley, Callide Valley, and the Northern Burnett-could , with proper rotation of crops, produce three bales of cotton to the acre, or 1,500 lb. The growers at the present time are very dissatisfied with conditions in the industry, particularly with the low yield, which accounts for high overhead costs and low net return. In some years the cotton is actually produced at a loss. During the last two seasons, the acreage has been increased, but production has declined, due mostly to unfavorable seasons.

238,Mr Forde,"Yes, so far as I know.year, in California, 750,000 bales of cotton were produced from 620,000 acres One bale of seed cotton to the acre which equals 1,500 lb. of raw cotton, is the average in California^ where it is grown wholly by irrigation; If that can be done in California, it could be done here, so that we should be able to look forward : to producing 1,700 lb. of raw cotton to the acre. The average yield in Queensland at the present time is 300 lb. If we go on expanding the secondary branches of the industry we shall require before long 300,000 bales of raw cotton each year. This is a matter which cannot be left to the State governments; it must be tackled by the Federal Government, working in co-operation with the States. Apart from the payment of a bounty, the Oommonwealth could assist in many ways with the help of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. If all cord tyre yarns in this country were made from Australian grown cotton, we should require an additional 25,000 bales of raw cotton, and another 15,000 bales would be needed for the manufacture of condenser yarns. The question of protection for the cotbefore he can afford to buy dairy cattle ton industry was referred to the Tariff : Board in August of last year, and it is Minister to make some definite pronouncetime the Government announced what it ment as to the Government's intention intends to do regarding the board's rein regard to this industry, in order that commendation It is not usual for reports the growers will not be held in suspense. of. the board to be made available until Naturally, many of them will refrain the Government has reached a decision from putting in increased acreage if they regarding them. I understand that the are left in doubt. They have been told report of the board on this question was to go in for increased acreage, but if they presented to the Government some time, cannot be sure that they are going to ago., since when there has been ample make a profit, many will abandon the opportunity reaching a decision.

T remind the Minister that the spends a good deal of time considering primary producers in Queensland realize these matters before they are presented that Australia has adopted a protectionist to Cabinet, which is then able to reach policy and do not begrudge protection a speedy decision. I have had personal being given to any of our secondary inexperience in dealing with legislation on dustries. However, they ask for a share this .matter. When I was Minister for ih the benefits of that policy. It is the Trade and Customs, I introduced a Raw Minister's duty to let them know immeCotton Bounty Bill myself, and was indiately where they stand, because within strumental in having tariff protection the next few weeks they must prepare afforded to a large range of cotton goods land for the next planting, and any delay manufactured by factories in Australia, would cause them serious embarrassment. resulting in an increased ' demand for The' production of raw cotton, of course, Mr Forde. Australian-grown cotton. A great stimu^ lus was given to the industry by ' that protection,, and by the bounty on raw cotton.' The industry, which had almost gone out of existence, was first revived by the payment of a guaranteed price of 5d. per lb. for seed cotton by the Queensland Labour Government in 1920. Later,-the-Commonwealth took the matter over, and a bounty was granted. Successive -federal governments of vdrious political colours have since dealt with the. matter. I sincerely hope that the present Minister will not let the growers' down. I extend an invitation to him to visit the cotton growing districts in Queensland so that he may see for himself what an important part the industry plays in making possible closer settlement of the land. Large pastoral properties, which formerly gave employment to 20 or 30 persons, have been cut up, and now furnish a livelihood' for 10,000 or 12,000 persons, who are engaged in cotton growing, pig raising,""and dairying. This is a small man's industry. It is one that enables a man to go out and clear the land and make a. living or go in for pig raising. I appeal to the for considering it and industry altogether, as happened in conThe cities to swell the ranks of the unemis 'linked up with our defence preparations. I point out that those .directly depending on the industry for a livelihood include 3,000 growers, 2,000 cottonpickei-Sj about 1,200 field workers and over 100 mill-hands. All of these people are anxious to know what is going to happen' to their industry. The growers, of course, also need to be certain of the future--.before they can order necessary implements or engage labour. Minister's pronouncement is not favorable: they will be able to proceed immediately with the planting of other crops. : From a defence point of view it would be disastrous to allow any to. abandon the industry, but that is what will happen if the Minister cannot allay their apprehensions by making some definite pronouncement this evening. to bring several matters under the notice rison). Some time ago, business people in a small country town which does not possess a bank asked me to see whether it would be possible to arrange for the registration of mails on the morning of the day on which the train left the town. The regulations ordinarily provide that a .registered letter must be delivered for registration one hour before the closing time. ..: If that regulation; were adhered to in this instance, it would .bring the closing,.time for registered mails to an hour before the post office .opened. Con: sequently, these business people are obliged to register valuables, including remittances, and leave them in a small post office over-night subject to the risk of burglary or fire. The department originally refused my request on this matter, advising me that the regulation must be observed. At that time the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), who has had some experience in an.allowance post office, was Postmaster-General. ""When I approached him he said that he had been in this particular town, and .when I showed him the department's letter refusing to grant this request he replied, "" That is ridiculous; whilc'I am Postmaster-General, I expect the department to render service"". He made a minute on the letter advising the officers concerned that he expected the department to render service nnd pointing out that having had experience in an .allowance post office he had no doubtthai all of the registered mail in this case could be handled inside a quarter of an hour. The matter was reviewed and the country postmaster concerned was advised that he could receive letters for registration up to within twenty minutes of the closing time for the ordinary mails, which meant 50 minutes beI f the fore the departure of the train. Now, however, because of red tape or' some petty viewpoint taken by some officer, people wishing to register mail in this country town are also obliged to pay a late letter fee. Some officers of the department, do not hesitate to inconvenience people living in the back-blocks. I urge the Postmaster-General( Mr Harrison) to see that the instruction issued by his predecessor in this case is carried. out I am .pleased to note from press reports that the Government is determined to carry out the resolution agreed upon by the Cabinet at its meeting in Hobart to abolish the surcharge of 4d. on interstate telegrams. I and the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) fought strenously for this reform for years. Because our electorates lie on State borders some people think that the matter affects only people, residing near such boundaries, but the alteration will apply to all telegrams despatched,, including those between the capital cities. This surcharge is not only anomalous, but also out of keeping witli 'the spirit of federation. The department places a limitation of £50 on its contribution towards the cost of erecting a telephone line in country areas whether the line be required by one. two or three subscribers. It pays no regard to the fact that where more than one subscriber is interested it will receive greater revenue. I urge the Postmaster General to increase the department's contribution in reasonable proportion to the increased revenue which will be received when more than one subscriber is concerned. My next point deals ' with broadcasting listeners' licences. Many schools in country centres install wireless sets from which they receive a distinct advantage.

There is a home-consumpI also ask that the Government In 1932, the Federal Gofacture. It has been the policy As the result of the cause in that instance the Government I now wish to deal with the site selected Junee and Narrandera which show that. there is considerable dissatisfaction concerning the selected site and the report made by certain officials of the Royal Australian Air Force. The communication from Narrandera states that sufficient allowance was not made for the comparatively perfect surface of the suggested site at that centre, and that in one day one man could level off the undulations and fill in the crahholes. According to a report in the Wagga Advertiser, it will cost £12,000 to place the selected site at Wagga in reasonable order. The land at Wagga is to cost £10,500, whilst that at Narrandera would cost only £5,000. Reference was also made to a railway crossing between the buildings on the landing ground at Wagga, which would interfere to some degree, but such an objection does not exist at Narrandera. Moreover, those who reported on the sites did not refer to the fact that a new defence highway will pass right through Narrandera, and will pass the border of the suggested aerodrome site. There is not any railway connection with the suggested site at Narrandera, but the people in that, town were prepared to arrange for the construction at a small cost of the necessary 4 miles to establish communication. Moreover, the authorities disregarded the fact that a new waterpipe line is under construction at Ganmain and that filtered water could be obtained quite as cheaply as on the site at Wagga. In the matter of electric power, there is to be connection between the scheme at Burrinjuck aud the Yanco power-house. It will be seen that a considerably larger amount is t.o be expended by thc Government, in the purchase of and in preparing the ground at Wagga than would be necessary nt Narrandera. The prevalence of fogs at Wagga is also a decided, menace. Reports from Wagga state that there have been nine fogs in a year, but the records are taken after 9 o'clock and fogs are usually more dense before that hour. I urge the Minister for Defence to give further consideration to the extra cost that will be involved, and to realize thatsafer conditions exist at Narrandera than at Wagga and at a greatly reduced cost. The residents of Junee have also complained that there are fewer fogs in that locality and that the Junee site is more suitable than the Wagga site. I realize that the powers of the Government over monopolies are very limited, but such menaces to industry and to consumers should be controlled Power kerosene is a commodity used extensively by many farmers and others on the land, particularly in tractors, and means should be provided to reduce its cost. The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, in which the Government has a controlling interest, could be used to supply farmers with power kerosene without the necessity of distributing it through agents as at present, thus adding to the cost. If farmers could obtain supplies from the works in Sydney and have it distributed at the ordinary wholesale Sydney price through a farmers' representative, considerable savings could be effected. There would be no charge for commission and no business risks, as payment could be made befoTe delivery. A saving of £20 a truck load could be effected which would be equivalent to an advantage of one penny on each bushel of wheat. As the wheat-growers are experiencing considerable difficulties in many ways, I trust that the Government will give earnest consideration to the suggestion I have made.

The record of the Government in respect of cotton production will inspire confidence in the minds of all cotton-growers. The Government has subsidized the land under cultivation for cotton to about £2 10s. an acre per annum, which I regard as substantial assistance. This subsidy works out at £40 per annum per grower, which must be of considerable help to those engaged in the industry. I have already assured the cotton-growers that the Government will continue to do a fair thing by them; hut every one will admit that the mere granting of a bounty cannot in itself guarantee the efficiency of the industry. I hold the view very strongly that we should do something more in order to attain a higher measure of efficiency than has so far been reached, and it is for th.it purpose that I am now considering a scheme under which the Commonwealth Government will co-operate with the State government with a view to devising a plan for growing cotton under irrigation, and improving cultural and scientific methods. It is recognized in greatest difficulties of the growers is the cost of production, and that that cost cannot be lowered appreciably unless it is possible in some way to greatly increase production. It is estimated that with proper irrigation it would be possible to increase the yield threefold, and if the yield were trebled it is only reasonable to assume that the cost of production would be considerably reduced. should like .to see a scheme formulated whereby assistance could be given to the growers in that direction. The Tariff Board has submitted its report after a thorough investigation of the industry and that report is now receiving the attenthat the Public Service Board, in its tion of the Government. Leader of the Opposition may rest assured that there will be no avoidable delay in making a pronouncement as to the future intentions of the Government in this respect. remarks which time will permit me to make are prompted by a letter which I have received from a returned soldier. WhatT have to say will be in'the nature of a plea for better consideration for reconnexion with defence works. My correspondent was one of those who answered the first call for volunteers in 1914, served at Gallipoli, and afterwards rendered three years of meritorious service. He is now married witli. three children to support and is unfortunately out of work. For over twelve years he has been subject to periods of unemployment in the government service, but owing to the system in operation he is not permitted to remain at work sufficiently long to qualify for a permanent position. In twelve years he has been out of work for four years, and at present he says that he has been unemployed for the last three months. That is a most unfortunate position for a man who has to maintain a wife and family, particularly in view of his war record. I feel that there is a responsibility upon the Government and upon the people to do more than is being done for the ex-service men. A portion of his letter readsTheA i r Raids Precautions stipulate middle or exempt men so tliat mobilization would not entail dislocation. Why mot apply it to new Australia that one of the vacancies created by defence activities; and after twenty . years' delay absorb ust Nitches can be found in the new "" B "" reserves without pay and similar nitches could surely be found in the paid service. A great deal of money has been spent on defence and I believe that ex-soldiers have a first call on employment for defence purposes.

256,Mr George Lawson,"I amfuture influence Cabinet to make available sufficient money to carry out this important and urgent work. [S.25] I intend to raise a matter in advance of fact. I spoke to the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Spender) about it this morning. It arose here in 1936 during my original term, when there were suggestions that the dissolution of this House would take place, and that honourable members would go to the country on the same day as the referendum was taken. The argument advanced in support of the contention at that time does not fit in with the constitutional position with which we arc faced to-day. It was argued then that the representative of the Crown in the Commonwealth of Australia has no alternative but to abide by whatever advice is tendered by the Prime Minister for the time being in office. The Minister was not in this chamber at that time, but there was very serious disagreement of opinion on tbe point as to whether that is a correct statement of the relationship between the Prime Minister of the day and the tive of the Crown. I -raise the point to-night because I think, as T thought in 1.936, that some authoritative statement of the constitutional relationship between the Crown and his advisers is necessary. We hear a good deal about the changed conditions which will apply in the Dominions consequent upon the adoption of the Statute of Westminster. I do not know if that was the argument behind the contention advanced in 1936, but I do know that I felt so strongly on the matter that I drafted and placed upon the notice paper a notice of motion which I desired to have debated. Parliament, however, prorogued and a new session started. To-day, we find ourselves and the Commonwealth in a very much more interesting constitutional position than we did in 1936, and that from two points of view two entirely new factors have come into calculations since I mentioned this matter in 1936. One is the fact that it can no longer be said that the head of the Government of this country received a mandate from the people of this country to carry on certain government for a stipulated length of time. I am not raising this matterI hope that the right honourable gentleman does not think that I am-in a party spirit. I am raising it in what I believe to be the interests of this country and this Parliament from the constitutional aspect. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) was Deputy Leader of the United Australia party at. the time of the 1937 elections. Sub-"" sequently he resigned from the Government and from the position of Deputy Leader of the United Australia party, so it cannot be argued to-day that he has any definite mandate personally from the electorate, as was argued in the case of the late Mr Lyons in 1936. I contest that point in any case, but, even if it were argued successfully that the 1936 proposition in regard to the prerogative of the Prime Minister was correct, that state of affairs does not exist in this Parliament to-day. It is not for me to inquire into how this came about. 1 simply state the facts as I see them. Another interesting point and new factor which will come into force before the end of this year will be that for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth we representashall have a Royal Governor General. It has been suggested in certain quarters that it may then be that the representative of the Crown would perhaps not take the strong line that it might be possible for another representative of the Crown to take. I do not know whether or not there is any ground for that contention; nevertheless, it is a very interesting possibility. If the contention of 1936 is held good; then, of course, I am in the wrong. The contention of 1936, as I have tried to make plain, was that on the advice of the Prime Minister and of nobody else, the Crown, having no discretion, is obliged to grant a dissolution to the Prime Minister of the day. As I understand the constitutional development of the British EmpireI speak with all due deference to the learned King's Counsel now at the table-the position to-day is that if that argument holds good, and the Crown has no discretion in these matters, we come up against a logical sequence of events. We have watched very closely that sequence of events and the development of the Constitution over a great length of time. If the Crown is to have no discretion in these matters, or, in the case",65,Cameron Woul D The Thought That The Floor Space Was Suflicient
257,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"of the Commonwealth, if the Crown is to be placed in the position in which Speaker Lenthall found himself in the time of Charles the First when he said he had no tongue to speak anything except what the Houseof Commons directed him to say, the time is not far distant when the people will ask just exactly what useful purpose is served by a royal representative who haa no discretionary power at all to influence the course of events in any way. made to the effect that the Governor General had no discretion whatever in ii uy circumstances ? will show that questions were asked on this subject and answers were given, or what is more important, answers were not given. That is why I am asking to-night for an answer. An interesting position has arisen and no satisfactory explanation of it has been given. The difficulty is one which may crop up in a very real and vital form at any moment, particularly having regard to the circumstances in which this House functions to-day. I have always contended, as a .student in a small sense of these matters, that the job of the Crown is to see that the government of a country is carried on by the Parliament elected for that purpose until such time as it is clear to the Crown that Parliament ia unable or unwilling to keep in power a government capable of carrying on the King's administration. That contention is very opposite-almos t diametrically opposite -to the contention advanced in several quarters that the Crown has no discretion, but must abide by the advice tendered hy the head of the Government. the honourable gentleman will find any lawyer who would support the view that the Governor General has no discretionary power. I have never heard it suggested. honourable gentleman should search among his close friends. emphasis on the word "" lawyer "". But I realize that this is not the right time to have a full-dress debate on this question, although I see some very. serious possibilities in the relations which may exist if certain ideas are held to be good in law and capable of being carried into effect. As one of the commonality in this community, I see what I understand to be 3ome reserve of power, known <is LIIL' Royal Prerogative, which is above party and Parliament, and which in certain eventualitiea iB supposed to be evoked for the good of the people as a whole. I am among those who would be very sorry to see a state of affairs arise in which it was successfully argued that the Crown has no prerogative in these affairs. Therefore, in view of the experience of December, 1936, and having, for some time since not been in a position to question these matters owing to being engaged in the exercise of certain prerogatives of my own, I suggest it would be very interesting if the Government, during the next parliamentary session which, we understand, may include a consideration of constitutional matters, would make some clear-cut pronouncement with regard to the present-day relationships between the Crown and its Ministers, particularly the Prime Minister. very warmly support the remarks made concerning the present Repatriation Act. I believe that the rigid terms of that, act are causing serious injustice to many people who claim pensions. There are many returned soldiersI personally know of many cases-whos e applications for pensions are seriously prejudiced because, owing to the lack of medical records, they are unable to show connection between the disabilities from which they now suffer, and their war service. It is a remarkable thing that although a man may have been classed as medically unfit when he returned from the war, if he were subsequently discharged by medical authorities, and then years later siiffered a that the relapse is attributable to his war service, he cannot obtain a pension. I have known of several cases of that kind, and although I have personally brought them under the notice of the Repatriation Department I have been unable to secure satisfaction.",66,Cameron Woul D The Thought That The Floor Space Was Suflicient

I do feel, however, that the medical omcers. of that department, to put sions, they should, at leasts be brought it mildly, have a very conservative outlook. That complaint applies not only to the Repatriation Department but also in some respect to the medical section administering invalid sions. I informed one medical officer of the Repatriation Department that while 1 did not doubt his conscientiousness and sincerity, I felt that he and his able. Some of these offices have been associates were acutely actuated by an inordinate desire to serve the interests 'of the department. Undoubtedly the claim's of many people for pensions are' unduly prejudiced by the medical oflicers. I have at times wondered whether the medical officers had been given some unofficial instruction that they had to tighten up their examinations. pathetic. honourable member for Grey( Mr that the Postal Department is very unBadman) supports my contention in this regard. I have no doubt that my complaints in this matter are shared by many other bonorable members in this House. I very heartily support the representaimproved services rather than the policy tions made on behalf of Boer War veterans, and I agree that repatriation provisions should be made available to them. I should also like to see included within the scope of the Repatriation Act those men who served during the Great War not in the Australian Military Forces, but with the armies of other countries of the British Commonwealth. There .are many men in Australia to-day who have to their credit good service in various branches of the British army, but unfortunately, many of them have lost touch with the Ministry for Pensions in England. Some consideration should therefore he .given to them. They'should receive the provision of the service pen1 sion. Many of them are prematurely aged and are suffering from a degree of invalidity which makes their cases worthy of the most sympathetic consideration.

If nothing more liberal can be done for them by repatriation penunder that section of the Repatriation Act providing for a service pension. 1 very strongly recommend these deserving cases and hope that an early amendment, penof the act will be introduced., I wish now to refer to the policy bf the Postal Department in closing certain post offices which are said to be unprofitserving certain localities for many years, and even if they may not be profitable, they are still necessary to the convenience of the general public. I have just received word that such a post office in H part of my electorate, which has been serving the public since before the achievement of federation, is to be closed, although the community in which it is situated is growing. Why should the department adopt such a. policy? Surely the convenience of the general public I am glad that the should have some weight! It appears willing to give service anywhere unless it can be sure that it will make a profit. The very substantial surplus in the working of the Postal Department warrants of discontinuance. The policy of the Postal Department should be to ensure service rather than become. a taxing machine. If I can point to grievances of this kind in my electorate, I am sure that honourable members who represent country districts must know of many such instances. I urge the Government to give instructions that the policy of which I . complain be altered. The department should consider more than it does the general convenience of the community.

I shall be very brief. I wish, first, to congratulate the Government upon its interest in our shipbuilding industry. Last Saturday, Mrs. Street, the wife of the Minister for Defence( Mr Street) launched the sloop Parramatta. which was built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and is a fine example of Australian craftsmanship. Once upon a time, South Australia had a shipbuilding industry. The last ship built there was turned out in a most workmanlike way. A sloop like the Parramatta could he built in South Australia if some assistance were given to the project. I ask the Government to consider distributing its shipbuilding operations so that some of the less-favoured States may share in them. I look for the day to come when South Australia will again have a shipbuilding industry. to make some reference to the need for an amendment ""of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act. ""When the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) gave notice of' his intention to move for the appointment of a select committee to consider and report upon anomalies in the Repatriation Act, I said that I would support his motion if it provided for consideration to be given to the rights of [fi8] Imperial ex-service men resident in Australia. The Repatriation Act, as it stands, is harsh in some of its provisions, and many of the complaints made by ex-service men in this regard are thoroughly justified. We all know that after the war many men who returned to this country from active service in apparently good health made no call whatever upon the War Pensions Department. At that time, a considerable therefore, decided to rely upon their own ability to get a job and hold it. But, with the passage of the years, the health of many of them has become impaired. They now find themselves unable to furnish history when they feel impelled to make a claim upon it for a pension. Moreover, many of the medical practitioners who treated them in days gone by are dead, and no records can be found of the details of such treatment. This prevents numerous ex-service men from furnishing a continuous medical history, and for this reason they are denied a pension. The Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Harrison) stated this afternoon that our Repatriation Act was more liberal than that of any other country. He also observed that Australia was expending £7,700,000 per annum in war pensions of one kind or another. He did not think it worthwhile to inform honourable members that about £20,000,000 per annum is being paid out, even now, in interest on war bonds and the like. I can see no justification whatever for restricting the benefits of the repatriation legislation while no restriction whatever is imposed upon the payment of interest in respect of war bonds. Surely the men who were prepared to give their lives for their country are worthy of more consideration than those who remained at home and lent their money to the Government at a high rate of interest in a time of national peril! It is neither reasonable nor fair that ex-service men whose health has been impaired should he denied a pension on the ground of financial stringency, while people who lent money to the Government for war purposes should be permitted to continue to draw substantial amounts year by year in interest.

If it is good enough to restrict the payment of pensions, it is, in my opinion, good enough also to cease meeting charges on interestWhy should the Government discriminate bearing securities. I wish to say a few words concerning service pensions. As the honorable member for Balaclava pointed out this afterthey left the Old Country they were adnoon, the conditions in respect of these are in some ways grossly unfair. At the close of the ANZAC Day celebrations in a part of my district this year, I was invited to visit a sick soldier who had been denied a service pension. I found him absolutely incapacitated and bedridden. His wife had to treat him as a child. She even had to l if t him out of bed to change his bed. He could do absolutely nothing for himself. I made representations for him to the Repatriation Department, from which I have now received a reply to the effect that he is not permanently unemployable. When does the department consider a man to be permanently unemployable? This ex-soldier is absolutely helpless and bedridden. His name is Logan, and. he lives at Cessnock. Repatriation to make a special investigation of his case. He was recently an inmate of the Repatriation Hospital, but has since been taken back to Cessnock, where he has been bedridden ever since. Another case that I wish to have investigated is that of Thomas Elwell, of Hebburn Western. His complaint affects him from the hips down. His legs are useless, and he cannot walk let alone work. Yet the department says that he also is not permanently unemployable. I urge the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to his case. I join in the representations that have that my services have been so recognized. been made to the Government for the setting up of a select committee to recommend amendments Repatriation Act and also for the inclusion within the provisions of the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act of the thousands of Imperial ex-service men Mr James. ' who, since the war, have made their homes True patriotism in Australia. They fought beside Australians in the Great War, they have adopted this country, they pay taxes and rear Australian children, and they have been here long enough to qualify for invalid and old-age pensions; yet they are refused repatriation benefits, which are paid from Consolidated Revenue to which they, with all other taxpayers, contribute. between the ex-soldiers of Australia and Great Britain. British ex-service men feel that they have heen deserted. When vised that Australian sunlight would cure them of that dread disease, tuberculosis, which they had contracted during the war. The Imperial authorities bought them off by paying them lump sums in lieu of pensions. While residing in Australia, many of them became totally and permanently incapacitated. When they have been here long enough, they qualify for invalid pensions. Their complaints are diagnosed by the highest medical authorities as being due to war service, yet they cannot receive repatriation benefits. Is there any justice in that? Because there is no reciprocity between Australia and Britain in regard to pensions, Australian taxpayers have to carry these men on the invalid pension, when their maintenance should primarily be I ask the Minister for the responsibility of the Imperial Government. If we accept tbem as citizens-in fact, in conjunction with the Imperial authorities, encourage them to come here -w e should be prepared to treat them as Australians, at the same time making representations to the Imperial authorities to help in the ' matter. The Imperial ex-service men have a just claim. Hundreds of them reside in my electorate and I have fought, and will continue to fight on their behalf. RecentlyI was appointed an honorary member of the British Ex-service Legion at a reunion in Weston and I am proud I hope that this Government, or a future government, will ensure that these men to the become eligible for repatriation benefits. At present they have to appeal to the imperial authorities and wait six months or more before their cases are determined. Tf they were eligible to receive Australian repatriation benefits, their files would be kept in Australia, and their cases could be dealt with expeditiously. tations should be made to the Imperial Government to set up in Australia a t r i bunal including representatives of I m perial ex-service men, and the H i g h Commissioner for Great Britain, who could look after the interests of the British Government, which should bear a f a ir share of the costs. That would do away with tlie present unsatisfactory system. Many honourable members are acquainted with a song which has been practically dedicated to the French Foreign Legion"" The Legion of the Lost They CallU s "" . have made changes in one of its verses which make it appropriate to the case I am submitting on behalf of these exImperial service men, many of whom are "" forgotten men "" in this country of their adoption.

The provision of pensions for them is the responsibility of the Imperial Government for the same reasons that the ex-soldiers of the Australian Imperial Force are the care of the Australian Government. I appreciate the fact that the Postmaster-General has seen fit to implement the arrangement made by Cabinet at Hobart to reduce the interstate telegram rate from Is. 4d. to ls. As one who represents a border electorate, I know how unjustly that surcharge operates in many cases. For instance, a telegram despatched from Surfers' Paradise to Tweed Heads, which is 15 miles away just over the border of New South Wales, costs ls. 4d., whereas it costs only ls. to send a telegram from the same place to Cairns, which is 1,500 miles away. Nothing can justify a discrimination of that kind after 30 years of federation. Government is asking the committee to appropriate the sum of £10,477,100 in order to enable it to carry on during the next three months, when Parliament will be in recess. I should like to know what the Government intends to do, during that period, to relieve unemployment. How much of this amount will be spent in the alleviation of distress and poverty among the unemployed throughout Australia? In this great Commonwealth, which produces an abundance of the necessaries of life, we find large numbers of people suffering from malnutrition, and unable to purchase clothing. Such a position cannot be tolerated on humane or christian grounds. At the last general elections this Government promised to relieve unemployment, but it has failed to do anything tangible in this direction. It should recognize its responsibility, as the national Governseat. I have many happy recollections of ment, to solve this problem instead of shelving it on to the State governments. Is it any wonder that so many semi governmental bodies throughout the Commonwealth are endeavouring to obtain as much loan money as possible in order to initiate necessary works in their respective areas with a view to relieving local unemployment? The Labour Government of New Zealand has definitely given a lead to the Commonwealth in this matter. To-day conditions in New Zealand are attracting artisans from Australia. If this Government were sincere in its desire to assist the unfortunate unemployed, it would not allow any of our artisans to go elsewhere in search of work. In Canberra alone there is a shortage of approximately 400 houses. Why cannot the Government go ahead immediately with a huge building programme to overcome that shortage? The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr George Lawson) has repeatedly urged upon the Government the necessity for building a new general post oflice in Brisbane. The post oflice at South Brisbane, which is in my electorate, is housed in a shop, which is an eye-sore. Any government would feel ashamed to call such a building a post office. These are the works with which the Government could go ahead immediately in order to relieve unemployment. During the recent by-election in Griffith electoral officers were obliged to work in a room which was not fit for animals, let alone human beings. Those officers laboured all day and through the night until 3 o'clock the following morning, and for their extra services they received no remuneration whatever. Does the Government call that, democracy? for the discussion in committee has expired. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. That the bill be now read a third time.

285,Mr Spurr (Wilmot) [9.26],"Whilstsuggest to me that I should enter public life in Tasmania. I do not oppose the third reading of this measure, but I intend to draw attention to two very important omissions from the bill. This measure contains no mention of the important matter of unemployment, although that problem is definitely the responsibility of the National Government. saps the very vitality of a community, and, unfortunately, it is one of the most serious problems confronting this country at the present time. Only last week I was a member of a deputation which waited upon the Prime Minister( Mr ment brings down a constructive proMenzies) and asked that a pensions scheme in relation to unemployment be introduced. This problem has reached alarming proportions, not only on the mainland, but also in Tasmania, and it is not confined to any particular industry. ""We find hundreds of unemployed, not only in industrial areas, but also in rural torate I have many opportunities to make districts. 1934 general election campaign the late Mr Lyons said that the States had almost reached the end of their resources in dealno more than thirteen years of agej looking with this problem, and that it was essential that the Commonwealth evolve a definite plan to solve the difficulty. As sibility is thrust upon such young the result of that promise a youth employment scheme was approved by this Parliament some time ago. What; pleased me most about that fact was that in dealing with it this National Parliament recognized that it has a responsibility in respect of unemployment. It is all very well for this Government to take £10 out of the pockets of the taxpayers in the States and to pose as a benefactor hy returning £5 or £6 out of that amount to the State governments in the form of grants. Having recognized that it has a responsibility in connection with unemployment this Government should get down to work and tackle the problem in a business like way, because unemployment has become too big a job for the States. It calls for statesmanlike action. If we cannot make our working people contented, we cannot hope to lay a solid foundation on which to build the future of this country, or to inspire our people to respond to the defence of their country in a time of emergency. A contented community will defend itself to the last man. This Government must tackle this problem, even if its solution involves a re-organization of the economic structure of this country. Only last night in this House the national insurance scheme was held up for a further period. In reconsidering that scheme I urge the Government to give careful attention to the institution of unemployUnemployment ment insurance. That will be one way in which we can attack this evil. Another method is by the introduction of a shorter working week. Those two reforms will assist us materially in dealing with this problem. I suggest that if the Governposal in this direction it will be astonished at the co-operation which it will receive from honourable members on this side. I am sorry that no provision is made in this bill for widows' and orphans' pensions. In moving around my elecI n his policy speech at the first-hand acquaintance with the conditions of the poorer people. In many homes which I have visited I have found a girl, ing after four or five of her younger brothers and sisters. This cruel responshoulders because the mother, as I invariably discover on inquiry, is obliged to go out washing and scrubbing in order to earn sufficient to keep the home together. The family having lost the breadwinner, the mother had to maintain the children. Order! The time allotted for the consideration of the remaining portion of the bill has expired. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. Debate resumed from the 7th June (vide page 1443), on motion by Mr That the bill be now read a second time. Although the Opposition does not. intend to oppose this measure, I should like some information from the Minister( Mr",72,Third Reading
286,Mr Speakee (Hon. G. J. Bell),,73,Spender
287,Mr Forde (Cadricornia) R9.311,"Spender) concerning the reports received from the. State governments on the expenditure of the £200,000 previously 5 appropriated. I should also like to know how many young persons have been trained in trades or assisted in obtaining employment as the result of the expenditure of the money already provided. According to the Minister's second-reading speech, 5,900 persons have benefited in all the States, and 3,226 are waiting to receive educational facilities or to he assisted to learn a trade. According to the report from the Queensland Government for the year ended the 30th June, 1938, it would appear that, since the inception of the scheme up to the 31st August, 1938, the position is as follows: Enrolled in commercial trades, 202; resultant employment, 67; enrolled for farming pursuits, 73; resultant employment, 5; enrolment for mining, 30; resultant employment, 7. These figures show, that although the Government has taken a step in the right direction, it is only toying with the great problem of assisting unemployed youths to obtain suitable work. This is a matter on which a very definite promise was made by the late Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), who, as Leader of the United Australia party in 1934, stated in his policy speech that the employment of youths was of such paramount importance to Australia that it would be one of the fiTst problems which his Government would tackle. He also stated that the Government proposed to increase its efforts to relieve unemployment with particular reference to the needs of youths which, he said, should : take precedence over all other Commonwealth activities. When such a pTomise was made we naturally expected that the Government would treat the matter seriously, and would not consider that by appropriating £200,000 to be divided among the six States to. assist in the trainproblem, and we have not yet had any ing of youths, its responsibility ceased. The last census figures disclose that there were approximately 90,000 of both sexes under the age of 21 out of employment, and of that number 23,000 had never performed a day's work. Various police magistrates have stated from the bench that'the unemployment amongst youths in Australia is one of the chief causes of crime, and that it was distressing Mr Forde. to them to find that many young men who came before them had been brought up under favorable conditions and were anxious to make their way in life, but, having been denied that right, had drifted into bad habits. The Government now proposes to appropriate an additional £200,000, making a total of £400,000 to be expended during a period of five years. The late Mr Dunningham, Minister for Labour and Industryi n New South Wales, who was strong in his criticizm of the niggardly treatment meted out to the States by the Commonwealth in regard to unemployment generally, and particularly unemployed youths, saidThere seems to be a hoodoo on Federal Ministers who talk unemployment, perhaps that is why so many of them dodge it altogether. After having read the many statements emanating from Federal sources as to the Commonwealth's ardent desire to assist youth training and employment throughout Australia, I am very disappointed at the decision of the Federal Government to make only £200,000 available. In effect, this means that the amount will be taken from the pool, which is divided between the Federal and State Governments and provides employment. We really reduce employment in one direction and utilize the money so withdrawn in an endeavour to deal with the problem in another. Although the late Prime Minister said that employment of youths would take precedence over all other Government activities, his Government did not do anything for two years. A conference of Oommonwealth and State Ministers was then convened to consider the subject at which it was decided that £400,000 should be appropriated for use during the following three years. The present Prime Minister, who was Attorney-General and Minister for Industry, said that the Government had no set plan to deal with the definite report as to how the money already provided has been expended in each State, and whether it has been additional to the normal activities of State Governments in assisting youths to obtain the necessary training in trades or in commerce. I should like to know if this amount is to be used to supplement the expenditure of State governments, or if it is the only money which is being expended for this purpose. When this subject was debated recently in the New South Wales Parliament one honourable member saidOver 50,000 young people of both sexes in New South Wales are at present looking for work, and this number will be added to automatically when young persons who reach the age of 1!) to 21 years are dismissed. Unfortunately that is the practice throughout Australia. Boys of 14 to 15 years are engaged, but when they reach 1.8 to 20 years of age, and, when by virtue of their experience they are entitled to an increased' remunerajtion, they are dismissed and younger persons employed. That is a great injustice and is responsible for a good deal of the unemployment which now prevails. number of misfits. men have received a certain amount of training and are becoming proficient, they are dismissed in order to employ others at a cheaper rate. The Unemployment Council of Now South Wales found that blind-alley jobs were adding 1,500 young men annually to the ranks of unskilled youths, and that most of these youths Avere dismissed because they became 21 years of age, when they were entitled to higher award rates. The council also made an exhaustive survey and assessed the proportion of juniors to adults in 40 firms, and found that there was a total of 1,246 juniors to 305 adults. The following table shows the position:Firm's Products. Male Adults. Juniors. Metal stampings 34 1 Metal stampings 15 Bolts and rivets Bolts and nuts Aluminium ware Spray pumps Piston rings 56 Pram wheels Canisters Wireless sets Mr A. B. Lalchere, chairman of the Young Citizens Association Advisory Council, referring to the appalling conditions under which the youths of the day are being thrown on the industrial scrap-heap, said. The onus of thc whole trouble is on the employers, who are making huge profits' 'tit the expense of youths. These lads do not acquire any skill or any experience which would enable them to secure employment as adults. They are discarded and go to swell the ranks of uuemployed unskilled, labour. I think that every honourable gentleman has had the' same experience as I have had with parents who are driven almost frantic wondering how they shall place their boys and girls,, mainly boys, in employment -It is not every parent who is so fortunate' as to have children who can pass the junior or senior university examinations. It is also making a Many parents t are forced tosend their children out to employment at an earlier age than one would desire, to see. A great.many boys leave school at the age of fourteen years. They cannot say they have passed the intermediate or the junior university examination, and they find that they cannot get employment as apprentices in trades which are congenial to them. Many of them take Up blind-alley jobs at the end of which is the dole ofilce. . The latest census revealed that there were 90,000 youths who were unemployed. The census also showed that 23,000 youths had never done a day's work. The Commonwealth Statistician estimates that approximately 90,000 juniors enter the wage-earning group every year, and that deaths, retirements, &c, account for 50,000 a year. The net increase of the number of youth wage-earners is thus about 40,000 a year. Australia intends to expend £63,000,000 in three years or less on defence, and in this regard the Labour policy of industrial preparedness for defence is being 37 L7 acknowledged. Unfortunately, however, 73 5 owing to the short-sighted policy of the 37 6 Commonwealth Government in not push73 1 ing ahead with industrial activities to 76 16 the full extent, the industries whicli could 118 29 be developed with rapidity and thereby 31 .1 absorb the people in employment cannot develop at the rate at which they would develop if they had the whole of the Australian, market. I suggest to the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr John Lawson) that he look into the question of",73,Spender

289,Mr Fobd.e,"Exactly. When youngthe number of industries which have asked for additional protection to enable .them to extend their enterprises and thus absorb a greatly-increased number of workmen and youths in factories. If the honourable gentleman would, with the greatest possible speed, have those requests considered by the Tariff Board and acted upon, many of the youths who to-day are walking the streets looking for work as apprentices in factories would find work. The Western Australian Government has already gone into this question at great length. It appointed a royal commissioner in 1938 to inquire into the question of youth employment and the apprenticeship system. The commissioner made soihe very good observations and recommendations. He said on page eight of the reportI proceed to outline some of the more important specific measures adopted or under consideration, by various countries in dealing with the problem. They areThe raising of the school leaving age and the raising of the age for admission into employment; compulsory attendance at education centres of unemployed young persons; part-time attendance of employed young persons at educational centres until the age of ' eighteen years; vocational training of employed young persons between -18 and 25 years of age, with general education. This royal commissioner, in this report that was submitted to the Government of Western Australia towards the end of last year, summarized the recommendations made in the various countries to. grapple with the question of unemployment amongst youths. Amongst them wereA revision of the apprenticeship system; the provision of recreational and social services; the establishment of work camps or work centres; The development of systems ofvocational guidance, pre-vocational training, vocational training, as part of the general educational methods; The establishment of placement bureaux and labour exchanges, and the transference of young persons from "" depressed areas "" to areas where work is available; the rationing of employment (i.e., part-time), in times of economic depression; the reduction of the hours of labour; the shortening of the working life by compelling the retirement at, say, 60 years of age; Mr Forde. Other measures of a general character which have been discussed or suggested areThe development of a long-range policy of public works so that the maximum of publicworks construction will coincide in point of time with periods when depression is severe; the curtailment of women's services in industry, and the question of equal pay for the sexes; unemployment insurance. This report is so voluminous that it would require days for .honourable members to absorb its details. The commissioner after deliberation then made these recommendationsI therefore recommend(1) That a Bureau of Industry and Economic Research with statutory powers of holding inquiries and of obtaining information .be established. It should be presided over by a full-time director who should be a widely experienced oflicer and be given power to utilize the services of technicians and State officials. It should be a representative body consisting of representatives of tlie Government, the employers and thc workers and having the services, in an advisory capacity, of an economist and industrial technician. The powers and duties of the bureau should include the following:(a) To acquire and disseminate information with regard to the States' economy with a view to improving economic efficiency; (6) To inquire into the conditions of employment and the causes and provision for supplementary extent of unemployment; (c) To collect statistical and other information; (d) To endeavour to improve the relations of employers and workers; (e) To assist in improving thc efficiency of existing, and to develop new, enterprises. (2) That an economic research section be attached to the Statistician Branch. That this section be charged with the duty of conducting continuous research and keeping in constant touch with the director. The first duty of this section should be to have at its command immediate interpretations of statistics so that the fullest possible use can be made of them. I recommend that the State co-operate with the Commonwealth and the other States of the Commonwealth in the formulation of a scheme for providing credit for new types of industries, the fostering of whicli is recommended by the Bureau of Economic Research, acting in conjunction with the credit banks established for this purpose. E commend t h is r e p o rt to M in is t e r s and hope t h a t they w ill read it c a r e f u l l y . The r e p o r t continuesThat the present buildings used for technical education are inadequate. Thati t is necessary, if youth is to be proto place their children in work. What perly educated for industry, that the building should be enlarged and the equipment increased. At the present time there is a limited number of trade classes in the day time for the crafts in which apprenticeship is compulsory. In the other crafts there are either no classes at all or instruction is given in the evenings in self-supporting classes. The Technical Branch should cater for all classes of industry in which apprenticeship is necessary, and should also provide rural workers with a general course of instruction in agricultural science and methods, the course to cover a period of two years, and instruction to be given at slack periods of the year in the farmthe Minister on that point later. I undering industry, so as to enable as many students as possible to attend. (a) The Junior Technical School system is not as adequate as it should be. The facilities should be increased in the metropolis and extended in the large country towns. There is a somewhat surprising lack of record of tlie vocations followed by students from thc school. I consider that greater efforts should be made to obtain increased attendance of students of suitable type at these classes, aud that .better records should be kept. agricultural instruction of a pre-vocationa 1 nature be provided in the curricula of both city and country junior technical schools. The point is to what extent is the Government considering all the reports on this question of youth employment that are available in the various States? Is thing constructive apart from providing amongst the six States under this bill? Such provision, after all, is very niggardly considering the revenue resources of the Commonwealth and the fact that we are finding £63,000,000 for defence. These young people who leave school every year, invariably fired with enthusiasm to make their way in life, are the young men who join the Militia and will play an important part in the defence of this country if defence be ever necessary. The best way to lay thc foundation for them to become effective citizens is to engender among them the feeling that they arc not being overlooked by the State and Commonwealth Governments, that the governments are desirous of equipping them for the great work that lies ahead of them, that this country cares for them and their welfare and that this is a country really worth fighting for. I am always deeply moved by the representations made to mc in my electorate by unfortunate parents who are unable applies in my electorate applies equally in other parts of Australia. The Government cannot wash its hands of responsibility by the mere granting of £200,000. It must follow up this bill. I think that the Queensland Government is the only government which has submitted a comprehensive report to the Commonwealth Government on this matter. New South Wales too. stand that there is no uniformity among the States in tackling this problem, and I should be interested to hear from the Minister what the several States are doing. The Minister for Social Services( Sir Frederick Stewart) displayed a keen interest in this matter a few years ago and I should like to hear him on the That subject. After his visit to Geneva, the honourable gentleman said' As in Australia, I found this phase of the problem provoking great concern in all sountries. At the Geneva Conference a striking demonstration ensued when representatives of youth organizations ' from all' parts of thc world were received by the conference to whom oral appeals were made, backed up by petitions containing hundreds of thousands of signathe Government doing anytures, asking that special consideration be given to the plight of 7,000,000 unemployed £200,000 for division youths. It must have been a stirring experience to hear the earnest and sincere representations from the representatives of those 7,000,000 youths throughout the world to the conference to tackle this problem in a comprehensive way and on an international scale. In his report to the Commonwealth Government, the then Minister for Labour and Industry saidThe petitions and appeals were in perfectly good form and created an obvious impression in the Conference. They were referred to a committee of which I was a member. After the most sympathetic consideration, the general conclusions of the committee were that it was not practicable to separate and deal with unemployment issued in arbitrary age sections, and the most effective aid to youthful victims would be found in a more rigorous attack on the general situation. The honourable gentleman then stated that the main features of the recommendations were1. The minimum age for leaving school and beiug admitted to employment should be fixed at not less than fifteen years as soon as circumstances allow.",75,Spender

Vocational training centres, in which some provision is made for general education, should be organized for' unemployed persons between in co-operation with employers' and workers' organizations. 5. Where it is considered desirable to establish, for unemployed persons between the ages of 18 and 24 inclusive, employment centres the principal object of which is not to give vocational training, but to provide work under conditions of employment other than those obtaining normally, adequate safeguards should be adopted to prevent these abnormal conditions from resulting in abuses. Attendances nt employment centres should be strictly voluntary. Every care should he taken to prevent such centres, whether public or private, from becoming institutions for military training. Those privately, organized should be under the -supervision of the civil .authorities. fi. Measures should be taken to transfer to expanding occupations and to districts in which such'occupations arc carried on, young persons wiu> are without employment in districts where tlie principal industries appear to be in permanent decline. 7. Present attempts to promote re-employinent by a reduction in ordinary hours of work should be pursued with special vigour in . respect of employment in which young persons engage. What has been done in regard to the recommendations which the present Minister Services Government mendations? heen' arrived should be taken? ment a plan in mind, or has the matter just mental head pointed out that the £200,000 previously been exhausted ? Probably that is the only reason why the matter has heen brought up at all. In my opinion, before bringing down such a measure as this, the Government should have investigated the whole problem;' for then it would have been in a position to announce to the House what it intended to do. A long range plan should be evolved and submitted to a Premiers Conference, so that the matter could be fully considered and concerted action taken with a view to Mr Forde. ameliorating the distressing conditions which exist to-day. Thousands of youths leave school every year and find that industry has no place for them, or can offer them only a temporary place until they reach the age of nineteen or twenty years. Many youths are discharged after giving four or five years' f a it h f u l service to their employers, and they find themselves without jobs at an age when they the ages of 18 and 25, should be considering undertaking the responsibility of marriage, and f u l f ill in g a useful place in the community as husbands and fathers. Unless the Commonwealth Government is prepared to render assistance, we can expect nothing but demoralization amongst the youth of this country. Youth employment is one of the most important responsibilities of any Government, and this Government cannot wash its hands of the whole matter simply by passing a bill providing for the granting of £200,000 to the States. This bill has more than ordinary interest, because it indicates the Government's desire to help the Statesi n this most important phase of national development. While I agree that the States should be given financial assistance in this direction, it. is necessary to scrutinize just what is being done with the subsidy. W it h regard to this problem, we come once again against the old constitutional difficulty, of that conference to namely, divided control. Whereas the for Social control of unemployment is a function of was a delegate.? Has the the States, the financing of schemes ever perused these recomsuch as this is a responsibility of the If so, has any decision Commonwealth.

Last year a youth employment scheme was inaugurated in New South Wales under which youths between the ages of 19 and 25 years were subsidized in their employment hy the State Government, aided by Commonwealth assistance.",77,Spender
292,Mr Jennings (Watson) [10.5],"Nearly 3,000 youths were employed under this scheme and I suggest that that scheme could be expanded to include technical and commercial activities, such as the dealing with scientific appliances and commodities, in which three or four years' training is necessary to acquire proficiency. There are also semi-governmental activities such as main road construction calling for skilled men and engineering talent. Recently, the Main Roads Board of New South Wales engaged three overseas road engineers who happened to be I'ecent arrivals in Australia. I have been officially informed that the board required men who were experts in reinforced concrete designs and steel bridge designs, and that no such experts were available in Australia. It seems to me that we are sadly lacking in our efforts to eliminate unemployment if we are not training youths in skilled trades such as these. The expansion of main roads throughout Australia is one of the most important phases of our national development in this motor age and with defence need. I understand from inquiries which I have made, that the New South Wales youth employment, scheme was cancelled on the 1st January last. T ask the Minister what was the reason for that? Is a new scheme being contemplated, or is it desired that a further subsidy should he given by the Commonwealth ? yet been decided upon but negotiations are proceeding between the Commonwealth and the States. in operation, or has it, been cancelled? No more recruits have been taken since the beginning of the year, due to the fact that an alteration of a Commonwealth industrial award was not continued beyond that date. much interest that a select parliamentary committee has been set up in New South Wales, sponsored by Mr Baddeley and Mr Mitchell, to inquire into the capacity of industry to absorb unemployed youths; the extent and distribution of youth employment; what steps should be taken to provide opportunities for those engaged in ""dead-end"" occupations, nnd the relationship between the school-leaving age and the present system of technical education. That proposal has much lo commend it, and I suggest, in view of the position that this Government should appoint a similar committee, consisting of honourable members from both sides of the House, to inquire into every phase of this important : national question. Eor instance, what is the attitude of the trade unions and industry itself to this question of employing and training youths in skilled occupations? I have no doubt that finance is an important factor in this problem, and I suggest that the Loan Council should give this matter and other employment requirements earnest consideration, in order that some method of providing the necessary finance might be arrived at. think that the name of this bill is more imoressive than the effort which is being put forward by the Government. I am not at all satisfied with the effort that the Government is making in connection with this very important major problem. The bill which has been brought down is a very small one, and it appears that, the Government regards it as a minor question. Personally, I think it is a matter of great importance to the youth of Australia, and one in which the Government should wholeheartedly interest itself. A great majority of youths leaving school to-day are unable to find work, and one of the results of this great wastage of useful lives has been an increase of juvenile crime. As the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has frequently stated, many young men have reached the age of 25 years and have never done a day's work. In a country such as this, that is a very unfortunate state of affairs, and it does not reflect to the credit of the present Government, or of the governments of the same political colour that have preceded it during the last seven years, because these governments are responsible for the position of the youth of Australia to-day. Had steps been taken years ago to combat this social evil, the plight of the unfortunate unemployed youths would not be nearly so acute as it is now.

At present a good deal is being said about the desirsomething could be done to train these ableness of bringing migrants of youthful age to Australia. I consider the Government would be acting more wisely if it made provision for youths in depressed areas, such as the mining fields, to be transferred to other areas where permanent employment could be made available. This would ensure that these young men would be given an opportunity to become useful citizens of this country under conditions which would enable them to marry and rear families with reasonable prospects of economic comfort. It appears to me that the amount of money proposed to he voted in this bill will be useless to do anything of a major character. The sum of £200,000 will probably be sufficient only to maintain activities already in operation. The Government should go much farther than this. While the schemes now in force are useful in their way they are limited in their scope. New avenues of employment, and especially new avenues of training, should be opened. The men who are trained should, moreover, be given some assurance that permanent employment will be available for them in their chosen callings. Many of the young men and women who attend high schools until they obtain their leavthe provision of employment for the ing certificates are well qualified, but no persons trained. Actually, to-day young employment is available for them. Surely something is wrong with the system that permits that kind of thing to occur. It is frequently said that youths eighteen years of age are too old to obtain Labour party is of the opinion that a employment. In various industries young people of fourteen years of age and theregreater measure of employment for our abouts are preferred. Yet it is deplorable that people who remain in our educational establishments until they reach the leaving certificate standard should be left high and dry. Another regrettable feature of our economic life to-day is thai so many dead-end jobs are offered to young men and women who are retained in certain lines of employment until they reach the age of possibly 21 years when they are dismissed as unskilled, and thereafter find extreme difficulty in gainbe enlarged. The building trade proing a new start in life. The Commonwealth Postal Department is one of the worse offenders in this way. Mr Clark. It employs juniors as messengers until, they reach the age of eighteen or nineteen years, and then dismisses them. Surely young people so that, as they advance in years, they can take more responsible positions in the department. The Government should direct the employing agency of the Postal Department to give more consideration to this aspect of its administration. It is the duty of the Commonwealth to discourage the employment of young people in dead-end occupations. It will not be discharging its responsibilities by merely saying to the State governments, "" Now we have made this sum of money available to you it is your responsibility to do the job. Thank goodness we are well out of it "" . The Opposition has made several suggestions to improve existing conditions. It has proposed that the school leaving age be increased so that boys and girls of tender years vvill not be available for absorption in industrial enterprises. It has also suggested that vocational training should receive more attention from the Commonwealth Government. Unfortunately, some young people who spend two or three years iu vocational training find themselves afterwards left high and dry. Vocational training should include men and women who take up vocational training courses frequently find themselves without permanent employment on the completion of their courses. The shorter working week would provide a people. The subject with which we are dealing is of vital significance, and the Commonwealth Parliament should exert every effort to formulate an adequate scheme to meet the urgent needs of the situation. If national works were put in hand ona larger scale, more employment would be available, greater facilities would be offered for the training of artisans, and the spending power of the people would vides varied employment for a large number of people, but, unfortunately, it is languishing throughout Australia. Some years ago the Commonwealth Government made funds available, through .the Commonwealth Bank, for the building of homes; but in reply to questions I have put to Ministers recently I have learnt that no advances have been made under that scheme for a considerable time. I urge that fresh attention should be devoted to home-building projects. The employment situation for the young men and women of Australia is so unsatisfactory to-day that many are leaving this country to go to New Zealand. If the Government wishes to do the fair and honest thing by our young people it will provide avenues of training for them, and then take all the necessary steps to see that they are assured of permanent employment. I ask the Assistant Treasurer to state specifically whether the amount of money proposed to be voted under this hill is intended simply to permit, youth employment schemes already in operation to be continued? totally inadequate to the needs of the situation. This is an important national problem with which the National Parliament should deal comprehensively. It sliould not be left principally to the State community. authorities to train youth or to find employment for them after training. A larger amount of money should be appropriated so that an adequate scheme -could be devised. -The purpose of this bill is to appropriate a comparatively small sum for the purpose of training and placing in employment youths between the ages of IS and 25 years; but the measure involves a very important principle. It is based upon section 96 of the Constitu..r.ion, which was first used in this way when the federal aid roads scheme was put into operation. This use of the section has led to an expansion of Commonwealth powers in a really Remarkable way. The Commonwealth has power to offer to the States sums of money which the economic position of the States forbids them to refuse. It says to them, in 'effect, "" We will vote money to you for -certain purposes, provided you use it in a way that satisfies us"". In this way ithe Commonwealth Parliament is able indirectly to dictate the policies of the States. A French writer on the American Constitution referred to this procedure as legislation par ricochet. Although the Commonwealth has no direct power to influence State policy its indirect power is proving most effective. The particular object behind this bill is to encourage young people to take up technical training courses. As the Commonwealth has a considerable measure of control over industry through the Oommonwealth Arbitration Court, on the one hand, and the tariff-making power of our Parliament on the other, it is fitting, in my opinion, that it should do as much as possible to encourage technical education. Obviously the State authorities would find technical education a heavy burden if they had to provide for it unaided. As the Commonwealth is able to assist in this way it indirectly influences State policy to the advantage of all concerned. It has been said that the making of grants of this kind is in effect an invasion of State provinces, but I cannot agree witli that point of view. By subsidizing technical education, as is proposed, to even this limited extent, the Commonwealth is doing something of benefit to the whole In other countries where the federal system of government is in operation the federal authorities have no hesitation in voting large sums of money for the encouragement and assistance of technical education under conditions specially prescribed in acts of Parliament or set out in agreements made between the federal body and the provinces. Section 639 of thc British North America Act declares that power over education is expressly reserved to the provinces; yet the Canadian Dominion Parliament has passed legislation whichprovides for the granting of £10,000,000 over a period of ten years for the assistance of technical education in the provinces. That amounts to £1,000,000 a year for the assistance of technical education, but the money is not made available until the provinces have made agreements as to the conditions to be fulfilled in order to qualify for federal aid. In that way, the Federal Government has been able to regulate technical education.",79,Spender
298,Mr Spender.,In substance that is so.,81,Spender
299,Mr Clark,Then the measure is,81,Spender
300,Mr Blackbuen (Bourke) [10.26].,"ment now substantially controls technical education in Canada. the Assistant Treasurer's leader informed the Teachers' Council in Sydney recently that it would be an invasion of the constitutional rights of the States for the Federal Government to do the same thing in Australia. In the United States of America, in spite of the fact that the federal authority enjoys only certain specified powers and that all other powers are expressly reserved to the States, the Smith Hughes Act was passed in 1917 providing for the matching of State funds with federal funds. The federal authority was to provide a subsidy in proportion to the amount provided by the States. The money wa3 for the payment of salaries of vocational teachers, and the act provided that the federal authority should prescribe the subjects, and approve the methods employed, before the money was made available. In this way, the giving of the subsidy has been the means of controlling the educational policy of the States. The Commonwealth Government in Australia should say that technical education is so much bound up with the future of Australian industry, of which the Commonwealth is the chief controller and regulator, that it proposes to make technical education its own responsibility. It should provide the funds, and lay down the conditions upon which the money will be made available. There would be very little difficulty in getting the States to agree to uniform technical education provided that the Commonwealth found most of the money. As I regard this bill as an instalment of what is to come, 1 commend it to the House. This bill is an excellent illustration of the defects arising from the divided authority uncier which'the various parts of the Commonwealth are governed, with the Commonwealth controlling finance, and the 'States exercising sole responsibility for spending, particularly in the matter of the education and training of youth. In this instance, we have presented to us a quite insufficiently considered measure of relief, which was set before the House hy the Minister in a speech almost barren of information, uninspiring in its terms, and suggesting that it was really in the nature of a concession to one of the junior Ministers who has interested himself in child welfare. Less than a week ago, I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) whether he would extend the sittings of Parliament for the purpose of dealing with the ever-present problem of unemployment. I asked the question in good faith, and for very practical reasons, which are familiar to every honourable member of this House as a representative, as they are to those who, as parents or as applicants for employment, are constantly knocking at the doors of honourable members in the hope of obtaining some relief fi'om the odious condition of absence of occupation which, as a scholar once said, is not rest. The Prime Minister, of course, said politely that he would consider my request, and I make no charge against him if that is the end of the mutter, because one does not suppose that the Government, having determined to close. the Parliament, will alter its plans merely because a question was asked. Linked with the problem indicated in this . measure, but not solved by it, is the wider subject of social amelioration and uplift. which has been so sadly neglected by this Government and its predecessors, preference constantly having been given to 'imagined troubles, which were not really present or threatening, but which seemed to serve better the political ambition of the Government. The present bill, which is for an act to grant out of Consolidated Revenue a fund for the purpose of givingfinancial assistance to the States, is littlebetter than a dole. There is no plan associated with it ; no scheme is suggested' which might conceivably bring the light, of hope into the eyes of the rising generation and tlieir harassed parents.. We in Australia are presented witb tiiis problem. We have a very elaborate scheme of public education; we have our primary schools, for the most part efficient and well managed, under the guidance of competent teachers; we have our technical schools, our secondary schools, and our universities, none of which is perfect, yet all of which are practical contributions to the uplift and betterment of the rising generation of which",81,Spender

302,Mr Blackburn,"That is so, yet",82,Spender
303,Mr Brennan (Batman) [10.34],"we have just cause to be proud. We have, in a word, a fine body of Australian youth, always increasing in numberspromising lads and young women of whom any couatry might well be proud. I pay tribute to the teachers, some of -whom are performing heroic work. They devote long hours and great enthusiasm to the cause which they serve, and in no case are they highly remunerated. Too much praise cannot be given to them. But alas, though education is good, and in many instances complete, opportunities for applying the knowledge gained, or for providing an outlet for the enthusiasm of youth, are sadly lacking, and that is the responsibility of the Government. With failure in that direction, comes congestion of those knocking at the door of opportunity, which remains closed to them. Many employers engage boys and youths, only to put them off again when they reach the age of 21 years or, in some cases,' even before that, and they are passed out again into the ranks of the unemployed, at an age when it is more dangerous than before, to them-at higher wages that is waiting selves, and the community, that they should be unoccupied. They are at an age when they possess an immense fund of vital energy which is available for use by the community, and the community could well make use of their services, jobs of a kind are offering for boys, but but for the failure of governments, and, indeed, of the whole capitalist system under . which we labour. According to an official report quoted by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr youths to take up these positions. The Holloway), in New South Wales alone 1,500 young men are passed out of industry every year, and there are others waiting all the time to take their jobs at the smaller wages paid to youths as compared With adults. Those wbo are driven out are easily replaced with others. are held for the Commonwealth and State public services. I know of nothing sadder than the lists of those who have succeeded in passing these examinations. Of course, there are many hundreds who fail to pass. But having succeeded in open competition in getting into the list of successes these young boys and girls imagine that they will necessarily be employed. They have to be disillusioned, nnd theSr parents have to learn that although many are called few are chosen, and that of those who qualify-and the standard is high-fe w will be called to commence work in the various government departments. And, as I have said, the position is similar with respect to private employment. All of us have had experience in association with various classes of college teachers who are interested in their work and proud of their boys, but who are at their wits' end to find employment for those who attain the required standard of education under their expert guidance and tuition. I know, of course, that part of the problem is involved in the fact that many are driven out by reason of mechanical devices which makes the employment of numbers less necessary. This machinery, which should lighten the burden of labour and distribute the benefactions and riches of a rich country like ours, becomes an instrument of unemployment under the . perverse and obstinate methods of governments which refuse. to employ this machinery for the work, under improved conditions and to be done. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports told me this evening th -.t Mr Giles, the secretary of the Victorian Unemployed Youth Movement, had stated that hundreds of they are dead-end jobs which open up no future for the youths to whom they are offered. For that reason skilled educationalists do not encourage promising hopeless dead-end nature of the employment offered to the youths of this country is emphasized in a press interview with Mr Giles who puts at 166 the number of positions offering and refused either for the reason that they are dead-end jobs and, therefore, undesirable, or because Examinations the youths to whom they were offered would be dismissed on attaining the age of 21. I felt that I should not let this measure pass without making it the occasion of these few observations. It has been introduced in the closing hours of this session, if I may call these sittings a session. It is submitted hurriedly, and will rank in history as the Commonwealth Government's contribution to the solution of a great problem-thi s beggarly allowance to the States for youth employment. Indeed, it is not merely beggarly; it is tragic that an Australian government should so inadequately provide for the solution of so serious a problem-ou r greatest problem-the provision for the rising tide of youth in this country. I have had some experience of conditions under which youths live in congested suburban areas. I have had some experience of the crime statistics of this country, and also experience among youths who have got into trouble with the police authorities, youths who could just as well and just as easily and much more naturally have become self-respecting, responsible and progressive young Australians as they have become members of the so-called criminal classes. But because we have no intelligent appreciation of the problem, and no real resolve to face it, because our minds are diverted to things which do not matter to the neglect of those that do, we pass this over, making a kind of a verbal concession to the requirements of youth, but no real, earnest and determined effort to face the major task and to perform it. impossible; it is not even difficult. There can be no difficulty in a country of infinite riches like Australia with a sparse population to provide adequately for the rising generation, such as must be faced in a country beset by plague, pestilence or ravages, in a small poor country of niggardly resources where climatic conditions essentially entail hardships the position is different, but in this country, with its equable and ideal climatic and undoubted resources, any government which realizes the social importance of exercising some supervision of its people, should not be perplexed by this problem, and there should be no need for this measure which I am bound to call a despicable contribution to a great cause. must support this measure, hut I regret that under the forms of this House, I have no right to move for an increase of the amount proposed to be allocated for the all-important purpose of training and employing our youths. of £300,000 in respect of the Commonwealth aa a whole is inadequate to enable the States to deal with this problem, which to my mind ranks in the forefront of the problems confronting Australia to-day. Indeed, it is of equal urgency to the provision which this Government has made in respect of our defence. When we examine the position critically we find that this problem is an important factor in defence, and, indeed, should be dealt with primarily as a problem related to defence. When one compares this amount of £200,000 with the sum of £63,000,000 allocated for defence one wonders whether this Parliament is competent to view these problems in their true perspectives. On a conservative estimate it will take, on an average, £100 to train one youth under this scheme, and on that basis, allowing for an equal contribution from the States, the maximum number who can possibly gain any benefit from this proposal will be 4,000. Do honourable members realize that that number of unemployed youths can be found in any one of our capital cities, and in some bf our provincial districts ? It is obvious that a more serious effort is called for on The solution of this problem is not the part of this Government in order to deal with this problem, particularly when this Government bas seen fit to make such huge financial commitments in respect of defence. We cannot hope to deal with this matter in a statesmanlike way by making a mere gesture of this kind. This problem first impressed itself upon my mind about the time of the depression in which I believe, it had its origin. I find confirmation of that view in this measure which provides that preference in the distribution of the meagre benefits to be made available under this allocation is to be given to youths who have never yet been employed, or who were thrown out of employment as the result of the depression. In respect of training, preference is to be given to youths who have never had a job at all, mainly because of the economic depression which afflicted this country in 1929-31. But, to-day, we find that this problem is becoming a permanent evil in our economic life, and a realization of that fact prompts us to examine the reason for this development. Youth unemployment has This provision now become a problem in country districts in Victoria where it was never known in",82,Spender
304,Mr Pollard (Ballarat) [10.55j,"Ithe past. One explanation of this unfavorable development is the mechanization of agriculture which has resulted in the development and improvement of production from land at so rapid a rate that in country districts, and indeed in the larger provincial cities, no outlet now presents itself to our lads for employment on the land. When I was a youth ample employment was offering in rural areas in clearing, fencing, road-making, clam sinking and ploughing, the last-mentioned being undertaken with comparatively primitive implements. In the initial stages of land settlement in Australia horses, and in some instances, bullocks were used to propel the primitive implements used; but we have travelled a long way along the road since then, and to-.day farming is mechanized to such a degree that under the present system a farmer with only one assistant can actually work a 640-acre farm from the time when the land is first cultivated until the crop is harvested. That has been accomplished by a farmer in Victoria who with only one assistant carried out the whole of the operations without undue inconvenience. In the early days of the potato-growing industry cultivation was undertaken by a single-furrow plough which was followed by a man planting the seed potatoes in rows, but to-day that work is done by a three-furrow plough and a mechanical planter thus dispensing with the laborious work which once had to he undertaken. A good deal of the manual labour which was once necessary in connection with primary production has now been eliminated. In the dairying industry milking machines, coolers, and other equipment have been installed and the services of many young men are not now needed. The representatives in this Parliament, particularly of country constituencita, once knew little of the youth unemploment problem; but we are now interviewed almost daily by farmers and other country residents asking if we can assist their song to obtain employment, either in the Public Service, in munitions factories or in other governmental undertakings. We are also asked if we cannot exercise our influence with the directors and managers of some of the vast industrial undertakings ; but owing to the lack of activity on the part of the Government, employment cannot be found for many deserving youngmen. It is therefore the responsibility of the National Parliament to provide work for these youths by, say, the development of the motor car manufacturing industry. The present Minister for External Affairs( Sir Henry Gullett) when a private member strongly advocated the manufacture of the Australian motor car, and had this Government been earnest in that matter, as it has been in providing for wasteful defence expenditure, it might have found a solution of this tragic problem. Closely associated with the employment of young persons is the education of youths to equip them for positions in our secondary industries. I am fully in accord with the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) who contends that it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to assist in providing technical education particularly as in every State technical schools are over-crowded. There is a shortage of teachers and equipment, the buildings are too small, and the equipment insufficient. This problem is becoming more accentuated every day, and in at least, one State the technical schools are unable to absorb the students offering.. I trust that the Government will remedy this position, and become conscious of the great need which exists in .the community in this respect. During the debates on this subject. I have listened to speakers on both sides of the chamber speaking of the necessity to dispense with dead-end jobs; but no one has yet defined what a "" dead-end "" joh actually is. Perhaps the Minister who is conversing with another Minister instead of attending to his job to make a constructive contribution to this debate, and I think that the Minister in charge of the bill should listen when I am endeavouring to elicit information that will help me to deal with the subject intelligently. It is tragic to find fine specimens of young manhood from 18 to 21 years of age almost imploring us to assist them. I again ask the Ministeri f he can define a "" deadend"" job. He is dumb and will not attempt to assist me. In my ignorance",84,Spender

306,Mr Pollard,"I am endeavouringI am not sure whether the term applies to men who are compelled to leave the industrial arena at 21 because they w ill be entitled to higher wages, or whether it casual that is so, who is going to undertake dead-end jobs which necessarily w ill always exist? If the concentration of the Government on this problem should have such satisfactory results that men vvill no longer be available for such jobs, what w ill be the position? tliat the Minister, dumb as he is, will urge the Government to tackle the problem of training youths for technical work, and in that way make employment more attractive than it is to-day. The Government should exercise whatever power it possesses to institute a 40-hour week, and in that way help to improve the working conditions of those who are supposed to be occupying dead-end jobs. Some portion of the money being appropriated under this bill should be used to train those left in dead-end jobs to become more skilled, and eventually deadend jobs would become more attractive than they are to-day. I have always felt that the motor manufacturing industry offers greater opportunities for the employment of youths and artisans in this country than almost any other, particularly as in many inland cities and country towns there are engineering shops and technical staffs quite capable of undertaking the manufacture of the component parts of a motor car, which could be forwarded to large assembly works in the most suitable centre. All of our defence expenditure is being centralized in the coastal cities, but I trust that when the manufacture of motor cars is seriously tackled in Australia, an effective decentralization policy w ill be adopted.

I should also like an assurance that this grant w ill not have a fate something like the fate which attended the farmers' debt adjustment scheme, under which, whereas the States were promised £12,000,000, they have received only £6,000,000 or £7,000,000. their £12,000,000, but perhaps not for tliat purpose. get the public money for public works they do not get it for farmers' debt adjustment, and vice versa.

I hope that this measure w ill be agreed to by this Parliament, but that the people will realize that the bill represents an inadequate provision to meet this all important problem.

The problem of unemployment, especially unemployment of youths, transcends in importance all other problems, even that of defence. Instead of a bill for the distribution of £200,000 to the States, we should be discussing a measure for the provision of £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 for the construction of technical schools, of a magnitude at least equal to the new defence buildings that arc being constructed at Maribyrnong and elsewhere, in which youths could be",85,Spender

In 1931-32, I asked the Government of the day to place a sum of money on the Estimates for youth vocational training and ever since 1932 I have been urging the Government to tackle the problem, and.I congratulate the Ministry on the introduction of this measure. My principal reason in speaking is to discuss the way in which thc States disburse the shares they receive from grants of this sort. Last year the Commonwealth Government distributed £200,000 to the States under a bill somewhat similar to this measure, and the South Australian share of £19,000 was supplemented by another £17,000 by the State Government. That State wisely spent what it received. I know that that is so, because from time to time. I have made it my business to attend at the South Australian schools to ascertain what results are being achieved. I understand, however, that some of the States, New South Wales for one, and I think, also Western Australia, have failed to use the money for the purpose designated by this Parliament, and may have paid it into revenue. and I hope that the Assistant Treasurer will be able to enlighten honourable members as to actual facts the funds are being expended on extensions and equipment of schools of mines, the Muresk Agricultural College and the Perth Technical College. About £18,000 is being put into the building of the technical college. honourable gentleman's cliarge. ness for Western Australia, but I thought, that the money was voted by this Parliament for the actual training of youths. Air. SPENDER -The Commonwealth advanced the money for the purposes of capital expenditure on something lasting. hearted support because I feel that in pursuing this line of action the Commonwealth Government is doing a real service. amount of £200,000 is a niggardly contribution from the National Government to the States for the technical training of youths. About £2,000,000 would be a more fitting payment for this Government to inake in view of the fact that there -ire so many tens of thousands of youths in this country who need equipping to meet, the storms of life. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) estimated that in Sydney alone there are 1.0,000 unemployed youths, but I should say that his estimate is far below the actual figure. In the Newcastle and Maitland areas there are thousands of young men of 25 or 26 years of age who have never known work. These figures make the grant of £200,000 ridiculously small. New South Wales is to receive only about £80,000. The bill is merely camouflage designed to induce the people to believe that the Commonwealth Government is honest in its intention to do something for the youths of Australia who are really the backbone of the country. The country's economic security depends on the well-being of its people. I object, to the slipshod method adopted in the distribution of this money. Apparently there has been no inquiry as t,o what methods of control of the expenditure will be adopted by the States. I take this opportunity to direct the attention of the Government to the fact that there has developed in New South Wales a deplorable circumstance in which certain employers are taking advantage of the grant of money for this purpose by the Commonwealth Government to the State Government to flout industrial awards. In country towns certain garage proprietors take youths on to their staffs in order to train them as mechanics. When these youths are approaching the skilled stage which would entitle them to reasonable rates of payment the employers announce that they are to be dismissed. Application is then made to the State authority controlling the youth employment fund with the result that those authorities subsidize the employers by £2 2s. a week in respect of each young",86,Spender

Notwithstanding the fact that the lad's services are costing them only £1 Is. a week the employers charge full rates for the work that they do. Honest employers who observe the awards and pay full wages are unable to meet such unfair competition. This is a mabter which should be dealt with severely by the Commonwealth Government. Efforts should also be made to see that some money is expended in giving mechanical training to youths so that they may take their place as skilled tradesmen. Throughout the length and breadth of Australia to-day there are hundreds of youths who have no mechanical knowledge whatsoever. This bill, as I said before, is only a paltry attempt to solve the vital problem of unemployed youths. I do not think the Government is serious in this matter, because if it were serious it would evolve a definite plan whereby the money which it proposes to grant to the States would be expended judiciously and would have some appreciable effect. I hope that steps will be taken to ensure that the money will be devoted to the purpose for which it has been allocated and will not, as the honourable member for Boothby( Mr pose of dealing with this probPrice) suggested, be paid by the States into Consolidated Revenue. for Boothby produced no evidence in support of his contention. ment for an honourable member to make. It should be definitely investigated. in New South Wales under the Stevens Government, but it was not done in Western Australia where there is a Labour Government. Minister should give a full explanation. I do not know that the system to which I have referred is definitely in operation in New Souith Wales to-day, but the -Government should make an investigation it the earliest possible moment and make sure that the money which it is granting will not be used to break down awards and working conditions. The -Government is not tackling this very serious problem in the right way by bringing down a measure such as this in the dying hours of this session, and not giving any detailed explanation as to how the money is to be expended. I suggest that the Government should seriously consider assisting the States in the provision of educational facilities, such as technical training. The burden of education to-day is more than the States are able to bear, and I submit that it is a function of this Government to ensure that the youths of Australia are adequately trained to engage in skilled employment. Legislation of this character should be much more liberal. To allocate only £80,000 to a State as large as New South Wales is only begging the question. -No one can deny the gravity of this problem. It is unfortunate that measures of this kind are brought down in such a way that honourable members are given very scant time to discuss them. The young men of Austr.alia, who are looking to the Commonwealth Government to assist them in making a start in life will say in regard to this measure, "" Thank you for nothing "". To allocate the paltry sum of £200,000 for the purlem throughout the Commonwealth is laughable. One of the gravest features of this problem is the practice which has grown up in industry to-day of sacking hoys when they reach the age of 18 or 21 years, because they would have to be paid higher wages. The Commonwealth Government itself is a very serious offender in this matter. RecentlyI received a beseeching letter from a young man in the Department of Trade and Customs who was to be discharged because, at the age of 21, he was regarded as too old. The Postmaster-General's Department has also been one of the worse offenders in this regard. In that department, it is the practice to employ boys as telegraph messengers until they reach the age of sixteen or eighteen years and then -to discharge them because, under the Oommonwealth awards, their wages are becoming too great. This tendency is a manifestation of the dying system of production for profit. Industry to-day has become so organized that machines are-",87,Spender

I have no objection to that, but it is a tragedy to see young men who can only obtain relief work being sent into slush and mud up to their knees when the work could be done much more efficiently by machinery. relief work is all they can obtain as a means of livelihood, and they are forced to do whatever the Government asks. I say to the youth of Australia to-day, "" Do not go down on your knees and beg for work. You have a right to live and if society cannot find you work, then it must grant you the right to live "". That is the Government's job. I am satisfied that until the vicious system in operation to-day is abandoned, there can he no hope of alleviating the unfortunate position of unemployed youths and unemployed persons generally. This problem must be tackled from its very foundations. If production for profit cannot he eliminated then profit must be regulated and the controllers of industry must be forced to pay better wages and give their employees better working conditions. What is the use of talking about £200,000? The Government might just as well talk about 2d. when it comes to giving occupational training to a few young men, because before they will finish the training there will be machines that will do the work they are being trained to perform. That experience is repeating itself every day. t do not desire to reiterate the evidence available, but unless the Government attacks the problem from the point of view that every body is to share in the production of machinery and in the advantages that the employment of machinery gives to the human race there will be no benefit to anybody. If machinery that is doubling and trebling production every few years and so reducing employment is to be piled up there will be no remedy. The Government must face the matter from the point of view of managed economy. The Minister has talked of scientific control. If he wishes to handle the problem, he should bring in the scientist to find jobs for youths. That expert would tell what the country's productive capacity is, its man-power, and the number of men, women and children there are to feed. I get tired of listening to the palliatives suggested, when we know that the approach to the question is only humbug; it is like little children pretending to be Eed Indians. The Government is trying to persuade the people outside Parliament that it is However, doing something, but it is not even touching the fringe of the problem. It cannot do so unless it faces the matter honestly. The vicious system under which we live must be attacked. This is not a problem of only to-day or yesterday; it is as old as the history of man, but it now manifests itself in different phases from, what it did 100 years ago, and that is due to the ever-changing complexity of the economic arrangements of the nation. There are the few who have and the many who have not. The Government must be prepared to realize that and to approach the question so that it will mobilize the resources of the country and carve out an economic policy that will have regard for human well-being. Human well-being is the first problem, and it can be guaranteed only when the wealth produced each year is equably divided among those who produce it. able memher propose to do it? if I attempted to explain it now I should transgress the Standing Orders. The Government would have to move towards managed economy and the reduction of profits, if not their complete abolition. This may be called socialism or any other ism, but the Government must move towards it. I am not foolish enough to say that the Government can jump to it, but no attempt has been made to bring about something like an equable distribution of the productive resources of the nation; on the contrary, most of the things done have simply aggravated the position. Will the Government say that £200,000 is worth a snap of the fingers towards solving the problem of the unemployed youth to-day? I believe that the Minister has done some thinking on this subject. that this measure would solve the problem of unemployment, but that is not the point to be debated on this bill. am trying to drive home is the stupidity",88,Spender

That is a stupid interjection. This is the kind of thing that goes on and the Government gets away with the suggestion that it is doing something for the youth of this country when it is doing nothing. The Government can find £60,000,000, £90,000,000 or £100,000,000 for defence purposes; in fact, there is no limit to the amount it can raise. If die Government allows things to go on much longer with the constantlygrowing problem of unemployment, there will be no manhood in this country to defend it in a. few years' time. Man cannot continue to live under the present conditions. The race is being destroyed before it gets a chance. What sort of fathers and mothers will the men and women be who are living on the dole and relief work? What sort of families will under-nourished ^men and women bring into the world? knows that that is more a question for a biologist than it is for me, but this fact is self-evident to the meanest intellect. I wish the Minister to tell us what the Government intends to do in regard to the matters of which I have spoken. What does it propose to do for the youths who have heen ""sacked"" ? What is to happen to the boy of 21 years of age, who was disthe honourable missed from the Customs Department because otherwise he would have drawn too high wages? I have sent a letter to the Minister on the subject. What will the Government do for the youths that it entices into the Post and Telegraph Department at fourteen years of age and sacks at sixteen years of age, because they have to receive higher wages? It is of little use for the Government to talk about providing for youths dismissed by private employers while it continues to permit government departments to dismiss so many of their youthful employees. Even in prosperous times, before the man-made depression overtook us, that policy was followed in the Postal Department. It is also the practice of Minister t.he Telephone Department to treat girls in the exchanges in this unfair way. Seeing that thousands of young government employees are dismissed from their employment every year because they reach the age of-21 years, it is hypocritical for the Government to talk about correcting I would not vote the faults of private enterprise in this regard. I urge the Government to give instructions that the young men in its employ shall be retained in the service in some capacity which, they are competent, to fill. The amount which the Government is now asking us to vote for the encouragement of the employment of youth is paltry and wholly inadequate. I shall not repeat the arguments in the excellent speech delivered by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini). It must be as apparent to the public generally, as it is to honourable members, that this Government, whicli has been in office since 1931-for 1 regard it as tbe same government although the personnel has changed somewhat-ca n do nothing but talk about providing employment for youth.

337,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.52],"the bona fides of the States in the expenditure of this money. In New South Wales a subsidized apprenticeship scheme was put into operation, but nothing was done to provide for the adequate supervision of it. Therefore, many objectionable practices were adopted. I have in mind a youth who lives in the electorate of Cook. He was employed under the subsidized apprenticeship scheme for three months by a certain firm, aud then dismissed as unsuitable. The whole of his time was occupied in labouring work, for the firm was shifting its premises during that period, and his duties consisted of help3 ing to dismantle the machinery and transport it to new premises. He was given no opportunity whatever to learn the trade he wished to learn, yet he was dismissed as unsuitable. The representations which the honourable member for Cook( Mr Sheehan) made on his behalf met with no success whatever. Other unscrupulous employers have also made use of that so-called subsidized apprenticeship scheme to obtain cheap labour, for under it the Government, pays part of the wages of the alleged apprentices. The Commonwealth Government should insist that any apprenticeship scheme is adequately supervised. Commonwealth and State co-operation it. essential in this matter of youth employment, but difficult because of the operation of certain soldier preference measures in the various States. were reviewed. A boy born in 1918, the year the war ended, would he 21 to-day. Yet he is seriously handicapped in his search for employment because of the operation of the soldier preference measures. personal view on this subject, on a number of occasions. now growing old and in ill health are being handicapped because their able bodied sons cannot obtain employment owing to the operation of this legislation. are obliged to remain in work in order fo maintain their families. Some of the aldermen of the Sydney City Council have endeavoured to meet the position. but they have been debarred from giving employment to young men over the age of 21 solely because of the existence of the soldier preference principle. I urge the Government to consult with the State authorities on this subject to see whether some more satisfactory arrangements cannot be made. Under existing conditions the very men which these measures are alleged to help are handicapped by them. I agree with the honourable member for Werriwa that no effective results are being obtained from the expenditure of the money previously provided for the technical training of young men. One reason for this is that after those men are trained they are left without regular employment. Some of them have had to become voluntary outcasts from their own country on this account. They have gone to the sister Dominion of New Zealand where, under a Labour administration, industry is prosperous and developmental works are in operation. In that dominion decent conditions and good wages are provided which many Australians are to-day enjoying. This Government should adopt a comprehensive plan for national development under which the young men of this country would be assured of permanent employment. I daresay those of us who are still members of this Parliament nine or ten years hence will find that if an antiit is rendered Labour government is still in officea circumstance it is hard to imagine-the Government will he still talking about It is time these, too, providing for the employment of youth butdoing nothing to give effect to such a policy. Economic planning on a national scale is necessary. Our problems should be faced in a scientific way. Only by that means will they be solved. The provision of a miserable £200.000 to provide for the employment of youth is practically useless. In any case, I ask the Minister to give me an assurance that any subsidized schemes of training assisted hy means of this money will be properly policed, so that honourable members may be assured that this money will be used for the purpose for which it is being Consequently they themselves voted I hope also that he will take up with the State governments the question of the effect on the employment of youths of the operation of the policy of preference to returned soldiers.",90,Spender

Treasurer) [12.1 a.m.] -in replyI do not propose at this late hour to do more than seek to summarize a few of the points raised by honourable members during this debate. No one will dispute that the question of youth unemployment is a very serious one. The cold hard fact is that each year the number of unemployed unskilled or semi-skilled men is being increased as a result of young men being thrown out of employment. A review of the circumstances shows that to a large degree this is due to the fact that young men are employed in certain industries only up to the time they reach the age of 21 years, and are then thrown out of employment. They then come upon the already saturated market and to a substantial degree the difficulty I am able to do anything to assist in th< is aggravated from year to year. The Government does not suggest that this scheme touches more than the fringe of the problem. The real problem is how best to absorb in useful and continuous employment the young men thrown into the discard at 21 years of age. I am no recent convert to the cause of youth; but I do not believe, for example, that the spending of any unlimited sum of money on vocational employment will solve their problem. The point is how to find avenues of useful employment. There are only two avenues; one is through private industry which, at the present moment, does not lend itself readily, so far as I can see, to their absorption building industry? member knows I am strongly in favour of the development of that industry. The other method is through the medium of public works, but that medium is questionable. other works. avenue for the employment of young men is wrong. I agree and would not dispute that certain public works in their turn assist in providing other works and so assist in the solution of the problem. The problem of youth employment is, of course, part of the general problem of employment, but at the same time presents certain peculiar features of its own. A review of industries will show that in the retail trade sometimes as much as 33 per cent, of the employees are juveniles, that in the wholesale trade, the percentage of juveniles is in the vicinity of 20 per cent., and that the percentage of juveniles in factories is about the same. Those are the chief industries in which juvenile labour is employed. We find, too, that in New South Wales alone, in the year 1937, permits were issued for the employment of 6,000 boys and 6,000 girls under the age of sixtee ?! years. 4 I regard that myself-and I have no hesitation in saying so-as a serious reflection upon our economic structure. Indeed, honourable members may rest assured that so far as ; solution of this problem, something will be done. I have no doubt that this Government can be relied on to take no narrow view of this problem, but a wider national view in its attempts to solve it. If one considers the means by whicli juvenile labour may be restricted, and thereby increase the number of jobs available to young men, there are avenues which suggest themselves. I summarize these avenues as follows:(1) By direct legislation or through the medium of the arbitration courts, working in co-ordination with all the States-becaus e without co-ordination the scheme would fail-to fix the proportion of juvenile labour in any given industry; (2) By the enactment of laws operating under a co-ordinated plan which would prevent the employment of juveniles below a certain age; and in conjunction with that; (3) By the adoption of uniform laws governing school leaving age. The unfortunate fact is that most of the younger men who are in the ranks of the unemployed at the present time are not there because they are inefficient, or because they are not physically capable of discharging heavy labouring duties. Indeed, it is found that about 75 per cent, of the younger men are strong enough to carry out the most arduous",91,Spender

It says that, in each case, the terms shall include territories of the Commonwealth to which the act extends. The fourth clause provides for the inclusion in the principal act of a new section, 5A, which says that the act shall extend to the territories of the Commonwealth as if each of those territories vvere part of the Commonwealth. Parts 4, 5, 12, 13 and 14 of the Defence Act do not apply to natives of any territory governed by the Commonwealth under a mandate. Attention has been drawn to what is a serious defect in the Defence Act at the present time, in that it does not apply . to either Norfolk Island or Papua. The acts governing some territories of the Commonwealth contain a clause which negatives application to them of any other act, unless that act is expressed to extend to the territory. For example, owing to the prohibition contained in section 7 of the Papua Act 1905-1934, the Defence Act-and , consequently, the Australian Military Regulations-doe s not operate in Papua. For the same reason, the Control of Defence Areas Begulations are not operative at Port Moresby, and it was recently found that there was no law to prevent the erection there of certain oil installations in a position where they would menace defence works. The extension of the Defence Act to the territories has become urgent because of the necessity for raising forces for local defence purposes. Clause5 provides for the repeal of section S of the principal act, and the subhas been rendered necessary by the apmendation of Inspector-General Squires in his first report that there should be a grouping of formations into commands to time of peace and war.

I submit that that mere prohibitory section, section 49 of the Defence Act, does not apply the whole of that act to the non-mandated territories, and if it did, it seems perfectly clear that it would not apply to the mandated territory, because, although the Acts Interpretation Act of .1.930 denned the territories of the Commonwealth to include the mandated territory, two of Their Honours of the High Court in Jolly v. Mainka were of opinion that that definition could not apply to any act before 1930. The Military Forces are divided into the Permanent Forces and the Citizen Forces. The persons who, under section 59 of thu Defence Act, can be called upon to serve in time of war, are in the Reserve Forces. All men between the ages of 18 and 60 are members of the Reserve Forces as defined in that act, and the section which I have read provides that they are to be used for the defence of Australian territory. .There is nothing in that provision that extends defence and protection of the Oommonwealth to the defence and protection of the territories of the Commonwealth. The only section to which the Minister can point is section 49, and that section does not amount to an expressed extension of the Defence Act to the territories. It may leave the inatter doubtful, but I prefer it to remain doubtful rather than have a definite provision inserted whereby the men of Australia may be compelled to serve in the Admiralty Islands or some islands which are near the equator. Eveni f the Minister is right, this bill as presented to I he House will have the effect of compelling Australians to serve against their will in the mandated territories. The Minister cannot contend in any way that the Defence Act, as it stands at present, applies to the Mandated Territories, but this bill proposes to apply that act and the actual continent of Australia and mandated territories. That is a yery serious departure from the principle of the Defence Act. It has always been understood that the men of Australia could, in time of actual or apprehended invasion, be called upon to serve in the defence of Australia, and whenever territories have been created provision has been made in nearly every act relating to such territories that the Commonwealth legislation shall not apply to them unless intended to apply. I refer the Minister to section 7 of the Papua Act, section 35 of the New Guinea Act, section 7 of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands Act, and section 5 of the Norfolk Island Act. The only territory in respect of which this provision is not made is Antarctica. Theoretically, however, there is no doubt that if this measure is passed in its present form, it would be legally competent for the Commonwealth Government to compel Australian people to serve in Antarctica. If this change is made in the law, it will be possible for forces to be raised anywhere in Australia to serve in New Guinea, the German Solomons, New Britain and the Admiralty Islands which are nearly on the eqjuator. I suggest that such a proposal should not be made in the dying hours of a session. It is an important extension of the obligation to serve. Sections 59 and 46 were inserted in the Defence Act in 1903, with grave misgivings. The first Defence Act brought to this House was found upon examination to contain a carefully wrapped-up provision by virtue of which Australian young men could be compelled to serve anywhere. The honourable member for North Melbourne, MrH . B. Higgins, as he then was, pointed out that under that provision, Australian men could be forced to serve in Afghanistan, or anywhere else; and so great was the opposition that the hill was eventually dropped, and in 1903 the tendency was to limit the obligation to serve in Australia only. Section 49 of the Defence Act is prohibitive. It says that men shall not be required to serve except in the Commonwealth and territories, but it does",95,Second Eeading
352,Mr Street,Does that not refer only,96,Second Eeading
353,Mr Blackburn,"No, it says thatnot expressly provide that men can he required to serve in the territories. That does not amount to the express provision which section 7 of the Papua Act and section 35 of the New Guinea Act require. If there is a doubt it should be preserved. I do not desire Parliament to make an alteration of the act, making it perfectly clear that the Commonwealth Government will he able to compel men to serve in New Guinea, the Admiralty Islands or the Solomons. This Parliament has always been very jealous of the limitations of the power to exact compulsory service or compulsory training. When it inserted section 59 in the Defence Act, it also inserted section 49 in that act, and when it provided for compulsory training it, provided for compulsory training for the defence of the Australian territory only. . It was thought that no departure from the principle ought to be made the people, and a referendum was taken on that issue in 1916. Now we are being asked, just before Parliament goes into recess, to extend the operation of the Defence Act so that Australian men can be required to serve not only on the actual continent of Australia and the island of Tasmania, but also in the Territory of Papua and the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. That is something to which this House will not agree if honourable members understand the position. Such a proposal might be carried in the dying hours of a session when many honorahle members are anxious to get away, but if it is it will be a gross betrayal of the interests of the people we are here to represent. In my view, I repeat, the Defence Act, as it stands at present, imposes an obligation to serve for the defence of Australia, meaning thereby the continent of Australia and the island of Tasmania. It does not contain any expressed provision to extend the operation of that obligation to either Papua or the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. The acts relating to those territories provide that no act of the National Parliament shall apply to them unless it contains express provisions for that purpose. I cannot find in the Defence Act any express provision applying the obligation to serve in time of war to those territories: but if this bill be passed, that obligation will rest on the manhood of Australia. But even if the Defence Act does apply to Papua, it certainly does not apply to . New Guinea. I hope that the House will refuse to make the amendments contained in clauses 3 and 4 of the bill. They appear to he innocent, because they come under the mask of interpreting clausesclauses which alter the interpretation of the act-bu t in this matter we must be exceedingly careful, for those clauses, by altering the meaning of words, actually extend the operation of the act. Proposed new section 5A 1 readsThis act shall extend to the territories of the Commonwealtli as if each of those territories were part of the Commonwealth. Associating that provision with the Defence Act, there is an obligation on the part of every male between the ages of without the sanction of 18 and 60 years to serve in the territories of the Commonwealth in time of war. Sub-section 2 of proposed new section 5A readsParts IV., V., XII . , XIII . and XIV. of this act shall not apply to the native inhabitants of any territory governed by the Commonwealth under a mandate. If full consideration is given to so important a subject, the present sittings will have to extend beyond this week. I know that the bill could be carried by the application of the closure and the operation of the guillotine; hut I warn honourable members that in voting for such methods they will be voting for the imposition of an extended form of conscription on the Australian people. The party of which I am a member will strenuously resist any such proposal. The Minister would be well advised to drop the early clauses of the bill, for he can achieve his objective by an amendment of the Papua Act. If he wants to provide for the military discipline of the forces in Papua, he can do so by a simple amendment of either that act or the Defence Act. In this bill, he proposes to go far beyond that. Measures such as this justify the suspicions of the Opposition and of the electors. Under the guise of innocent preparation and extensions of the law, the Government is attempting to encroach on the liberties of the people.

I have conferred with the Crown Law officials and the officers of the External Affairs Department. The power is not general. general. when the Minister considers it necessary, an alien should be required to report at intervals so that his movements may be continually checked. of the British Empire, particularly in South Africa, persons are engaged in certain questionable activities, and if the power provided in this measure were extended as I suggest, the movements of aliens during the 60 days in which they would be permitted to remain in Australia without registration could be checked, and in that way the Government would have a much greater control over them. I trust that the amendment to be moved by the honorable member Archie Cameron) will receive the serious consideration of the Government. The Minister in charge of the bill mentioned the concentration of aliens, 'but I do not think that the Government can check concentration under this measure. The admission of an alien may be on the condition that he shall not settle in any particular area, but, in fact, he is entitled to go where he desires. All this legislation provides is that he shall report any change of address to the electoral officer of a subdivision. The prevention of concentration by registration will be quite they be ineffective. It is only reasonable to assume that aliens settling in this country will wish to congregate in alien communities, as would Britishers in a foreign country. Our main objective should be to endeavour to absorb aliens into the Australian community, and in that connection I again bring forward the subject 1 have mentioned previously-the control of newspapers printed in a foreign language. I am not opposed, of course, the to the circulation of educational works, or to the importation of foreign newspapers, but I am opposed to the publication in Australia of newspapers printed in a foreign language. The assimilation of aliens in our population can be achieved more effectively by means of a common press than in any other way. If Britons settled in a foreign country, grouped themselves in one locality, and were allowed to pubObject to it being lish newspapers in the English language, soon they would constitute an alien British community in that country. That undoubtedly has been the case in the United States of America. Citizens of the United States of In certain parts America have assured me that the authorities in that country are sorry not only that they applied the open door policy and allowed alien groups to settle, but also that they obtained no effective control over the press established by aliens and so allowed them to carry on their traditions that to-day even the third and fourth generations retain their old nationalities as Poles, Spaniards, Italians, or whatever their grandparents and great-grandparents were when they migrated to America. These groups for Barker( Mr live within the body of the nation as almost separate entities, and as the result of their establishment, the Government of the United States of America finds it almost impossible to apply a direct line of policy on affairs not only international, but also internal.

By this means we are preventing the assimilation of the alien migrants into our nation. to gain a knowledge of foreign languages. the point raised by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). I have already said that I am not against the importation of educational works or newspapers from Germany or any other foreign country, but I am against the circulation of newspapers printed in foreign languages in Australia, because they preach the ideals and traditions not of Australia, but of the lands from which the readers and publishers came. complete absorption of alien migrants into our population, the Government should exercise the power it. has to put a stop to the dissemination of propaganda directed against the interests of Australia electoral officers in the several States in newspapers published locally in languages other than English. I am told that in the External Affairs Department translators have to be employed continually in the checking of such newspapers. I believe also, on authority, that those newspapers need checking. The alien problem in South Africa is causing perturbation to the Union, and compels the government of the Union to take certain steps which would not have been necessary now had the development of alien groups been prevented in years gone by. Those groups are a distinct source of weakness in the Union, and I do not want Australia to suffer similarly. In order that it should not, this Governcards are issued. ment must give a good deal more consideration than it has given to a policy of alien migration. than that, I shall not attempt to go. to the settlement of the alien problem, bnt the greater aspects of the problem have yet to be considered. time for that consideration will not be when the problem has assumed tremendous importance; the time is now, and I hope that the Government will in the near future bring down a bill for the application of a policy to which every member of the Australian community can subscribe with confidence. a.m.]I regret that the debate is taking place at such a late hour because I had wished to discuss many aspects of this problem. I shall content myself with naming what I consider to be two important omissions from this bill. The bill provides that electoral omcers in each State, the Chief Electoral Officer in the Australian Capital Territory and the Returning Officer in the Northern Territory, shall keep an index of aliens. That is all right so long as the aliens are law abiding and so long as the machinery works, but experience of even our own people, shows that people are apt to be forgetful and, sometimes, not law abiding. We must expect the In order to ensure the same lapses on the part of alien migrants. It would be difficult to keep track of the aliens registered under this hill unless there were set up a central register in Canberra to which the would furnish returns. For example, an alien may slip unnoticed into Victoria and transgress the laws of that State. The Victorian police would be put to the trouble of corresponding with the registrars in each of the other States and the two Oommonwealth territories in order to ascertain where he was registered. That would be avoided, and inquiries would be facilitated if there were a central registration bureau. The second point which occupies my mind is the failure of the bill to specify that the registration cards that are to foe issued under the bill to aliens shall bear photographs of the persons to whom tbe fingerprints ? so f..r as to suggest that the aliens should This measure is a contribution be fingerprinted as part of this system, but I do suggest that they should be photographed and that their photographs The should be printed on their registration cards. It is difficult to distinguish one foreigner from another. Handwriting is not a sufficient guide. In most European countries every visitor carries a card of identity which includes a photograph of",99,Perkins

The points that I have suggested are worthy of inclusion in the bill in order to make the measure an effective check on the registration of aliens. ajn.] -The provisions of this bill are on the whole very reasonable. I propose to make some suggestions in committee, but I rise to speak mainly because of the suggestion that the bill should contain more stringent provisions directed against aliens. The point I wish to make is that this country has a tradition of tolerance of aliens. That tradition is based on the fact that non-British people have made large contributions to this country. The discovery of gold, especially in Victoria, attracted a large number of people who had taken part in the Young European Movement and who led, and to a large extent inspired the democracy of Australia. Apart from them we had enormous contributions from the religious exiles from Germany, the Lutherans, who came to Australia in 1.839. They have contributed great advantages to South Australia and Victoria; they have especially left their mark upon South Australia. We owe tlie wine industry to an Italian-Swiss, the butter industry to Danes, and other industries to other aliens who came here. We have shown them a very tolerant spirit, especially in the State to which I belong. In Victoria we have agreed that an alien may hold land although Queensland forbids it. We do not go as far as some of the States of America which permit men to vote after a certain residence while they are still aliens. In the United States of America the famous Judah Benjamin, the author of Sales, was Attorney-General of the Southern Confederacy of America and before that a member of the United States Senate, and he was nothing more than a British subject. When he returned to England he practised at the British bar without difficulty because he had never ceased to be a British subject. Although it may be necessary for this country to regisCanada and 'South Africa, which are all ter aliens it should not do so in a spirit depreciatory of them, but merely for its own protection. We ought, as has been suggested, to say this to them, "" While wo are imposing this system of registration, [69] we wish to make, it easier for you to acquire Australian nationality"". It should be understood that we are doing this for our own protection and not in a spirit of hostility to them. An honourable member suggested that the Commonwealth Government should have power to depori aliens, and he said that the power i -> deport is necessary because aliens may be guilty of subversive actions, or of offences against our laws. We have laws providing that aliens and British subjects nn; born in Australia may be deported for using subversive language, for membership of subversive organizations, for taking part in strikes and lock-outs, and so forth. The honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) challenged me to give a reference on this matter, and I refer him to section 30L of the Crimes Act(2) The Attorney-General ""may, by order under his hand; direct that any person, not born in Australia, who is convicted oi any offence under section thirty e„ thirty j or thirty Q of this act, shall be deported from the Commonwealth. It will be remembered that without the preliminary condition of a trial it was attempted to deport people who were British subjects, but that failed because the High Court held that persons who were in this country before the Commonwealth was founded were members of the Australian community. Tbat was one of the reasons why the attempt failed. The point I wish to make is that this' legislation should not be considered as anti-alien legislation. We are entitled to pass these laws for the protection of ourselves because although we have a register of .our citizens under the Commonwealth Electoral Act, we have no register of the persons whose names do not appear on the electoral roll. I object strongly to the suggestion that the alien is a potential enemy of Australia, the aliens have not been our enemies. The people who have come here have made great contributions to this country and have enriched its life. I believe that aliens have enriched the life of America., the better because of the influx of people of different races. The various strains that have poured into the United States of America have made it a greater and more vigorous nation",100,Perkins
375,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [1.9,"than it would have been otherwise. We have had a great mixture of strains in Australia. The honourable member foi 1 Wannon( Mr Scholfield) does not object to the many descendants of aliens who are constituents in his electorate. loyalty of those men was tested in 1913. In tuait, year the Kaiser celebrated his 50th birthday, and the German Language Union was formed; Germans all over the world were urged to join that organization. An appeal was made to the Australian-German Lutherans, whose ancestors had fled on account of religious persecution in their country. The German authorities had attempted to force a creed on them, had taken their children from them and baptized them in a new religion; and they had ruined and persecuted many. Some of those people fled to the United States of America, and some to Australia. What did their descendants in this country say when they vvere invited to join that union? They said, "" We have received nothing but tolerance in Australia. From the Kaiser and his government we had nothing but persecution. We arc not Germans, but Britisli. We keep alive the German language because in it Luther translated the Bible and wrote his hymns"". devotion to this country was also tested by the fact that many of them went to the Great War. Thousands volunteered in South Australia, as did many in Victoria. Small congregations in the Wimmera and Wannon districts had no young men left. All the men bearing German names had gone to fight for tbe country that had given them a free life. Such people have made great contributions -social, this country, and it is most undesirable that we should enact legislation which stamps the alien, the stranger within our gates, as a potential enemy. We are entitled to make a register of aliens, and we should make an easier opportunity for them to become naturalized citizens of this country. We should see that this legislation is framed in a fair and tolerant spirit-there which I shall direct attention-and designed for the protection of Australia, and not for the denunciation of aliens. It would be very dangerous to load the Mr Mackburn. measure with the anti-alien provisions suggested by some honourable members yf the Houso. ter in charge of External TerriThe tories) [1.18 a.m.] -in reply1 regret that the debate on this measure has been interrupted, and, consequently, has been hard to follow, but its general tone shows that the House agrees that aliens should be registered. I think that probably the last speaker has a better idea of what the Government has in view than have some other honourable members. It is a matter, nol of alienating the sympathy of people of other nations, but of making them feel at home. Many of the proposals suggested could not be introduced into this bill. If the reforms mentioned were necessary, they would probably involve amendment of the Immigration Act or the Nationality Act. The bill is purely and simply for the registration of aliens, but the other things that might follow in time of war are not considered necessary now. If we were at war most of the conditions mentioned could be met. by thc powers contained in the Defence Act. Here is a simple measure that will, I am sure, meet with Their the approval of the House generally, and it will not inflict any more hardship on aliens than Australians themselves suffer to-day. We all register our names on the electoral roll and we all are liable to pay fines if we fail to do so, or fail to record our votes at elections. Some speakers have suggested that the penalties provided in the bill are excessive, but I point out that they are very similar to the penalties provided in the cultural, and economic-to Electoral Act. The highest penalty under that act is £50 as it is in this measure. There is further provision that the electoral officers may under this measure aud in certain circumstances impose a fine not exceeding £5. That is really intended to try and keep cases out of the law courts in the interests of the people concerned. Fines of £5 are also provided under the Electoral Act, but usually the imposts are are one or two clauses to not more than a few shillings. is I congratulate the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) upon his excellent'contribution to the debate.

It feels that -McEwen) had a great deal to do with the drafting of this measure in its early stages and I regret that he did not have the opportunity of piloting it through the House. . Much of what he said, however, had relation to aliens about whom we might be concerned in war time, rather than to aliens of the character that this bill proposes to deal with. Some objection has been taken to the provision that a Minister may decide certain matters. The purpose of this is to counteract any suggestion that officers may be too officious. In effect, it is 'proposed that the Minister shall act as a kind of intermediary. The honourable member for ""Werriwa objected specifically to the provisions of sub-clause 3 of clause 14 to the effect that sixteen years who is not a British subject no prosecution for an offence against the sub-clause, which deals with the failure of occupiers of habitations or others to furnish' information, should be instituted without consent of the Minister. This is really a protective provision, designed to -restrain any tendency towards undue bureaucratic secrecy by reposing in the Minister, as' the representative of this Parliament, to which he is answerable, the final decision as to whether the circumstances of the case warrant the institution of legal proceedings or not. The honourable member also suggested that the definition "" Commonwealth officer "" embraced too many classes of persons. It is considered, however, that the definition could not be abridged without detrimentally affecting the effective administration of the bill and, in the event pf war, the desired control over our alien population. The honourable member may rest assured that adequate precautions will be employed to prevent "" the information in the records from being wrongfully divulged. course, be answerable to Parliament. honourable member for Batman ""( Mr shall be preserved. Brennan) suggested that the register of aliens should, under certain conditions, be open to public inspection. The honourable member for Werriwa held a different view. The Government also is opposed to the suggestion of the honorthat would be most undesirable in the interest of the aliens concerned. We have no desire or intention to make the information contained in these records available to foreign agents or to any one who might use it for improper or subversive purposes. The bill is really a registration measure, which will serve a useful purpose, not only for the Government, but also for the aliens themselves. Question resolved in the affirmative.

From my experience I know that they have very little, if any, spare time for extra duties, and if they are called upon to perform additional work they should be adequately paid for it. Their salaries, under present conditions, are not too large. I do not know that I should agree to allow the matter of any additional remuneration to be left to the Public Service Board for determination.

It is a somewhat amusing complaint coming from the ministerial side, that only one member of the' Opposition should -have ventured to strike a discordant note. reprimanded for a very mild offence. On this, clause, to which the observations of the Minister are peculiarly pertinent, and in anticipation of what the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) is about to say about the inviolable secrecy of this register, I Avould like to present a view consistent with my attitude to the whole bill and my second-reading speech. It is some time since I spoke upon the bill, and I presume I would not be in order now in quoting my actual words. But I know the tenor of my observations. In speaking of the welcome which we should give to aliens who had satisfied the Commonwealth authorities that they were desirable citizens I said that they should be accepted as welcome guests, and desirable citizens or, if not citizens in the full sense of the word, desirable residents of the Commonwealth. I said that no stigma should attach to a man because he was an alien-firs t because he had to be here for five years before he could qualify for full citizenship, and, in he had not qualified even after the expiration of that period, he might have sufficiently good reasons for not having done register, I think I pointed out-a t all events I do so now-that we have public records of our own citizens. ""We have our own electoral rolls for every part of the Commonwealth on which are recorded the names, addresses and occupations of all of the electors and which are open to inspection by every body. We have registries of births, marriages and deaths, where any citizen may go and find out particulars about a fellow citizen upon payment of a small fee. There are many -other public records affectingprivateinterests. I suggested, therefore, that as there was no stigma attaching to alienage, and as it might be desirable for any citizen to make himself acquainted with the names of persons who had been admitted to the Commonwealth and later on naturalized, in the same way as he could make contact with people already resident here, I saw no reason for secrecy in connection with the register, if the provisions of. this bill were operated in good faith and in the spirit in which they should I suggest that I was be operated. But of course, I assumed in favour of the Government, as I must assume in favour of any government, that such a list will be operated in good faith, and that the persons on that list will he treated fairly as desirable residents of this country. I did not assume against this or any future government that it might make that list the instrument of oppression of aliens resident in this country. I recalled in my speech the occasion of the last disastrous war when a concerted attempt was made"" to deport nonnaturalized Italians from this country against their will. ' born wives and children. sad chapter in the history of Australia and brought almost unlimited discredit upon this country. I was not counting on that kind of thing being repeated. I thought that a broad minded government, preferably a Labour one, would treat these aliens properly, and tbere would be no reason why the list the second place, although of aliens sbould be any more secret than a list of any other citizens. That was the whole head and front of my offending. I am sorry that I was the one Labour so. In regard to the member who was considered to have raised a discordant note during the second reading debate. [Quorum formed.] a.m.] I listened with attention to the opinions so succinctly and clearly expressed by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), but I am afraid that he has not given due weight, first to the local Australian prejudice against aliens-unreasonable , I believeand, secondly, to the jealousy and enmity",104,Perkins

It would, perhaps, operate to the prejudice of a man who had heen living in a district for years, if it became known that he was a foreigner, and the danger would become graver in times of tension. . Clause7 does not sufficiently safeguard the register. I have just had brought under my notice section 35 pf the Commonwealth Public Service Regulations which embodies a provision relating to secrecy. I believe that such a provision should be imposed by statute or by regulation. . I am not satisfied that the regulations under the Public Service Act go far enough. Some of the persons employed in the electoral department of the State are not Government officers at all. I was going to suggest that persons concerned with the compilation of the register should make an affidavit, or an oath of secrecy in the prescribed form but, in view of the regulations to which my attention has been drawn, I shall not press that point. I suggest that the Minister might consider this point when making regulations. But, I move That the words "" except for official purposes "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" by a person authorized in writing by the Minister"". The clause will then read that the register of aliens shall not be onen for inspection except by a person authorized in writing by the Minister. The.clause as it now stands gives no protection. policeman might claim the right to inspect the register for .official purposes.. accept the amendment.

Mr Rlaclcburn. remain in the Commonwealth, for more than sixty consecutive days; or I have received representations on this matter from several Yugo-Slavs in Western Australia, and also from the publisher of the., Yugo-Slav journal in Sydney. Under the law as.it now stands, it is difficult for, a foreigner to become naturalized in Australia. Frequently an objection is raised on the ground that the applicant has not a sufficient knowledge of the English language. Yugo-Slavs, like English people living in foreign countries, are gregarious, and tend to concentrate in certain hotels or residential areas. Yugoslavs find it difficult .to learn to. speak the English tongue fluently. Our, law provides that a foreigner must be resident in Australia for five years before becoming eligible for naturalization. In the United States of America, a period of six months' residence only is required before a foreigner may take out what are known as "" first papers"". I suggest that the period here should not be. more than three years, and that the language bar should be largely removed. If foreigners are able to live here for three years without coming into conflict with the law they should be welcomed as Australian citizens. I know of some Yugo-Slavs, the fathers of Australian school teachers, and in every way worthy persons, whose applications for naturalization have been refused. I also think that the fee of £5 is too high, and prevents many thrifty men from seeking naturaliA State zation. These men experience great difficulty in becoming naturalized, and we should not impose a hardship upon tbem by requiring them, after having lived in Australia for some years, to register as if they were criminals. a.m.] -Every Australian citizen is required, on reaching the age of 21 years, to enrol under the Electoral Act.

The maximum penalty for failure to enrol as an elector is only £2. 1 am aware that the fine of £50 provided for under this clause is the maximum penalty, but I think that the alternative punishment of imprisonment for three months would be too drastic. Assistant Minister) [1.54 a.m.] -The period of residence in Australia before naturalization can be secured is governed by an Imperial agreement, i i a person were naturalized in Australia after three years' residence in this country, he wojild not he recognized as a British subject in other parts of the Empire. But that matter has nothing to do with the measure under consideration.' Another suggestion put forward would, if adopted, require an amendment of the Nationality Act. I do not believe that any great hardship would be suffered by Yugo-Slavs, on account of this measure, hecause Australian citizens are liable to similar penalties for failure to comply with the Electoral Act. a.m.] -In the case of an Australian national or a British subject who fails to enrol, thc law discriminates between a first and a second offence. The penalty for the first offence is 10s., and for a subMinister,-in any particular case, may direct"". sequent offence, £2. It seems to me that the penalty of £50 or imprisonment for three months is an extremely heavy one for a first offence. I do not say that the penalty provided for an alien for non-enrolment should be the same as in the case of an elector who contravenes the Electoral Act. The penalty to be imposed on the alien for non-enrolment should be higher than on the British subject for non-enrolment, but, f ollowing the policy embodied in the penalty section of the Electoral Act, we should impose a smaller fine, and a fine only, for a first offence, and a higher fine for the second offence. Eor the first offence of an alien, which might be committed in ignorance, he could be fined £50 or sent to prison for three months. It may be said that the magistrate would not be likely to impose the maximum penalty, but we do not know what magistrates might do in periods of tense feeling. I suggest that the penalty for the first failure to enrol should be a maximum of £10, and that, for a second offence, the punishment should be heavier. Assistant Minister) [1.58 a.m.] -The Government would not be prepared to accept such an amendment. The question whether the maximum penalty should (Eden-Monaro bo imposed could be safely left to the Minister or to the courts.

On the 22nd March of this year, a-man named Warren, a resident of the Australian Capital Territory, was charged, at the Acton Police Oourt with negligent driving. The case was dismissed. When Warren was conversing with two other gentlemen, Messrs. Jones andCooper, outside the police court immediately after the case, Sergeant McCall, VV. V. Bailey, of the local police force, according McEwen, J. to a statement made in writing to the Price, J. l i . Attorney-General's Department by Scholfield, T. H . Cooper and supported by two written Spender, P. C. statements from Messrs. Warren and Stewart, Sir Frederick Jones, said to the three men, "" D o you Street, G.

K . to have replied, "" I was referring to the lies you told in the oourt."" The sergeant is then alleged to have addressed Cooper, Martens, G. W. "" I will get you, Cooper."" I am not in Kiordan, W. J. F. a position to pass judgment on these alleRosevear, J. S. gations, but the point which concerns Scully, W. J. this House is that when three reputable Spurr, L .

Further to my letter of 29th A p r i l , 1939, Watkins, D. 0. concerning your complaint against Sergeant Frost, C. W.

Sergeant Bailey denies the allegation that he threatened you and states that his remarks in relation to possible proceedings for perjury were « o t directed to you personally. After considering the matter carefully, J do not think it calls for any action by me It appears that the only inquiry which the Attorney-General made in regard to geant Bailey to make a statement in reply to the allegations which had heen made against him. According to the letter forwarded by the Attorney-General to Mr Cooper, Sergeant Bailey admits having made one of the statements attributed to him, although he explained that he did not direct it to Mr Cooper personally. The residents of the Australian Capital Territory, who do not enjoy representation in this House, are entitled to some protection.

Irrespective of the result of any inquiries that may be held, it is obvious that Sergeant Bailey was wrong in making remarks of that nature after the Court had decided the matter.

When the bells ceased ringing, we returned to our cups of tea. The bells commenced to ring again, but when 1 reached the door of the chamber I was toy late for the division. I am confident that the. time for locking the doors must have been taken from the commencement of the first ringing of the bells. If that was so it is. unfair; the time should have been taken from the commencement of the second ringing of the bells. I should like to know what really did take place? The incident referred to by the honourable member occurred in committee, and therefore I have no knowledge of it. I shall ask the Chairman of Committees to inform me on the subject. a.m.] -Wer e it not for the possibility of .the House adjourning to-morrow for the winter recess, I should not bring forward .at this hour the matter which I how raise. 1 Some. days ago I zies) a question relating to a decit sion by the newly-appointed Public Service Arbitrator, MrM . C. Boniwell. in.' ai case affecting the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union of Australia. His award has caused great dissatisfaction, and. has seriously perturbed members of the union. A person occupying so important a position as Public Service Arbitrator should be properly qualified for the task; he should have a knowledge of the industry, or the particular clerical sections of the Service concerned, and be capable of assessing not only evidence but the human values involved in making determinations. The recentlyappointed Public Service Arbitrator was formerly an officer of the Attorney-General's Department. His first determination reveals a lamentable lack of ability to weigh the evidence submitted on behalf of the postal workers. Not only has his determination caused dissatisfaction and alarm among the members of the union, bnt also many competent impartial observers, whoso opinions have been sought, have declared emphatically that the With decision is contrary to the weight of evidence submitted. It might be contended that Parliament is not the tribunal to deal with this matter. Indeed, the Prime Minister said last week that he did not believe that Parliament should be made a court of appeal in this instance. I remind him that Parliament has acted as a court of appeal on a number of occasions by disallowing through thc medium of regulations determinations with which the government of the day was not pleased. The Opposition stands for arbitration, but it believes that those who exercise the duties of an arbitrator should be competent to perform them. The arbitration system would break down if men in such positions were unable to act impartially, or to do justice to those over whom they exercise authoritv. It would appear that the new Public Service Arbitrator is so immersed in legalism as the result of his training that he is totally unsuited for the work which has been entrusted to him. In that respect he is entirely different from his predecessor, Mr Westhoven, who had considerable experience in the postal service before he was appointed Public ServiceArbitrator in 1930 If the new Arbitrator; continues as he has begun he can expect to hear many. complaints from the Opposition in this Parliament.

414,Asked The Prime Minister ( Mr Men,"to transfer him to.some other position if he persists in the attitude that he has adopted in this instance. The union submitted comprehensive evidence, both docu. . mentary and oral, to support the claim for an increase of £30 a year to all mail officers, but the Public Service Arbitrator granted an increase of £5 a year to employees who had reached the maximum rate of pay, and also to those who were in receipt of the sub-divisional rate next to the maximum. The number of mail officers who will, immediately upon the determination becoming effective, be entitled to the increase is approximately 50 per cent, of the men involved, the remaining 50 per cent, being on varying ranges of a much lower rate, so that many years will elapse before they reach the maximum. The way in which the award has been made excludes from the determination about 50 per cent, of the men engaged in these duties. The decision is amazing, and no one appears to understand it. . Now the union statesExperienced arbitration court authorities who are fully conversant with the documentary evidence tendered and the evidence of witnesses to the Public Service Arbitrator are firmly convinced that an increase of at least £11 to £13 was justified. Submissions made to the Arbitrator included(1) That since 10.15 uo increase iu rates of pay had been granted to mail officers, apart from adjustments due to the rise in the cost of living, other than an increase of Thirteen pounds (£13), in 1923.' (2) Increased complexity of work,the knowledge required and the responsibilties involved due to .many changes in procedure, growth in all mail services, thc introduction of extensive air-mail services, which are daily being further extended, while the output per employee was much greater. (3) Differential postage rates applying to air and overseas mails, increased number of mails for despatch, daily changing of routing of mails, 33 per cent, increase in private boxholders, changes being made in at least one-third annually, and the fixation of responsibility on an individual . officer for the con-ect sorting of every single postal article. (4) That extracts from reports of, the Public Service Board were indicative of savings effected from the introduction of mail-handling plant, closer supervision efficiency. Ur. lieaxlep. (5) The special selection of employees for admittance to the training school for mail officers, and the groundwork instilled in trainees prior to . appointment as mail officers, with the object of the attainment of efficiency was most marked. (0) Comparisons with the salaries paid to other classes of postal employees, namely, postal clerks, clerks, telegraphists, mail officer machinery, senior mail officer, Grade 1, and senior assistant mails. W it h the exception of the latter three, these classes in 1923 were in receipt ol a range of salary either equal to or less than mail officers, whereas their range to-day is much higher. (7) That mail officers being the men who perform the real work of a mail branch were entitled to share in the general tendency of increased rates of pay which within recent times has been extended to superintendents, assistant superintendents, supervisors and overseers of the various mail branches throughout the Commonwealth. (8) Offsetting reduced salaries that applied during years of financial stringency against times of financial prosperity. I have set out the grounds of complaint which have been obtained from the documents which the Prime Minister was good enough to have placed on the table of the library. I do not wish to delay the House by discussing this subject at great length, but I felt it my duty to direct the attention of the Government to the. attitude which this newlyappointed Public Service Arbitrator has adopted. If be continues to make decisions so extraordinary as this one he will certainly strike trouble. Men cannot be expected to submit to such determinations without complaint. They expect only a fair deal, and the sooner this gentleman realizes that the problems with which he has to deal must be studied not only on cold legalisms, but also on justice as well as humane considerations, the more efficiently will he he able to carry out the important work entrusted to him. jects raised by the honorahle member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) under the notice of the departments concerned. and increased Question resolved in the affirmative.",109,Bells Publi C Service This Very Serious Charge Was To Ask Ser

I desire to inform the honourable member that 33 conventions have been adopted by International Labour Conferences since that date. The total number of ratifications of these conventions which have been registered with the League of Nations Secretariat is 124, making an average of less than three ratifications in respect of each of the 52 countries which were members of the International Labour Organization between 1930-39. One of the most important of these conventions, viz., Convention No. 47, which approves the geneijal principle of the 40-hour week, has been ratified by one country only, viz., New Zealand. So far as Australia is concerned, many of the 33 conventions adopted since 1930 deal with matters affecting the States exclusively, e.g., Hours of Work (Coal Mines), Sheet-glass Works, Reduction of Hours of Work (Glass-bottle Works), Reduction of Hours of Work (Textiles), while the great majority affect both the Commonwealth and the States. On the 25th May, 1939, I made a comprehensive statement as to the present position so far as the Maritime Conventions adopted at the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Session of the International Labour Conference are concerned. With regard to the few conventions adopted since 1930 which concern the Commonwealth Government alone, I were predesire to inform the honourable member that the Commonwealth Government has ratified the Hours of Work and Manning (Sea) Convention (No. 57), that approval has been given for ratification of the Statistics of Wages and Hours of Work Convention (No. 63), and that the Recruiting of Indigenous Workers Convention (No. 50) is at present under consideration by the Territories Branch of the Prime Minister's Department. Consideration of the question of ratification of a number of conventions dealing with questions of insurance has been post; poned pending a decision as to the future scope of the Commonwealth national insurance scheme. 9th The question of facilitating examination of the possibility of ratifying conventions affecting the States was discussed at' the Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held at Adelaide in August, 1936. This conference adopted the report of a subcommittee containing, inter alia, the following statement:In connection with the ratification of a number of these conventions, considerable delay has occurred, and the sub-committee is of opinion that this has been, to a large extent, due to the fact that the consideration by the States of the subject-matter of the conventions is not the function of any one department or officer. The committee recommends that the States should be invited to arrange to charge with responsibility of dealing promptly with the International Labour Conventions some one department or officer. With regard to the conventions which have already been submitted to the States, the subcommittee recommends that the States should be invited to indicate at once their acquiescence, or otherwise, in any convention the subject-matter of which is substantially covered by State law, and, so far as concerns the other conventions, to advise the Commonwealth Government as early as possible, and in any event within six months, whether or not they are willing that the Commonwealth sl.jnld ratify. The Commonwealth Government has now received replies from five States intimating that, so far as they are concerned, there is no objection to ratification of a substantial number of International Labour Office conventions. As soon as a reply is received from the remaining State, immediate consideration will bs given to the question of ratification of these conventions.",110,Bells Publi C Service This Very Serious Charge Was To Ask Ser
