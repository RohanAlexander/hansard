4,Mr Higgs,"Hasof Tuesday? The latter journal states that, though the revenue has exceeded the estimate by over £6,000,000, the expenditure has exceeded it by £4,000,000; while the statement of the Age is that, although the revenue has exceeded the estimate by £6,500,000, the expenditure has increased by nearly £4,500,000. figures with amazement. Neither statement is correct. I have made no announcement about our revenue and expenditure except in the loosest way, because, until we can bring the London accounts to balance, it is impossible to say exactly what has been received and spent. Last week, I gave a rough approximation of what the revenue would he in excess of the estimate, but I have made no statement concerning our expenditure, and I do not know where the figures published in the newspapers were obtained. The statements are preposterously incorrect, and a protest should be made against these attempts to disseminate figures which have no foundation in fact. It will be found, I think, when the books are balanced, that on the expenditure side we have exceeded the estimate hy, perhaps, £1,000,000; hut I cannot say that definitely. Of that £1;000,000, the sum of £600,000 will have been spent in increasing war pensions. It is wrong of these journals to publish statements without attempting to cheek their accuracy in any way. of a motion of censure, and would have liked the Prime Minister to he present, though, of course, the Minister acting for him is at liberty to take.any action he may think fit in regard to the matter. To-morrow, I will move:That the Government ia deserving of censure for its general incapacity, and more particularly(o) for its failure to prevent an inordinate Tise in the cost of living; (6) for .its failure to keep its pledges with returned soldiers and their deof the particular branch of the Departpendants; (c) for its failure to take steps to deal with the causes of industrial unrest; in the matter. Although the work was (<i) for its failure to secure an adequate . return to the Australian people for 'their wool and other primary products sold overseas; (e) for its failure to make definite binding contracts for the Bale of such products which would have prevented any possibility of profiteering overseas in Australian products at the expense of Australian producers, and would have made it possible to secure a prompt adjustment of accounts in connection with such sales. nary circumstances, there would be but one course to take; but there is such a smack of Ballarat about the motion of which notice has been given that it cannot be treated seriously. Is there anything new or emergent about the high cost of living, for instance? to make a speech at this stage. will I make any statement at all regarding the matter at the present moment. Later: 1 Minister is here, and has-been informed of my notice of motion, I ask him if he intends to treat it as cavalierly as it was treated by his deputy..

It is Efforts are being made to obtain the outstanding replies, and the matter will he expedited as much as possible. 2. This matter is receiving the consideration of the Government. notice1.

The 1914-15 Star was designed, and the whole supply for issue to members of the Australian Imperial Force, was manufactured in Great Britain, the engraving only of the name of the recipient being carried out in Australia. I am not aware of any strong criticism from soldiers as to workmanship or quality of metal. 2.

In March last, the Acting Treasurer gave approval for this Department to invite tenders for material to be delivered during the present financial year, and a large portion of this sum has been utilized to obtain material and apparatus for Sydney, which, when received should improve the service to some extent. 3. It is a fact that a largo number of persons are unable to obtain telephone facilities, although application was made months ago, for the reasons given in answer to question No. 1, but it is not the practice of the Department to retain the deposits unless the applicants desire the Department to do so. 4. No effort is being spared to overtake arrears, but it is not possible to give any definite information as to when telephone connexions can be given, owing to the fact that the material which is necessary to give service has to be obtained from abroad, and the conditions existing overseas are such that no definite date of delivery can be given by the manufacturers, who are unwilling to bind themselves to specific dates.

Under the law, such fees must be paid to revenue, and the oflicial, who is entitled to such, has in the past been required to make claim. As a result of recent inquiry by the Inspector of Accounts, action is being taken to pay, in future, without formal application. Postmaster-General, upon notice1.

With reference to the promise made in Parliament concerning the question of payments to allowance officers, has any action been taken? 3. If so, w ill he inform the House with what result? able member's questions are as follow:1. The work of an allowance postmaster is reviewed annually, and payment for control is adjusted thereon. No reduction in payment is made unless the value of the work has decreased by an amount in excess of £3. The allowance postmaster is notified when any variation in the amount of payment is made. 2.

The inquiries which it is necessary to make are not yet complete, but they will be expedited as much as possible, so as to enable an early decision to be given. 2. It would be opposed to the spirit of public tendering to decline the lowest tender received if in other respects the tenderer is satisfactory.

Has this agreement been carried out in so far as it affeets citizens of the Soviet Republic now resident in the Commonwealth? 4. If not, why not? honourable member's questions are as follow:1. An agreement was entered into between 1 Messrs. O'Grady and Litvinoff, representing the British Government and the Soviet Government respectively, at Copenhagen, in February last, on this subject. 2. The Commonwealth Government is in communication with the British Government as to the precise intention of the parties and the meaning of the document. 3 and 4. See reply to No. 2. Minister, upon notice1. Whether the Government is prepared to a give any assistance to private persons desirous of prospecting for well oil, provided such persons can satisfy an expert that there is good grounds for expecting a payable quantity of crude oil? 2.

That this House is of opinion that the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act should be amended in order to provide for a destitute allowance to be made to all inhabitants who are destitute, so that any person making a statutory declaration (to a postmaster, Customs officer, or other appointed Commonwealth oflicial, a schoolmaster, a union secretary, a magistrate, or other appointed individual) that he or she is msufficientfy fed, clothed, or sheltered, shall be paid as soon as possible the sum of I5s. per week, and for each child 7s.

That the passing of the foregoing resolution be an instruction to the Government of the Commonwealth to bring in the necessary amending Act. my right to continue the debate on this motion. I have already said what I desire to say. [3.3] -The contention of the honorahle member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) that it is the duty of the people to provide an allowance for the destitute in the community is not new I admit that in common with other .suggestions for legislation of a beneficent character it is viewed by many people in a very peculiar way. would appear, is for many reasons bound to meet with opposition. It is regarded by only a few as a matter with which they are concerned, because only a small proportion of the population may he said to be really destitute. humanity is very selfish, and people are disposed to view a proposal to deal with conditions which are not brought immediately under their notice as something which should not be considered at all. vanced against the establishment of old age pensions, and practically every attempt to place beneficent legislation upon the statute-book has met with the same kind of opposition. Proposals of this kind are frequently ridiculed, and I know that some persons who may not go so far as to ridicule such a motion as that now before the House, because they would not desire to be considered heartless, have ridiculed the provision for old age pensions. That legislation was continually the subject of ridicule until it was properly understood. Honourable members are aware that it was the practice of many to refer facetiously to the ""baby bonus,"" and the maternity allowance, which is its proper name, is in some quarters still referred to by that and similar contemptuous appellations. We know that when the Eisher Government introduced their legislation for the payment of the maternity allowance meetings in opposition to it were held all over Victoria. This opposition was instigated by certain wealthy people in the community, and also, to their lasting disgrace, by many women in Australia, who were free from all fear of want at the time of their performance of the duty of maternity, and by others who used means to evade that duty. These people referred to the maternity allowance only in terms of ridicule. Those who favoured the proposal were asked why the general body of the community should pay a mother £5 to assist her in bringing her child into the world. There is not a man or woman in the country who does not know that every child born is an asset to the community. The aged, no matter how wealthy they may be, must be aware that they cannot continue to live on their wealth unless there are others growing up in the community to Sueh a proposal, it produce the commodities they require to sustain life. All the laughing and gib*ing at the maternity allowance should have been strongly condemned. We are told to-day that the payment of the allowance has not brought about what After all, was desired by those who supported it. We shall no doubt be told that the adoption of legislation to give effect to the motion now under consideration will not bring about what is desired by the mover of it.

The argument with respect to the increase in the birth-rate makes a strong appeal in the electorate I represent, and appeals forcibly to me, because in that electorate we have the highest birth-rate in any part of Australia. Every argument used as to the benefit of legislation of this character is met by some persons with contempt. subject of destitution, I have heard teetotal lecturers, for instance, assert with brazen effrontery that drink is the cause of 95 per cent, of the destitution in the world to-day. their infernal ignorance that they make such a statement. They can never have studied economics, or they would make no sueh assertion. As a matter of fact, under the present economic system, if the world were teetotal, destitution would be as rampant as it is to-day member .questions that statement. All I have to say is that if the workers of today did not spend money upon alcoholic liquors, they would receive so much less in wages. It is only because they require means to satisfy that desire that they have been enabled to secure'increases in their wages. wages into beer? able member asks me that question, I reply that they have as much right to drink beer or whisky as the honourable member has to drink water, so long as they do not endeavour pel him to drink beer or whisky. The honourable member is like a few more to whom legislation of this character seldom makes any appeal. We generally find that people who take this stand on the question of the consumption of alcohol are narrow-minded, and try to make out that it is the cause of destitution. There are in our midst to-day men and women who have never been guilty of excess in the consumption of alcohol and are yet in want and destitute. Every honourable member should know, whether we like it or not, that our present economic system produces destitution. We know that under it, for every person who becomes richer, some persons become poorer. I do not intend to give honourable members an address on the economic system, but every student of economics must be aware of the truth of my statements. I do not personally agree with many contentions advanced by some who belong to the Labour movement. I do not agree, for instance, with the contention that the On the worker pays all taxation. I know that if a worker gets £3 per week, and 30s. of that sum goes in taxation, the employer would take very good care that if all taxation upon his employee were removed, he It is because of would only get 30s. a week in wages. Under our existing economic system, no matter what wages a man gets, he cannot with surety make provision against destitution. We are asked why the workers are not thrifty, but "" t h r if t "" is a word that is bandied about without consideration of what it really means. If wo were to inquire into its real meaning, we might suggest that no man need waste 6d. in getting his hair cut. There is no reason why he should blacken his boots, or why he should wear decent clothes, l ie might live in a hovel, if he pleased. There is no reason why he should have carpets on his floor, curtains on his windows, or glass in his windows. The logical deduction from the arguments of those who commend thrift is that a man should spend nothing, and we know the effect which that would produce in the community. Many reasons except the true one are advanced for the destitution in our midst. It is a well-known fact that the wealthier countries are the greater is the destitution in them. There is just as much to comdestitution in the great, wealthy country of America, in proportion to population, as there is in any other country in the world, because all alike are working under a faulty economic system. WhilstI do not agree that this motion represents a panacea for all the evils of our economic system, I agree with those who think that if it were put in operation it would act as a deterrent upon those who are responsible for the creation of destitution. If those who make the wealth were compelled to pay for the destitution which they cause, they would take care that all people were given employment at fair and adequate wages.

That many do fall into poverty is indisputable, but if we inquire as to the cause, we may find that it is a weakness which, in its essence, is a disease.

Many people have never been able to realize that drunkenness if a disease, and not a crime. when I try to prevent drunkenness? ""Why ask me to pay for it? in the community keeps anybody else.

May the time never arrive when civilization is controlled by the men and women who preach teetotalism to-day; they are hard and narrow in all their views. If they but knew it, they are the real cause of destitution, because, if they were desirous of preventing drunkenness and other evils, they would join hands with us on this side. But they are generally to be found voting against us. If in an election a teetotal Labour candidate is opposing a Nationalist brewer, the heads of the teetotal organizaton vote for the brewer every time. I tell the honourable member that teetotalism is not the panacea for destitution. that some people have become destitute through drink, but they represent only a small percentage of the total number of destitute in the community. There are some who believe that the single tax is Admittedly, the panacea for all evil-that by concentrating all taxation upon the land we shall do away with destitution. That is nonsense. Others tell us that we have only to place a high enough duty on imports to make everybody' in the community prosperous. They say that there is always plenty where there are smoking chimneys. Do we not know that in all manufacturing countries there is destituDo honourable members think tion ? More misery and sickness are caused by fear of destitution than by anything else. The phantom of want preys on the nerves to such an extent that people are unable to continue at their employment for the modest pittance they are receiving. I believe that it is the duty of civilization to provide for every member of the community so that there shall be no destitution. Just a3 it is the duty of the State to make provision for the dependants of those who fell in the great war, and for those returned soldiers who have 'been maimed or ruined in health to such an extent as to be una'ble to earn a livelihood, so it is the duty of the Government to care for and keep from want those who have fallen or been injured in the great battle of life. There are people who look at. me with horror when I voice that doctrine. But I believe that men and women who have heen fighting in the industrial field, and, who, through lack of proper nourishment and inability to continue at their occupations, have fallen by the wayside, have just as great a claim upon the assistance of the State as have the soldiers and their dependants. Those who cannot see the justice of that argument are wilfully blind. We shall never even approach a proper state of civilization until we realize that every unit in the community has a right to food, clothing, and housing. Surely we are not asking too much when we urge that ib is the duty pf the Government to provide relief-no t in the form of charity, but as a right which a human being should be able to claim from civilization to-day. Honourable memhers may differ regarding the causes of destitution. Some may condemn destitution, but they are utterly wrong if they regard the cause as any other than the economic system I admit under which we are working to-day, whereby the more some people increase their wealth the less others possess.

I have already stated that, in my opinion, there should be some amendment of the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act. Some means must be found to raise sufficient money to enable us to pay our pensioners a decent allowance. This half-starvation rate is no good to them at all. What is going to become of them if they cannot get enough to live upon? One-half of the pensioners are tightening their belts to-day, because the 15s. per week is not sufficient, and we, who are sitting on cushioned seats in this chamber, should not allow this state of affairs to continue. We must face our responsibilities. It is idle to say that the pensions bill has grown to a large amount. Even if it has, on the other hand we have largely iucreased revenue. Some of the big ""money-bags"" who did not subscribe to war loans or do very much to help this country during the war period should be made to pay. Where would they be with their wealth, tlieir homes, their stations, their terraces of houses, but for the services of men who to-day are among our pensioners; men, grown grev in the service of tlie country, but who were not wise enough to amass any of the world's goods for their old age? Lack of cash appears to be the only objection to the proposal to increase the pension. That is not a sufficient answer. The present allowance is not any better than 7s. would have been when the Act was passed, and it is logical that we should go further and pay these people at least £ 1 per week. I say unhesitatingly that Australia can afford this amount. I am -satisfied that, if a vote of the people were taken to-morrow, there would be an overwhelming majority in favour of the increase, and I propose, so [107]2 far as I am able, to insist upon something being done. I was chairman of the Commission that inquired into this subject, and visited every State of the Commonwealth in order to get the fullest informaI doubt tion upon it . The Commission was composed of members of all sides of the House, and its first recommendation was that the pension should not be regarded as charity but as a right ; the right to live. If , now, we are not prepared to give our pensioners the means to live, then we are not acting I will decently by them. On the contrary, we are suggesting that it is a crime to be However, I poor. Unfortunately, the mills grind slowly. The allowance of 10s. continued for the purpose of t ill 1916, and the increase to 15s. only came into force this year. Twenty years ago the same objections were raised. We were told that we could not afford the money, and it took us t ill 1916 to make up our minds to increase the amount to 12s. 6d. This is not playing the game fairly . We can afford to pay a f u r ther increase. One crank of the Customs wheel, or a special tax upon the rich people of the communityand I do not think there would be very much objection on their partwill provide the necessary cash. I hope the Government will take notice of what I have said on this subject. I know that private members' resolutions do not count for very much in this House, b u t if the Government, of their own volition, are disinclined to do anything, then honourable members should insist upon something being done in the interests of our old-age and invalid pensioners. ister for the Navy and Acting Treasurer) [3.40] I was to have spoken at a previous sitting on this question, but it will be remembered that the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) took up the whole of the available time.

This is a matter which, as is well known, falls within my purview just now as a matter of administration.

The honourable member ' for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman)' has told us that there are sources of wealth that could be tapped, and has spoken of "" moneybags "" from which revenue could be derived. being tapped to-day. The Government have not had a "" bob "" towards the loans from a lot of rich people who ought to be made to pay. Sir JOSEPH COOK honourable member that there is not only the question of loans, but the question of taxation, and some of the "" moneybags"" are being taxed up to 8s. and 9s. in the £ 1 for Federal purposes alone, in addition to the taxation paid to the States. The ""money-bags"" are "" p a y ing u p "" and it is no use girding at them unnecessarily; nor must we let sentiment run away w it h us when dealing with these poor old pensioners. They are an obligation, and I am one who believes thoroughly in the old-age pension system. something to these people, though I do not pretend to agree with the statement made this afternoon that there are no obligations remaining with members of the pensioners' families. down that doctrine,, and I do not think that an unfortunate member of a family should be altogether a direct charge upon the State when there are other members of the same family who should discharge their famil y obligations if they are able t.o do so. However, this motion is really not an old-age pensions proposition, but one to create a destitute and benevolent department, which is to be associated with the Old-age Pensions office, and statutory authority for the establishment of which is to be incorporated with the Old-age Pensions Act. So fa r as I read it , it simply means that any old-age pensioner who cares to make a statutory declaration that he does not possess sufficient means to enable him to make ends meet, shall be at once granted an additional 15s. per week. It provides that "" any person "" making a statutory declaration shall be granted that additional amount. . It applies, therefore, to any inhabitant of Australia. to any old-age pensioner. than the Minister suggests. Sir JOSE PH COOK I know that. I am merely dealing w i th one aspect of it . It means that an' additional 15s. per week shall be granted to every old-age pensioner who cares to go before a schoolmaster, a postmaster, a Customs officer, a\ But the ""money-bags"" are union secretary, a magistrate, or "" other appointed individual,"" and make a statutory declaration that he is insufficiently -fed, clothed, or sheltered. Such a provision would double the cost of our old-age pension scheme at once. A t present, our I remind the old-age pensions amount to £5,300,00 0 per annum, and the effect of adopting this proposal would be to immediately increase them to £10,600,000 per annum. But , as the honourable member for Barrier( Mr. Considine) has very properly pointed out, this motion relates to all destitute persons in the community. Clearly, therefore, we should increase, that sum very considerably. Indeed, it is safe to say that if effect were given to this motion, our yearly b ill for old-age pensions and destitute persons would aggregate, £12,000,000 or £13,000,000. position very quickly. The pensioners would go to work then. Sir JOSE PH COOK -Would it cure the position? Would a pensioner be I do not lay likely to go to work if , instead of receiving only 15s. per week, he received 30s. per week I because of the economic situation. The Minister knows that.

142,Mr Mathews,"Although there areSir JOSEPH. COOK point out another striking fact in connection with these old-age pension increases. crease in the amount of the pension opens the way to a tremendous increase in the number of applicants for it . The pension becomes more attractive, and people who would not apply for it when it was only 10s. per week do not scruple to apply for it when it is 15s. per week. I have here some instructive figures in this con-, nexion. Our oflicer goes on to say that during the year following 1916, when the pension was increased from 10s. to 12s. 6d. per week, the number of pensioners in creased by 6,488, whilst in the year previous to 1916 the increase in the number was only 2,791. The figures for the half year ended 30th June, 1920-the Act had again been liberalized in the meantime!-ar e even more poinvincing when compared with the corresponding six months ended 30th June, 1919. Thei n crease in the number of applicants for the six months ended 30th June last was 1,579, whilst for the six months just closed it was 4,313-a n increase of 2,634 above the normal increase. applicants were, by reason of age, qualified to receive the pension. Sir JOSE PH COOK -The facts show that every increase in the amount of the pension attracts people who d i d not ask it previously. That is the point which these figures bring out. he qualified. pensioners apply for the pension immediately the terms are liberalized in this way. increase in the cost of living has compelled these extra persons to apply for the pension ? Sir JOSEP H COOK -Certainly not. is on a slippery wicket now. not; why should I be? Surely the in creased cost ofliving ought to have given us more pensioners when pensions were on the lower rate. But experience shows that the higher the pension the greater is the number of applicants for the number of pensioners, and the increase in the cost of living, been conSomehow or other every in current ? Sir JOSEPH COOK No t to the same extent. cost of living is 100 per cent. Sir JOSEPH COOK I would like the honourable member to understand that the increase in the number of new pensioners has amounted to about 150 per cent, in two years. SuTely the cost of livin g has not risen to that extent w it h in the same period. The simple fact is that the higher we make the pension rate the more applicants there are for the pension, because the more tempting it becomes. People who would not bother about it when it was 10s. or 12s. 6d. per week do bother about it when it is made 15s. per week. I am stating these facts in order that honourable members may ruminate upon them, and in the hope that if t'hev can offer a better explanation of them they may favour me w i th it on some f u t u r e occasion. I have here another set of figures relating to the number of old-age pensioners in the Commonwealth, which will prove interesting to the House. InA p r i l last there were 98.750 old-age pensioners in the Commonwealth, and 34,000 invalid pensioners. The old-age male pensioners number, approximately, 39,000, and the female pensioners 59,000. But the applicants must There are thus 20.000 more female old age pensioners than there are male. The invalid pensioners comprise 16,000 male, and 18,000 femalesa total of 34,000. These figures, of course, are not absolutely correct, but they are sufficiently close for ordinary purposes. The percentage of old-age pensioners to those who are eligible by age is just less than 34 per cent, for men, and just over 34 per cent, for women. The qualifying ages are, rebers of pensioners, according to population at 30th June, 1919, were as under:Old age-19 0 in each 10,000 of population.

Figures show that with every effort at liberalization, there is a great increase in the applicants. finding the money due to commitments as the outcome of the war? is one of the reasons. However, everything in the world is more or less relative; and with all the criticism of our old-age pension scheme, it is still the most liberal reached an age when their working time in the world. I should he glad to be able to concede this extra 5s. per week if , in the circumstances, it were possible to do so; but this year, with all our towering commitments, we are paying the old-age pensioners of the community an additional £1,500,000, and I am afraid that it is more than I can promise at the moment to consent to pay them another £1,500,000 next year. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) wilfully or inadvertently misunderstood an interjection I made during the course of his speech. I said that when it became a question of killing, any amount of money could be found. strate that in all countries, not only in Australia, any amount of money can be found when it is a question of warfare, but that the cry of insufficient funds is always raised when the matter is one affecting social welfare. I had not the slightest intention of reflecting on any honourable member who had sons or relatives at the Front. for the moment, the honourable memher knows the old democratic sentiment that the safety of the State is the highest law and the first necessity moment, I shall be quite prepared to dehate that matter with the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook). the honourable member do if a burglar attacked him? gaged in the task for which I was sent to this House, and that is to prevent burglary on my own class; as a sort of policeman, I. am trying to get a restoration of some of the property of the working man which has been taken from him by the exploiters of this country. WlhileI support the principle, because of the spirit behind it, that there ought to be no destitute men or women in Australia, that every individual should not only have the right to work-, but should also be obliged to work, except those who, owing to physical disabilities, are unable to do so, and that those who have "" done their b it "" in helping to build up the country and make it what it is, and have is over, should be provided for, not as a matter of charity but as a right, I disagree with the wording of the motion which makes the granting of the pension an act of charity. It is incumbent upon the person who applies for assistance to seek it as an act of charity, when it is his right to get it . In_the course of his exchanges with me, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro made some reference to the Bolsheviks. The very sentiments to which the honourable member gave expression to-day have been put into actual practice by those Bolsheviks he so much despises. I was endeavouring to demonBolsheviks killed? necessary. Official statements show that there were more people executed by the Allies in Murmansk and Archangel than were executed by the Bolsheviks in the whole of Russia.

The country has agreed pensions, and the continuance of the system is an admission of the need for providing a decent living for those eligible for the pension. It was.thought, when the pension system was introduced, that 10s. a week was the lowest sum that would be of any service, and if 10s. was the minimum then, £1 is not sufficient now, because, despite Mr Knibbs and statistics generally, it is absurd to say that the cost of living has increased only 50 or 65 per cent.

This is one passageHave you any idea when the War Precautions Act is to be entirely abolished? This damnable instrument hangs like the executioner's blade Chanter) Order!

That gives a true reflex of the state of fear and suspicion in the minds of many of these people, and for that TeasonI do not intend to bring under the notice of the House many of the cases which I could quote. It will be noticed that mv motion ia divided into three parts. The two first ask for a Select Committee to inquire into the internment camps and the treatment of the internees. That is not the most important reason why a Select Committee should be appointed, and if I could obtain the last portion of the motion-I should be even willing to forego",40,Smith Are All Persons There Is A Need For Investigation And Care

Stilli t seems to me that some good may come from an inquiry into those things, if only because I have heard, and others may also have heard, of certain things which are said to have happened in the internment camps. I , as an Australian, would like an inquiry, so that if the statements are not true we may he clean and clear in the eyes of all, and, if they are true, the people of Australia may know what militarism means, and may not be deluded, as some of them seem to be to-day, into the belief that militarism in Australia must necessarily be different from militarism anywhere else in the world. have not seen a man shot in Australia, anyhow. sure of what he is saying? the honorable member's interjection, and when the time comes will answer it. If the honorahle member will make inquiries privately I think he will find that he may not be correct. In any case there may have been circumstances where even that extreme course was justified. I believe the expenditure on the internment camps was between £1,250,000 and £1,500,000. were treated better than the soldiers were. may be right, but I have heard otherwise, and that is another reason why I should like a Select Committee that will have the confidence of the people to go into the matter.

He, therefore, cannot say that it will not have the confidence of the people. It would be a good -thing if the whole question could be cleared up.

I do not wish that reflection to be cast on every member who has been in the ranks.

Honourable members may "" sling "" all the mud they like at rae, but I am here battling for these people because I am convinced, from my inside knowledge of different things I have had the chance of reading about, from diaries that have been kept, and from meeting these men, who were once honoured, but who are not honoured to-day on account of the stigma which has heen placed on them, that many of them have not received a fair deal.

In the interests of these people, and at the wish of some of them, I am not prepared to give the details now. As the honorable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) asks me, "" What is to prevent the Government, if they want to, from deporting any of these men?"" Nothing whatever. It surprises me that the members of this Parliament have allowed the present position to go ou so long. The war has -been at an end for a long time. Germany, Austria, B u l ' garia, and Hungary have a] signed the 1 Peace treaties, yet our War Precautions Act is still in force, and unless something is done to terminate it , it is bound to operate for the f u l l length of this year, if not longer. down here helpless in f r o n t of that Act . I have heard one or two members of the Country party, and some of the members on this side, complain about it , but the Act is still in operation, and if a man has been once caught under it he is afraid of the same weapon falling upon him again. Darwin( Mr Bell) may be asking me for particulars from the best of motives, but I am going to tell my story in my own way. Those who were interned, so far as I have been able to go into their cases, may be divided into four classes. honourable member speaks of still in terned ? Select Committee, not to get them out of an internment camp, but to give those who remain here a chance to clear themselves of the stigma of disloyalty that is upon them to-day. terfered with in any way by the authorities? first class would include the recent arrivals in Australia. Amongst those who came here when the war started there would be a good many runaway sailors. So far as I have been able to gain inforW e want to hear them. mation, it seems to me that much of the trouble was created by runaway sailors and others who had only recently come to this country. I have no complaint to make about the internment of those men, nor could I have. The Government was justified in taking those who had recently come here, and whose sympathies were bound to be with their native country, and putting them where they would not do any harm. I have no complaint to make about that particular class, provided that they were treated humanely in the camps. The second class comprises unnaturalized persons who have been in Australia for a long period. Some honourable members may say it was their own f a u l t that they were not naturalized. Some of these cases have come before me, and I find the position to be as follows: The Soutli Australian law in regard to naturalization did not necessarily confer naturalization on the child with the naturalization of the parent. I am informed that in some of the other States the opWe sit posite was the case, and that, consequently, when a person who came fro m Germany with his family became naturalized there, his naturalization automatically passed to all his children who were under twenty-one years of age. Many of the people in Australia to-day who have been here since childhood are not naturalThe honourable member for ized simply because they thought that their naturalization was necessarily consequent on the naturalization of their parents. Others have told me that they paid men to get them naturalized. They solittl e understood the procedure that they did not trouble, even when no certificate of naturalization was given to them, and they find now that they were simply fooled. Honourable members may be inclined to take this with a grain of salt, b ut I assure them that there have been on the rolls numbers of electors who were not naturalized, although they thought they were. It was only when it was pointed out to them, after the war started, that they were not naturalized, that they had to go off the rolls. This class is distinctly unfortunate. I recognise that the Government were acting within their legal rights in their No t that I know of. The case, but it seems to me that since these people had been residents of the Commonwealth for many years, and had proved themselves good citizens, the Government, in interning them, were pressing for the uttermost.",42,Internme Nt Camps

The fact that, although they had been resident in the Commonwealth for many years, they remained unnaturalized told against them in the opinion of many people, and it is for tliat reason that I have explained why they failed to take out naturalization papers. They believed that they were covered by the naturalization of their parents. I understand that under a Commonwealth Act which came into operation only a few months ago, the naturalization of al foreigner will apply to all his children under the age of twenty-one years. ber knows that these people were in terned because they were believed to be disloyal. able member and the majority of the Houset h in k ; but I can quote a statement made by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) that many of these people were interned on suspicion. tralian Judge has said that the fact that a man has been interned is no evidence of his disaffection or disloyalty. Many persons were interned on suspicion, and the trouble is that they come out of the internment camp bearing the same brand as those who might have been absolutely disloyal. The third class to which I desire to refer are naturalized Australians who were interned. There were 267 cases of that kind. A naturalization paper carries with it the rights of a British subject, and one of the rights of a British subject, ""War Precautions Act or no such Act, is that he shall not be condemned or imprisoned without a fair t r i a l . These 267 men had taken out naturalization papers, but under the War Precautions Act those ""scraps of paper"" were, so to speak, torn up by the present M in Minister recently stated in this House istry. I can well understand that there might have been suspicion in regard to some of these men, but since they had been naturalized, .and had thus been given the rights of British subjects, -the Government should have carried out their part of the bargain, and have given them a trial. The last class I propose to mention are those of Australian b i r th who have been interned, and it is for these that I am specially in the fight. I am bringing forward these unpopular matters popular matter in the honourable member's electorate. honourable member's mind, and to induce him to be a little more charitable, let me tell him that a leading Labour worker in my division some three weeks ago said to me, "" Gabb, old man, you have done enough to show the German people""-h e should have said "" A u s tralians "" "" that you are trying to be their friend, and are endeavouring to carry out your pledges. Your attitude on this question is being used against you in your electorate for all it is worth. You have proved yourself to be bhe friend of these people; take my advice and do not have much more to say on the subject."" More than half of my electorate are of British origin, and I know that my opponents are stating all ever my electorate that I am a pro-German. If I had regard only to my own interests I should accept my friend's A South Ausadvice. He is a stalwart Labour worker who travels over a good part of my electorate, and I have had his friendship for many years. I have already fought an unpopular fight in this connection, and if I had regard only to my own interests, I would now allow the matter to drop. I believe, however, that these people have been wronged. They are as truly Australian as I anj. There are forty-three of them who were born on Australian soil, and I am satisfied that those honourable members who are now jeering at me w ill , within the next three years, view this matter in its proper light, and recognise that our fellow Australians should be fairly, treated. has not shown that these men have been unfairly treated. that the question of the injustice done to Australian-born citizens was no longer a live matter. There is in my electorate a man of German origin who, like the Prime Minister, had two boys at the Front. One of them paid the supreme sacrifice, and lies buried in France. This man, who is about the same age as the Prime Minister, was put behind the barbed-wire of the internment camp.",43,Internme Nt Camps

I cannot believe that a child reared in a disloyal home would enlist. In the light of these facts, it is absurd to say that this is no longer a live question. In another case a poor man of German origin, with a wife and eight little children, returned from work one day to find a constable waiting for him at his gate. He was arrested, taken from place to place, and ultimately interned. His wife was allowed 30s. per week for the upkeep of the family. While he was in camp he learned that she was ill , and naturally desired to go to her, hut was not allowed to do so. How would any honourable member like to be treated in that way, especially when he did not know why he was interned? Would this not be a live question to him? In yet another case a wealthy manand I admit that, in this matter, the Government did not discriminate between the rich and the poor-wh o was interned, has determined, as soon as the War Precautions Act ceases to operate, to take his case into the Law Courts. He knows that an Act is to be passed indemnifying the Government and its officers for any wrongful act that may have been committed by them; but he is determined to take his case to the Court, in order to clear himself. He told me that, although he had struggled hard for what he had, he had resolved to clear himself of the stigma resting upon him hy an appeal to the Courts, even if he had to spend every penny he possessed to do so. How can it be said that this is not a live question to a man who feels so warmly? No honourable member has experienced what it is to be disowned by his own country. were justly disowned by our own country we should be much perturbed, but if we I know some absolutely were unjustly disowned and dishonouredif the sense of injustice rankled in our breasts-woul d it not be a very live matter to us ? This is an intensely live question to those who, in some cases, have been dishonoured on mere suspicion, and ib is only reasonable that we should appoint a Select Committee to .determine their guilt or innocence. If any of these people, born on Australian soil, enjoying all the advantages of this country, sharing its freedom, and participating in its blessings, are proved to' have been disloyal, then the Government may treat them as it pleases.

If the Prime Minister means that, I hope that the Government will not oppose, but will facilitate, the giving of an opportunity to do justice to these people. If they will afford such .an opportunity, that will be a proof that the Prime Minister meant what he said. he says. opinions about that.

I wish to be as fair to him as possible, and, though I may not use his own words, I quote similes which he made use of to show that he considered that it might he necessary sometimes to have people interned on suspicion. The first simile he used was in regard to loyalty to a political party. He said, in effect, that it is very hard to prove disloyalty on the part of an honourable member to his party or his leader; that one might feel sure that a certain man was disloyal, but at the same time it might be very hard to prove it. Whilst there may be some truth say that there is no member of his political party who would be expelled by the Prime Minister or by any leader merely becauso he 6uspected him of disloyalty to the party. I quote the simile used by the Prime Minister as an admission that some of these people, even if there were only two, were interned on suspicion. We know that loyalty to a political party and loyalty to the country in which one is born are not to be compared, and even if only two of these < As a reference has people who were born in this country were interned on suspicion, I say that they should he given an opportunity to appear before a body in whom they would have confidence, and be given a chance to clear themselves of the stigma cast upon them. Another simile made use of by the Prime Minister was that of a person suspected to be suffering from small-pox or leprosy. The right honourable gentleman said, in effect, "" If a man comes off a boat, a doctOT may say to him, ' I do not know whether you have small-pox or not. 'but I cannot take any risks, and must put you into quarantine on suspicion.'"" I intend to refer to the case of a man suspected of suffering from quite another disease.

It is not a sufficient answer; but, unfortunately, it is so regarded by some people in Australia who do not know that certain persons were put into the internment camps on mere suspicion. In regard to the evidence at the inquiry to which I have referred, I quoted the remarks of the Judge on one of the military men who gave evidence. While giving him credit for his war duties, as the man had done good service, the magistrate saidEither his memory was at fault, or he was prepared to make out his case without regard to the truth. the honourable That is a serious statement, and judging by the information which has reached me, the same thing has happened in other cases. The time to speak of that is not yet, but if what I have been told in that regard is true, there will not be many people who in future will condemn me for trying to obtain justice for Australian-born subjects. The only inquiry that has been held has related to the cases of two men, both of whom have been cleared of any suspicion. The acquittals to date having been 100 per cent, of the cases tried, surely that is a reason why the House should appoint a Select Committee so that others may have an equal opportunity to clear themselves. Six of the men who are interned in South Australia were justices of the peace. As a rule, men are not appointed to the commission of the peace unless they have proved to be good citizens, although, at times, political influence does enter into these appointments. To me it is remarkable that men who held such a high status in the community should be interned on on the accusation of, I know not whom, and that their own assertions should go for nought. Some of them were arrested in the middle of the night, and immediately swept into the internment camp. The Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie), in answer to an That was the verdict of Mr interjection, said that he differentiated between Germans and Australian-horn citizens of German origin. I think we ought to do that, and I ask honourable members, particularly those who fought against the Germans, and who know more of their conduct than I do, to distinguish bet-ween the two classes of people,",47,Internme Nt Camps

272,Mr Gabb,"If we could get.the peopleand vote for the appointment of a Select Committee, so that justice may be done to those who, like themselves, were horn on Australian soil. second the motion. I am sorry that this motion has been moved. Hadi t been proposed by anybody but the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb), I should have said that it had been brought forward for the purpose capital out of the cases of interned Germans. I do not make that accusation against the honourable member for Angas, because I give him credit for being as sincere as is any other honourable member in . this House. But the motion is exceedingly useless. The inquiry which is asked for could do no possible good; at the best it could be only expensive and wasteful, whilst it might be positively mischievous. It relates to a matter that is past and done with. I do not think that even the internees, whose cases have been advocated, would thank the honourable member for proposing an inquiry into the reasons for which they were interned. Much of the difference between the honourable member and myself is due to the fact that he is very much more of an optimist than I am. He said that he never felt, at any time during the war, that Australia or the British Empire was in any danger. That view is held by very few honourable members. Perhaps, because the honourable member believed that the British peoples were in no danger, he takes, a different view of the need for internment. To my mind, both Australia and the British Empire were for many years in very grave peril indeed, and while that danger continued internment was a perfectly justifiable precaution. I do not say that it is very pleasant to be internedI was a prisoner of war for six months-bu t I am sure that the internees in Australia enjoyed very much better conditions than did Australian soldiers who were in the hands of the enemy. When I was made a prisoner of war, I had been slightly wounded in the hip; my experience commenced with a thirty-days' march without any halt. Only twice during that time was my wound dressed at all. Then for nearly three months it received no ""attention, because tlusre was no doctor in the camp. A t night the wound adhered to the mattress beI am not complaining about the treatment; it was all in the game of war, and my hardships were light, compared with those suffered by others. But I think it is ridiculous to endeavour to arouse sympathy for the men who were interned in Australian camps. They, at any rate, knew when and where they of making political would get their next meal; they were reasonably certain that next day they would be sitting at the mess table as usual. That is more than was known by the soldiers serving at the Front. Internment was a necessary precaution during war time, but I admit that it should not in -itself be regarded as absolute proof of disloyalty. I have already fought that battle, and I would take strong exception to the Government saying that internment in itself is definite proof of a man's disloyalty and sufficient reason for his deportation. In regard to that matter we ought to act carefully. One case in which I have taken a good deal of interest has brought upon me a good deal of blame; in fact, I am not sure that I have not incurred thereby, even myself, a suspicion of disloyalty. But when I went to the Prime Minister and asked that before deportation the man's case should be reviewed he was perfectly fair. The case was reviewed in the manner we requested, and one must abide by the result. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) and I both represent electorates which include a large number of persons who were either horn in . Germany and came to Australia as children or young men, or are the descendants of such. I have previously made plain my position in regard to them, and that attitude I shall never alter. But the honorahle member for Angas has admitted that the feelings which were aroused during the war are cooling down, and I ask him whether it is not better, instead of stirring up and perpetuating bitter feelings which will lead to that most abominable thing in a British community-racia l bitternesswhich, wherever it asserts itself, weakens the Empire, that we should realize that",48,Internme Nt Camps

[5.32] A few months ago, when this inatter was raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), I availed myself of the opportunity to express my sentiments. motion should have been referred to by tbe mover as unpopular. I do not admit that it is. If it be unpopular to give justice where justice is due it is a bad state of affairs for the country. Any unpopularity that surrounds this endeavour on the part of the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) can be due only to misrepresentation of the subject. The mere wording of the resolution is sufficient to disarm all suspicion and ill was originally before the House, the feeling. have interjected regarding the war services of honorahle members on this side who are supporting the request for this inquiry. were made in a jocular spirit. ' It is quite irrelevant whether those who support the motion served at the Front or not. As for the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, I do not think he touched the matter at all. He said it was past and done with, and that it should be allowed to rest. from his point of view. attitude of the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Wienholt) in regard to this subject, from the beginnirrg, may be such that he does not want it resurrected. I will say no more with respect to that; but this matter is not done with. In the interests of justice, it is not going to be allowed to rest. In the interests of fair play to these people, who are living in Australia under a cloud, having a stigma upon them, it is not going to be dropped. I ask the honourable member for Moreton how this subject can be regarded as past and done with in the eyes of those who have been treated, not as Australian-born citizens, but as lepers, or worse? This motion asks, among other things, that any native-born or naturalized subject who, by statutory declaration, affirms that he has reasonable grounds for believing his internment to have been the result of untruthful information, maliciously furnished, shall have the circumstances investigated. that now. It has never heen refused to one who has taken that stand. statement is absolutely unfounded. been a case in regard to which such a request has been made that has not been inquired into.

I have received I believe that those remarks letters concerning men who were interned, who are prepared to make statutory declarations in. regard to their innocence, and who claim an inquiry.

It is that of an Australian-born citizen of the second generation who was a district That is all very well councillor. While occupying that posiPerhaps the tion, he promulgated the most comprehensive scheme for the repatriation of soldiers that has yet come under my notice. During the war, he went on the public platform and advocated enlistment. He and his family have subscribed to the war loans in generous fashion. However, there are always some people who bear enmity against their neighbours. The Prime Minister has stated that among the internees were some who found themselves there because of information supplied hy the secret service. In the district to which I am referring, the secret service was represented by men who bore personal enmity against this Australian-born councillor. His accusers were animated by motives of personal spleen. They made false statements, and their victim was interned as a result. That is his firm belief to-day.

296,Mr Parkermoloney,"It is allnow quote the case of another man who was interned, and therefore was interested in the deputation to the Prime Minister. This man had a son at the Front. He volunteered this information, or it was supplied on his hehalf at the time of his arrest, but owing, no doubt to the underhand methods employed, and because of personal animus of members of the secret service, amongst whom the man lived, it was some considerable time before he could get this simple statement of fact through to the Defence Department. He now has in his possession a letter from the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), to show that when it became known to the Defence authorities that he had a son at the Front, he was released, and admitting that if it had been known at the time he would not have been interned. stance I have heard of the Defence Department listening to reason. tunately, it took a long time for that simple statement to reach the authorities; whereas, if everything had been above board ' it should have been known next day. his own fault at the beginning that it was not known. orable member is wrong, because the statement was made at the time of his arrest. The honorahle .member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) might he quite right in affirming that some people deserved to be interned, but I am not dealing with that aspect of the matter at all. I say that if for good reasons 1,000 were interned, surely there could be no objection to an effort being made to secure justice for a tenth of that number if they believed they had been interned wrongly. Quite a number of these people declare that 'they know of no reason for their internment, and, naturally, they feel the stigma that at"" taches to them. They are suffering in business and public life because of it, and they believe that if they had an opportunity of submitting their oases before a. proner tribunal they would be able to prove their innocence. I regret to think that even one member of this House would say that such men are not entitled to a chance to answer such a charge. I do not want to labour the question, and so I will conclude by saying that I believe many of them are suffering an injustice, and that they were interned because of false reports furnished to the authorities by other residents animated by personal bias. I have ample evidence to prove this statement right up to the hilt, and it is 'the duty of this House, and particularly of every honourable member who saw active service at the Front, in what he regarded as 'the fight for liberty and fair play, to see that fellow citizens-becaus e many of these interned men are Australian-born citizens-ge t that British fair play for which they fought. few words will suffice to put my view of the question. The honorahle member who submitted the motion made an appeal for justice on behalf of Australian-horn citizens who were interned during the war period, and he made a special appeal, as did the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, to those who have served overseas. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) made some veiled accusations of ill-treatment of internees, but when I asked him, by way of interjection, to cite a case, he said he would defer doing so to a later date, giving as his reason his belief that some of these people were afraid to come forward and tell what they knew. that my cases are pretty genuine. dence of ill-treatment of Australian-born citizens of German parentage, or even of German birth, during the war period, no appeal to honourable members for the appointment of a Select Committee would be made in vain. plenty of evidence. alleged ill-treatment, but presented no evidence of it, so the whole matter simply resolves itself into a complaint that some people were interned on suspicion, and that, therefore, a Select Committee should be appointed to inquire into their loyalty or disloyalty.

305,Mr Bell,"The mover of the motionthat. There was ample opportunity during the war for every man to show where he stood. The question now is-Wer e the Government of the day justified in interning Australian-born citizens of German parentage on suspicion? have always been inclined to be trustful rather than suspicious; but during the recent war there was plenty of evidence to prove that the Government were perfectly justified in interning any one upon reasonable grounds for suspicion. your statement now. caution to take. member can distinguish between "" reasonable "" ground for suspicion and mere suspicion. people believe that the Government, when interning these people, had reasonable ground for suspicion. those men came to you and said he believed he had been wrongfully interned, would you give him a chance to prove his case? now. Wlhile the mover of the motion was speaking, I made an interjection that I would not have minded had I been charged with disloyalty. There was no possible chance of that. Likewise, many young men of German parentage had no fear of the charge during the war; but I know that many people of German parentage, whose sons were at the Front, were openly disloyal, and avowed that they would never recognise their sons again. In the face of all this, it is a peculiar argument that the presence of a son at the Front should have heen regarded as the test of a man's loyalty. as the argument that a certain gentleman in Victoria, with a D.S.O. decoration, should now be charged with disloyalty. have the D.S.O. and still be distinctly disloyal. the Front was no proof of your loyalty. the Front to prove my loyalty. Some people would need to go to the Front many times, and still they would be under suspicion. It is, as I have said, difficult now for men who were interned to prove their loyalty, so there is very good reason to believe that the motion has been introduced for the purpose of getting another little stab at the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Therefore, the House would not be justified in supporting it, especially as the honourable member who submitted it intimated that, at somo future date, he is going to bring forward another motion, and cite cases of gross are qualifying ill-treatment. tion is not carried. fer the appointment of a Select Committee until such time as we get some definite charges.

I do so because, in my opinion, the camps were very often used in order to get rid of people who were undesirable in the eyes of the powers that be. There has possibly been quite enough said about internees of German origin-of both the first and second generation-and I rise in order to say a word on behalf of an Australian born of Scottish parents, who, in spite of his nationality, was put into an internment peculiar camp. I refer to J. M . Scott, a gentleman who wrote a book entitled The Circulating Sovereign. He was born, as I say, of Scottish parents in New South Wales, and was detained in an internment camp for a period which may have ranged up to one year and eight months; and to this day he does not know why.

This man was resident, I understand, in a little town in South Australia, where he was grabbed by the military police, whirled away in a motor car, and put into a concentration camp, and none of his friends knew where he was. If this were the only case of the kind during the whole period of the war -the only case of a man being spirited away-it is sufficient to justify an exhaustive inquiry. Otherwise, which of us is safe, in view of the policy followed by the Nationalist and capitalistic Governments throughout the world, to whom the war was due? It is possible that we may have another war shortly, and we must look to the future, so as to know where wa stand. Honourable members may not be acquainted.with this particular case, but I had the facts from the man concerned; and, under all the circumstances, no Government dare refuse an inquiry. This man, Scott, is an intensely loyal man; but in the work I have mentioned he advocated a principle inimical to the interests of the banking and other great financial institutions of the country. He is gifted with a brain for finance excelled, perhaps, by very few meni in Australia, and he put forth' a system of financial administration by which the Commonwealth could have met the cost of warlike operations without taxing the people to the extent of l d . that was the reason he was interned? and I shall continue to believe it to be the fact until a Select Committee proves the contrary. not prove the statement, it is my opinion he was put there in order to be silenced, as he was, for a period of something like one year and eight months. When the war was over, and the conditions altered, he was given his freedom, being considered no longer dangerous. Moreton( Mr Wienholt) says that enemy subjects, and other suspected persons, were treated much better in the camps in Australia than others in similar positions were treated in the camps in other countries. That is quite possible. camps. though intensely loyal, was sent into camp While there, in the course of argument with some German internees, one of the latter asked him if he believed, all he read in the newspapers about the German atrocities. He replied in the affirmative, and then the Germans said to him, ""There is one thing that the Germans have not done; they have never interned a German subject along with enemy subjects."" That, Scott informed me, squashed him -h e was beaten. This man, at any rate, is a British subject, and if he made disloyal statements, he was entitled to a trial; but, failing a trial, an inquiry such as that now proposed would satisfy me. A large number of people in the country no doubt believe that this man had done something to justify this detention; but I say that he was deliberately put into camp in order to silence him, because the principles he was j > h in g were reac right up against the principles of financial and banking institutions in all the nations of the world during the war. These institutions have their grip on the economic arrangements and conditions in all countries, and are possessed of great power; hut I repeat that this man was out on an intensely patriotic mission, -trying to prove that financial arrangements could be made to meet the cost of the war without taxation-that we could, as the British have done in the past, conduct the war without adding a penny to the national debt, and thus save the £25,000,000 or £30,000,000 of taxation I do suggest Lhat. necessary to meet our interest bill. I am not satisfied that Mr Scott's is the only case of the kind, and I only know Further, though I canof his case because I happened to be acquainted with him, and, brushing up against him, was given the facts. For all I know, there may be hundreds of similar cases. It is, to say the least, disquieting to think that, when passions are roused, as they were during the war, some interests have to be safeguarded, The honourable member for even if it means sacrificing the liberty of British subjects; and if any honorahle member says that this case is not one for inquiry, he is ignorant of the elementary laws of justice. supporting the motion I wish to say that very few of the details are within my own knowledge.

One statement in particular was that it was only on representations made by the Swiss Consul or the American Consul, before America entered the war, that alterations were made in the treatment of prisoners in the internment camps. I know no more than do other honourable members who have spoken of what were the conditions which prevailed in the camps; but it is within our knowledge that in the press of Australia, especially the Sydney press, statements were made concerninathe use of machjneguns at Holdsworthy Camp. In reference to that matter no report has ever been asked for in this Parliament. I have in my possession a statement signed by, I think, a captain in the German Navy who was interned at Holdsworthy. We know that according to international arrangements officers of certain rank, when prisoners of war, are not to be asked to do certain kinds of menial work; but because this man refused to obey some orders he was ill-fcreated. I do not know whether his statement is true; but, according to him, he was blindfolded and taken by a firing party near to a grave which had been dug. He was told that he was to be shot, and placed with his back against the tree.

The Government were quick enough to use the powers conferred upon them, by the War Precautions Act to suppress Stead's War Facts. They acted in the same way in regard to other publications.

Yet no honourable member will affirm that the safety of Australia, would be in any way Then the bandage was taken endangered by the importation of the ""good old book"" printed in German. The action of the Minister, however, would lead us to believe that if elderly people are allowed to sing Lutheran hymns, or to offer prayers in German, the foundations of the Empire will be sapped. All this only goes to show the spirit of intolerance which possesses the Government. the fights for religious freedom, andwho put Luther upon a -pedestal as a pioneer in that connection, are to-day preventing Luther's countrymen from reading his The idea is absurd and preposterous.

While I was in Sydney some time ago the wife of the gentleman whose case has been mentioned by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) called upon me concerning the internment of her husband. She assured me that the whole of their family were intensely loyal, and at no period had there been the r slightest suspicion cast upon their loyalty.

The question which has t a be decided is, "" Are the Government prepared to have this matter inquired into with a view to righting any wrong which may have been done?"" The Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) cannot shirk the responsibility of the Government by saying, "" Please, sir, we did not do these things j they were done by somebody else."" Ministers are now in a position to right the wrong which has been done to certain individuals.

It is very important from the point of view of the safety of a ship that shipwrights and ship's carpenters shall be men of experience, under proposed sub-section 7 a man will be entitled to be rated as a shipwright or ship's carpenter if he has served only five minutes in such a capacity before this Division of the Act comes into operation.

But by proposed sub-section 7 any person rated as a greaser, fireman, shipwright, or ship's carpenter, before the coming into operation of this Division of the Act is to be entitled to be so rated. I realize the necessity for the provision in its relation to greasers and firementhey must make a start sometime-bu t the"" position of a shipwright or ship's carpenter is too important to entitle those who may have been engaged in the occupation for a limited period only to be rated as shipwright or ship's carpenters when the A ct begins to operate. for Trade and Customs) [ 8 . 5 ] gone very carefully into the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) last night, and find that the objection raised b}' shipwrights to the inclusion of ships' carpenters arose originally out of the dispute between two unions, both of which have members going to sea, and that the amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition would prevent a large number of seafaring men who have followed their occupation all their lives, and are now serving on the coast of Australia, from continuing to follow the same calling. The amendment to section 39 of the principal Act, as set out in this clause, is really consequential on an amendment to schedule 2 of the Act, which was authorized by the Leader of the Opposition when he was in charge of the Navigati'-n B ill introduced by the Pisher Government and was effected in the Senate. There was quite a long fight on the question of whether ships' carpenters should be included or not. Eventually they but were included. If the amendment of section 39 of the principal Act is not made as set out in this clause, these carpenters will be prevented from following their occupation. My advisers have gone into the matter carefully. .Captain Davis, who has had a life-long is to be rated as a greaser, experience, tells me that the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, if agreed to, would prevent ships' carpenters who have been engaged in their occupation for the whole of their working lives from following their calling in future . [8.9] -If there should be any delay in the proclamation of this measure when it is passed, any person who becomes a ship's carpenter in the meantime will be entitled to be rated as a ship's carpenter, although he may not f u l f i l the requirements of the proposed sub-section 5, which demands that before he may receive his certificate he must have served for three years at sea in the capacity of ship's carpenter In other words, the B ill provides a certain qualification, and at once proceeds to take it away. In the following clause we give power tto a superintendent, before whom a seaman is engaged, to refuse to enter him as A . B . , O.S., greaser, fireman, shipwright, or ship's carpenter unless he can give satisfactory proof of his title to be I have so rated. The giving of such f u l l powers to a superintendent is a further entrenchment on the rights of seamen.

The seamen, have their rights. ing to protect them. to the seamen to allow a person with five minutes' experience in the calling before the proclamation of the Act to be rated as a ship's carpenter. job as a ship's carpenter unless he could show that he had the necessary experience.

Shipwrights and ships' carpenters should be supplied with a certificate of competency to show that they are capable of performing the work, and surely the Government will not object to that. Shipwrights and ships' carpenters are experts, because there are no others on board capable of performing the work they are called upon to do. It must be remembered also that seamen are supplied with a certincate of competency. trust the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) will agree to the in sertion important amendment, as shipwrights and ships' carpenters are very i m portant members of a vessel's crew, particularly in the event of an accident..

It is therefore not of much use to object to them. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 16 and 17 agreed to. Clause 18 (Wages payable for handling cargo or ballast). heartily in accord with this clause, because it gives to seamen engaged on a ship the right to the same rate of wages as is paid to shore labour for this class of work In times past, when trouble has occurred ashore, ship-owners have compelled the seamen to work ashore at a lower rate of wage than the shore workers were obtaining under an Arbitration Court award. This clause will, I believe, save trouble. In times of trouble, owners sometimes get so-called loyalists and others who are not f u l ly qualified to do the work, but, if they have to pay those men the same rate as skilled workmen, they will not have very much to do with the loyalists. I am not sure that the penalty of £ 1 0 0 is high enough. if there is an Act safeguarding them, the seamen will take good care to get the money. Proposed new sub-section I B provides that, if a sufficiency of shore actually served in the capacity labour cannot be obtained at such rates If an cwner thinks fit, of wages, it shall, for the purposes of this provision, be deemed to be not available, and in that case the crew may be employed to the extent of the insufficiency.

Eveni f the wreck occurs on the other side of the world, the wages of the seaman will cease within a month. Complaints have been made that, even in the case of some of the Commonwealth line of ships, men were landed owing to illness at other-ports, and their wages ceased after a certain time. The shipowner should be compelled to bring the man hack to his port if he so desires. If the wreck takes place on the American coast, the man may prefer to go to some port in England, as that may be the nearest way home for him, but we should not cut his pay short at one month after the wreck. I should like to hear from the Minister why the time has been curtailed. It should be remembered that a seaman may lose everything he possesses if the ship is wrecked. We should make the period three months, or, if the man is brought hack to his home port before three months have ©lapsed, we might provide that the pay should cease on his arrival. for Trade and Customs) [8.59] -This is a new provision and a new departure. It very often happened that the wreck took place near the port where the service terminated.

In this clause, -we are doing two things: we are throwing on the ship-owner the liability to take the man either to the port to which he was shipped under his original agreement, OT to bring him back home, or to some other port mutually agreed upon. We are bhrowing that obligation on the shipowner. ""We are also throwing on him the obligation to pay the seamen's wages for one month. Asf a r as we have been able to ascertain, there is no similar provision in any other navigation law. from the Merchant Seamen's A ct 1894? The marginal note suggests that it is. . which provides for the payment of a month's wages is nob. My information is fchab an examination of the navigation with laws' of the world shows that, as f a r as word ' three."" 1 can be ascertained, the general practice, with one exception, is for a seaman's wages to terminate at the time of the wreck. The exception is in the case of the German Seamen's Law of. 1902, which provides thab where a ship is wrecked or lost bhe seamen shall he entitled to reconveyance to the port of departure or to receive proportionate compensation, and, in. addition, to a continuance of their wages at one-half the original rate for the time occupied in their re-conveyance. Generally speaking, the provision for the payment of a f u l l month's wages w ill , I think, cover almost every case. A t the same time, it w ill prevent men straying away from .means of reconveyance home, and w ill not throw on the ship-owners a greater obligation than is necessary in the circumstances. It is a liberal provision. As ib is a new departure, I suggesb that the Committee agree to it , so that we may see how itworks. that the period should be extended from one to three months. Where a shipwreckod sailor could be returned to the port of engagement within a month, the clause; as ib stands, would work very well; hub I would remind the Committee that some time ago one of bhe Commonwealth line of steamers, while on a voyage from South or No r th America, was -wrecked on an island in the South PaciThe ship-owner was in that fic, where bhe men remained for some considerable bime. Under bhe clause as it stands, in buch a case, bhe seamen would not only have to endure the privations attaching to life in an outlandish place, but would receive only one month's wages from the date of shipwreck, even if six months elapsed before they were returned bo their home porb, or to the port of departure. The shipping companies would not be penalized-by bhe extension of bhir provision from one to three months. If a shipwrecked crew were conveyed home wibhin a month, there would be an end to the matter; on the other hand, if three months elapsed before they were returned, then, since they were engaged on the work of the company at bhe time of the disaster and were disadvantaged wages in respect of thab period.

His desire is that seamen who are wrecked shall be paid their wages until they are returned to the port of engagement, the port of discharge, or such other port as may be mutually agreed upon. clause ' provides that the owners of the .shipwrecked vessel shall convey the seamen to one of these ports, and pay them their wages for a period of one month while they are proceeding to their home port. In laying down that principle, we should endeavour to make it effective. Why not put the matter beyond doubt in the way proposed by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) ? A sailor might be shipwrecked at a point from which he could not he returned to the port of engagement or discharge, within less than three months. such circumstances to be left without sustenance for two out of the three months ' of the section to be amended, which deals with men who are engaged for the round run, cover that point? proviso to this clause governs the whole matter. Under it, even if it took the owners of a shipwrecked vessel six mouths or eight months to return the crew to one of the ports mentioned, they would not have to pay the men more than one month's wages. I amconfident that the Committee desires to do the fair thing by these men, and the mercantile marine ask for nothing more. By agreeing to this amendment, the Minister will not give away anything. It provides foT the payment of wages for a period not exceeding three months, so that if that period were exceeded in returning a shipwrecked crew to their home port they would not receive, more than three months' pay -The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr the ship-owners. If it takes six weeks to Marks) has an intimate knowledge of seafaring matters, and is able to speak of the privations and hardships to which British seamen are subjected. disaster overtakes a ship, the lives of the passengers depend upon the skill, bravery, and coolness of the seamen, and surely it is not asking too much to demand that this meed of justice shall be done [9.12] -It is evident that this clause has been inserted in the Bill because the Minister recognises that it is unfair that shipwrecked seamen shall receive no wages from the time of the wreck until their return' home. It is unreasonable to expect them and their families to live un The air. ing this provision in the Bill was to remedy an injustice. At the same time, we are trying to safeguard the position. The amendment would probably do an injustice to the other side. John Murray, when she was wrecked, were stranded for many a month. Why should shipwrecked sailors and their families be expected to live without pay? There are parts of the coast of Western Australia Is a sailor in from which it would not be possible to return a shipwrecked crew to their home port within two months. The industry should be called upon to carry the charges necessary to keep a shipwrecked sailor until he is returned to his home port. ' Having recognised the I think not. Tho principle that shipwrecked seamen should be provided for, why should we stop at the payment of one month's wages ? Mi-. CONSIDINE (Barrier) [9.14] I support the amendment. The Minister( Mr Greene) stated that, in introducing this provision, he was actuated by a desire to prevent injustice to the seamen, and later on he said that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) might do an injustice to the ship-owners. Surely the honourable gentleman must recognise that an injustice would be done to shipwrecked seamen if they were allowed only one month's wages in cases where they could not be returned to their home port within that period. The amendment would do no injustice to return the seaman to his home port, then, although the Minister claims to be seeking justice for the seaman, the latter will When be penalized, and the shipping company will be saved expense to the extent of a fortnight's wages for the man.

I think it is quite unnecessary. Eveni f the Committee agreed to the amendment, injustice might be done to seamen under this proviso. A seaman engaged for a certain voyage might be shipwrecked at some remote place, and forced to take refuge upon an island. He might have to remain for a considerable time before a passing vessel could be used to carry him to his port of discharge, or the port at which he was engaged. such circumstances, why should the period for which the owner of the ship is held to be liable to pay wages to the seamen be confined to a month, or, for that matter, to three months, or any other period? In my opinion, the ship-owner should be called upon to provide against this risk just as he is called upon to proBill. vide against expenditure under the Employers' Liability Act. I think there should be no limitation as to the period, in these circumstances, for which the ship-owner should be liable to pay the seamen's wages. It should be held that a seaman engages until such time as he reaches his port of discharge, or is returned to his home port; and in the case of shipwreck, his wages should be continued until he has reached one or other of those ports. ber should see that without some such provision a seaman marooned on an island in the way he has suggested would get nothing during the period between the wreck, of the vessel and his return to his home port, or to his port of discharge. there should be no limitation of the period provided for, and it would be better, in my view, to omit the proviso altogether than to deliberately do an injustice to seamen in the circumstances. A seaman may be five or six months away from his home because of some accident to his ship over which neither he nor his skipper may have had any control. Is the seaman and his family to suffer in consequence?

Part of it , I am sure, is new. I decided to introduce this particular provision first of all throwing upon the ship-owners the obligation to land the seaman at the port to which, under his agreement, he was going, or at such other port as might be mutually agreed upon between him and the master of the vessel, or to return him to his home port. In the next place, I decided that the ship-owners should be called upon, in such circumstances as are set out in the clause, to pay the seamen full wages for a period not exceeding on6 month. The reason why that period was decided' upon is that it is conceivable that a shipwrecked seaman might be landed at a port within a week's sail from Australia, and a vessel by which he could return to Australia might call at that port next day. The representatives of the ship-owners might tell the seaman that he could go back to Australia by that boat, and his passage would be paid. The man might say that that did not suit him, and if he knew that he would receive full wages for three months he might wait for three months before he found a vessel that would suit him.",63,Pairs

In view of the length of the average voyage of vessels between Australia and other parts of the world, it seemed to me that to throw upon the ship-owners the obligation to pay the seamen f u l l wages for a month was, in the circumstances, a fair compromise. I do not say tliat in every case under this provision the seaman would secure all that he was entitled to, but in some cases he might secure more, and I consider that a fair compromiss is proposed by the proviso as it stands. w i th the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) that it would be better if no limitation were proposed of the period for which the ship-owner should be responsible for the seamen's wages; but if a proposal to leave out the proviso were defeated it would probably be held by the Chairman that it would then be too late to carry such an amendment as that proposed by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb). I suggest to the honourable member for Hunter that he might move the omission of the first part of the proviso, and if that amendment were defeated it would still be possible to make the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Angas. I do not mind the Ministerf or Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) saying that I was responsible for piloting the original measure through this House.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. In proposing an amendment to leave out the proviso, I want to say, in reply to the statement made by the Minister, that in the present Navigation Act, there is no provision made for the payment of seamen in these circumstances, but I find that in subsection 2 of section 85 of the Acti t is provided thatWhere a seaman whose service terminates by reason of the wreck or loss of a ship has been engaged by tlie run he shall be entitled to the wages to which he would have been entitled on the termination of tlie run, subject to just deductions. That shows that under the Act as it at present stands a seaman is entitled under his agreement, notwithstanding what may happen to the ship, to f u l l pay until he reaches the place at which he is to be discharged . men engaged for the r u n . There is no I agree such provision applying to men employed under agreement. The provision with respect to men engaged by the ru n still stands. if a seaman engaged by the r u n is shipwrecked and held up for a considerable time, it may be for a couple of months, he is entitled to f u l l pay under the section I have quoted; but if a seaman is working under an agreement, and is shipwrecked, it is proposed, under the clause now under consideration, that he shall not be entitled to more than one month's wages, though he may have been six months earning them. The seaman who is under agreement and is shipwrecked may be detained in some foreign place for two or three months, but he will receive only one month's pay. Even the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Angas would allow him only a maximum of three months' pay. That is an injustice to seamen, who are just as much entitled to protection as is any man working ashore.

If the seamen refused the conveyance offered by the ship-owners, they would do so at the risk of their wages.

Does this meam that in the event of an accident happening on a boat coming from Singapore to Australia, whose first port of call is, say, Broome, the master of the vessel will be compelled to go to Fremantle for the purpose of the inquiry?

It may happen that this first port is one, say, on the north-we3t coast of Australia, where there is no superintendent, and where, consequently, -it would be impossible to hold an inquiry. The clause simply provides that in such case the inquiry shall be held' on the arrival of the ship at the principal port. If the first port of call is Broome, and the next one Fremantle, then the Deputy Director may order that the inquiry be held at the latter place. The clause by another amendment also transfers from the superintendent, who is a minor official, to the Deputy Director, who is the responsible officer, the duty of giving effect to this provision. Clause agreed to. Clauses 51 to 55 agreed to. Clause 56 (Uncertificated steam-ships not to proceed to sea). part of the Navigation A ct has not yet been proclaimed, and, therefore, there has been no difficulty in regard to uncertificated steam-ships up to the present, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. Under the State law of Victoria, however, there has been difficulty, and I have in mind one case of a vessel which, I understand, cleared out for China. This vessel had not been condemned, but had been refused a clearance on account of unseaworthiness; and, thereupon, she was allegedly sold to a person said to be a resident of Chili, and she left this port flying ihe Chilian flag. This enabled the owner to defy the port authorities. How-far will this clause protect us in> a case of the kind ? We are all anxious that no unseaworthy ship should put to sea; and I should like to know what power we will have in regard to the master or owner who takes such a vessel to sea, and who may not return. right.

I believe that at holiday times the Tasmanian boats, which undoubtedly have to face an exceedingly rough trip , during which accidents are quite possiblethough there have not been any very serious accidents up to now-hav e 'been allowed to carry extra passengers; but I hope that such exemptions will not be permitted in the future. simply bring our Act into line with the articles of the Convention. Clause agreed to. Clauses 62 and 63 agreed to. Clause 64 (Watertight partitions, fireproof bulkheads, and double bottoms). T h is though this clause is in accord with the requirements of the Convention, there is necessity in the construction of new vessels, as proved by the Titanic disaster, for, not only cross bulkheads, but longitudinal bulkheads. The Titanic struck an iceberg, and had one side ripped out; but had there been, as there should have been in a vessel of her size, say, three or more longitudinal bulkheads, she would have been saved. The rake-out by the iceberg was practically on the outer skin, and every bulkhead filled one after the other. Anybody who has had experience of shipping realizes the necessity of fitting ships with bulkheads, which will prevent water flowing from one bulkhead to another. the regulations to deal with that matter. statement of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor). built here will be thus equipped. In Australia we are thinking of providing for the bulk handling of wheat, and longitudinal bulkheads are imperatively necessary for the sea-carriage of that commodity, which otherwise will shift just as readily as will water.
