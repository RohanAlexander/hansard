James (Jim) Alexander Debate resumed from 21 June, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the paper. ber here, Mr Duncan Kerr, as we set out a tribute to a great Australian political figure and a great Australian Labor leader, an unexpected Labor leader for Tasmania. He was an accidental Tasmanian, as he used to joke. At the time he became a Tasmanian he was in fact a Western Australian official of the builders labourers union in Western Australia, where I knew him slightly. He went to Tasmania, he liked to joke, to represent the union at the funeral of the then state secretary. He found himself trapped by Norm Gallagher to take over the organisation of the union in Tasmania and then stayed there forever. He said that within a few weeks he realised that it was not a trap but he had found himself in heaven. He loved that state and the people in the state. He could not get enough of them either in the political sense or enjoying their social company, whether it be at the football or any other social location in which he found himself. Our deepest sympathies go to Honey and to his children. Honey stood by his side throughout his premiership and through the terrible illness which has taken him away. She was such a wonderful helpmate and first lady of that great state of Tasmania. Jim’s affection for Tasmania was reflected in his affection for the character of Tasmanian society. Tasmania in many ways has the attributes of old Australia: respect for one another, respect for the labour movement, respect for egalitarian principles, respect for what governments can do for societies and communities and respect for the opinions of others. These are manifestations, for those of us who have been privileged to campaign around the country as I have, missing from many other parts of the nation but very much prevalent in Tasmania. A quiet style of reflection suited the personality of Jim Bacon. Jim was a very radical man indeed. I notice that in some of the obituaries his sister, a journalist, said that he never lost the radicalism of his university days which saw him in a Maoist faction-not an unusual position for many people to be in, might I say, during the course of the 1970s. The Premier of Western Australia was a Trotskyite at the time, so a conversation between the two of them, had they had one, would have been something truly illuminating. He was a radical personality. That radicalism was reflected in not walking back from ideological positions he had adopted; it was just irrelevant. His was a radicalism of the heart as much as the head, and he was perfectly prepared to see it manifest as much in the decent way in which he treated his fellow men and women in Tasmania, looked after their welfare and sought a good direction for their lives as in any theoretical debate about the socialisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange. He was perfectly happy to have no roads to Damascus away from his youthful convictions. He was simply always on the same road, whether it was in the union movement or as a politician. He was always on the same road to social justice as he saw it in a state where such attitudes were very necessary.

208,Mr Beazley (Brand) (4.36 P.m.),"I am pleased to acknowledge one Tasmanian memThe Tasmania he inherited was a Tasmania that worried all Australians. It was a Tasmania of declining population, a Tasmania of declining opportunity, a Tasmania without young people, a Tasmania with declining values in real estate. It was a lovely place-the best possible place to take a holiday and a marvellous place to tour but a place with no real opportunities to stay. This worried him terribly. It worried him as a person who was an organiser of the Labor movement, because jobs were at stake there. It worried him as a civic father when he entered into political life, because he was responsible for the circumstances in which he found himself, whether he created them or not. So as premier he set about turning Tasmania around. Tasmania is a very different state now. You can see it in the values of real estate down there-and, while I am not altogether sure that all Tasmanians are cheerful about that particular development, some are an awful lot wealthier as a result of it. You can also see it in the development in Tasmania of the knowledge economy-that notion that you can, with contemporary technologies, develop anywhere you choose to develop. You do not necessarily have to be adjacent to sources of raw material, large amounts of skilled labour or large supply markets as with older industries. They have proved the point in Tasmania that the new economy is one which exactly suits the character of the society that is extant there. Jim Bacon teased all that out and made it obvious to all Tasmanians. He showed that there was an opportunity here for the state to get back on its feet, largely by lifting itself by its own bootstraps-and, while the people there were always pretty proud to be Tasmanians, this made all Tasmanians really proud and, more importantly, determined to stay Tasmanians. That is the legacy he left his state. For us in the Labor movement-and I want to conclude on this-we all have our personal memories of Jim Bacon. As I said, I knew him vaguely when he was a young man in Western Australia. I knew him very well when I was leader of the federal Labor Party for roughly the same period of time, give or take the odd year, that he was Premier of Tasmania. He was an enormously helpful man, who was enormously willing to put himself out to assist us in the federal Labor Party and proud of the fact that he presided over a state Labor Party which returned a shut-out as far as federal members from that state were concerned. He had a strong belief that the state deserved to benefit for that from the election of any federal Labor government, and he was willing to come up with good ideas and share them with us. He was not jealous of them, keeping them to himself for a state election campaign, but he gave them to us to run through in a federal election. He was surprised from time to time by the character of federal politics. I remember once campaigning down there during the course of the federal election. In an election, the federal Leader of the Opposition carries, as does the Prime Minister, an enormous press entourage with a very high level of demand for news from him instantly. Jim came to do a joint press conference with me. We had done a few before, but they were basically with two or three journalists who would turn up from the local radio or television stations or newspaper in Tasmania. This was a huge, all-court press of 40 or 50 people desperately trying to get to us their questions-hypercritical questions, attack questions, and questions to find the worse possible conclusion from anything you might have to say. Jim said to me, ‘Kim, are you in crisis?’ I said: ‘No, Jim, this is what it’s like all the time. This is not a crisis gathering down here. This is actually very relaxed and we’re going to get some good footage out of today, courtesy of you. There’s no crisis on here.’ But I thought to MAIN COMMITTEE myself: if it were a crisis, you could not have a better bloke alongside you to keep you calm and give you advice. We will miss him terribly. Many of us anticipated that we would have a chance this winter to go to Tasmania to see Jim before he went. That was not to be. We miss him terribly, and we will miss him terribly. We have the deepest sympathy for Honey and the boys and enormous pride in the way in which Honey has conducted herself since the illness of her beloved husband. She will have many friends for the rest of her life. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (4.46 p.m.)-I take this opportunity to put on the public record my sincere sympathy to Honey Bacon, to Jim’s sons, to his sisters-to Wendy in particular, whom I have known personally for many a decade-and to Jim’s mother on the passing of her beloved son on 20 June. His stunning political career was tragically cut short by inoperable lung cancer, which he battled, as we knew he would, with all the courage and determination that marked Jim out as a very special person. Jim Bacon was a fine human being. I was privileged to have known him and to have worked closely with him in our respective trade union roles prior to Jim moving into the political arena. I think Jim Bacon was pretty typical of many people of my generation. The member for Brand alluded to that. His first involvement in political activity, like mine, was in opposition to the Vietnam War, which became a very radicalising experience for him and led him for a period to be very active in the Maoist movement, for want of a better word. Jim did very well at school. He was obviously very gifted academically, because he won a bursary and a scholarship to study at university. Only recently I read that his father, a doctor, died when Jim was a young man. Interestingly enough, it turns out that his father, Dr Bacon, was in fact the family doctor of the Lennon family in Melbourne. So his dad departed at a very young age and his mum was left to raise five children. So Jim would have known at first hand the struggles of ordinary people to make sure that their offspring had the advantage that education would bring. No doubt Jim did very well at university. I did not know him then, but I am not surprised that, instead of going on to work with the kinds of experiences that a tertiary education would give you, he went to be employed with the Builders Labourers Federation, working in his early years as an organiser in Melbourne and then going to Western Australia to work at Karratha. In 1980 he moved to Tasmania as secretary of his much-loved union. The BLF was a tough union in a very tough industry. It is through the efforts of people like Jim and his colleagues that unskilled construction workers were able to achieve significant improvements in their working and living conditions and their wages and were able to feel that the value of their productive labour was appreciated by all. My path crossed Jim’s more frequently after his election to the position of Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council in 1989. That in itself, for those of you who know Labor history in Tasmania, was a remarkable and incredible achievement as it was a union movement not noted for its militancy or radicalism. Jim himself was the representative of a numerically small union on the left of the political spectrum, one which had been through a very turbulent period. During that turbulence, one did not necessarily agree with all the positions that the BLF adopted, but I know that Jim was forever loyal to his friends and comrades and to those who had given him his start in the labour movement. MAIN COMMITTEE I think Jim was able to achieve the position of secretary of the labour council, despite the smallness of his union and despite the fact that he was very much positioned on the left of the political spectrum, thanks to his innate qualities as a person, his ability, his experience and, above all else, his humility. Coming from a very macho industry and union, Jim Bacon was really the antithesis of the stereotype that is all too often drawn about the BLF and its membership. I found Jim to be a kind, considerate and, in the member for Brand’s words, calm and gentle person, fiercely loyal especially to his colleagues and friends. He had all those lovely personal attributes-not as any sign of weakness but as the antithesis to the stereotypes that had been drawn about the BLF. In no way did these personal qualities detract from his very strong and passionate commitment to issues that formed the core of his passion for the labour movement and issues that were important in creating a better Australia and, for him, a better Tasmania. Those passions included looking after the interests of those less fortunate in our society and making sure that working people had the benefits of protection that unionism provided. He was especially concerned about the rights of Indigenous Australians and later was most concerned about the divisions occurring in his own society on issues such as gay rights. He made a very significant contribution to the work of the ACTU executive, on which he represented the state of Tasmania. I remember travelling at that time to Tasmania and Jim taking me to his first home overlooking the beautiful river. As you know, he came from outside the state of Tasmania, but in a short period of time he became part and parcel of Tasmania. I think his election to the position of premier and the achievements that we saw under his leadership have made Tasmania a much better place. A lot of credit goes to the efforts that Jim and his team made in that state. The Hobart Mercury in its editorial stated: Tasmania has lost a great enthusiast for this state, a peerless salesman for this small island, a consummate politician and a passionate advocate for equality of opportunity. Jim Bacon was the right man at the right time for this state, a relentless, fearless champion for Tasmania and Tasmanians. While there might be opponents who could argue about his policies, no-one could argue that in his heart he put his state and its people first. I think the people of Tasmania grew to love Jim too, despite the nasty politics that were played out by his political opponents when he first ran for election. There were those who wanted to try to denigrate his potential to lead the state by virtue of his earlier associations and work with the Builders Labourers Federation. But, undeterred, Jim struggled through that difficult period and, when the people of Tasmania got to know him in a real way-not as the caricature of him that was portrayed by his political opponents-I was not surprised that Jim went on to lead Labor to another substantial victory in 2002. He has been rightly credited, along with his team-I know how closely he worked with David Crean, the then Treasurer-with making sure that the economic fortunes of Tasmania were turned around. I think he gave Tasmanians a sense of belief in themselves, hope for the future and not just a place where one would visit but a place where one would want to stay. His time in public life was all too short, but he certainly left his mark. He has left huge shoes to fill, but he has also left incredible memories for all who, like me, were privileged to have known him. I particularly hope that in this very difficult period for Honey and Jim’s family-this time of immense grief-they will all find solace in the high regard and affection MAIN COMMITTEE in which Jim was held by all who worked with him and knew him and the huge response that his death has received from the length and breadth and across the wide diversity of the citizens of Tasmania. Opposition made eloquent remarks regarding the place that Jim Bacon will have in Australia’s political history, and it is most appropriate that today the former leader of the Labor Party, the member for Brand, whose period of service as leader of the Labor Party at a federal level largely coincided with Jim’s period as premier of the state, has spoken, as has a former colleague of Jim’s who was a national president of the Council of Trade Unions, because Jim’s history was as a participant in the political process since his university days, as a leader of the trade union movement and as a leader of his state. There was always a certain touch of grandeur about Jim. There was something potentially mesmeric in the way he was able to communicate his passions and beliefs to a large audience. On numerous occasions I had the opportunity of being with him when he was speaking to groups, large or small, and he could have been engaged in all kinds of business beforehandsometimes he was no saint, and he could have been involved in sharp disputes-but he could walk out in front of an audience and communicate to them something of himself and something of the importance of the issues about which he was speaking. As an individual passes, each of us sees them through different prisms. I have had a long association with Tasmanian Labor. For 16 years, I have been an elected member representing the seat of Denison-a seat with the same boundaries as the state seat that Jim Bacon later contested, held and served as premier. Under the Hare-Clark system of Tasmania, the federal and state seats coincide, and a number of state members are elected for each of those divisions. So our association goes back a long way. It was an association that was marked by turbulence. There were periods where our relationship was one of immense affection and friendship, and there were other periods of sharp disagreement on particular issues, but I know that he had that nobility. Even at the times when those disagreements were at their sharpest, you could recognise, in the stature that he had and the dignity that he presented, that he was doing something important for his state. Everyone does reminisce in these things, and I go back too to the days of Monash University. My association with Jim Bacon at that time was peripheral. It has been mentioned that he was a radical member of the Maoist grouping at Monash University. I was a student at the University of Tasmania and, after my first year at law school, I took the occasion to do what was then more easily done by students: take a year off to travel and work around Australia and New Zealand. After leaving Tasmania with mere hope and $50 in my pocket-that was for a year; it seems outrageous to me now but, nonetheless, that was my opportunity to see the world, as it were-I turned up in Melbourne, where I knew nobody. I thought I might get a friendly reception at the universities, and I went out to Monash University, where I secured a job on Lot’s Wife, which was edited by a man called David Dunston. I was the layout artist. I had never been a layout artist, and have never been a layout artist since, and I do not profess any great profundity at the art, but those were the old days of Letraset and sticking copy on the paper. David Dunston was very closely associated with Michael Hyde. They were both members of the Maoist grouping, of which Albert Langer and Jim Bacon were two of the most prominent advocates and probably the ideological drivers. I shared a house for some MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Condolences
209,Mr Kerr (Denison) (4.56 P.m.),"In the House the Prime Minister and the Leader of themonths with David Dunston at Frankston in Victoria. My period of association with that newspaper ended when David was sacked by a general meeting of the student association at Monash University over some issue that was obviously immensely important at the time, of political significance, but which I cannot recall at all. Nonetheless, I remembered the mass meeting and the outrage and hysteria of the various political groupings that were then in place. It was a period of great excitement in Australia. It was a period leading up to the election of the Whitlam government. It was a period when Australia’s participation in the war in Vietnam was being contested and there were moratoriums. In all that, Jim Bacon played a very significant role. I next came to know Jim Bacon as the Secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation in Tasmania. In that role, Jim played a very significant part in lifting the status and employment conditions of unskilled workers, and he also played a larger role within the Tasmanian labour movement. Ultimately, as a result of that, he became Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council. That was, I suppose, a first, because I think he was the first person associated with the Left who had held that position. It was a very substantial transformation in that environment. This was at a time, again, of significant political debate in Tasmania. As Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council, Jim participated very vigorously in many of those debatessometimes to do the discomfort of the state Labor government of the day. But that is what trade unions do. That is the role they play. They cannot be simply a clone of the political party that they caused to exist. Certainly Jim grew in stature as he served as Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council. Through the period of the Gray government and then the Rundle government, Jim emerged as a very significant social critic, somebody who spoke out in key areas of social policy as well as on industrial policy. That enhanced his stature and his ability to present himself to the community as a person who understood Tasmanian issues. Jim Bacon was elected to the Tasmanian parliament at a time when Labor was becoming competitive again, after a long period of internal disintegration and unhappiness. I might on this occasion say that there was a very dignified transfer of power between Jim and the former Premier and then long-term Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, Michael Field. I should record that that transfer reflects extraordinarily well on the generosity of spirit particularly of Michael Field, who had carried the cause of Labor in the parliamentary sphere for a very long time and under very difficult conditions and who probably, in all fairness, could have expected to serve again as a Labor Premier. But, in recognition of the fact that he had been politically damaged by events which were unfair and in which he could not have done other than he did, Michael Field saw that there was an opportunity and that it was time for change. He passed the baton to Jim Bacon at a time when Jim was able to present himself to the community as a leader without the baggage of the past. That was a platform, built largely on the decade of work by Michael Field, that enabled a new Tasmanian Labor government to be formed, and to be formed as a majority government. The Bacon government transformed the fortunes of Tasmania. There are a couple of key issues that were addressed, and the first was the sale of the Hydro. It is perhaps difficult to understand here the importance of that issue to Tasmanians, but the former Rundle government had proposed the partial sale of the assets of the Hydro and was moving in a direction towards full privatisation. It argued that the state’s debt problems required that radical solution. There is some plausibility in that argument, but Jim Bacon came up with another plan. I do not wish MAIN COMMITTEE to displace his key role in all this, but he had substantial assistance from David Crean, the brother of the recent Leader of the Opposition. David Crean provided economic credibility to the arguments that Jim was putting forward. If not for Jim’s and David’s powerful counter case that the Hydro could be maintained as a central part of the core infrastructure of the state, that it was not necessary to privatise it, that we could in fact turn around Tasmania’s fortunes without it, Tasmania’s political future would have been very different. They made that case very effectively and very well. Previous speakers have referred to the extraordinarily vicious campaign that was mounted against Jim Bacon and Paul Lennon, now the Premier of Tasmania, who contested the election before Jim became Premier. The attacks were particularly directed at Jim. Paid advertisements by the Liberal Party depicting him in particular as a union thug go down as one of the low points in Australia’s political history. where someone’s participation in the industrial side of Labor is seen as a negative in terms of their electability. We are entitled to be judged on what we can offer in the parliamentary process, not degraded if part of that public service has been as a servant of the industrial wing of Labor. I got to know Jim very well. At the time, I was the only Tasmanian shadow minister for some period of time. We worked very cooperatively. We met on a private basis about once a month to discuss relations between the state and Commonwealth political interests. We reflected on our individual personal circumstances from time to time and I got to know him and Honey well. We occasionally had to manage differences of opinion. That is inherent in these kinds of relationships and roles, and it would be foolish to pretend that those difficulties and differences did not exist. Nonetheless, I thought overall the relationship was extraordinarily successful. MightI say the presence today of my two colleagues the member for Braddon and the member for Lyons is testament to the strength of Labor in Tasmania, a strength that has been contributed to by the capacity of federal and state Labor to work through sometimes strong disagreements in a way which has not ultimately damaged the cause of Labor in the state. In those processes I can recall reflections and one of the things that Jim said to me which, sadly, cannot happen. He said to me, ‘I’m not one of these people who when I go out of public life will be looking for another career, like Paul Keating or Bob Hawke.’ He said: ‘I’m quite satisfied. I’ve got everything I want. I’ve got as much money as I’ll ever need. I live in a good house. I don’t understand why anyone would ever want to be more than I am now.’ I thought that was a pretty powerful statement about his contentment both with the job he was doing and with the people he was serving, and about his own sense of what was important. Jim did me the honour of officiating at a function held a couple of years ago when I became the longest serving federal member for the seat of Denison. He was the master of ceremonies at that function and we had a very good night. All the usual villains of Tasmanian politics came out to play. Michael Hodgman, who was my predecessor, even made a cameo appearance. So there are a lot of affectionate memories. MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Condolences

211,Mr Kerr,"He did get a record vote, and I hope that we will never again reach a pointIn concluding this address I wish no more than to say that, when those who are close to us pass from us-our friends or close relatives-we really do not know the words to say. We always know that they were not perfect; we always know that there was something about them that we did not like or bits and pieces of their character or relationships with us that were tough at different times. But when they die it is not the time to mention those differences and certainly it is not the time for me to reflect on or mention any differences we had from time to time; they existed, and I think people know that. What it is time for, though, is reflecting on the human condition: how much we share, how much we owe to one another and how much we should honour that respect for service that Jim’s remarks reflected-that he saw what he was doing as so entirely fulfilling that nothing would ever challenge that in his life. Everybody has quite properly mentioned the sad and personal loss that will be experienced by his wife, Honey Bacon, his sisters and his children. I can do no more than simply acknowledge that none of us speaking today will ever be able to assuage for them what must be a different kind of loss than we are acknowledging today. Ours is an acknowledgment of a public loss of a person important to public life in Australia; theirs is the loss of somebody whom they loved. I will conclude by saying that it is fitting that, after the addresses and testimony towards his contribution in public life that were given by the present Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition, the former Leader of the Opposition, a former President of the ACTU, the last three addresses on this condolence motion will be given by three of his Tasmanian colleagues. All of us join in this expression of respect. that Jim Bacon had passed away on Sunday in his tremendous battle against lung cancer. And it was a very sad day for Tasmania and for all of us in the Labor Party; he had been a true friend to many of us. I can certainly remember his days as State Secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation. I remember his first day in Tasmania actually; there was a builders labourers conference held in Hobart and Jim had been appointed to take over the reins of the Tasmanian branch. I think I was the first to lead the old Trades Hall blokes into the political arena when I won Lyons in 1993, and the others all came after me. Jim always took up the fight for the ordinary working man, as reflected by his early involvement in Maoist politics in Australia and also in the Builders Labourers Federation. He started off as a bit of a silvertail in one way, but I think after his father’s death his family fell on pretty hard times, and maybe that had something to do with his make-up as well. Jim knew what friendship was and dealt a lot on loyalty. He was a strong figure in putting forward his views but he believed strongly in loyalty and in friendship. He always took up workers’ views and he represented them with great force. He hated to see injustice being done, and he would always fight against injustice. The BLF was always in the forefront of fighting for labourers, and it is the idea of labourers getting nearly the same rate as tradesmen that has been a constant tension in the trade union movement over a long period of time. When Jim came to Tasmania in 1980 with the BLF he was seen as a leader. He had a character about him that showed him to be a leader. When he was elected Secretary of the Trades and Labor Council it was part of a major change for the union movement in Tasmania. The old Trades Hall in New Town was a building that had offices built behind a very large old house, not quite a mansion but rather large. It had been used for wedding receptions and had MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Condolences
212,Mr Adams (Lyons) (5.13 P.m.),"It was with great shock and great sadness that I heardseveral large rooms. They were used as the meeting rooms. I think the Left had another Trades and Labor Council that was operating separately to the right wing Trades and Labor Council. The bringing together of those bodies meant there was a lot of pressure on that old building. I remember it was standing room only on many occasions. There were some suggestions that people were voting with both arms at the back of the room and that had to be sorted out. A lot of tension was starting to mount. But change came and many trade unions reaffiliated at that time, and that certainly changed the Trades Hall. The entrenched rule at that time was that if you won the ballot you won every position in the Trades Hall, which was not really fair with the different power structures that exist within the trade union movement. After being elected secretary, Jim was one of those who helped change that, along with Des Hanlon from the AWU, Leo Brown from the Missos and many others. It was a very interesting time to be a part of those changes. The changes to the rules gave a broader base of representation to all the major groups affiliated with the council. It was a major breakthrough and a breath of fresh air for the movement. I was the returning officer at the Trades Hall at the time and it was tremendous to see so many unions reaffiliate with the Trades Hall. I was the first one elected on the new ticket as returning officer, which was an interesting proposition. Jim was elected leader only a short time after being in parliament because I think the party knew that he had really good skills and so did the people around him. There were, as has been mentioned, terrible attacks in TV as by the Liberal Party, trying to present Jim as a trade union thug from the builders labourers who wanted to dominate people, which was based on lies and trying to denigrate his career prior to him being elected to the parliament. That was a disgraceful effort which backfired. Tasmanians have had a tradition of electing trade unionists to the premiership, including Eric Reece and many others over the years, and I do not think they were going to accept this from the Liberals. I think Jim topped the poll in Denison and may have taken others in with him. Jim was a sound, strong and purposeful leader who led his government well. At the time Jim was elected, Tasmanians had really lost faith in the political process. Politicians were not held in very high regard by the Tasmanian public. There had been a Green-Labor government which had basically failed. Labor went to 29 per cent of the primary vote as the people punished it for trying to govern with the Greens. A Liberal-Green coalition government was then elected. Under both those governments economic growth stagnated, the population declined and unemployment was high and grew higher. Jim was a bit unknown when he first went in, but he soon used his negotiation skills to pull the Labor Party together. He pulled together all the factions and different groups to work together within the state parliamentary Labor Party, which was no mean feat. It had been through quite a bit of change and a fair few ups and downs. He developed a very strong team with his deputy, Paul Lennon, and his Treasurer, David Crean. Those three acted as a kitchen cabinet in the ongoing government. They headed out to fight to change the Tasmanian economy and build it back up. Those three were an incredible team with their complementary skills, and they carved out a whole new direction for Tasmania. Jim believed in the power of the people, and he knew he had to change the feelings of Tasmanians if he wanted to change the direction of the state, so he engaged the people, and their faith in the political process came back. He started by undertaking skills and opportunity auMAIN COMMITTEE dits, with extensive consultation around the community. His community forums in every small town and region were very popular. He took his cabinet with him, and cabinet ministers had to sit down at the table, along with the heads of their departments, the police commissioner and others, and listen to ordinary people’s arguments and problems that they could not solve. This was a great thing for the morale of the state, and I believe it rebuilt people’s confidence in the political process. The introduction of two new ferries and then a third gave a serious and proper ferry link to the mainland, and it has been a major boost for the state’s economy. That, along with the retention of the Hydro and the expansion of power generation capacities for the state, led to a huge increase in the confidence of those wishing to invest there. Jim managed the whole sea change in Tasmania in a very short space of time, and I believe now we are leading the nation in innovation, growth and opportunity. My seat of Lyons particularly benefited from his leadership style. Many of my small towns had never been visited by anyone other than me and, occasionally, a few others, but Jim led everybody out to make sure he had everybody, from his cabinet down, listening to, helping, guiding and showing an interest in ordinary Tasmanians. Jim was also a true friend of football. He championed all levels of the sport, and he was bitterly disappointed with the handling of a state-wide competition which came into being and fell over in Tasmania. We have traditionally had three areas of football-north, south and north-west-and we formed a state league with the aim of getting a team into the AFL. That did not work, and Jim was very disappointed with all that, because he saw opportunities for young Tasmanians who got into that team. But his love of football was well known and he was often seen at York Park or North Hobart Oval, especially when the AFL teams visited, and he was always checking out his beloved Essendon whenever he could and wherever they were playing. Jim’s interests allowed the breaking of the parochial views of north versus south rivalry in Tasmania where, if something happened in the north, something had to happen in the south and vice versa-and sometimes something would have to happen on the north-west coast as well. He tackled that nonsense head on and broke it down, basically saying that the state could not afford that nonsense and a two-hour drive from one end of the island to the other was not an incredible effort for most people. This basically led to York Park, in the north, becoming a national standard football venue which now hosts several AFL games a year, while allowing Bellerive to develop as an international cricket centre for the state and into probably one of the best grounds in the world. Jim always looked calm, even laid back. He and Honey made a great couple, always helping each other in a way that endeared both to the state. I think this is the hardest thing, to leave a great love and know that she will be devastated without him. Yet they must have talked about this and I certainly know Honey’s strength; and I think we have seen that in recent times as well, with her standing by him and showing great strength to him and to their family. I remember Jim at ALP conferences, kicking a football with his sons years ago. He seemed to carry a football in his car or something because whenever he had an opportunity he certainly used to get it out and have a kick-at lunch or whenever. I know that his family will miss him terribly and I hope they find the strength to continue doing together the things that they did with him. I hope they stay part of the ALP and do things that share their memories of MAIN COMMITTEE him with his old friends and his colleagues. We are here and we will never forget what he has done for the state, and together we must continue his vision. Paul Lennon was his best friend and colleague, and I know Paul will find it much harder than any of us to come to terms with his loss, taking over when he did in his true deed of friendship. I am sure he hoped to have an ear to discuss things with much longer than he has had. But Paul is doing a good job and he will continue to honour his proud friend. I am very sorry that the circumstances had to be that difficult. But something always comes out of adversity, and taking Tasmania to new heights is what we need now. It is quite interesting that over the last couple of months so many of my constituents asked me how Jim was. Jim grew to be admired by Tasmanians because of the turnaround in the state; people felt that his strong leadership had given Tasmania an opportunity to regain some momentum economically and socially. SoI mourn the passing of a very special leader and a close friend, and my family and I offer our sincere condolences to Honey and Jim’s family, especially his sisters, and hope that Honey can find some solace in the great affection that Tasmanians have for Jim and also for her. the member for Lyons and the member for Denison in paying tribute to Jim Bacon, who was Premier of Tasmania from 1998 until, tragically, earlier this year, when he handed over the premiership to his good friend Paul Lennon and set about the task of trying to cope with cancer. Jim unfortunately lost that battle on Sunday, and Tasmania is now in the process of grieving and farewelling him. I would like to share a potpourri of memories of Jim and some assessments of his premiership and of Jim as a man. Unlike my friends who spoke before me I do not have a long history with the Australian Labor Party. I do have a long history as a supporter, but not within that rich fabric of the Australian Labor Party. I lost a state election, which I think was in 1991. I also stood as a federal candidate in 1996, again unsuccessfully. I almost had the ‘political loser’ look about me. But one thing about the north-west coast of Tasmania is that, to test your mettle, they like to knock you down and let you get up-you have got to earn your stripes. I remember a Labour Day picnic in the mid-1990s-I think it was the day after the 1996 election, which I had lost, and I immediately declared that I was going to stand again. Not knowing the factions in Tasmania, I thought that, if I declared it publicly straight away, they would not be able to take the candidacy off me later on. Little did I realise that no-one was particularly interested in it. Braddon was a barren wasteland for the ALP for 20-odd years, federally. Even my colleague the very successful member for Denison-who indeed holds the record for Denison-once stood for my salubrious seat of Braddon many moons ago. He quickly decided that Denison would be a better prospect in the future, and then went overseas to get over it. Anyway, I remember distinctly at this Labour Day picnic that a very dapper and confident looking man came up to me-a face I had seen on television, a leader in the Labor movement in Tasmania. He shook my hand, looked me straight in the eye and said to me, ‘You’ve got what it takes, mate, and we are what it takes.’ I will never forget that. He followed my endeavours from the day on. I would get correspondence from Jim, and every time. I saw him he would come over and say: ‘Sid, keep going. You’re doing a great job and you’re going to win this seat.’ One of the great pieces of correspondence that I have received and which I cherMAIN COMMITTEE",135,Condolences
213,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (5.30 P.m.),"It is a great honour to follow my colleaguesish-and I made mention of it previously-is a letter of congratulations from Jim, which I hold very dear. He followed me through those times in the wilderness. The hardest time to encourage people is in the years of endeavour, and they were very lean years, but Jim Bacon was confident then that I would make it-and I was pretty sure that, whatever he did, he would make it. So what a great year 1998 was. Jim Bacon became Premier of Tasmania-and what a very popular Premier he was to become. The member for Denison very correctly mentioned that this was due to the earlier work of Michael Field and his cabinet in the Labor-Green accord years. In the transition from Michael Field, Jim was able to take on a movement that had momentum. Jim was the right person at the right time. He brought to the job the ingredients that made Jim Bacon, as well as a troika, almost, of David Crean, Paul Lennon and his team. It was the right time. Jim Bacon became Premier in 1998, and a couple of months later Sid Sidebottom became the member for Braddon, after seven long years. I had a very constructive and encouraging relationship with Jim ever since that time. In 2001, Jim Bacon went on to record a back-to-back success with the Labor Party in Tasmania as Premier. He was very successful, and my political fortunes followed that success, as did those of my other colleagues in Tasmania. Jim was a man on the move when I first met him, and he moved Tasmania from that time on, so I was not surprised when Jim became Premier or that he was a very successful one with his team. People have, of course, mentioned that. About 18 months ago, or two years ago at most, Jim was here at the National Press Club, and they were corralling people to go to the Press Club. I noticed a number of journalists sitting amongst the crowd along with some other pollies, and there was Jim extolling the virtues of Tasmania and, with the most confidence I have ever seen, saying that Tassie was on a big journey, that it was taking off very quickly and that you want to get on board. It was not long after that that you saw what appeared to be almost quantum leap decisions by the Tasmanian government, which had in fact been in train for some time. Jim was there to talk about the growing economy of Tasmania, a very outward looking Tasmania and a Tasmania that was very welcoming, not only to tourists but also to people who wanted to reside there, people who wanted to contribute to our economy-particularly to our society and our culture-and make Tassie innovative as well. There has been a remarkable turnaround. In fact, I have not seen anything like it in 30 years, particularly where I come from. So Jim Bacon was a catalyst as leader, along with his team, in events that were external and internal to Tasmania. When I think about Jim, I ask myself: what portfolios did Jim Bacon excel in apart from being Premier and running his cabinet? That indeed took great skill, but Jim Bacon also took on the portfolio of the arts. To me, that was one of his great contributions to Tasmania, because Jim Bacon believed that a society is more than just an economy. We are so used to hearing about the bottom line, particularly up here, and that economics is both the end and the means. Jim fully appreciated the importance of a growing economy, a sustainable economy-there is no doubt about that-but he also believed that the arts could do a few things, both in stimulating and being part of that economy and in opening up the minds of a community to what it could do. The arts are great generators of the economy. Jim Bacon took that portfolio on, himself, and created a culture that welcomed artists to Tasmania. MAIN COMMITTEE It was not all plain sailing for Jim in the arts community. He introduced the festival of 10 Days on the Island, which I think has an international significance now. He managed to get one of his mates, Robyn Archer, down, and they and the organising committee-and we must never forget the people who assisted Jim-made it the vibrant society it now is. The 10 Days on the Island festival has grown and become very popular. Jim Bacon had a great fixation with islands, and I would like to refer to that a little later if I can-but it is very important, because I think it greatly explains Jim’s passion for Tasmania and things Tasmanian. With 10 Days on the Island, Jim also introduced a number of prestigious arts awards. These involved literature, poetry and even local history. Controversy surrounded some of these, particularly in relation to sponsorship of 10 Days on the Island, but Jim, with his passion, perhaps could not see some of the roots of this controversy. But let it be said that his passion for culture in Tasmania and all things cultural in Tasmania was very important. We talk about Tasmania’s economy on the move, but I think it is very important that we recognise Jim Bacon’s very important role in stimulating the culture of Tasmania. I think that is very important. Jim also introduced and continued something that I do not think gets enough recognition, and that is the whole concept of partnership agreements. What they are really about is communication. Jim was a great communicator and Jim did not have any trouble with going to talk to people, to listen to people, to communicate with them, to have community forums and to welcome them in and hear what they had to say. And he did hear what they had to say in many instances, and in time that affected policy. I think that is a very important ingredient. There is another person on the political stage that believes in that and does not mind communicating-and the strange thing is that it has almost thrown political commentary into a tizz-and that is Mark Latham. I think Mark got a great kick out of meeting Jim Bacon, because he saw a lot of himself in him. appreciate any good strategy if it helped one to communicate better! And politics should be about that. I know Jim Bacon had a great regard for some of the great communicators in Tasmania. In my own seat it involved a guy by the name of Ron Davies, and I know Jim greatly respected Eric Reece. Jim never got into the league of Eric Reece in terms of memory for names, but he was not bad. I think it is a fitting tribute that Jim in his state funeral will be carried in a casket similar to that used by Eric Reece. Eric Reece was a great hero to Jim Bacon and, let it be said-I believe-a hero to Robin Gray. But Jim Bacon learned a lot about communicating and he set about doing just that. Jim was determined to not just be part and parcel of what it meant to be Tasmanian; I think Jim honestly believed that Tasmanians needed a little prod at times to start to believe in themselves and to start moving on issues where you go forward, where you cannot stand still forever. Jim genuinely believed in reconciliation and also took the rather controversial stand of looking at the transfer of land to the Aboriginal communities-and I particularly remember the issue of Wybalena on Flinders Island. These are very important markers of premiership, because they are about leadership. My electorate of Braddon has greatly benefited from the economic decisions of the Bacon government-I speak of the three Spirit of Tasmania ferries.

215,Mr Sidebottom,"I do not know whether Mark was a Maoist, but I know Mark wouldwalking down the main street of Devonport and literally see these boats pass you and they are no more than 20 metres away. It is a fantastic sight and it reflects Tassie literally on the move-and they are not all going out; they are actually coming in. Our freight is going out, our products are going out and people are coming in. That is a tribute to Jim and his team. That is what he talked about when he came to the National Press Club here. SoI think about that and I think about wind energy and renewables. Jim was part and parcel of kicking these along. I think about Basslink, I think about the introduction of gas and I think of the more efficient and effective use of hydro in Tasmania. They are all great legacies of Jim Bacon. The member for Denison spoke about the fact that we not only saw economic reconstruction in Tassie, but Bacon, Crean, Lennon and others gave it credibility. It is a great testimony to Jim’s leadership. I know that he did not like it but they used to call him ‘Good News Jim’. Jim Bacon personified optimism wherever he went. Tragically, I believe Jim thought that he could beat his illness. I remember reading that Michael Aird and Michael Polley, great friends of Jim’s, went to see him towards the last days and said that he was fighting as hard as he could. Their words were: he fought and he fought because he was a great fighter. Jim believed he could do that, and he had the optimism to do that; with the support of his wife, Honey, and the family-but particularly Honey-you could see why. One of the great things about Jim as a person was that he was part of a partnership. When you saw Jim you saw Honey. He was a self-professed workaholic. Honey knew that, and she was there with him all the way. I know he loved her very much, and I know that she is feeling his passing very much. Jim had great friends. I remember that Jim used to come to Boat Harbour in my electorate-a truly beautiful place-and I can understand why Jim would find some relief and rest there. At Easter, he took some time off from the chemotherapy and radiology that were battering his body to try to help him, and he went to stay at Boat Harbour with his good friends John and Catherine. I remember the type of character he was. I had an appointment with Jim a few years ago, because I felt I had to tell him what I was hearing on the ground about some potential decisions. I went to visit him and I did not want to take too much of his time. I got out no more than about four sentences and Jim wanted to argue with me. I had to stop him in the end and say, ‘Jim, I came to tell you something not to argue with you.’ But he was passionate, believe me, and you had to have good cause for your case. Jim had a number of flaws-we all do. In fact, when I was born they said, ‘ Mr and Mrs Sidebottom, you have had a flaw.’ Jim had some flaws, and his major one was that he barracked for Essendon. He was allowed to have that. I believe that Kevin Sheedy saw Jim not long before he died, and I know that would have meant a lot to Jim. He was passionate about his footy, and of course he made decisions about footy for the whole of Tassie-against terrific odds, let me tell you. Parochialism is fierce in Tasmania, and Jim made those decisions so that all Tasmanians could go to a venue that they could share in terms of distance and time, and of course it is the home of that great football side, Hawthorn. It is called Hawk Park now instead of York Park. Jim was instrumental in that. Being the man he was, he was both a Hawk and a Bomber. But I think that we all know that deep down he was a Bomber first and foremost. MAIN COMMITTEE I want to share an email that was sent to me by John and Susan Robertson and family at 7 p.m. on Sunday. It said: Sid, Please pass on to Honey and members of the Bacon family our deepest sympathy at Jim’s passing. Our church held special prayers and thoughts for them all this morning. This news was such a shock to us all. We are saddened by his death, but his legacy will live forever in Tasmania’s history. He was truly a ‘people person’ and he has done much in steering this state into a strong national and world position. He is at peace now, but he will not be forgotten. Sincerest regards These are Tasmanians who respected and loved Jim Bacon-a Tasmanian family, part of a community, part of a church, who felt enough to email their member and ask to have that message passed on to Honey. I thought it was very moving. I would like to finish in the best way I can-with the words of Jim Bacon. Jim was a passionate convert to Tasmania. They say there is nothing worse than a convert, but Jim passionately loved our state and not only was a proud Tasmanian-and I know he would say thatbut also tried to make us proud of the things we had. Jim always believed Tasmania had so much more to offer-and Tasmanians do. In an article in the Mercury Margaretta Pos states: Bacon’s vision of Tasmania, perhaps, is best expressed in his own words. She goes on to say: Reviewing Wayne Johnston’s Baltimore’s Mansion, set in Newfoundland, in Island magazine’s autumn 2001 issue, he made no claim to be able to provide a literary review of the book. “Perhaps more interesting is why the Premier of the state of Tasmania-a group of 334 islands and a vast area of ocean-is so obsessed with discovering and learning more about the unique characteristics of islands and their communities,” he wrote. … … … “There is a mystique, particularly among continental dwellers, about islands. There always has been and there always will be. It is ironic that in order to do all the things we want to, to improve in an allrounded way the life of Tasmanians, we must capitalise on this mystique.” “With the communications revolution exploding around the world, Tasmania and Newfoundland, and many other islands, are attracting attention like never before. It is because they are different! Protecting and promoting what we have that is unique will provide the only relatively safe haven in an often savage era of economic and cultural globalisation.” Question agreed to. con, I invite honourable members to rise in their places.

(2) Is he aware that at this workshop experts provided evidence that unnaturally cold water discharged from the base of the larger dams within the Basin is a significant contributing factor to the decline of native fish populations to around 10% of their pre-European settlement levels and that viable engineering and operational measures are available now to allow these impacts to be mitigated. (3) What specific actions has he taken to respond to each of the nine priority recommendations formulated by the workshop and presented in the Executive Summary of the report. (4) In particular, can he advise on (a) progress with the investigation, as approved by the Murray-Darling Ministerial Council in March 2001, of options for mitigating thermal pollution from Hume Dam, and (b) how the Government has sought to include within appropriate regional investment strategies and plans under the Natural Heritage Trust and National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, actions to mitigate thermal pollution from the major dams across the Basin that are the primary cause of the problem. (1) Yes. Issues surrounding thermal pollution, including those in the report, have been raised at Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meetings. (2) Yes. (3) Specific actions to respond to each of the nine priority recommendations formulated by the workshop are as follows: (i) We should not repeat the errors of the past, and act immediately to avoid the introduction of thermal pollution to those rivers that are unaffected by the problem today. (ii) That the extent of the problem is still not sufficiently well documented – both within the Murray-Darling and in other parts of the country – and that this should be a priority in order to guide future actions.",143,Questions On Notice
220,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(iii) There is an urgent need to undertake scientifically based test/pilot case(s) to demonstrate the benefits of mitigating thermal pollution, and to monitor the recovery of biota and ecological processes. River Murray Water (the operational arm of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission) is currently undertaking two research projects related to thermal pollution: (a) Development of an Adaptive Environmental Assessment Method (AEAM) model of the River Murray between Hume Dam and Yarrawonga Weir; and (b) Development of an Adaptive Environmental Assessment Method (AEAM) model of the Mitta Mitta River downstream from Dartmouth Dam. These projects will assess the relative magnitude of the effects of thermal pollution compared to seasonality impacts and riparian vegetation loss and aim to provide solutions to mitigate these impacts. Results from these projects are expected in early June and October respectively. The results from these projects will help us to understand the ecological benefits that might be expected through implementing physical options to mitigate thermal pollution. (iv) We should be pursuing as a priority, modification to the operating protocols of large dams that can allow some gains to be achieved without compromising other factors such as irrigation supplies, flood control, water quality standards. I am informed that the office of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission is not aware of specific actions responding to this recommendation. (v) That within the Murray –Darling Basin stronger commitment and urgency is needed in addressing thermal pollution and that vehicles such as the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality, and relevant State/Territory programs need to include target setting with respect to mitigating thermal pollution The Natural Heritage Trust contributes to the activities of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission through the Australian Government’s contribution to the Commission budget. The Commission is undertaking work to address thermal pollution as outlined. (vi) All jurisdictions should as a priority review their legislation and policies relating to thermal pollution and use this to identify areas where these could be made more effective through improved institutional and licensing arrangements, greater resourcing or similar actions. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission will amend and where necessary develop policies in response to recommendations following thermal pollution research outcomes. (vii) Where it is not already the case, jurisdictions were called upon to list ‘thermal pollution’(in conjunction with blockage from fish passage and alteration of natural flow regimes) as a ‘threatening process’ under current legislation, in order to focus the attention on the problem and pursue a coordinate national approach. A nomination to list the ‘alteration to the natural temperature regime of rivers and streams’ as a key threatening process under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 has been submitted and was assessed by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. The Committee concluded that the nomination did not meet the requirements for listing. A summary of their reasons can be found at http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/ktp/unsuccessful/ streams.html (viii)Actions taken to see thermal pollution impacts mitigated should be preceded by analysis of the social, economic and environmental costs and benefits, and this should be through a risk management approach that meets the principles of ecologically sustainable development. This process is already guiding actions being undertaken by the Commission and will precede any future proposed actions to address thermal pollution. (ix) In order to gain support and improved understanding of the thermal pollution problem there is a need to prepare and disseminate a range of communication materials targeted at the general community, dam managers and lock masters, high level decision makers etc. Specific information relating to thermal pollution will be placed on the Murray Darling Basin Commission website at http://www.mdbc.gov.au/ as information becomes available. The Commission will also have the opportunity to discuss thermal pollution and options to mitigate thermal pollution at future Living Murray community consultation meetings. (4) (a) See response to question 3 parts i, ii and iii. (b) The Government has not sought to include in regional investment strategies and plans under the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality action to mitigate thermal pollution from the major dams across the Basin.

(4) What is the breakdown for the number of services for total unreferred GP attendances for the electoral divisions of (a) Chisholm and (b) Deakin for the quarter ending 31 December 2003. Medicare statistics by electorate are no longer produced on a quarterly basis. Statistics by electorate are available on a calendar year basis. (1) The proportion of total unreferred GP attendances bulk billed for the electoral divisions of (a) Chisholm in 2003 was 72.7% and (b) Deakin in 2003 was 64.6%. (2) The number of total unreferred GP attendances bulk billed for the electoral divisions of (a) Chisholm in 2003 was 461,156 and (b) Deakin in 2003 was 395,655. (3) The average patient contribution per patient billed service for unreferred GP attendances in the electoral divisions of (a) Chisholm in 2003 was $15.65 and (b) Deakin in 2003 was $14.57.

226,Mr Hardgrave,The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs,147,Questions On Notice
227,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:to December 2003 (year of processing). Excluded are details of non-referred attendances to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veterans’ Affairs patients and some compensation cases. Average out of pocket costs relate to non-hospital patient billed services, and are the difference between aggregate fees charged and aggregate benefits paid, divided by the number of services. It is not possible to compute accurate statistics on the average patient contribution per service for patient billed services in hospital, since the Medicare system does not record gap payments under private health insurance arrangements. The statistics were compiled from Medicare data by patient enrolment (mailing address) postcode. Where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, the statistics were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from Population Census data, showing the proportion of the population of each postal area, in each electorate. Attorney-General’s: E-Security National Agenda (Question No. 3496) (1) In respect of the 2002-2003 Budget measure “E-Security National Agenda”, what sum has been spent by his department during (a) 2002-2003, and (b) 2003-2004 on improving e-security. (2) On what e-security initiatives has funding been spent by his department. (1) In respect of the 2002-2003 Budget measure “E-Security National Agenda”, the following sums have been spent by my department: (a) The total cost for the National Information Infrastructure (NII) E-Security National Agenda for 2002-03 was $908,841 (including direct and indirect costs). (b) With respect to 2003-2004, a total of $1,160,686 has been spent to 31 May 2004 (including direct and indirect costs). However, in May 2003, responding to increased external and internal pressure, my department set up a Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Branch to take an ‘all hazards’ approach to the protection of information and physical infrastructure. Therefore, the above amount relates to total spending across the branch, encompassing both work in the protection of physical infrastructure and information infrastructure (e-security). (2) The E-Security National Agenda initiative funded a National Information Infrastructure (NII) Section within my department. As mentioned previously, in May 2003 the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Branch was established to consider all aspects related to the protection of information and physical infrastructure. The CIP Branch currently consists of an NII section and a Critical Infrastructure Policy Section. My department coordinates the development of NII policy within the Attorney-General’s portfolio as required, in particular as it interfaces with criminal and information law reform and law enforcement. Examples include the work on the Cybercrime Act 2001, the ‘cyberterrorism’ aspects of the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002, ongoing discussions in relation to amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 and input into the SPAM Act 2003. The Attorney-General’s Portfolio funded the production of Standards Australia Handbook 1712003: Guidelines for the Management of IT Evidence and my department funds and supports the Australian Computer Crime and Security Survey. My department also has an active role on the Communications, IT and E-Commerce Board and the National Centre for National Security Standards of Standards Australia.",147,Questions On Notice
228,Mr Mcclelland Asked The Attorney,"General, upon notice, on 11 May 2004:",148,Questions On Notice
229,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:My department is coordinating international efforts in NII protection at a strategic level, both in bilateral and multilateral arrangements. My department has held bilateral and multilateral talks with the United States, UK, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, Malaysia, China, Taiwan and Brazil on national information infrastructure protection. My department has also engaged with the OECD and APEC in the protection of E-Security. Within the OECD, it chaired the working group which drafted the Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security (August, 2002) My department is sponsoring a project, aimed at increasing the number of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in the region, and promoting cooperation between them. My department ran CERT awareness raising workshops in conjunction with the APEC Telecommunications and Information Working Group (APEC-TEL) meetings in March 2003 and October 2003. My department has contracted AusCERT, the Australian Computer Emergency Response Team based in the University of Queensland to provide in-country CERT capability raising training to Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and Thailand. As a result of its expertise in this area, an officer from my department is overseeing an APEC funded project working to provide similar in-country training to other APEC economies in the region including Russia, Mexico, Peru and Chile. The NII section provides the Secretariat for the Information Infrastructure Protection Group (formerly the CIPG). The IIPG meets monthly to discuss protection of the NII. The First Assistant Secretary of my Department’s Information and Security Law Division chairs the meetings. The IIPG has developed an arrangement to govern when an extraordinary IIPG should be called and who should be briefed on the outcomes. Extraordinary IIPG meetings were held on several occasions during 2002, 2003 and 2004 to respond to issues that could pose a threat to the NII. Crisis Management Arrangements for NII incidents have been implemented. Known as the Joint Operational Arrangements (JOAs) these arrangements allow information to come into the NII operational agencies (ASIO, DSD, Australian Hi Tech Crime Centre) and be worked on collaboratively. The JOAs have set up a single 24hr contact number which is hosted by DSD. My department has been responsible for implementation of the recommendations of the BusinessGovernment Task Force on Critical Infrastructure and in particular the setting up of the Trusted Information Sharing Network for Critical Infrastructure Protection (TISN). This included the establishment of the Critical Infrastructure Advisory Council (CIAC) and key sector Information Assurance Advisory Groups (IAAGs). The TISN was launched at a summit in April 2003 The first meeting of the CIAC was held in August 2003 with subsequent meetings held in December 2003 and March 2004. In addition to its support for CIAC meetings, my department is supporting meetings of an Australian Government Senior Officers IDC on CIP and a National Committee for CIP comprising Australian Government, state and state and territory, and local government representatives. My department has launched a CIP Newsletter which is being distributed to TISN members and will be published on the TISN website. A free incident alerts scheme for the public was established through a contract with AusCERT in May 2003, and a reporting scheme was launched in June 2003. Subscription to the alerts scheme is via the website at http://national.auscert.org.au. My department has been able to coordinate Australian Government efforts to identify and protect those aspects of the NII critical to the national interest. It has also facilitated consideration of NII within broader CIP developments to date.

(2) What powers and obligations does the Government have in respect of the importation of (a) illegally logged timber, and (b) timber products made from illegally logged timber. (3) Is he able to say how many countries have taken action in respect of the importation of timber illegally logged, or products made from timber illegally logged, in Papua New Guinea; if so, which countries have taken action and what action was taken. (1) (2) Timber species listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and their derivatives cannot be imported into Australia unless a valid export permit, and an import permit for commercial consignments, accompany the shipment. quirements and, as such, are prohibited imports. There are over 160 countries that are signatories to CITES and each of these is required to apply the CITES permitting regime to protect threatened or vulnerable species from overexploitation in international trade. Australia is working to build institutional and technological capacity in the Asia-Pacific region as the principal means to address illegal logging of non-CITES listed species. Australia’s aid program contributes to the forest sector in this region through projects under country and regional programs, and contributions to multilateral agencies and organisations. (3) The Australian Government is seeking to address the serious and complex issue of illegal logging in Papua New Guinea by working towards increased cooperation between countries to enable harmonisation of forestry certification standards and to facilitate mutual recognition of certification schemes. To my knowledge, I am unaware of other actions individual countries may or may not be taking. Environment: Threatened Seabirds (Question No. 3553) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 11 May 2004:",162,Questions On Notice
248,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Will he be reviewing the status of the (a) Black-browed Albatross, (b) Fleshy-Footed Shearwater, (c) Indian Yellow-Nosed Albatross, and (d) Sooty Albatross, all threatened seabirds, following the release of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List review; if not, what action will he take to ensure the continuation of these species. A review of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species does not automatically trigger a review of the threatened status of species under Section 178 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The Indian Yellow-Nosed Albatross and Sooty Albatross are already listed as Vulnerable species under the EPBC Act. A nomination for the Black-browed Albatross was received in April 2004 and the Threatened Species Scientific Committee is currently considering this species’ eligibility for listing as threatened under the EPBC Act. The Australian Government already has plans in place that aid in the conservation and ongoing protection of the Black-browed Albatross, Indian Yellow-Nosed Albatross, Sooty Albatross and Fleshy-footed Shearwater. A Recovery Plan for Albatrosses and Giant-Petrels has been in place since 2001. In addition, there is a Threat Abatement Plan for the incidental catch (or by-catch) of seabirds during oceanic longline fishing operations, which addresses a key threat that has been identified for the four above mentioned seabird species.",165,Questions On Notice
