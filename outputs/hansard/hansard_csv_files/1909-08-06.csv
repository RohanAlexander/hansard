If so, why have the repeated applications of the large and important Rifle Club at Junee been so persistently delayed OT shelved? 3. Is he not aware that a most suitable site can be obtained nt Junee at a price which would return an annual interest of 5 per cent.? 4. Does he not consider it would be more to the interest of Australia to encourage rifle shooting here, by providing suitable ranges, than spending the money in assisting to send rifle team's to Bisley, in England? the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It is the policy of the Government to give every possible encouragement to Rifle Clubs. 2. It has not been the custom for the Government to provide Rifle Ranges for Rifle Clubs, but where a military range exists every facility is given for its use by members of Rifle Clubs. Since Federation, approval for the formation of a Rifle Club has been contingent upon the Club making arrangements for the use of a suitable site nnd the construction of the necessary range. For this purpose the regulations provide for a grant not exceeding £ 7 5 . My two predecessors in office have had the case pf Junee under consideration, but neither of them were disposed lo sanction the expenditure involved in the Junee proposals. 3. The only site which appears to be available would cost £1,350, and the construction of the range would be additional. 4. I do not see that these matters require to . be considered alternatively. . RULING. this House dissents from the ruling of Speaker that an honourable member is not entitled to read from a newspaper matter reflecting on honourable members personally. Yesterday, during the discussion of a motion arising out of the presentation of the Printing Committee's report, you ruled, Mr Speaker, that I should not be in order in reading from a newspaper report of proceedings in this Chamber, so far as it affected honourable members of the House. I wished to read that report to show that certain things had been done here of iwhich Hansard contained no record. Your predecessor could not be cavilled at for want of ability to control the conduct of honourable members. the omission from Hansard to which the I wish now to make a quotaSpeaker allowed in regard to the reading",14,Setup

10,Mr Webster,"I shall deal with'of newspaper statements reflecting on honourable members. According to the. official record, volume XLvn., page 1379, the honourable member for Wentworth, on the 2ist October, 1908, quoted the following passage from the Brisbane Worker"" L a u g h and jeer, as we may at G. H . Reid, . what can we wish him worse than the partnership of A l f r e d Deakin? He built his little house upon the faith of Deakinj had he read his Encyclopedia Britannica more closely he might have been forewarned by the p.iroble of the house built upon sand. sand-san d without grit, quicksand. Woe betide the political wayfarer who ventures, his feet that way! There is no foothold in Deakin. He is true to nobody, not even to himself."" The same newspaper said again"" The workers' delight at the downfall of Reid is only equalled by its contempt for the bloke that did it . "" "" Appropriately enough, thc champion Judas of Australia represents a Bally rat."" The following remarks appearing in the Brisbane Worker on that occasion are singularly appropriate, of the present situation"" Double-dealer Deakin is still ' explaining.' History repeats itself with the difference-Judas did all his explaining at the end of a rope."" I do not make these quotations because I think they are altogether fair criticisms of the Prime Minister. I recognise that the honourable gentleman has been wickedly treated. He always is ! The Worker referred to the fact that the Prime Minister was still explaining. The honourable gentleman is at the same business yet. He is now engaged in explaining the little difference as to figures to which the honourable member for Flinders referred the other night. ber doing? ber m i g h t come to m y r u l in g . quote another newspaper extract which the honourable member for We n t w o r t h was per. m it t e d by the late Speakert o read. It was from the A d e l a i d e He r a l d , and in these . termsMr Peakin has betrjiyed in politics more friends, parties, anil coalitions than any other .three men in Australia. . . . supported by a powerful daily paper, and obedient to its every whini, he was able to betray with impunity where others would have been crushed. . . . ' . Mr Deakin may last this' Parliament. It might be well to keep him there. Your predecessor. Sir, permitted those pas. sages to be read, and to be recorded in Hansard, and' in my judgment, the report which I was proceeding to read yesterday -did not reflect on any honourable member nearly as seriously as do they on the character and political honesty of the leader of this House.. The report which I wished to read contained words actually uttered in this Chamber, though not recorded in Hansard. It will form a dangerous precedent if two or three members are allowed to put their heads together, and agree upon the elimination from Hansard of true and faithful reports of our discussions. In addition to the passages which I have just read, 1 could instance many other quotations, by prominent members, of newspaper Deakin is a l l passages reflecting on .tbe character of other honourable members more strongly than that which I wished to read yesterday. But it is not necessary for me to pile up precedents. It has been laid down in other Australian Parliaments that Hansard is not to be altered except by the vote of the. House, and recently when, in the House of Commons, a member had said something detrimental of Mr Will Crooks, and, finding that he was wrong, appealed to have the record expunged, the House grarited the request. To go a little further, ""we find right through our own history cases where a House itself, on being appealed to by those affected, has been liberal enough to expunge records which had better never have entered the pages of Hansard. I do not desire to hurt any one's feelings by referring to a notable case in Queensland, where statements, made by a responsible member concerning another, were deleted by a vote of the Chamber. Had the extracts I read been published in the columns of HansardI should, 1 think, have been in order yesterday. Be that as it may, the report did not appear in Hansard, and that fact alone The honourable memindicates that there has been some .censorship which is out of harmony with the pracI should lik e first l o tice observed throughout the British Dominions. I do not think it necessary to say more in proof of the admissibility of a quotation similar to that I attempted yesterday-, What the honourable member for Wentworth quoted is ten times more a reflection on the present Prime Minister than what I read was a reflection on the honAt all times, orable members concerned, yet it was permitted by the late Speaker; and there are numerous other instances. I do not wish for a moment to cast any reflection on the Chair.

But I do not think that any such situation was in evidence when the honourable member for Gwydir used those extracts. to emphasize one remark which you have just made, namely, that the Speaker is the guardian of the personal honour of this House. because the Speaker is not only the guardian of the personal honour of this House, but the guardian of the personal honour of every honourable member. I have sometimes heard from the. Chair, even within the last day or two-and formerly under the best of Speakers we could ever have-the observation that if an honourable member considered any remark offensive it would have to be withdrawn. That often hrings a laugh down on the honourable member who is smarting under some unparliamentary utterance-som e remark which is, and which we all take to be, positively offensive. I clo not think that when an honourable member calls the attention of the Chair to a breach of the rule which you have just mentioned, he should be put in the position indicated by the observation I have referred to. It is the Speaker's personal duty to protect each honourable member of this House, and it should not lie on the honourable member who is aggrieved to put himself sometimes in a ridiculous position bycalling the attention of the Chair to the inCanada. Of course, it would be possible justice he has suffered. I think that the honourable member for Gwydir will be entirely with you, sir, now that he sees that the rule is what it is, and that it has been carried out as it was by the late Speaker.; and that he will be the first to concur in the observations I have just made. indicated that, as far as I am personally concerned, my object has been attained, and that I did not desire to place on record any objectionable remarks made by a newspaper. My idea was only to point out that there had been a custom of eliminating matter from Hansard, and that this should not have been allowed without a vote of the House. I have no personal feeling on the subject, and. as 1 should .not like any one to cast aspersions on my characterI like to do to others as I would have them do to me;-wit h the permission of the House, I shall withdraw the motion.

I do not know that I need say anything more now, because, when we are in Committee, I shall be able to give any further information required by honourable members in regard to the various clauses. I may say that the standard of the coinage will be the same as in Great Britain and Canada, namely, 92.5 per cent, of silver and 7.5 of alloy. In every other British Dominion where there is a distinct coinage, the standard is lower, namely, 80 per cent, of silver and 20 per cent, of alloy. Of course, there is greater profit in the lower standard, but we have thought it better, in regard to the intrinsic value of our coins, to follow the example of Great Britain and Canada. the interchange of coin? pared to say, but it will show that we have not sought to depart from the standard established in Great Britain and to make the coins of iron, when the return would be nearly all profit, but that is not the precedent that has been established in the two greatest parts of the Empire. help us in exchanging a pound's worth of our silver at 'Home? think our silver coins will be interchangeable in the Old Country, but they may be taken to some extent in the islands of the Pacific, and even in New Zealand.

Old Country one can get gold for the Imperial silver coinage, and one could get gold in Australia for the Australian silver coinage, but if ours were taken to the Old Country, one could not get gold for it at its face value. I shall be glad to give any further information required in Committee. [11.2] -It is a pity that while on the coinage question we have not at once adopted the decimal system of dollars and cents. It seems foolish to perpetuate the antiquated system of pounds, shillings and pence in an age when the world is abandoning all its old methods and adopting progressive ideas. Nearly half the world to-day has chosen the decimal system. It seems funny to hear people talk of intrinsic value in money. Money is only a medium of exchange. has the same value as though it were made of gold of the same amount. Indestructibility of value is the morality of money. Coin represents an exchangeable value, and all that we want is something by means of which we can exchange our products, properties, and commodities. When one buys a property or commodity the seller does not weigh one's money. Our gold or silver does.not pass because it contains so many ounces. If that were so, our silver would have to be weighed, because the intrinsic value of a pound's worth of silver coin is only about 8s. Yet that pound of silver passes as current coin throughout the Commonwealth. That being so, does it not seem folly, when beginning a new system of currency, not to adopt at once a system whereby we can utilize the credits, of the country? The credits of the country are not used when we only establish our currency on the basis of gold. just as well have the title deed to a property written on a gold bond of the value of the property, whereas you only have a piece of paper to represent a title to property worth perhaps millions. But you do not claim that that piece of paper should possess the value of the property. According to our system of exchange, our measure of the standard of value, every title deed ought to possess the value of the property itself. In other words, every title ought to be written on a piece of gold to the value of the property. The time has come for us to begin to think upon these questions. The Treasurer now has a chance [ 8 ] -2 7 to introduce a system of coinage which is In the recognised by 90,000,000 people in the United States, 6,000,000 in Canada, and 15,000,000 in Mexico, and by the people in several other countries, while Japan has virtually a decimal system although it is not upon the same basis. We have now a chance to make a change, yet no change is made. We are to continue the same antiquated system, and the O'MALLEY (Darwin) same old conditions. I did expect something progressive from this Treasurer, but I am disappointed. I suppose it would be of no use to try to persuade the right honourable gentleman, backed as he is by honourable members on the Government side, to make a change, for if they attempted to do so they would be frightened, arguing that they had no precedent to follow. Yet every, person admits that a child landing in the United States could pick up the American currency in an hour. One hundred cents A postage stamp make a dollar, 50 cents half a dollar, and 25 cents a quarter of a dollar. The whole currency is so easy to calculate that any child could understand it, but no man in Australia could figure up the interest at a certain rate, upon, say, ,£1,357 7s. 8Jjd., without consulting a book. The Treasurer has a splendid chance to effect reform, but I suppose it is not to be done. I am in accord with other honourable members in congratulating the Treasurer on the monetary advantage that will accrue to Australia by the adoption of the proposed scheme of Australian coinage, I also regret that he has not seen his way to introduce the reforms suggested by the Coinage Committee. There are, of course, certain difficulties in the way of the adoption of a decimal coinage system in any country. I readily admit that they exist in the case of You might the proposals of the Decimal Coinage Committee ; but similar, difficulties have been overcome elsewhere, and the change, after it has been made, has invariably been found to be of great advantage to the community. I am sure that if the change were made in Australia any slight difficulties that might be encountered at the outset would be more than counterbalanced by the facility with which calculations could be made. Much less time would be taken in educating children in arithmetical problems, and the community would at once acquire a facility in calculations which would be equal to several degrees ot added intelligence amongst the whole people.

48,Mr Batchelor,"That is practithe metric system of weights and measures, instead of dealing with decimal coinage in the incomplete manner proposed by this Bill. Another consideration is whether by making the sovereign the standard unit, as is proposed under this Bill, we shall not set up a standard that will ultimately lead to alterations of the penny and the halfpenny, so as to make them decimal proportions of the present shilling and sovereign. I think that it would be better to make the halfpenny the standard unit. It is all very well to say that people can readily accommodate themselves to changes in our monetary system, and can put up goods to meet the altered values of coins, but, by making the sovereign the unit, we should meet with serious difficulty. should have to make changes that would lead to an increase of something like 15 per cent, in the cost of goods how purchasable for one penny. For instance, ten papers, now sold at a penny each, would .be sold for a shilling, and the effect of such an alteration would also be seriously felt in coriniexpon wjth the payment of wages, which are. calculated by the hour in pence. The values of a hundred and one articles of domestic use would be changed.

We have to consider, however, what is intended ultimately to be brought about by this reform. TheB ill , so far as it relates tb decimal coinage, will be meaningless unless we alter the denominations of the penny and the halfpenny, so as to agree with the new system. Honourable members may well consider whether, instead of providing that the sovereign shall remain, and that all other coins shall, correspond in their decimal proportions with it, it would not be better to make the halfpenny the unit, and to work upwards. disadvantageous to the worker? Under such a system he would only get for a shilling what he may now buy for tenpence. start-with the five-mill piece? That would overcome any difficulty of the kind. the best of all proposals. Such a change would make very little difference in values, whereas if the denominations of the present pennies and halfpennies were altered, so as to fit in with the adoption of the sovereign as the standard unit, purveyors of goods now sold at a penny would reap an advantage of about 15 per cent, in values.

Why, for instance, is the standard weight set out in Imperial weight grains and metric weight grams ? Is it to facilitate the discharge of international commercial debts? Is our coinage to be based OJI the mint, the current, or the commercial par of exchange. Mr .FRAZER (Kalgoorlie) [11.33] It seems to me that clause 4, read in conjunction with clause 8, would allow the Treasurer of the day to authorize' at anytime the issue of coins of denominations not specified in the schedule, without even submitting the matter to Parliament. It says :The Treasurer may cause to be made and issued silver and bronze coins of the dimensions, designs, and denominations specified in any proclamation under this Act, and clause 8 provides thatEvery proclamation under this section shall come into operation on a date therein specified, and shall have effect as if .it were enacted in this Act. Of course, any proclamation would be that of the Governor General in Council. Apparently the Ministry is endeavouring to get power to do something by proclamation which is not otherwise provided for in the Bill. The alteration of the coinage system is surely a matter for Parliament. MF.

That seems to contemplate the possibility of coins of other denominations than those mentioned in the schedule.

No doubt the issue of coins not now specified is contemplated. value will not be altered. the possibility of the issue of coins* of denominations not specified in the schedule, other than half-crowns and crowns. It seems to me a weak point to make the unit a shilling instead of a bronze coin. The difficulties which this would create would increase with time. It would cause something little short of a revolution to attempt to depreciate the penny. I should like to add to what the honourable member for Boothby has said that the introduction of the decimal system will be of but little utility if it is confined to our currency, and not applied to weights and measures. The metric system, where universal, facilitates computations and calculations to such an extent that it probably results, in education and commercial transactions, in a saving of time equivalent to 25 per cent. From the stand-point of the revenue, the proposed arrangement is, of course, a good one, and I cordially support it. But as a contribution towards the adoption of the decimal system, it is almost negligible. [11.42] I wish to know if there is any limitation on the Treasurer's power to issue silver and bronze coins in times of financial depression. A Treasurer who is hard-up might feel tempted to inflate the currency by issuing a tremendous number of coins. The power of money depends on its volume, the regulation of its issue, and the manner in which it is received. bered that bronze is legal tender only to the value of a shilling, and silver only to the age into circulation, hoping to make things",20,Coinage Bill Second Reading

I recognise that any Government, in making such a change, would have to face the differentiation from the British system; but the proposals of the Committee were so framed that the differentiation would be as small as possible. Thcdifficulties of calculation, and of bringing the two systems into line in commerce, were minimised by the recommenda^ tion of the Committee to fix the florin as the standard, and to make the Australian sovereign, if minted under such a system, of the exact value of the British sovereign. The florin, which would be one-tenth of the sovereign, would be the standard. the florin would be a shilling, a quarterflorin sixpence, and so down to the cent, which would be about a halfpenny. The only difference would be a variation of 4 per cent, in the penny and halfpenny piece in favour of the consumer. subdivision of. existing coins in favor bf small purchasers. honourable member is quite right. I regret that no Government has yet seen its way to adopt that system. It must come, sooner or later. It would be an advantage commercially to the buyer, as the honourable member for Perth has said, in the greater subdivision of the coins; and it would be a facility in every way to every individual in the community, saving cost in schooling in arithmetic, and so on, and giving considerable advantages in other ways. I agree with the honourable member for Balaclava as to the convenience of the nickel as compared with the bronze coin. One reason why the Government did not adopt the decimal system may have been that they did not wish to depart at present from the British system; and, for the same reason* they may have decided not to adopt nickel coins immediately. But probably effect might he given to the suggestion of the honourable member for Balaclava by giving the option of nickel or bronze. that. clause 8 gives the option to the Governor General in Council to proclaim the character of any coin's other than silver or bronze. I wish to draw particular attention to paragraph b o i sub-clause 4 of clause 4. A distinction is made between the remedy or variation which shall be allowed in the case of coins of denominations mentioned in the schedule, and the remedy to be allowed irt the case of coins of denomina* tions not mentioned in the schedule. The first is fixed in the schedule by Parliament; the second is to be left to the Governor General in Council to fix by proclamation. The Imperial Act allows a proportionate variation on all coins, whether mentioned in the schedule or new coins not in existence when the schedule was published. It provides, first, thatAll coins made at the Mint of the denominations mentioned in the first schedule to this Act shall be of the weight and fineness specified in that schedule. . . . Half That is practically the same as the provision in paragraph a of sub-clause 4 of this clause. But the Imperial Act further provides tbatI f any coin of gold, silver, or bronze of any other denomination than that of the co.ins mentioned in the first schedule to this Act, is hereafter coined at the Mint, such coin shall be of a weight and fineness bearing the same proportion to the weight and fineness specified in that schedule, as the denomination of such coin bears to the denominations mentioned in that schedule. That is, it shall be proportionate. vernment can alter it. so. It is important that we should hold in the hands of Parliament the remedy or variation to be allowed on our coins. It is also logical that if we fix a certain variation or remedy for coins that are now existent and mentioned in the schedule, there should be a proportionate remedy or variation if other coins of similar metal are afterwards adopted. When we hand tp the Governor General in Council the power to decide what coins may be issued,in addition to those already existing, we ought not to part with the power of fixing the remedy or variation in regard to thema power which we exercise under this clause in regard to the remedy or variation for existing coins. The one is a matter of convenience ; the other is a mattei of the honesty of our coinage. finally determine the standard. with the honourable member for Wide Bay shows that it is purely a matter of drafting.

On the other hand, the title "" Emperor"" is that of an absolute ruler, and we do not care to attach it to our coinage in any local Australian On the obverse the Treasurer sense.

I have no feeling at all in the matter;indeed, I think "" King of all the Britains"" a magnificenttitle. I am very glad that the Treasurer takes the view he does on this question. I know of no country which recognises the name of Emperor, except Germany, that gives the franchise or freedom to the people. I remember the stormy discussions in London, when Her late Majesty was made Empress of India. In the shop windows there I saw cartoons inscribed "" You scratch my back, and I will scratch yours"" which was intended to mean that, in return for the new title, the Queen made Disraeli a peer. I remember with what energy the Liberals of the Old Country objected to this new title for Her Majesty. On the other hand, I may say that in England the franchise is yet"" of much too limited a character. In Canada there is manhood suffrage, while in Australia there is the freest franchise in the world; and I think that the inscription "" King of all the Britains"" is a splendid idea. I speak as a Republican of twenty years ago; but my visit to the East showed m-i the danger to be apprehended from that quarter; and I desire to see no severance of the ties we have, not only to the Home Land, but to our brothers of the United The States, who number more English-speaking people than there are in all the British Dominions. I feel sure, sir, that the title now suggested will meet with the approval of the English-speaking people throughout the world.

I hope we shall carry the amendment. -The Government have not intimated that they will accept my amendment, but some objection has been raised to the use of the nickel coins I have suggested, on the ground that they might often be mistaken for sixpences. During the luncheon hour a member of the press suggested to me that if the small nickel coins which I proposed were adopted, we might have a hole pierced through the centre, so as to make them readily distinguishable from more valuable coins of similar size. Many years ago I often saw strings of Chinese coins with square holes pierced in them. If we did not care to copy the Chinese, we could have a, round hole pierced through these nickel coins. That would make them still lighter, and render them no less valuable as a token.

The Government do not propose at -present to deal with the copper coinage. There is not a very large number of copper coins in circulation here, and if we were to gather them up in order to sell them to the British Government, we should not reap any substantial benefit. Under the arrangement which we have made with the British Government it will take about fifteen years to ""withdraw from circulation the present silver coinage, and the withdrawal of the copper coins in Australia is not of pressing urgency. decimal system is at stake. not deal with the decimal system, save that it does not propose the minting of any coins that would conflict with the adoption of that system. I think that we ought to follow the course suggested by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for West Sydney. The main object of this Bill is a financial one. It will enable us to secure the profit made on the coinage of silver, while at the same time doing nothing to affect our present currency. We can discuss the whole question of decimal coinage at some other time. Pennies are not used very largely by those who have considerable incomes. They could not even bestow a penny on any one as a gratuity, and as such coins are heavy, their disposition is to get rid of them as soon as possible. That, however, is not the case with the humbler portion of the community. To them the penny is a very important coin. I think it was Mr Gladstone or Mr John Bright who said that to attempt to interfere with the people's penny in England would be to bring about a revolution. A proposal to do away with that coin must necessarily receive very careful consideration. I do not think that any advantage would be gained by substituting for it a small nickel coin. There is no intention on the part of the Government at present to deplete by sales to the British Government the quantity of copper coins in circulation in Australia ; nor do we propose to coin at present any coin in lieu of the pennv. I ask honourable members to pass the Bill as it stands, recognising that there will be plenty of time later on to consider the other questions that have been raised. I have visited the United States and Canada, and cannot say that I was very much impressed with An arrangement has been the usefulness of the small coins of the value of s|d. .and 5d. in circulation there.

B. Edwards, the House affirmed a motion in favour of decimal coinage. The motion was criticised by the then Treasurer, Sir George Turner, but was carried, I believe, without a division. That is a pretty strong recommendation to the Government to see what can be done to open up communication with the Imperial Parliament. seven years. carry us no further; and it would be rather difficult to recast the Bill so as to provide for the decimal system. I ask the honourable member to be content with the expressed desire of several, if not a majority, of honourable members, and the report of the Select Committee accepted by the House. Government are prepared to admit that probably a majority are in favour of the adoption of the new system, and are willing to make representations to the Imperial Government, indicating the likelihood of our adopting it before very long, I shall be prepared to leave the matter with them. agree that it would be a great advantage if the decimal system could be adopted by Australia and the Imperial authorities simultaneously, and that the temporarywithdrawal of an amendment of this kind, in order to achieve such an object, is fully justified. I hope the Government will see mentioned in the schedule,"" sub-clause 2, be their way clear to take such action as I left out. suggest. In the meantime, I ask leave to withdraw the amendment. I am sorry that the honourable member that investigations of the subject have yet commenced at Home. wait for investigations to be made at Home? We ought to be able to make inquiries for ourselves, and to tell the Imperial authorities that whether they are ready or not, we are. All we require to ascertain is whether there are any. difficulties in the way of our adopting a decimal coinage before the Imperial authorities do so. There is very little hope of our achieving this reform for the next twenty-five years if It we wait for the Imperial Government. As the Attorney-General seems to think that the time has come when something should be done, the only way is to get an assurance that the Government will institute inquiries. Whether we get an assurance or not, I admit that this is not the Bill in which to deal with such a large question; but I should like the Attorney-General to say that the Government are ready to do something more than has been done in the last seven or eight years. [3.12] I think I might give ah assurance that some step will be taken to see if anything can be done; but, of course, I cannot take the responsibility of saying anything further without a Cabinet decision on the matter.

If our desire is to make a profit by the coining of silver, we ought to encourage its use in every possible way. Gold has naturally a tendency to push out silver, just as paper pushes out gold. If we desire to encourage trie production of silver, we ought to make it a legal tender up to ,£5. In very few cases would £ $ in silver be tendered in payment of a debt; but trouble might arise owing to £ 2 being fixed as the maximum legal tender.
