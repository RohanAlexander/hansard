0,"J^Ouse Of Usepresentatibes. Thursday, 23 April, 1008. P.m., And Read Prayers. External Aff Airs) . [2.31]","This morning's cablegrams inform us of the decease of the distinguished man who, but a few days since, was Prime Minister of Great Britain. On his career, involved as it was with the. party politics of the Mother Country, there is no"" need to dwell; his high character, . his genial disposition, his staunch sincerity were patent to all observers. This Commonwealth owes him a distinct debt, because, when the Constitution BiU was before the House of Commons, we had the advantage of his earnest support at every stage of the consideration of the measure. He, and several of those. who are now members of the Ministry which he so lately led, were ardent in their, desire to further the growth of self government in Australia. 'Again, last year, when there was considerable doubt as to the course which should be followed, he recognised the importance of the gathering of the representatives of the self governing Dominions of the Empire, by attending the Conference in person andwelcoming them in an opening speech which breathed the broadest statesmanship. iUnder these circumstances, I ' trust the House will forgive the fulfilment of what appears to me an obligation to tbe memory of a great man. [2.33] -The Prime Minister did well to note the passing of the late Prime Minister of Great Britain. The death of a great Britisher-must always be a matter of concern to us, and the'late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was the embodiment. of the characteristics which make up a great Britisher. I cannot think of him without -at the same time thinking' of another great . Englishman who, too, has lately passed over to the majority. I . refer to the late Duke of. DevonshireBoth loved their country intensely, both served it faithfully and. well for ' nearly forty years. We must remember thit these",14,Setup

3,Mr Joseph ' Cook (Parramatta),"men were born to high station, and possessed all that goes to make life easy and pleasant; but, in spite of these advantages and temptations, they de-voted their best abilities to the service of their country, and served the Empire with arare devotion and a high sense of duty. There have been many men, perhaps,' more brilliant than the late Prime Minister; but he was a much bigger man than we were apt to think. When one read his speeches, one realized how sane, how wise, and how broad were his views,-and saw how much grit*, courage, and honour he possessed. He must be regarded as one of those who are very much greater than is disclosed by a superficial g]ance. Many men have been able to appeal more strongly to the imagination of their countrymen ; but, in our time, m d within our knowledge, no man has so firmly implanted himself in the hearts' and affections of h is fellows, more particularly within the last two or three years. The nation loved him, and did so because it came to see that he loved the people. So long as our Empire is as f r u it f u l as it has been in the producother publication of exactly the same class. tion of men such as the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, we need not doubt our abilitv to maintain our pride of place among the nations of the world. passing of public men, especially of recent days, seems to indicate that the wear and tear of public life in modern times is more severe than it was in the past. Any one who had personal acquaintance with the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman will cheerfully admit that be was a man of broader view, greater mind, and keener susceptibility to the wants of his own people, and possessed of a wider knowledge of tbe development of civil government in foreign countries, than perhaps any other Prime Minister, of recent date, except the late Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone. I had the pleasure of meeting him, and' hearing him speak, and what impressed me more than anything else was bis broad, general, human sympathy, and his desire, not only that the Government of his own country should be ""broad based' upon the people's will,."", but that other countries should possess as liberal political institutions as they were 'able to conduct with advantage to themselves. The Prime Minister has mentioned what the right honourable gentleman did for this Commonwealth. May I bepermitted to allude to what he did for the sister colonies of the Transvaal and Orange River? I am almost tempted to name, too, a foreign country in regard to which .he said that, although its young Parliament might be dead, another would arise and establish itself on its ashes. A great man has passed; one who, perhaps, will, in the future, appear greater than he seems now. He was one of those statesmen who had the people's benefit at heart, and his broad sympathies linked together the members of a party in the great Government which, under the lead of his successor now controls the destinies of the Empire. ber of copies of a publication called Australia To-day were procured by the Government for advertising purposes. I desire to ask the Prime Minister-whether any other publications of an Australian character were procured, and, if so, whether he can, from memory, inform the House what they were ? There was also a handbook of Australia, which is a statistical compilation, giving figures relating to the commerce, trade, production., population, and so forth, for the whole of Australia. Beyond that, I clo not recollect any other such, publication. the Prime Minister whether he has seen the report of an interview with Lord Tweedmouth in the Sydney Morning Herald of a day or' two ago in whicli that statesman positively affirms ""that there is no desire on the part of the Imperial naval authorities to terminate the Naval Agreement, and no present intention of doing so. W i ll the Prime Minister reconsider whether he can lay on the table of the House the correspondence with the naval authorities containing the discussion left unfinished in his December speech? pleasure of reading the interview referred to, but shall take an opportunity of reading it . I have received, within the last two> or three days, a cabled reply saying that the explicit information for which I asked, further defining the position of the Admiralty, will be prepared and forwarded very shortly. Until that information arrives the correspondence is incomplete.",14,Death Of The Right Honourable Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman

20,Mr Austin Chapman,"When the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, ufon notice1. Is it a fact, as stated in the Age newspaper, that the Commonwealth Statistician admits that, under the metliod of computation, the population of Victoria has been under-estimated?. 2. If so, and correction were made, would it have disturbed the number of members allotted to Victoria and New South Wales respectively at the last election? 3. What is the relative increase of population, after any necessary correction, in each of the two States named, since the last allotment, and what number of members would the. latest figures give for each State? the honourable member's questions are as follow1. The Commonwealth Statistician is of opinion that the allowance of .9 per cent, for Victorian unrecorded departures by sea decided upon at the Statistical Conference of 1903 is somewhat too high for the year 1907, and that if such an allowance were made, the increase in the population of the State for that year would have been under-estimated to the extent of 2,587. Similarly the increase in the population of New South Wales would have been underestimated to the extent of 1,973. 2. No . 3. The figures on which the last allotment of representation was based were, those for 30th September, 1905. Between that date and 31st December, 1907, the population of Victoria, .according to the figures of the Commonwealth Statistician, increased by 33,995, while that of New South Wales increased by 85,573. According to the Victorian Government Statist the increase in the population of Victoria during the period referred to was 44,040. Under either set of figures the representation of the States would be as at present. notice1. Referring to his reply to questions on 15th inst., in which he stated that ""no drawback of duty has been claimed on Excise sugar,"" will he be good enough to explain why the Comptroller-General of Customs, in October, 1907, made the following statement:""When imported sugar is used, a drawback of the import duty is allowed upon the exportation of Australian jam. . . When Excise sugar 'is used, a drawback is allowed up to 30s. per ton of the weight of the jam."" W ill he also explain why' the Customs Department found it necessary on the 12th March, 1908, to issue a regulation under the Excise Act 1901, of which the following are the material portions :. 50. Drawback of the f u l l amount of the .Excise duty paid may be allowed upon the exportation of the following excisable goods, namely :-Spirits, Tobacco, Cigars, Cigarettes, Snuff, Beer, Sugar, Starch. Provided that as to sugar used in.the manufacture of the following articles drawback may be allowed on the exportation of the articles, but so that no allowance shall be made for sugar contents in excess of the following proportions to the . total weight of the articles :Confectionery, Comfits, Succades, Sweetmeats, and Sugar Candy ... ... frds. Jams and Jellies ... ... A Jellies, table, in packet .. -Jths. 1 Fruits, canned andi preserved ... ... 5-36ths? 2. If ""no drawback of Excise duty has been claimed,"" or was in contemplation of being claimed, why was this regulation issued making provision for. the payment of such drawbacks of duty? 3. If drawback is paid on Excise sugar sent abroad for consumption will not the results of such payment be(a) That the Treasury will have paid away in bounty and in drawback £ 3 per ton more than it has received from Excise; and (4) That the Australian people will have been taxed in order to provide cheap beer, jams, jellies, & c , for foreigners, though themselves paying the f u l l Australian market price for these commodities? 4. Does he not think that the reason why "" no drawback of duty has been claimed on Excise sugar"" is that it pays the exporter's of jams, & c, better to receive a drawback of the import duty (£6 per ton) than of the Excise duty (£4 per ton)? 5. Is he in a position to say definitely that no Excise sugar was contained in commodities exported for foreign consumption, and that drawback at the rate of £ 6 per ton has not been improperly paid in some instances? 6. In the case of Excise sugar which has obtained the drawback allowed on export to foreign sugar, has not the Treasury paid out £ 5 per ton more than it received? 7. What means does the Customs Department possess for determining whether commodities for export contain Excise sugar or imported sugar?. 8. Referring to his reply that the Constitution Act provides "" authority for the payment of bountv ""(a) Does he contend that the Constitution entitles him to pay, on his own motion and without the sanction of Parliament, a bounty on exported sugar? (4) Can he mention any other product except sugar which obtains a bounty on export without the authority of an Act of Parliament; and {c) If he considered that local sugar, when ' exported, was entitled to be assisted by bounty, why did he not include that commoditv in the measure recently before this House which appropriates revenue for the payment of bounties ?",16,Postal Ratesbill
21,Mr Dugald Thomson Asked The,,17,Sugar Excise
22,Mr Hume Cook,The answers to,17,Sugar Excise
23,"Mr Mahon Asked The Treasurer, U","bonSir WILLIAM LYNE tc the honourable member's questions are as foHow1. The reference to Excise sugar was intended merely to show what drawback is payable under the Excise regulations. tion of 12th March, 1908, was issued chiefly to make the form identical with the corresponding regulation under the Customs Act by stating sugar contents as proportion of the total weight of articles, and thus applicable, independently of the rates of duty „ 2. As implied in reply to (1) the regulation is -not new, but was amended as to form. lar regulations have been in force since January, 1902. 3. The object of the bounty is:-in accordance with the Commonwealth policy-to secure to the grower of the sugar cane (not the manufacturer of sugar) a certain definite advantage if white labour is employed. This object, is apart from any consideration of profit or loss by the imposition of an Excise duty or any question of the ultimate disposal of the sugar made from cane upon which bounty has been paid. As a matter of fact, the'sugar used in exported manufactures is imported sugar on which' import duty has' been paid, and of which drawback is given. 4.. Yes. 5. In view of the precautions taken there is no reason to suspect that any improper payments have been made. 6. See answer to No. 5. 7. Information is obtained both from the vendors of the sugar, and from the manufacturers of 'the articles exported, and such information is verified by statutory declaration. 8. Under the' Acts of 1903 and 1905, bounty is payable on the production by white labour of sugar cane delivered at a factory, and such payment does not depend in any way on the ultimate .manufacture of the cane into sugar or the actual quantity of the latter produced, and has no connection with the ultimate use or destination of the sugar made from the cane. ' BRIMPAEN-HORSHA M ' MrM c DOUGALL asked the. Postmaster-General, upon noticex. Whether it is true, as stated in the Horsham Times, that an officer of the Postal Department has, .by submitting an adverse .report, hindered indefinitely the completion of the Brimpaen-Horsliam telephone line, which line is 25 miles in length, and is being erected by the farmers at a cost of about ^350? 2. Is it a fact that 5 out of 39 poles erected within the Horsham borough boundary, and a large number of the insulators supplied by the farmers, have been condemned by the officer in question ? 3. Is it also true that the Department has refused to allow the Brimpaen-Horsham farmers to connect their telephone line with the Department's poles in Firebrace-street until such poles are replaced with new ones? 4. When does the Department intend to erect the new poles in Firebrace-street? The answers' 5. If the Minister is anxious tp give telephonic facilities to the farmers, will he show his disapproval of the official red-tape obstruction to the Brimpaen-Horsham telephone line by authorizing his Department to consent to the completion of the said line at once? The amending regula. Mr .MAUGER -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. It is not true that the Line Inspector has indefinitely postponed the completion of this line. The Inspector has not'so far taken any objection to any portion of the line outside the Simi1 borough of Horsham. 2. .Several poles erected by the Telephone Syndicate within the town boundary are unsuitable, i.e., they are very crooked, covered with large knots where the limbs have been cut off, and ugly in appearance. Such poles would not be erected by the Department. If the Borough Council agree to the erection of such poles, and make no further Claim on the Department, with reganl to them, 'the Department .is prepared to waive its objection. Tlie insulators supplied' by the farmers are of a class which has been condemned by the Department as far back as igoi. Where the private wire is on Departmental, poles proper insulators and fittings should be used. 3. The Telephone Syndicate-proposed to erect, their wire on Departmental poles in Firebracestreet, which would only allow of the' wire being at a height, of 11 f t . 6 in. over street crossings. . This cannot be allowed. By fixing ""extenders to poles, the necessary height of .the wire would be pttained. 4. The poles in Firebrace-street do not at present require renewal. The necessary alterations will be made with the development of telephone service in Horsham. .5. See previous replies. I w ill not allow any unnecessary obstruction, ""and will causefurther inquiries to be made at once.

122,Mr Chanter,"The honourable memberso to speak, a free country, stock could be easily shifted by road from one district to another, but nowadays we need to push our railways into the drought-stricken districts in order to enable us to combat the evils of dry seasons. Fortunately, a very small portion of Australia is at present affected by drought, and I hope that we shall never have, a repetition of. the drought of 1902. I agree with the honourable member for Corangamite that our farmers and graziers should make better preparation for dry seasons. I certainly thought that the drought of 1902 would teach them to make provisionfor the maintenance of their stock in bad times. In my electorate, we have never had a drought, and I do not think that we shall ever have one. The more severe the drought in other parts of Australia, the more bountiful is the supply of fodder in the electorate of Barker. There one may see stacks of hay which have been kept for two or three years as a provision against drought, but, fortunately, we have not yet experienced one. It seems to me that to specially exempt hay and chaff when we arej passing a generally protective Tariff is to give Australia a very undesirable advertisement. The principle that we have in view in passing a generally protective Tariff is that we should encourage industries and productions for which the Commonwealth is suited, and in respect of all such industries we impose stimulating duties. The special exemption of hay and chaff would be a declaration to the rest of the world that Australia was unable, in our opinion, to produce sufficient fodder for her own requirements. In other words, it would seem to indicate that the great primary industries upon which we pride ourselves, and for which Australia is held to be peculiarly suited are, in our opinion, so liable to periodic interruption that we are not prepared to extend to them the same measure of encouragement that we grant to other industries. That would be one of the worse possible advertisements that we could give Australia. are imposed to assist budding industries? ber has not yet studied protection. able member's speeches. ber, in making that statement, is exercising his capacity for bluff, which, after all, is of not; much value, since his bluffing is only superficial. I have said nothing that would warrant the honourable member's assertion; I have said repeatedly that, even when an industry is well established, it may still be necessary to impose protective duties in relation to it, in order to prevent the dumping from abroad of products which are likely to undermine the local production. As long as .prices locally are not unduly inflated against the consumer, protective duties in such circumstances should be maintained. If those who oppose a protective duty on fodder are anxious to help the farmers, they should direct their energies to an effort to break ^ up the rings that now controlthe supply and distribution of fodder. That is the crux of the question. Australia can produce, and at trie presenttime holds, more than the fodder necessary for the starving stock within her borders. As to the suggestion made by ""the honourable member for Wimmera respecting the educational effects of the last drought, one might reasonably have expected it to have a fair measure of influence upon our farmers. In my old electorate of Bland, which comprised a part of the Riverina, many farmers who suffered heavily during the last drought have learned a lesson from it, and. have conserved both natural and specially-grown fodder in ensilage pits, tub silos, and ordinary stacks. These men have not suffered in the slightest degree from the drought. In the case of one big pastoral property those in charge gathered together fodder, of various descriptions' to such an extent as to insure the management against any loss from drought. My strong conviction is that there is not one beast that need go without fodder because of any scarcity in the supply to be obtained in Australia. It is only a matter of making proper provision for seasons of drought and of our farmers and settlers generally being educated to take advantage of the opportunities Providence has placed at their disposal, and, what is, perhaps, quite as important,-of insuring that when a time of stress and scarcity arises a few people shall not be able to corner the market. That is what, at the present time, as well as during the last big drought, constituted the principal trouble from which 'those who I have studied the honorhad to provide for starving stock had to suffer. It was not that supplies were not available from farms in Tasmania or South Australia at reasonable prices, but that middlemen were, with the assistance of the shippingring, able to control the whole",24,Customs Tariff Bill

137,Mr Watson,"I do not think so. Isabsolutely opposed to the proposed duty. There is one aspect of the question which has not been touched upon by any honourable member I have yet heard speak upon the subject. It must be remembered that every duty we impose upon an article pro1 duced by farmers must be considered from a totally new point of view, in the light of the policy of the new protection adopted by the Government, and which the Prime Minister has stated that he intends to give f u l l effect to. Every farmer, or nearly every farmer, in Australia at some time produces more or less hay and chaff, 'and, therefore, if the duty, be carried, it may be assumed that it will bring every farmer throughout the length and breadth of Australia within the operation of the drastic provisions proposed by the Government in respect to the new protection. the duty imposed on oats. wheat. Mr W. H . IRVINE so. If a. duty is imposed on hay and chaff, one of the effects under the new policy of the Government, apart from the regulation of wages and working time, must be that the price at which farmers, will be al1 lowed to dispose of their hay and chaff will be regulated by an Act of Parliament -or by some body appointed under an Act of Parliament. become effective only at a time when people engaged in the most important industry in Australia are in dire distress and in absolute straits in their endeavours to keep starving stock alive, and if there be any possible time at which it would be justifiable to impose a restriction upon the price of any produce protected under the Tariff, surely that would be the time.

I should not have spoken had it not been for some startling statements made by the honourable member, for Flinders to the effect that it is desired to give an opportunity to people to take advantage of the difficulties of farmers in one part of the country by charging exhorbitant prices for fodder. Such a suggestion is both cruel arid unjust; and could only be surpassed if it be true as stated, that English officials in high positions protested to the Viceroy in India against charitable people in England subscribing money to save starving millions in our Eastern Possession.

When the Lord Mayor of Melbourne and a Committee waited upon that Minister with an offer of £ 1 , 2 0 0 in order to settle starving men on th^ land, he told them that he had not a single acre for the purpose; and yet he had grabbed land for himself. The honourable member for Corangamite has always been a humbug in regard to this affair; and I tell him that he dare not meet me on a public platform and defend the Minister to whom I refer. 1 merely say that he has suffered his punishment. men were noble enough to give their paddocks for the use of starving stock; but the facts are as I have stated. The object of the proposal is to prevent undue inflation of prices, and when we grant protection, it is right that we should have some power in this respect over the industry protected. The soundness of this view is shown in the case of the harvester industry; and we know that in High Court proceedings of the kind, the splendid abilities of the honourable member for Flinders may be utilized at any time if he is retained. It was a great truth uttered by Charles Sumner that for the betrayal of a country. or a great cause, one had not to ' go far to find a friend ready made in any lawyer we came across. We have heard how the honourable member has argued to-day; but we know that to-morrow, if the Combine were to retain him, -he would argue the other way ; and his legal twisting of the case against the honourable member for Riverina is unworthy of him.

It is very largely a sentimental question, but if the duty is retained, it gives the farmer a sense of securitv in respect of his future production. that reason alone, it is necessary that it should be retained. operation of the new protection might well be discussed by itself. We are dealing now with the question of an import duty on hay and chaff. It will be for us to deal with the new protection when it comes before us. It is not desirable to mix up the two questions. I had intended to go into some figures, but at this late stage of the debate, I do not think that that is necessary. For the last four or five years our exports of hay and chaff have been greater than our imports. In 1906, we imported only 895 cwt. of hay and chaff altogether, and up to the present this year only a small 'Importation has taken 'place. 'From information published from time to time, there is every reason to believe that there is plenty of hay in the southern districts of Australia to supply the requirements of those who can afford to pay a reasonable price for it. When hay reaches £ 3 or £ 4 a ton, it becomes altogether too dear for people to buv to feed sheep on. ton in Riverina. M.r. SAMPSON -That is probablv a higher price than they should be paying. It has been stated that chaff is quoted at £ 5 a ton in South Australia, and another honourable member stated that it could be got for something like £ 4 a ton in Tasmania. £ 4 a ton to carry it to the Riverina. [375] higher than they should be, but I do not think it costs anything like £ 3 or £ 4 a ton to carry chaff from South Australia to the Riverina. At any rate, I am not discussing present prices, but the prices that people can afford to pay to feed starving The retention or stock. When hay reaches £ 3 a ton, it is already too dear to feed stock on, unI do not think less it is for valuable dairy herds or stud stock.

As a matter of consistency, and for the sake of the retention of a duty which will apply all round to the agricultural community, I am prepared to vote for the adoption of the Senate's request. this question was last before this Chamber, 1 voted to place hay and chaff upon the For free list, as did also the honourable member for Riverina. The circumstances were The question of the then admitted to be peculiar, inasmuch as we were facing a possible harvest failure. At the present time the conditions are peculiar. Although there is in South Australia a very considerable supply of hay and fodder Australia and in Tasmania. tions of Victoria and of New South Wales there is a very considerable deficiency, and the exorbitant price of about £ 8 per ton is demanded. I venture to say that the practical effect of this amendment, if made, would be nil. Since October last hay and chaff have been on the-free list, but in spite of that fact an abnormal price is demanded. The amendment of the honourable member for Riverina simply proposes that hay and chaff shall be continued on the free list for a further period of six months. To what extent is that likely to affect the price ? I cannot conceive how the remission of the duty for six months is likely to be of the least advantage to the unfortunate persons who are now paying an abnormal price. Too much regard to peculiar circumstances should not be paid in a measure which has to deal with general circumstances. Although we may have a prolific season to-day, still in the course of a year or two we may have a drought, and then it would be impossible to make a special arrangement to meeF the situation.

I voted in favour of placing hay and chaff on the free list not only because of the special circumstances which then existed, but also for a broader reason. I venture to say that if a tax on hay and chaff is likely to be effective in an ordinary season, it is our bounden duty to confer that measure of protection, but normally hay and chaff are sold at such prices that there is no possibility of any importations being made to compete with the local produce. Consequently our farmers have nothing to fear, and so far as they are concerned, the contention that they are benefited by tbe duty is only a fallacy. times of special stress. that a duty on hay and chaff has no pro-, member for Riverina, but if the opportective effect. want to impose a duty for protective puragainst the continuance of the duty. poses, although they know that it is not hope that the Committee will extend its likely to be effective.

Some honourable members appear to think only one class of the commuir'ty is suffering-the pastoralistsand that the farmers are going to rob them.

I claim the votes of those who think that it is better to. suspend the duty for six months than not at all. I ask them to stand by me and to resist the attempt to repeal the duty. I desire to remove one impression [37512 which the honourable member for Flinders left by his speech, and I am glad that the honourable member for Gippsland is here to corroborate my statement. There is a strong sympathetic feeling between the farmers of Gippsland and those of the mallee country. Why? It was because the Gippsland farmers having been vis'ited by a disastrous fire, which practically destroyed their homesteads, the Wimmera farmers extended them a helping hand by saying to them, "" Send us along your stock, and we will provide it with grass until you recover from the effects of the calamity which now affects you."" As a result, when the -Mallee farmers in their turn were suffering from a severe drought, the farmers of Gippsland extended to them reciprocal treatment. . That period; however, has passed. Can the honourable member for toria who has provided free grass for starving stock this year? grass to give? vide free grass? show humanity on their part. provide free ,grass ? to the statement of the honourable membeT for Flinders that there was no necessity to suspend the operation of this duty, because those who possessed stock but had no grass were always invited by those who had grass to place their starving stock upon it. As a matter of fact, I was in Gippsland during the early, portion of this year-the honorThe honourable able member for Gippsland is in a position to vouch for the accuracy of my statement out to me which was under lease for six ' . . months to a Riverina grazier who was paying 30s. fin acre for it. Everybody knows that extremely high prices are being asked for the use of such paddocks.' Only last week I was interviewed in the parliamentary buildings by a ruined dairy farmer, who informed me that, after having paid I for a considerable. period the sum of £ 8 per ton for chaff with which to feed his 100 head of dairy cattle, which had cost him £ 6 each, he was obliged to put them in the saleyards, where they .'realized only 25s. per head.

I frankly confess that 1 am unable to see that a duty upon hay and chaff ever becomes operative.

But this Parliament, having deliberately adopted a policy of protection!, it should be applied fairly all round. duties upon almost every article usedby the farmer, and I do not see how we can consistently refuse tQ sanction the imposition of a duty upon hay and chaff. Of course, we all recognise that in ordinary years such a duty will be entirely iiiopera-tive.

I regret that I was not present to vote against the proposal.of the honourable member for Riverina to postpone tiie operation of the duty until November. It was most illogical for him to ask for a postponement of .the duty merely because there is now a drought in the Riverina. hence there may be a drought elsewhere. Either there should be no duty, or a dury should be imposed at once; as in the case of other articles. A t the present time, owing to the recent bountiful rains arid .warm ..weather,' abundance of fodder is obtainableon the New South Wales coast, the people there having,, not only enough for then: own requirements, but also plenty to sell. The honourable member for Riverina, however, objects to them making a fair profit by selling to his constituents, and has proposed the postponement of the operation of the .duty until November, by whicli time he hopes that Providence, which is apparentlv overlooking his district now, will have sent ' rain there. I emphatically protest against this postponement. The proposal to make hay and chaff dutiable is absurd, -because any duty can operate only at the expense of pastoralists and dairymen who are suffering by reason of drought'. The proposed duty, if operative at all, will be operative in favour of, perhaps, one State when some, or perhaps all, of the others are suffering. The Minister might fairly' take up a more liberal attitude. and agricultural industries that the prosperity of this country is becoming more and more dependent. Every year the amount of capital invested in dairying is increasing, and it is impossible to make dairying pay during periods of drought in the face of high fodder duties. Tlio recent experience of Sydney is that scarcity of fodder increases the price of milk to the people. If those wbo are opposed to the duty are defeated on this occasion, and a recommittal is moved for, I shall vote-for it Question-That the requested amendment, as modified, making the duty on Hay and Chaff, per cwt., is., on and after ist November, 1908 (item 6-j), be made-put .

503,Sir William Lyne,"It is true I doson. Fashions change, and, as they change, the figures of women are moulded by the kind of corsets used. Four or five years ago there was a change in the fashion, and large stocks of the older sort were left in the various warehouses, and had to be got rid of somehow. Mr White, I am credibly informed, purchased large quantities of those stays at a minimum of cost, and altered them for the market by removing the bones and steel, shortening them, and so forth. That was altering and mending, not making corsets. that something like 365 hands were employed in the factories in New South Wales, but that is absolute rubbish. In 1905, under a Tariff of 25 per cent., which"", with costs and charges, ran up to about 40 per cent., there were, four makers in Victoria, employing forty-four workers, and making stays at from £ 2 2s. to ,£15 15s. I am endeavouring to obtain a lower duty so that the wives and daughters of the workers will not be continually made to pay a higher price. With the active work which they do, their stays will not last so long as would higher-priced pairs made to order. They purchase stays at 2s. n d . The existing duty has raised that price to 3s. 6d. That class of article wears out very much quicker, owing to the amount of stooping necessitated by constant house work. I am perfectly certain that the average stays made by Madame Masseran will run to £ 3 3s. or £ 4 4s., and up to £ 1 0 ios. and £12 12s. per pair, according to order. With suspenders added, the cost would be even more. It is impossible for the wife of a worker to obtain a garment of that kind. articles would not care if a duty of even'200 or 300 per cent, were imposed, because their customers would obtain them from them no matter what the duty was. I have a friend who has lived in England for the last eight years, and who still orders his boots from Collins-stireet, simply because the Melbourne maker suits his requirements, and makes to his order. I was informed that Madame Masseran has clients travelling on the Continent who send to her for their stays, as she has their measure. In Bourke-street ribbon band stays can be purchased for is. 1 id., but they are simply bands of ribbon which any girl with a proper machine can make. They are not corsets. The making of corsets seems to have gone entirely into the hands of the French. America, ' when its population was 30,000,000, endeavoured to establish .the industry. It made no mistake about the duty, for it charged no less than 60. per cent. After considerable loss of time and money the industry was established when that wonderful increase of population that has distinguished America took place. It was aided by the quick transit between America and European ports, and by the natural acumen and ability of the American manufacturer, who will select his workmen from any part of the world, and take them to where he wants them. But when an It was stated American proprietary company endeavoured to start, and laid down .works and machinery at Plymouth, in England, they found the greatest difficulty in'educating the supposed highly trained English workmen. It is acknowledged throughout the world that this work is a specialty, oftentimes running through generations of one family, and France seems to hold the key to it. When in Brisbane during the recent election, I made inquiries about the matter. The managing director of Messrs. Finney, Isles, and Ca.,a very large firm, who is a personal friend of my own, assured me that they made corsets only at from 35s. That gentleman is perhaps one of the keenest business men in Australia. He added that corsets used in surgery were made by them, some at a lower and some at a higher price. This duty is purely a revenue one, and I , as a protectionist, object to it. If there was a chance of these articles being manufactured here, I should vote for a protective duty. If the Government honestly intend to encourage the industry, they should start a Government factory, and then, people would know that the prices would be acThe makers of Such high-priced cording to sample. The Treasurer cannot look, me in the eyes and say that this is anything but a revenue duty. population of 30,000,000, could not make the industry ""a success until the population increased still further,' and skilled workmen were brought over, how can the honourable member expect it to succeed in Australia, with only 4,000,000 people?

A corresponding reduction of 5 per cent, in the duties under item 107 was then made. cause there were higher import duties on woollens. that reduction the' difference proposed by the Government between the duties on items 106 and 107 was preserved. There is no doubt that the Government agreed to that arrangement, and I certainly think it is unpeople. precedented for the Government to have one opinion in this House and another in the Senate. I also agree with the honourable member for Angas that it is monstrous that we should be considering requests by. the Senate for increased duties.

Mr W. H . IRVINE I merely wish to refer to the point of order which has been raised, as it is rather important in the relation of one House to the other. I should be very sorry to urge the Committee to adopt any rule that would unduly curtail our powers. On the other hand, we may be in danger of adopting a rule which would place it in the hands of the Senate, by making some small suggestion, to give us a power of review which the Constitution would not give us if the Senate had not made such a suggestion. raised by the right honourable member for Swan is not only important, but I see no answer to it at the present time. The request which comes from the Senate is to include sugar sacks with a number of other sacks in the free list; and all we can do is set forth in the following words in the ConstitutionAnd the House of Representatives may,' if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with, or without modification. We can make the amendment which the Senate requests, or decline to make it, or, if we make it, it may be with modification. The essence of the request is that one particular article shall be included in this particular free list. Could it oe said to be a modification if we replied, ""Yes, we will include sugar sacks, but we will also include a lot of other articles?"" In the next item, for example, there are words "" Blankets (except of Rubber), Blanketing Flannels,"" and so forth. In that item the Senate suggests that the words "" whether plain, fancy or printed "" shall be inserted after "" Flannels."" that case. . Mr W. H. IRVINE -It is only a question of degree. Could we say ""Yes, we At the first division, accept that suggestion; but we propose to ' strike out the words ""(except of Rubber)"" ? It could not be suggested that we could take such a step. If we could, it would The next day it was struck mean that any amendment, no matter how trifling, suggested by the Senate, . would throw open. to us the discussion of everything included in the item, whether relevant to the particular suggestion, or whether a modification of it or not. able member suggest that the striking out If you, Mr Chairman, rule that of the words "" except of Rubber"" presents a parallel case?
