So we have been very responsible and Let us make three simple points about conservative in the estimates that we have what Labor’s view is on this system of new made. funding for schools. First of all, Labor supWhat this minister does is part of the fog poor private schools. This minister’s priority of misrepresentation and half-truths that is to give an extra $1.4 million a year to come out of his mouth. It is no wonder the schools like King’s, with fantastic facilities Prime Minister gets lost in his fog of misrepalready, which are getting excellent results resentation. Part of the fog is he does not talk with many of their students. We say that our about the 62 category 1 schools; he talks aim should be that every child at every about the 67 schools serving the wealthiest school should be striving to achieve the same communities. The reason he does that is that sorts of results as we see at the category 1 he does not want to talk about the 62 cateschools. The first step along that path is to gory 1 schools; he only wants to talk about ensure that those poor government and poor the 67 schools that are at the top of his SES private schools get a decent level of relisting. That is part of his trick, because under sources. his definition of the 67 wealthiest schools the This minister claimed yesterday that we King’s School is not wealthy and that is why need to look at the objective evidence of the it deserves an increase of $1.4 million a year. schools that have real needs. He claims that It is quite clear who is misleading whom. his new funding system uses the objective The point we make about funding for evidence to determine which schools need schools across the country is that there are extra money. His system of objective evireal needs in schools. There are needs in dence delivers massive funding increasesmany of our government schools.

233,System. This Collision Of Totally Incompatible Mr Speaker,"Order! It being 6 p.m.,20956 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 Thursday, 5 October 2000 ----Schoolchildren: Traffic Accidents mourning organised by HOPE-Helping Our Pedestrians Everywhere-at Blacktown Civic Centre. This day of mourning was designed to draw public attention, particularly that of young schoolchildren, to the number of children who die as a result of traffic accidents each year while travelling to and from school. This particular service involved children from four local public schools; choirs from Doonside, Blacket and Bidwill primary schools paid homage with their voices; students from Colyton Public lit candles in remembrance. HOPE was formed by local resident, Val Moorhouse, in 1991, after she witnessed a student’s death while travelling to school. HOPE experienced early successes, with branches being established at Springwood, Tweed Heads, Queenscliff and the Gold Coast. One of the earlier programs of HOPE was to promote the use of distinctly coloured school buses. With the support of St Lukes Grammar School, Dee Why, Lindisfarne Anglican College, the Lakeside Christian College at Tweed Heads which supplied their buses, Wattyl Paints, Heckla Lights, 3M Australia and Newfema Pty Ltd which provided the materials, there are now three yellow safety buses being used to transport children to school each day. Mrs Moorhouse is hopeful of setting up a national register which would provide information to governments designed to eliminate accidents involving schoolchildren. Information sought would include the names of deceased children and all details relating to the accident. Mr Brian Evans is another person directly involved in the organisation of HOPE. Brian suffered a personal tragedy when his son was killed alighting from a school bus. Brian has campaigned vigorously for a number of Staysafe committee recommendations, such as vehicles permitted to pass school buses in either direction at a maximum of 40 kilometres per hour, buses able to run ahead of schedule without statutory control and adequate enforcement of road rules around schools and along school travel routes. Statistics do not give a true picture, because one fatality is one too many. While there has been a drop in fatalities in the nought to 16 age group over recent years, the figures show how serious the problem still is. Total pedestrian fatalities during 1996 nationally in this age group were 196; in 1997, there were 162; in 1998, there were 40; and in 1999, there were 42. These figures show a significant drop in fatalities in the age group; nevertheless, 40 or 42 schoolchildren killed on our roads is still 42 too many. With the assistance of organisations like HOPE, we aim to have a nil figure in the nought to 16 age group in the near future. I have been asked to raise this matter in federal parliament in the hope of achieving a wide national approach to prevent road fatalities of this nature. (Time expired) Paralympic Games again descend on Sydney for the 11th Paralympic Games. The Paralympic Games embodies the triumph of the human spirit over physical disability and I am proud to be part of a government that is supporting this important event in so many practical ways. As a parliamentarian for the Paralympics, it is enormously satisfying to know that Australia will be represented at the games by the strongest and best prepared Paralympic team ever. The Australian Paralympic Team 2000 is the biggest in our history, with 393 athletes qualifying to compete in all 18 sports that are on offer.

His name is Shane Walsh and he is a Paralympic swimmer from the Gold Coast. Although only 23 years old, he is truly a world-class athlete, ranked third in the world in the 50-metre freestyle, fourth in the world in the 100-metre freestyle, and sixth in the world in the 400-metre freestyle. Shane is a real medal chance when he dons the green and gold for Australia in the 50-metre and 100metre freestyle and medley relays at the end of this month. Shane Walsh is a true Paralympian, in every sense of the word. Although born with cerebral palsy, he has not let his disability interfere with his dream of representing Australiaand he has done it all on his own. He receives no sponsorship of any kind. As a quiet achiever, Shane would not ask for help and, in fact, I only found out about him after picking out his name from a lengthy list of Paralympic athletes in a recent newsletter. But, once I found Shane, I knew that his determination would inspire all Gold Coasters, and the community has not disappointed. A fortnight ago, I launched a fighting fund dubbed ‘Help Out Our Home-Grown Hero’ to ensure that Shane was given the best chance possible in Sydney. The first priority of this fund was to get Shane’s mum, Marion Walsh, to Sydney, so that she could fulfil her dream of watching her son compete in the Paralympic Games. Sadly, Shane’s mum passed away suddenly last week and will not have the chance to see Shane fulfil what he has worked so hard for. Never one to be defeated, Shane remains determined to compete at the Paralympic Games in memory of his mother. His siblings and a close family friend will now be there to give him as much support as possible and to celebrate his triumph. However, it meant an enormous amount to Marion Walsh to be given the chance to see her son compete at the Paralympic Games, something she described as ‘a dream come true’. That is a priceless gift that the Walsh family will forever be grateful for and it embodies the sense of community and warm-hearted generosity that the Gold Coast is so proud of. I would like to add my thanks to the Gold Coast community at large, particularly the residents and local businesses who have contributed to the ‘Help Out Our Home-Grown Hero’ fund. We have raised a very satisfying amount to make sure Shane has the support he needs in Sydney from family and friends when he swims for Australia. Northern Territory Electorate: Olympians and Paralympians performances and contributions of a number of Northern Territory athletes in the recently completed Sydney Olympic Games and to also highlight the contributions that will be made by Paralympians from the Northern Territory. Seven athletes from the Northern Territory competed in the recent Olympics. Three of them were medal winners. Jaime Fernandez, from Nhulunbuy, was a member of the silver medal winning men’s eight rowing team. Kerry Dienelt, of Darwin, was captain of the bronze medal winning softball team, Aussie Thunder, and is a veteran of two Olympics and a total of 153 international appearances. Stephen Holt was a member of the bronze medal winning Kookaburras-the men’s hockey team which trounced Pakistan. Kerry has since retired from the sport, I am told, and Stephen has shown his true Territorian roots by going fishing as a way to relax, now that the fuss has died down. Being an Olympian is not just about winning medals-it is about competing and participating on behalf of this country. There were five other Territorians who competed in the recent Olympics. One was Nova Peris-Kneebone from the Northern Territory, the first Territorian to win a gold medal as a member of the victorious Hockeyroos in Atlanta. She switched sports to run in the track team and anchored the 4 x 400 metres women’s relay team that broke the Australian record in their heat and made it through to the finals. She and the others are magnificent role models for Territorians and for the whole community.",104,Representatives Main Committee

Another boxer who competed was Henry Collins. Both James and Henry are from Alice Springs. Both, I imagine, will be thinking about what they will be doing over the next few months. Pistol shooter Christine Trefry-a quiet achiever with six gold medals from the Victoria, Canada, and the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games-slipped out of Alice Springs days after the Olympic opening ceremony to compete and, after competing, returned home before the closing ceremony. This morning, I was privileged to be at the lighting of the flame for the Paralympic torch relay, just in front of this building. A number of Territorians will be competing in the Paralympics. They are: Hamish MacDonald, a shot-putter and discus thrower from Alice Springs; athletes Mark Davies and Sam Rickard; swimmer David Rolfe; table tennis player Bill Medley; basketballers Melissa Dunn and Nadia Romeo; and swimmer Judith Green. These people show all Australians what it means to be part of competition. It is important that we try to win but it is also important that we set examples for our fellow Australians. Those people from the Territory who competed in the Olympics and those who are competing in the Paralympics are fine role models for us all. They are to be congratulated. Olympic Games Administration) (9.49 a.m.)-At the outset, I would like to associate myself with the comments made by my good friend and parliamentary colleague the honourable member for McPherson. In recent weeks, many Australians have made commendable contributions to the Olympics, involving the cooperation of thousands of people. The Olympics came together. We had a tremendous sense of unity of purpose from right around the nation, and we showcased ourselves to the world. We showed that we were able to have planning and infrastructure that ensured the games went like clockwork, and, as Juan Antonio Samaranch said, the Olympic Games in Sydney were the best Olympic Games ever. In the years building up to the games, there were people who doubted our capacity to be a successful Olympic host nation. Those doubts, of course, evaporated. I felt a very great sense of pride when I saw the participation of Australian athletes and when many of those athletes won a total of 58 medals-16 gold, 25 silver and 17 bronze. As a nation with fewer than 20 million people, that of itself is an outstanding effort. We were well up on the medal tally, and when we looked at those nations ahead of us they certainly had very much larger populations from which to draw their Olympic champions. We clearly had world-class training facilities. I am pleased that the Sunshine Coast was able to play an important role in Australia’s Olympic success. Obviously, the Australian women’s water polo team were outstanding. They snatched a gold medal victory in the final seconds of their match, and I was particularly pleased and proud that they trained on the Sunshine Coast. I would also like to recognise Regan Harrison of Caloundra, who was a member of the silver medal-winning men’s 4 x 100 metre swimming medley. Right across the nation we saw athletes stand up and proudly represent their country. Many were successful and many were not, but Australia was able to display itself to the world. We were able to prove the doubters were wrong and obtain the recognition and the flow-on benefits from holding what will undoubtedly be considered for many years to be the most successful games ever. I would like to salute the members of the Australian Olympic team and to wish those in our Paralympic team every success in the forthcoming games. Boromeo, Mr Paul Bendigo success story.

239,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (9.52 A.m.),"I am delighted to inform the House of a greatThursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20959 of Contemporary Art. Paul was born and raised in Bendigo and became interested in drawing at an early age. At school he always preferred art and manual subjects, and later took an art and design course at a tertiary level. After completing his course, he gained employment as a technician at the Bendigo Art Gallery. His duties included hanging and arranging other works, both local and international, as well as general handyman duties. He continued to develop his own style of drawing whilst employed at the gallery. His work was featured in Florence amongst some 500 works by painters, sculptures and print makers from 16 countries. In January this year, he was elated to be notified that he had been awarded first prize in the works on paper category. The medal of the International Biennale Exhibition of Contemporary Art awarded to him carries a portrait of Lorenzo de Medici, while some 80,000 visitors viewed his work at the Fortezza da Basso in Florence. The drawings that achieved this enormous recognition of his talent are portraits of his parents, Glenice and Bill. Paul’s work could be described as super realist. He takes dozens of photos of his subjects and then attempts to penetrate beneath the superficial external appearance to find the core of the individual and tease out the essence that is an internal expression of the character of the subjects, which can include his family, his friends, the famous and even some of the farm animals that inhabit his modest property on the outskirts of Bendigo. The work shows a breathtaking realism, using graphite on paper-Paul being probably one of the few artists using that particular method. I believe the most striking example of his work is a superb portrait of the AFL legend Tom Hafey. At first glance you would swear it was a photograph because of the detail in which Hafey was captured. This unassuming Bendigo artist has a great future and will no doubt go on to be one of Australia’s most talented artists. All of Bendigo is very proud of him. I had the pleasure of hosting a visit by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and the Arts to Bendigo recently, and the committee viewed an exhibition by this artist. All members of the committee were very impressed with his work. My own particular favourite work is a superb drawing of a chicken through a piece of chicken wire. When you look at this work, you would swear it is an actual photograph of a chicken, such is the detail. I am delighted that Paul is a good friend of mine. We often enjoy a local ale on a Friday night at the Rifle Brigade Hotel in Bendigo where Paul relaxes. As I said, this artist has got a huge future. He will undoubtedly be one of Australia’s finest as he pursues his exceptional talent. Deakin Electorate: Small Business the Leader of the Opposition and members of the Australian Labor Party about how they will help small business and make the GST fairer for small business. For small business to believe this they would have to ignore the current policy positions of the Australian Labor Party on things such as unfair dismissal and also the actions of the Bracks government in Victoria on WorkCover changes that were recently introduced. I say this because recently I conducted a survey of businesses based in the Deakin electorate with my Barresi Business Report. At the outset of my remarks, I wish to say that the responses were both informative and encouraging. I thank the numerous business owners who took the time to respond. As a local member, I keep in regular contact with Deakin’s small business owners. While a one-to-one discourse with all of them would be impossible, I appreciate the opportunity to listen to and to act on their concerns. It is often said that small and micro businesses are important for the economic suburbs, which I am proud to represent.",106,Representatives Main Committee
240,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (9.55 A.m.),"Recently we have heard various pronouncements by20960 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 Although small business people have disagreements with governments at both state and federal level, it is my assertion that the coalition government is best able to represent their views. This has been proven time and time again by the policy positions that this government has introduced since 1996, and the fact that a lot of our policy positions have been thwarted by the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate. Our political opponents, on the other hand, offer a lot of rhetoric and little, if any, understanding of the small business issues. If the recent actions of the Bracks Labor government are anything to go by, there is absolutely no chance of future positive reform. In the Business Report survey-which was well responded to by local small businessesissues of greatest importance to respondents and, by assumption, to most business owners, are those such as WorkCover premiums. Sixty-seven per cent of small businesses said WorkCover premiums was the biggest issue. Fifty per cent certainly are concerned about the business activity statement, more in terms of not knowing what the new world would look like. I share that level of apprehension, but I am sure that after the first or second business activity statement their level of concern will pass. One-third of all small businesses in my electorate are very much concerned about the unfair dismissal laws, reform of which has been thwarted by the Labor Party and the Democrats, as I said earlier, in the Senate. The Bracks government’s decision to dramatically increase WorkCover premiums is obviously a huge local issue. Many of the small businesses in my electorate are saying that the cash flow and profitability of their businesses are being affected and that, in fact, is causing them not to hire new staff. This is a tragedy when one thinks of all the good work this government has been doing to increase employment. the time for members’ statements has concluded.

242,Mr Lawler (Parkes) (9.58 A.m.),"I would like to continue briefly with a few remarksThursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20961 dire need for these precious urbanites to allay their hysteria about leaving the comfort zone of a major metropolitan city. The doctors’ shortage aside, the quality of life in regional Australia is second to none in my opinion, blissfully free of the dreaded Four Horsemen of the Metropolis: traffic snarls, pollution, overcrowding and stifling pretence. In the country you can own your home for a fraction of the price, enjoy a sense of community, be routinely greeted in the street, savour the great outdoors, be home from work before 6 p.m., breathe clean air and see the stars like never before. Six years in this type of environment hardly seems a dreadful penalty to pay. Further, let us not forget that this opportunity to use $20,000 in taxpayers’ money annually to acquire a valuable career in medicine is a voluntary one. No-one is being compelled to do anything whatsoever. These are extra places; no-one needs to be disadvantaged compared with the options that they have today. Those who choose to accept thousands upon thousands of dollars from the public purse to become a GP are being required to return something in kind to the community members who stock that purse. Critics have also decried the 12-year ban on Medicare benefits to GPs who get their qualifications under the scholarship but do not fulfil their obligation to serve outside the big cities. But the community expects some safeguards on its money, particularly when the amount will be in the vicinity of $120,000. Imagine the public outrage if money that was supposedly allocated to provide more country doctors was instead simply being spent subsidising trainee GPs to waltz into a lucrative city practice and all that goes with it. To ask the public to pay to train GPs on the off-chance that they might set up in a rural area will be less like a mutually appealing solution and more like a grossly irresponsible handout. At least the RAMA scholarships are targeted for rural students who come from rural areas and are much more likely to go back to rural areas. Put simply, the deterrent against skipping out on the scholarship deal must be seen to be sufficiently unappealing to be effective and, of course, holds no fear for those who do not intend exploiting the scholarship scheme. Having said that, those who for various reasons do not receive their Medicare number still have a variety of choices: they can work in hospitals, in industry, in research, in academia or join the armed forces, for example. Each year of a successful carer’s training in the armed forces must be matched with a year’s enlisted service with an additional year on top for good measure. So the obligation is not unlike that required for people who are trained through the armed forces. We should not allow ourselves to be distracted from what these initiatives mean to the lives of people throughout regional Australia. Imagine what it is like for those people who are ill, anxious about some aspect of their health or have sick children and cannot get a doctor’s advice. This government is seeing to it that those days become a thing of the past for the people who live outside the nation’s major cities. This is truly a reversal of the fortune of country people, because adequate health services are so intrinsically linked to the living standards and the appeal of country towns to potential newcomers looking to relocate. This government rightly views improved health services as the key to improving the prospects of towns in rural and regional Australia right across the board. Not only has the coalition identified health as the circuit-breaker to end declining regional services; in the case of rural GPs it has also now identified a realistic solution. the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000, is very important. I commend any initiative that seeks to improve the services and the quality of health in rural and regional Australia. I note that a very similar plan was proposed on 10 December 1998 by the then shadow minister for health, the member for Dobell. He advocated the introduction of a scholarship worth $20,000 per year. In return, graduates would be",108,Representatives Main Committee
243,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (10.04 A.m.),"The bill that we are discussing this morning,20962 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 required to practise in an area of need for the same number of years for which they received the scholarships. That, of course, is at the heart of the contractual agreements contained in the present bill. Unfortunately, because of the ‘tit for tat’ which takes place in politics, the current Minister for Health and Aged Care rejected that proposal as being unconstitutional. I noted in the Bills Digest that there was a question about the unconstitutionality of the proposal. I do not profess to be a lawyer, but I would hope that that is not the situation and that it does not affect the offering of scholarships, particularly in this instance. I suspect that it may affect the offering of scholarships in other professions. It may well be the case if we decided to offer similar scholarships in the areas of pharmacy, nursing, or even teaching. In the past we had a wonderful incentive program called the Commonwealth scholarship program which contained both incentives and penalties. I hope the proposal is not unconstitutional and that there is no ‘tit for tat’ involved in the issue. My good friend the member for Parkes mentioned that this is one of a raft of current proposals to support rural health. I would expect that to be the responsibility of government, whether it be a government comprised of those on this side of the House, the present government or others. When you look at the assessments of some of the programs that the member for Parkes mentioned, for instance the clinical assistantship program, which cost over $200,000 to promote in 1997-98, not one young doctor participated in it. I cannot vouch for those figures at the moment, but I suspect that it did not work as well as people anticipated. The register of medical availability attracted only 25 people, the bulk of whom are not residents or are not currently qualified to practise. The John Flynn scholarships have been in demand, but I believe there is a mismatch between where students want to go and the areas of need. These issues were raised by my colleague the member for Jagajaga yesterday. The rural surgical training program attracted only four new participants in 1999 rather than the 10 that had been planned. So we hope that the government, with its hurry-up mentality, will continue to promote these programs and do everything it can to get medical and health workers into rural and remote Australia. I think it is very important to outline the extent of the existing need. A variety of statistics are available which show that there is a great need in rural and remote Australia in terms of health services. We are talking about medical practitioners at the moment, but we all know that health and social well-being are integrated issues and that we need an integrated health care program which involves more than just medical practitioners. It should also involve nurses, psychologists, health workers, counsellors and so forth. I refer to some statistics released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare this year. Compared with the national average of 260 doctors per 100,000 population in 1998, the figure for my home state of Tasmania was 247. The figure for the Northern Territory was 262; Victoria, 258; and New South Wales, 272. The ACT and South Australia had the highest figures, with 310 and 293 respectively, while Queensland and Western Australia had 236 doctors per 100,000 population. In terms of my home state and my electorate of Braddon, which is on the beautiful north-west coast of Tasmania, which includes King Island-and I hope you all have the opportunity to visit us there, particularly those interested in health issues-I have some good news stories to tell about rural health, which is supported presently, and from way back, by Commonwealth funds. You now have an excuse to come and check some of these things. An article in the Australian Journal of Rural Health-and its title is rather apt: ‘Inequitable Distribution of General Practitioners in Australia’-showed that there is a great need for more rural GPs in my home region of Mersey-Lisle. For instance, in the Mersey-Lisle region, there is a full-time doctor for every 1,300 people. In Circular Head, to the far north-west of my Thursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20963 electorate, with a population base of around 8,000 people, there should be at least five, and probably, ideally, six, doctors. At present, there are three. In addition, I am informed that the Smithton Hospital has eight full-time equivalent nursing staff vacancies which are proving very difficult to fill. That is not unique to Tasmania-and I do not wish to make it sound as though there is a massive crisis. For instance, I have read with interest in newspapers throughout the mainland that there are nursing shortages. We know that is going on because we now have state after state trying to attract nurses with greater dollars, greater incentives and so forth. What it is really saying is that it is a bit like some of the other professions-maybe teaching-where we are saying, ‘It’s tough going these days. It’s a tough job. It’s very rewarding but it’s a tough job.’ The numbers are not there; the incentives are not there, perhaps, and we have got to do everything we can to get them. I notice that in my electorate there is a difficulty in getting a sufficient number of nurses for our hospitals, so we have got to work hard at that. I note, however, that here in the ACT there is a full-time doctor for every 870 people. This can be compared with the state average in my own state of a full-time GP for every 941 people. I suppose that if I am sick on the job I will have a greater chance of seeing a GP here than I will at Smithton-but that is no reflection on the quality of care that I would receive in Smithton. The Bills Digest points out-and I think this is very significant: In 1998, 60 per cent of general practitioner trainees elected to work in capital cities compared to 31 per cent in rural and regional areas. The turnover of general practitioners in rural areas is also greaternot surprisinglyThese trends might be attributed to a number of thingsthe digest goes on to argueincluding the facts that the average number of hours worked by rural practitioners is higher, the proportion of general practitioners on call is lower, and the number of hours on call is higher in rural areas, and there is a higher proportion of small practices in rural areas (with corresponding low profitability). It is important that we state this because, in terms of the scholarship scheme-which I will arrive at-it is not just a question of financial incentives attracting people to rural and remote areas to practise a great profession; it is a widespread social fabric issue and the attraction of wanting to live there. So money incentives, in terms of training and having a position when you leave that training, are important, but it is also where you live. We are, after all, people before we are doctors, and we are people before we are politicians-I hope. The digest goes on to say: Other major factors for physicians’ choicesI am sorry if it seems like I am plagiarising this, but it is very well put and it is put much better than I couldagainst rural practice will include personal background, family and spousal considerationswhich are absolutely crucialprofessional education/support/practice factors, and community factors. I think the professional education, support and practice factors really are a major key in supporting people in rural practice. That is something I would like to talk about in Tasmania in particular. In terms of the bonded scholarship scheme, many comments have been made on both sides. It is tit for tat about who thought of it first and so forth but the point is that, if you are interested in practising in regional or rural Australia and your heart is set on being a medical practitioner, you would rub your hands together and say, ‘Terrific. This is something that is 20964 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 going to help me fulfil that dream.’ Evidence would suggest that those people most attracted to this idea would not be in it for the loot, because practising in rural Australia is not just in the clinical office; it is where you live, who you live with and how you live. Evidence would suggest that growing up in a rural community and experiencing rural health care as a student are the greatest attraction for people to go into rural health practice and, in particular, to be medical practitioners there. I note that the AMA have said that we have a crisis in rural health in Australia, and they make their points in their various extracts on it. But the one thing that comes out about the bonded scholarship scheme is that perhaps-and I think the word ‘draconian’ was used-it could do with a little bit more flexibility instilled in it. It should be given the old flexibility syringe, so to speak. Maybe those details are a little clearer in the contractual arrangements that people go into. I do not know what they are. I think they have just been released and, unfortunately, maybe I am remiss for not knowing all the details. But I think the common theme that is coming through-even though those on the other side do not say it outright, because they are supporting this measure-is that we need to look at the flexibility of it. Sure, there are occasions when we take into account certain circumstances where people, for whatever reason it may be, are unable to fulfil the continuous side of their obligation. I do not know what happens when people, for various reasons such as maternity or paternity reasons, are unable to fulfil the continuous side of their business. Maybe we should look at some flexibility. I note that we have an amendment to make to this bill. I would ask all those on the other side to look at it fairly and squarely. If we can come to an arrangement where we have that flexibility, I think that will be terrific because, after all, we are talking about providing a service to rural and regional Australia. SoI hope we will be able to do that. The questions of unconstitutionality and so forth will be dealt with. WhatI would like to do is relate to you some of the positive things that are occurring in Tasmania, particularly in relation to the partnership that has been developed between the Tasmanian Department of Health and Family Services and the University of Tasmania with its Department of Rural Health, which was set up in 1997 under the terrific leadership of Judy Walker. I hope those people involved in health, if they have not already met Judy, will meet her in the future. She is a most enthusiastic, effusive, dedicated person. She is dedicated to rural health, and she comes from Penguin, which is in my electorate. I had the privilege and pleasure of teaching her son, who was just as enthusiastic and effusive. The Tasmanian departments have set up this terrific partnership, in essence effectively creating teaching centres throughout Tasmania. So rather than concentrating on one centre, they have a series of them. I think she is looking at the grand plan of 10 or 15. Two of them are already in my electorate-one at Burnie and one at Smithton, which I mentioned earlier. The idea of those teaching centres is to do perhaps three things. The first is to provide support for people in rural practice. I reckon if I was in rural practice that would be fantastic. There would be that incentive for me to say I feel supported collegially and I feel supported in terms of professional development and ongoing training. The actual facility itself and the technology that can go with that facility would be helpful as well. Allied to these are telehealth centres-these telehealth provisions with technology-so I can get collegial support literally down the line. I reckon that would be fantastic and it must be a very positive program. The second thing is to support other health care workers. When you support other people, you generally create this network of collegiality, which means that you talk. In sitting down and talking as professionals, you start to develop an integrated health plan for your region. It comes from the ground up. That is working pretty well, and I think that is a terrific thing. Thursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20965 The third thing is to provide a base for young people who are going through medical studies-whatever aspect of health studies it may be-to actually come out to a region, to a centre, and receive training and, at the same time, be able to move out and network in that community. I think that is a terrific idea. If we are talking about putting funds and moneys into rural health then this scheme is to be applauded. We must continue it and expand it, because I think all indications are that it is working pretty well. WhatI found interesting is a program that lets students become involved in rural health projects. So you can see the city slickers making their way into these rural health and training centres, moving up there amongst some of their country cousins who come down to the universities. And isn’t it interesting how the country people start to radiate when they get back home? The city slickers start to say, ‘What is going on here? This is a healthy looking lifestyle we have around here. They seem to be having fun. They do not need to be down at the pub every day enjoying themselves at the uni bar and so forth.’ It is interesting that 20 of these projects have been completed by this rural health scheme. Young trainees come in, form a group and start to work out a health aim for the region. They work on a project, and then they are actually let loose on the community. One of the great things about that is that, no matter how naive or enthusiastic you are, there is nothing better than young people moving amongst the community and the community asking what they are doing there and being told that they are actually there working with the community to help them. I think that is terrific. We will help them, because that is the country way. The trainees have done some terrific projects, and I would like to mention three. They did an emergency care project on the actual outcomes for people with head injuries sustained in road accidents in rural areas. They did a major study of that and tried to work out for the emergency services and the government departments involved if there were any things they could recommend from their study that might assist in the treatment and the avoidance of head injuries in rural areas. It was very interesting. If the trainees came away with anything, it would be to say, ‘I have been out in the rural areas. I did not know this side of life, and I do not mind it.’ What better way to get the taste than to do that? They did an occupational health and safety project-and I am raising these projects because they are relevant to my electorate; that is where they were-on the timber industry. How many people in general practice or seeking to be in general practice would know anything about the timber industry if they did not come from that area? Yet you can get a terrific interest in that type of thing. They made some very sensible recommendations to that business which employed 150 people in my electorate. The recommendations were taken on board and improved that situation. The other project was on assessing rural teenagers’ understanding of conception and contraception. No doubt that would have been an interesting survey on its own. Of course rural people need assistance in that area, just like city slickers, and no doubt that was an important program. I do not mean to trivialise it. WhatI am saying is that these are really positive, integrated health programs for trainees who go out into rural Australia. I think these bonded scholarships will assist that, as long as we get the injection of flexibility. I would ask the government to take on board our amendments in this important area, as proposed by our shadow minister. support of the government’s initiatives in relation to this matter and, indeed, in relation to other matters. I thank him for his dissertation to the House on issues that face his constituents in the island state of Tasmania. I suspect they are not entirely different from the problems faced by the constituents of the honourable member for Page, who is sitting beside me, or by my constituents in the electorate of Ballarat.",109,Representatives Main Committee
244,Mr Ronaldson (Ballarat) (10.24 A.m.),"I thank the member for Braddon for his20966 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 The honourable member for Page told me that almost 1,000 people have already expressed interest in the bonded scholarship scheme. I think that is a fair indication of the strong level of commitment from those who want to practise medicine, those who represent regional and rural electorates and from the government to addressing an issue that is significant for many Australians. I do not use the expression ‘in the bush’-although I know that there are some in Queensland, and perhaps in New South Wales, who do not mind that term. I prefer to use the expression ‘country Australia’ or ‘country Victoria’. prefer the word ‘country’ whereas I know that the constituents of some honourable members from Queensland do not mind using the word ‘bush’. Whatever the term-irrespective of how we describe the area-the problem remains the same. This is not only a health issue but a regional development issue regarding access to appropriate GP medical, health and allied services. The fundamental point is that in 2000 all Australians should be able to expect to gain access to reasonable health services. No-one is suggesting that people should have access to a heart specialist within 10 minutes. That is obviously simply not feasible-although some of the measures that we have introduced, and to which I will refer later, will certainly reduce the distance between country people and specialist practitioners. I do not think it is unreasonable for anyone to expect to have easy and quick access to a general practitioner. Yet that has not been-and is still not-a reality for many Australians. The most basic of health services is access to a general practitioner. I noted the contribution of the honourable member for Bradfield. He has an intimate knowledge of this area: he was a practising doctor and head of the AMA and, while in that role, spoke to many of his country colleagues. He outlined some of the more challenging aspects of rural practice. I guess that we were all amused to hear the tale about rural GPs being called out in the middle of the night to see a cow because the farmer claimed that it was cheaper to get a GP than a vet. I assume that that story is true; I have no reason to believe that it is not. While it is amusing, the background to that story is not at all funny for two reasons: first, because it is cheaper to employ the services of a GP than a vet; and, secondly, because the poor GP is being used in the role of a vet. However, that is the life of a country GP: the expectations are enormous. It is a bit like the poor country copper who is expected to play a variety of roles. The country GP is not just a deliverer of medicine and advice but a pivotal part of the community. I know that the honourable member for Braddon-the honourable member for McEwen has now joined us also-is acutely aware of the fact that, if a town can say it has a GP, a great multitude of things will flow from that. This will probably be news to those from the city who read this speech, but regional development is as much about the variety of services offered as about one particular service. It is about things such as having access to a general practitioner. If a family is making a choice about whether to move out of the city to the country, the first question they ask-I ask the honourable member for McEwen, who is a very fine member, to confirm this-is whether medical services are available. Fran Bailey-Absolutely. It underpins small towns. what is happening from a communications point of view. We are seeing quite dramatic increases in the access of country people to the telecommunications advantages that our city cousins have been enjoying for a long time. The Networking the Nation program that the government introduced has been of great assistance with that. We are now seeing access to telecommunications. As honourable members have heard me say before, it should not matter",113,Representatives Main Committee
245,Mr Causley,Because of the size of the state.,114,Representatives Main Committee
246,Mr Ronaldson,I suspect that probably has something to do with it. My constituents,114,Representatives Main Committee
247,Mr Ronaldson,"It does-it totally underpins them. Look at health in the context ofThursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20967 whether you live in Avoca, Ayers Rock or Ashburton-which is a suburb of Melbourne-you should have the ability to access state-of-the-art communications, telecommunications and information technology. We are finally getting some advantages and taking some steps forward and we are narrowing the gap in relation to that access. But that will be meaningless in a regional development sense if we are not able to have those basic health services. If we get the two of them together, we are going to see some very serious growth in country Australia. We will get to the stage in this country where, no matter where you live, you can conduct a business; where you can conduct your business wherever you live in regional Australia not constrained by the cost of telecommunications or by lack of access to telecommunications and information technology. As the honourable member for McEwen said before, if we can underpin that with basic health services we are going to kick some very significant goals. The carrot and the stick have been needed to encourage those health services. We are talking very much about carrots today-about these bonded scholarships and a variety of other areas. The regional health strategy was announced in this year’s budget, with $562 million over four years, and it is amazing the impact that has had on country Australians. The significance of the message coming out of Canberra with that was that it was absolutely pivotal to their belief that Canberra actually cares about what happens outside Canberra and what happens in regional Australia. That is not talking in a party political sense. That is talking about a fact of life, that, irrespective of which party it is, there is a very general view that there is a significant lack of understanding of what the real issues are in country Australia. There is an assumption that you can ring up and in 15 minutes a doctor who is on call will be at your home, which is a service provided to metropolitan people. It is simply not there in country Australia. Many country Australians do not have that. That is why that package was so important, because it provided a number of bases for change. It can be broken up into the variety of packages: the strengthening of the rural health professional work force, $102 million to increase the number of GPs in regional Australia, $48.4 million for greater specialist access, $50 million to increase allied health services, $10 million towards supporting GPs who are starting out in a rural career, the establishment of new university departments of rural health, additional funds for the Rural Australian Medical Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme, medical graduates having the opportunity to work off their HECS debt, and the $32.4 million regional health strategy scholarship program that we were talking about before. These are huge changes and of course they have been welcomed, I am pleased to say, by my honourable colleague opposite, the member for Braddon, because they are significant changes. It is not just putting one finger into a 10-hole dyke, because that has never worked, and it certainly cannot work in relation to rural health. It is actually about putting 10 fingers into 10 significant holes that have been sapping the energy out of rural Australia for a long time. It is about putting in place a variety of packages that, although they are stand-alone, are part of the overall picture about where change can be made in the overall service that is provided. And it is about allowing and encouraging specialist health services to go out of those major centres into smaller centres. It is not about having a brain surgeon in every town. None of us expect to have a brain surgeon in every town in Australia. That is not going to happen-we are realists. But we also believe that it is appropriate for a brain surgeon to be visiting country areas at various times. This budget put $10 million into radiotherapy services in Ballarat, Bendigo and Gippsland to stop that appalling sight-I get very upset about this-of people vomiting on the side of the road when they are returning from Geelong or Melbourne to Hamilton, Horsham or Stawell or somewhere because they could not have access to radiotherapy services in country Victoria. It 20968 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 is an absolute disgrace that in the year 2000 that is happening. Fortunately, those services will be up and running, I hope, by early next year. No, we are not putting a radiotherapy service into Ouyen-it is not in my electorate, of course; it is in the member for Mallee’s electorate-and we cannot put a radiotherapy service into every small town in Australia either. But we can certainly put those sorts of services into those larger regional towns where (a) it is a lot easier to get to and (b) you will have country people staying in a country town. It is a big deal for someone from country Australia to have to go to Melbourne or Sydney for three, four, five, six, seven or eight weeks or three months while a member of their family is having treatment. It is a big deal: they are uncomfortable; they often do not have that family network in those metropolitan areas. It is a lot easier for them to go to regional centres where they are going to be a lot more comfortable, for starters, and there is a far better chance they will have some support there as well. These budget changes and this legislation are about addressing something that is of enormous concern, not just to my constituents but to country people right throughout Australia. We are not asking for everything, but I think we deserve some basic access to health services and I very much support this bill. Ms GERICK (Canning) (10.39 a.m.)-I am pleased today to be able to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000. If it is properly implemented, this bill is going to ensure improved medical access for many rural Australians. Like many members, I have a large rural component in my seat. TodayI want to talk about two issues in particular. The first one is that there is a village, Serpentine, about 20 minutes drive from Perth, from my electorate-if you go from the city, it is an hour’s drive. Serpentine are very fortunate in that they are classified as both rural and city depending on what government service they are about not to get! If it is a medical service, they come under the metropolitan city board, which means that they have been struggling to get a doctor now for a number of years and cannot do so. When they approached the federal government they were told it was a state issue; when they approached the state government, they were told, ‘Oh no, you are close to metropolitan services. It is not our place to provide a doctor for you.’ So they went to their local council and the local council, quite fairly, said: ‘Well, we can’t provide the infrastructure for a doctor to come. We have a doctor who wants to come to Serpentine, but we can’t do that; it is not part of our role.’ So we still do not have a doctor in Serpentine. The population in Serpentine is about 2,000. The primary school is full. But Serpentine falls into that category now where it has a lot of older citizens and a lot of kids-two of the groups that need lots of medical services or the potential to need them. As I have already said, there is no doctor in Serpentine. One of the community groups in Armadale, which is 20 minutes drive away-the Armadale Home Help-provides a bus once a week to try and help the Serpentine people, because obviously there is no public transport: when it comes to public transport, Serpentine moves back to the rural component! This means that, if you do not have car, you do not get to go anywhere-you have to rely on your neighbours or the Armadale Home Help group. Those home help groups are facing a lot of problems, because legislation has just gone through in WA which means that volunteer drivers have to pay to get a special licence. So there is a lot of pressure on getting enough volunteer drivers. It seems that it doesn’t matter what the rural communities try to do, there is no way that they can get that little bit ahead. The other area that is struggling somewhat is the town of Pinjarra, which is about 1½ hours drive from the city. They have a hospital, but it has been continuously downgraded. The justification of the state government has been, ‘Well, if you drive to Mandurah’,-which is a further 20-minute drive-‘you have access to a full hospital.’ But the problem is that the Thursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20969 South West Highway runs through my electorate and it is, sadly, one of the roads that has the most fatalities in WA-we have lots of road crashes. The emergency services at Murray Hospital have been downgraded, which means that if you have an accident you have to be taken on a further 20-minute drive. We all know that, if you have been in a car accident or any sort of accident, the quicker you get the treatment, the better chance you have of survival and of minimising your injuries. We also have a number of mine sites in my electorate and, unfortunately, mine sites often have accidents as well. So we have been arguing strongly that we need those emergency services. The Shire of Murray does not have the moving backwards and forwards between metropolitan and rural-almost everyone agrees that that is a rural area. But the argument is kept up: ‘Well, you’re really close to the city, so you should be able to manage.’ Just keep hanging in there while they keep downgrading our services. A lot of people nowadays want to make that lifestyle choice though: they want to be able to move to Serpentine, Jarrahdale or Pinjarra, which are beautiful communities. But, as previous speakers have said, if you are going to move, you want to make sure that there is a school for your kids to go to, you want to make sure that there is a doctor that you can get to, that there is a hospital within a reasonable distance, that, if there is an accident, you are going to be able to get the care you need. Hopefully, the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 is going to move some way towards making sure we get those services. If we can get families moving back into these areas, we all know that that is going to be the lifeblood of regional Australia. Regional Australia has been through a really rough time. Those who have lived in the country-I spent the first 12 years of my life in the ‘real outback’, as we called it, not just rural areas-know that if the bank closes you lose the bank manager and a clerk, if the school downgrades you lose a teacher; every person is vital to that community. If we are going to build communities, which is what we all should be about, we should be making sure that the basic services are there. I encourage the government to make sure that they carry through on their promises. There is not much consolation in the short term for the people of Serpentine. We just have to keep fighting and hope that doctors are going to spend the money of their own free will and move down there-but we have to be able to make sure that we can. The other problem that we face in WA is that we have the rather worrying distinction of having had the highest number of medical practices bought out by corporate bodies in Australia last year. The problem is that-as we are faced with frequently-if you are a private enterprise, your sole purpose is to make money, otherwise you would not be tempted into private enterprise. If you move into a rural community, you are not going to have the means to make lots of money. Therefore, those medical bodies are making the obvious choice not to move into regional Australia. That is another area that we need to have a look at and see what incentives we can give for doctors to move out there. I know that a scheme is operating in WA-and, I assume, nationally-where we are giving scholarships to kids from rural areas to get into medical school. One young lad in Pinjarra missed out by one mark on getting into med school last year. The local doctor put in a plea and said, ‘This kid has grown up in Pinjarra. He will go off and do his med training and he will come back and live here.’ And they said, ‘Pinjarra is only an hour and a half from the city-it is not worth considering.’ You get that situation of a kid missing out by one mark, even though he is committed to the country people, he is obviously smart and he has the skills. If we are going to have these schemes, perhaps they should not be quite so arbitrary whereby they decide that one mark or five marks is going to be the cut-off point. Those of us who have lived a country lifestyle know that it is a great lifestyle, and there is always the temptation that you are going to want to go back to it. So we should be 20970 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 encouraging young people to go to the city and get their training and then come back to the country, because there is nothing sadder than seeing your country town die because young people have to move away because there are such limited opportunities there for them. Again, that is an area we need to look at to make sure that people are getting what they need. From personal experience, I know how awful it is when a member of your family has to move away to get treatment for cancer. We went through that when I was fairly young, with my father needing to go away for six months on and off because there was no radiology centre in Geraldton, where I spent my teen years. We need to make sure that, when families go through this trauma-and quite often there is not a happy outcome-they have the support they need and that they can stay together while they are going through that treatment process. Anything we can do to get the treatment centres to regional areas and to make sure that there are support systems there, so that whole families-or as much of the family as possible-can be together, will certainly be a great improvement. It can also happen in cities. Until recently, children on dialysis who lived in Armadale had to catch the train into Royal Perth Hospital, which is about a 25or 30-minute train ride, so that they could get treatment. We managed to get a dialysis machine, because-by coincidence-the Premier was on a train coming out to a function and he met a woman taking her child in for dialysis. Until then, there had been no realisation that there was no dialysis machine in my electorate. We now have one, so a certain amount of pressure has been removed. If we are going to get doctors into country areas, we all know that they are going to need some sort of support and encouragement because, if you live in a country area, you do not just do your job. We all know that it is a much greater commitment and is part of your life. The average number of hours worked by a country GP are going to be higher. They are going to spend more time on call because they cannot share it. The doctor in the Shire of Murray has not had a holiday for over 18 months because he cannot get anyone to come down and be a locum for him. Doctors can suffer burnout. There is a realisation that, at the end of the day, if you move to the city, you are probably going to make a lot more money, and everybody has to make those considerations as well. I support the government in its goals. I encourage it to work hard to achieve them because, certainly in my electorate of Canning, we need more doctors and we would like them as soon as possible. to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 today, and I thank the previous speaker, the member for Canning, for her support for the bill. It is certainly something that has been generally widely welcomed across the Australian rural community. The question of doctors in rural areas has been one that has been very close to my heart. AlthoughI represent Australia’s largest tropical city-in fact, the twin cities of Townsville and Thuringowa, where we have good medical facilities-it is not too far outside of Townsville and Thuringowa that the problems began to show. All those towns out along the Barkly Highway-starting with Charters Towers and moving to Hughenden, Richmond, Julia Creek, Cloncurry and so on-have had problems in attracting and keeping doctors. In the gulf area-the Mornington Islands, Currumbin, Normanton, Millaa Millaa, Malanda, Atherton and right across rural areas in northern Australia-there have been significant problems in attracting doctors to practise. There has been some opposition to this particular legislation from medicos. I have had some representation from medicos, and I acknowledge that. They are opposed to the bonded nature of these particular positions that are provided for in this bill. They are opposed as a matter of principle. I guess they see that an Australian government-of whatever colourdown the track may make further decisions about bonding or directing doctors",114,Representatives Main Committee
248,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (10.49 A.m.),"I would like to thank the House for the opportunityThursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20971 wn the track may make further decisions about bonding or directing doctors where they shall or shall not practise. But that is not what this bill is about. Doctors are free to go where they choose, but if they choose to take up these bonded scholarships when they are young people-or indeed older people-entering medical school, then so be it; it is a free choice. Because it is a free choice-it is not something that is universally applied across the medical profession-I do not think that the current opposition from the Australian Medical Association does have a valid basis in fact. This bill is certainly of interest to me as well in relation to the impact it will have on James Cook University in my electorate. James Cook University has Australia’s newest medical school, and it has been a quantum leap forward for James Cook in obtaining that. Part of the government’s strategy in allowing the medical school to be established and to fund a medical school at James Cook was the underlying strategy that we see in this bill today: to get building blocks that produce more doctors in rural and regional Australia-and that is a good outcome. In addressing these sorts of things, the philosophy at the James Cook medical school was that doctors trained locally would stay locally and there is a body of evidence that indicates that that actually happens. Incidentally, you will be interested to know that when the James Cook medical school started this year there were 60 places available and, without advertising, the university got over 800 applications for the places. You will also be interested to know that it is an undergraduate school, and that has been widely applauded by the kinds of people that the university wants to attract. Entry is not by what your OP score is; it is not by your academic merit. The university has sought to take people into the course who would make good doctors, and a person who happens to be a fantastic academic does not necessarily make the best doctor. I think we all have had experience with that. So entry was by interview; the 60 places were chosen and filled by a very rigorous interview process, which has developed a very good student body. More than that, there were some places reserved for indigenous students-and what a wonderful outcome, because that is getting indigenous doctors right into the areas where they truly are desperately needed. I think there are about five places reserved for indigenous doctors. The particular students have been outstanding. When they graduate, they will be a great asset to the indigenous people of Australia, particularly those who are in remote areas of Australia-and this initiative is all coming through the new medical school at James Cook University. The scheme that we are considering today encourages students to go into regional Australia and to take up the bonded scholarships. I think that there has been an overwhelming response to the 100 positions that are available. Incidentally-I do not know whether this is public or not-it is very likely, I believe, that James Cook University will get 10 of those positions; I am certainly hoping that that will be the case. I would like to have seen more. I put in a bid for 20 but I think that fell a bit on deaf ears-but you can always try and stand up for your electorate. I think that is the role of all of us who are members in this place. This scheme provides-and I am pleased to see it-the financial support and the ability for those who meet the criteria to embark on a career in medicine. As a return of service, basically, for having that support provided, they will be asked to work in regional and rural Australia. I think that that is a small price to pay for a lifelong career. When a student accepts a bonded scholarship, they will need to enter into a contract with the Commonwealth government. They will be entitled to $20,000 per annum for each year of the medical course, the time frame depending on whether they are on graduate or undergraduate entry. There are some penalties, of course, and so there should be if students do not meet their obligations. Again, the medical profession has said that they are pretty draconian, but I think it has been explained very carefully that we cannot have a situation where students take advantage of this 20972 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 scheme and then do not meet their obligations. Even if, for some reason or other, they cannot meet their obligations, the scheme is not all that draconian because they can still practise in the public hospital system and in other areas-so it is not a matter of these penalties taking away the future job prospects of students who go through the scheme. The scheme allows for, and expects, these new doctors to work in rural areas for six continuous years. Often, when doctors work out in rural areas for that time, they get accustomed to the area and they become part of the community. But a concern that I do have-and it was articulated by the previous speaker-is in relation to burnout. Often these single-practice doctors have an enormous workload and work the hours, dare I say, of members of the federal parliament and are on call all of the time. It may well be that burnout is a factor in how many years people continue to work in rural areas. Dr Wooldridge is to be complimented for introducing this scheme because it certainly does address a very definite need in rural Australia. We are going to deliver the much needed medical practitioners to rural areas and I think that people in rural Australia will certainly be pleased to see this. It is a win-win outcome for Australia, and it is a win-win situation for the majority of scholars who will fulfil their bonds and work in the rural areas. It is a much needed service to rural Australia. I am certainly strongly supporting this. I wanted to speak on this legislation because it certainly does have an impact in my part of the country and it is very pleasing to have the opportunity to be able to support it. I am also very pleased to see that this is non-controversial legislation which is being supported by both sides of the parliament. A little bit more of that would go a long way in making this great country even greater. Australia is widely recognised. In this year’s budget the federal government unveiled a $562 million regional health strategy, which represents the largest effort by an Australian government to address the historic imbalance between rural and city health. One of the key features in this package was funding to further the training and educational needs of doctors and medical graduates. In total, about $162 million will be spent on a range of medical training and education initiatives. More than $32 million will be spent on 100 new scholarship places, each of $20,000 per annum, to new medical students to undertake their training in return for a commitment to undertake a minimum of six years postgraduate work in country areas. The scheme is known as the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme, and many of my colleagues have referred to it yesterday and today. This bill sets up the legislative backdrop against which these scholarships will be introduced. It amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to enable the Commonwealth to restrict access to Medicare benefits for medical practitioners who breach a contract with the Commonwealth to work in rural and remote areas. In essence, the bill will be used to enforce the contracts of medical practitioners participating in the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme. The scheme will deliver an extra 100 doctors annually to work in rural communities for a six-year period once the first group of students complete their fellowship training. Under the provisions of the bill, the provider number of bonded scholars will be restricted to rural areas for the period of their six years of rural work. Those who break their bond will have to endure a 12-year ban on receiving their Medicare provider number and will be required to repay the scholarship funding with interest. I listened to some of my opposition colleagues yesterday bleating about some of these provisions. We know that there is a tragic shortage of doctors in rural areas. We heard some of them say that the opposition itself proposed a similar scheme in 1998. Then they started to bleat about how draconian these laws were. But let me put this to you: if you get $20,000 a year for six years the total is $120,000more than the state lottery. If you get that sort of money you should be required to undertake",118,Representatives Mainwhere They Committee
249,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.00 A.m.),"The need for more doctors in regional and ruralThursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20973 certain obligations. Do we know of any other country in the world that would be silly enough to put that investment into a student and then at the end of the day say, ‘So you do not want to go to the country; you can go back to Sydney’? Of course we do not. Universities will select the scholarship holders through the normal admission processes so that students will have to apply for the medical rural bonded scholarships through the normal admissions process. These scholarships are in addition to another initiative the government has introduced this year, the Rural Australia Medical Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme. Australia currently enrolled in a medical course. Funds are payable annually to assist scholarship holders with ongoing accommodation, travel and living expenses during the period of study. RMS is another component of the government’s strategy to boost the number of GPs in the bush and improve access to health services for regional and rural communities. It is about giving country students access to the same opportunities as city students to pursue medical careers. That is not just some mumbo jumbo from the government. There are figures that demonstrate very clearly that we are not getting the same proportion of medical students from country areas. I was recently advised that a former Bundaberg student, Tyson Reeve, has been successful in obtaining one of these RMS scholarships, and I would like to congratulate him on his achievement. It is heartening to know that these schemes are benefiting country students and it will be good to hear the feedback at the local level. Almost 400 students a year will benefit from RMS, and when you add to that the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme, you have 500 students a year receiving assistance for their education. I think that is very generous. As these people flow through the six-year system, there will be quite a marked impact in regional and rural areas. In my electorate, Bundaberg and surrounding rural communities suffer from a shortage of general practitioners. Bundaberg is certainly not the end of the earth. Bundaberg is quite a beautiful city, with beautiful facilities and a population of 45,000 people, yet we are seeing a shortage of doctors in a community like that. At the other end of my electorate, in Gladstone, which has a population of nearly 30,000 people, there is a similar problem. It is important not only for the government but also for the medical profession itself that we address this issue. In that regard I would like to take the opportunity to praise the Bundaberg Division of General Practice, which has identified the challenge of attracting and maintaining an adequate practitioner work force as its top priority. I recently attended a meeting with the division and other stakeholders and local government officials to examine these issues. Within the Bundaberg division-which includes the city of Bundaberg and the shires of Burnett, Isis, Miriam Vale, Kolan and Mount Perry-the total GP population is a ratio of one GP to every 1,292 people. In total, there are 22 practices with 70 general practitioners in this wider area. These are concentrated mainly in the city of Bundaberg. There are very few doctors working outside the city. The division states that the ideal GP work force for the region would be to increase the current levels by 12 GPs. If in a city the size of Bundaberg you need another 12 GPs, just imagine how difficult it is in a country town, and it is more difficult again in a rural or remote area. Some of the identified recommendations of the Bundaberg Division of General Practice include developing linkages with local stakeholders-such as councils, employers and government departments-and developing recruiting strategies such as links with universities. I do not think we do quite enough of this. We just take it for granted that these links will occur. There needs to be an active participation from the community to the medical community and from them to the universities to try to concentrate on attracting students. We should be bold enough too to forget state boundaries. 20974 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 This problem is all about getting people to adopt a country lifestyle. I do not know for the life of me why it is that so few young people want to serve in regional and rural areas. I heard some of the opposition say yesterday that it is because people from the capital cities marry these students and they therefore find it easier to make their lifestyle in a capital city. I have heard others say that the problem is the remoteness-for example, the doctors are unable to get upgrades in medical practice and are not able to get to seminars and workshops and the like-and others say that it is because they have no relief. There is an element of truth in all those. Doctors in rural areas tell me the thing they want most is to be able to get relief. Sometimes it is as little as one weekend a month, where they know that for three or four days they do not have any demands. They need to know that they are not going to be rung up in the middle of the night on their day off to come in and deliver a baby or something like that. They do not mind working 28 or 29 days straight, but at the end of that time they need a break. They want to know if they want to upgrade their skills in some form of radiology or obstetrics or something like that that they can get to a workshop or an in-school training facility and have someone cover them in their practices. In some of these country towns, they are the only doctors for 50 and 60 kilometres around. The Bundaberg Division of General Practice has initiated a scheme which will start in February next year where specialists at the local base hospital will train GPs through 20-week clinics funded by the National Health Development Fund. The GPs will receive training in such areas as dermatology, orthopaedics, emergencies, paediatrics, obstetrics, gynaecology and general medicine. The initiative is not about getting GPs to become specialists but to increase the skills of local GPs and to ensure they have a better understanding of the hospital system, the overall health scheme and the skills that they might be called on to use in emergency situations in country towns. The government has moved in a similar direction in terms of linking stakeholders to the announcement that the delivery of education and training for GPs will move towards a regionalised approach over the next 18 months to be overseen by the new Board of General Practice Education and Training. Regionalisation of the delivery of training and making it more contestable will provide a range of key players, with the opportunity to be involved in the development and delivery of vocational training to the medical and associated professions. This draws together the key stakeholders, including the Division of General Practice, new clinical schools being established by the government in regional areas and university departments of rural health. This government has also established the James Cook University Medical School at Townsville at a cost of $10 million and the University of New South Wales Clinical School at Wagga Wagga at a cost of $13.2 million. In addition to this, $117.6 million will be spent establishing nine more clinical schools in rural and regional Australia as well as three new university departments of rural health. That means that for the first time in Australia we will have a rurally focused network of training and positioning of students. On top of these initiatives aimed at improving general practice education and training, the government’s regional health strategy will allocate $185 million over four years to provide restructured and more flexible services to support GPs and respond to local community needs. The Regional Health Services Program will expand and 85 new services will be established. This program has been very successful in establishing and maintaining practical, high quality health services like child care, aged care and mental health services in around 100 communities throughout Australia. By 2003, it is expected that there will be more than 250 of these programs. An example of an area that has already benefited from the work of this program and, indeed, that of the Bundaberg Division of General Practice is the Agnes Water community in Thursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20975 Queensland in my electorate. The government is currently funding, as a first step in this process, a health and aged care needs analysis. Agnes Water is part of the Miriam Vale Shire and that is the fastest growing shire in Queensland. Not only has it grown in terms of the population of residents; it also has a burgeoning tourist industry. It is relatively isolated in terms of health services, with the nearest hospitals about 90 minutes away in Bundaberg and Gladstone. It is an interesting point that a person 100 kilometres west of Longreach is actually closer to medical services than someone in Agnes Water who is an hour and a half from either Bundaberg or Gladstone. We think sometimes of remoteness as being west of the Great Dividing Range, but often remoteness can be in a coastal environment. Another important part of this regional health strategy has been the strengthening and supporting of the regional health professional work force with incentives for specialists, funding to increase allied health services like podiatry, physiotherapy and other forms of assistance and to try to get those into country areas. Under the RMS scheme and under the new scholarship scheme, we have 500 places. If you look at the new university campuses at Townsville and Wagga, the nine new clinical schools and the 250 areas of Australia that will be covered for the first time by the Regional Health Services Program, you start to see a fabric of putting things back into regional and rural areas. We are not going to see the real benefits of this for another five or six years, but the foundation has been laid very thoroughly. We will have these new graduates, some of them bonded under the first scheme and some of them coming under the RMS scheme. Some of them will have done their training in places like Townsville or Wagga, found that they liked the rural or regional lifestyle, and decided to marry people and stay in those areas. If we give these young doctors support through ancillary services, so that they know that psychologists, podiatrists, physiotherapists and all the other associated health workers will come through periodically, and if we put that whole fabric together, we will start to genuinely address the problem of regional health. The bill that we are considering today is an integral part of that process. I therefore commend it to the chamber. Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000, which gives effect to a major budget initiative, can be traced back to the highly successful regional and rural summit in October last year. In fact, it could be said that the significant boost in the number of medical practitioners has been a major priority for the coalition since it came to office in 1996. Certainly, within my party, the National Party, the desperate need has been spelt out for a very long time. In early February this year, the Prime Minister undertook his listening and learning tour of regional areas. Certainly, the need for improved medical services in these areas was conveyed to him. His promise that there would be no further erosion of these services pointed the way to a major initiative. The Chairperson of the National Rural Health Alliance, Dr Steve Clark, in a media statement dated 6 February, acknowledged that progress was being made. He said: It has been an encouraging four months for rural affairs, from the Regional Summit in late October to the Prime Minister’s tour of selected regional areas last week. What is needed now for success is a decade of commitment from the Federal Government, and concerted and collaborative action from the State and Territory Governments as well. Dr Clark, in his February statement, made the point that the words of the Prime Minister’s commitment had to be matched by sustained policy and program action and that a decade of commitment to rural affairs was needed, not just a week’s. Reflecting now on Dr Clark’s statement, it is clear that the government took to heart his concerns. In February he said: The level of commitment will be expensive but if we start investing seriously in non-metropolitan areas and other disadvantaged regions now we will not have to pick up the tab every year in the future",120,Representatives Main Committee
250,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson) (11.16 A.m.),"The origins of the Health Insurance20976 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 through targeted programs to meet serious need. Also, we will have a much more even and fair society, which ought to be a primary goal for all governments. Dr Clark plainly threw out a major challenge to the government. When the budget was presented in May, it was clear that this challenge had been met, and met in full. In fact, Dr Clark issued a statement dated 9 May which began as follows: The National Rural Health Alliance has warmly welcomed the range of initiatives and enhanced programs for rural and regional health services announced in Budget 2000. Dr Clark in fact announced in his statement that he had written to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, and the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon. Dr Michael Wooldridge, to congratulate the government for the rural and regional health care package. Again, I quote from Dr Clark’s May statement: “Three announcements in particular stand out for us. First, the Alliance is delighted that there will be nearly $50 million over four years for allied health professionals and nurses to be available through Divisions of General Practice to help build multi-professional health teams in rural and regional areas. The Alliance has long argued for the Commonwealth to show national leadership on allied health and nursing workforce issues and this is a major step forward ... He continued: “Secondly, we are particularly pleased that there will be three new University Departments of Rural Health and nine Clinical Schools located in rural and regional areas. With these initiatives the health sector, through the Federal Department, is leading the way in re-establishing physical and social infrastructure in country areas. The results will be beneficial to the fabric of country regions in the long term, as well as to the training and support of health professionals for country areas.” “And thirdly, we welcome the relatively small but significant program to prevent and better manage chronic disease in rural and regional communities. This is a good signal to give, focusing as it does on health promotion and illness management, and recognising that certain chronic diseases (including coronary heart disease, asthma and diabetes) are proportionately more prevalent in country areas.” Dr Clark went on to list the other six programs in the budget 2000 health care package that the National Rural Health Alliance welcomed. Of course, one of those is a program that is going to be delivered through this bill. The National Rural Health Alliance is no lightweight body, nor is it some sort of general apologist or defender of the government. It comprises 22 organisations-all of which are national bodies in their own right or are the rural special interest groups of national bodies. The alliance includes organisations such as the Association of Australian Rural Nurses, the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, the Australian Council for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, Rural Pharmacists Australia, the Country Women’s Association and ATSIC-the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. It covers a broad field of those concerned about medical services in rural and regional areas. It is extraordinary that they should all unanimously endorse the budget 2000 package, and that reflects great credit on the government. In this bill we will see each year 100 new medical students who will receive $20,000 annually to study medicine on the condition that they agree to work in a rural community for six years once they have completed their basic medical training and GP or specialist fellowship. It is a long-term strategy and it recognises the principle of mutual obligation. It is entirely fair and reasonable that students, as my colleague the member for Hinkler has said, who receive somewhere in the order of $120,000 should recognise their obligation to the community, particularly those who are most disadvantaged in Australia with regard to medical services. There are penalties for breaches of this obligation, although, of course, the minister has the right to waive such penalties in exceptional circumstances. Thursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20977 This scheme neatly dovetails with the government’s other regional and rural health initiatives, including the Rural Australian Medical Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme and the establishment, as we have said, of the nine new clinical schools in regional and rural areas and the additional university departments of rural health. There has been a call for the scheme and the bonded scholarships to start virtually immediately. The Minister for Health and Aged Care, I think, quite rightly has noted that this would merely result in an inundation in rural and regional areas of barely qualified doctors. The minister is right when he says that rural Australia deserves better and the government would be negligent if under this scheme it permitted doctors to practise in a rural area before they obtained their fellowship. Under this scheme, the doctors that go to rural and regional areas will be fully trained and qualified to work unsupervised, and that is the way it should be. The demands of a rural practice, as I know from many of my doctors, are extraordinary. They could be delivering a baby one minute and then the next they could be racing out to a severe car accident because they are the only doctor in the area. They have to be an anaesthetist, a surgeon and an obstetrician. Their skills go right across the spectrum of medical practice. As my colleague the member for Hinkler said, the greatest impost upon them is often the lack of relief. I can recall last Christmas one of my doctors in Proserpine ringing and saying that he had been trying to get assistance in his practice, a locum, for 12 years. That is a long time. He was hoping to go away to the beach for two weeks with his children over Christmas, but because he had been unsuccessful in getting assistance in his practice, he would have to forgo the beach holiday with his children. He was understandably very upset, as we all would be. I shared the distress and the weariness that was obviously his lot. If in some small measure this bill goes towards providing backup for those doctors that work so hard in small country towns and regional centres, then I think the government will have done a very fine thing, not only for the doctors in those towns but for their patients as well. I would like to dwell for a moment on the statistics that reveal the low standard of service in rural and regional Australia, despite the enormous commitment by the doctors who currently work in those areas. I will quote from the report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on rural health that assessed the standard of service in various areas of Australia in 1996. Frankly, the record is appalling and unforgivable. In 1996 almost double the number of medical practitioners provided services in capital cities per head of population compared with other areas. The study states: The supply of primary care practitioners per head of population falls sharply in rural areas. In large rural centres, the supply rate was 13% below that of capital cities, whereas small rural centres and other rural areas had supply rates 23% and 35% respectively less than capital cities. Distances travelled to visit practitioners in the more sparsely settled areas may add further to the rural and remote zone disadvantage. In the critical area of medical specialists, the study concluded: In 1996, the number of specialists per head of population was fairly similar in the metropolitan zone and large rural centres but substantially lower in small rural centres, other rural centres and the remote zone. Compared with capital cities, small rural centres have less than half the supply per capita of specialists. Other rural areas and the remote zone have less than 10% of the number of specialists per capita in capital cities. The report continues: Of all specialists, surgeons have the highest numbers per capita practising in rural and remote zones. However, the supply of surgeons in small rural centres, other rural centres and the remote zone was still only 59%, 11% and 17% of the corresponding supply in capital cities. 20978 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 Those cold, hard statistics reveal the legacy of total disinterest in rural and regional health care and abject neglect of this responsibility by the previous government. Research compiled for the National Health Labour Taskforce by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, entitled Medical labour force 1998, made some other deductions about the distribution of medical practitioners nationally. In 1998 there were 7,757 medical practitioners working in their main job in rural and remote areas-or 15.6 per cent of all medical practitioners. This contrasted with the overall population distribution of 28.7 per cent living in rural and remote areas in 1998. There were 143.6 practising medical practitioners per 100,000 people employed in their main job in rural and remote areas compared with 142.8 in 1996 and 144 in 1997. This compares with 306.3 per 100,000 people in capital cities and other metropolitan areas in 1998-almost double the number-and 306.2 per 100,000 in 1997 and 308.2 per 100,000 in 1996. While these figures are undeniably depressing, the report revealed a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. It went on to say: It is expected that in time an increase in the proportion of medical students with a rural background will result in an increase in the proportion of Australian medical graduates willing to practice in rural areas. In 1999, 11.9% of students commencing initial medical degrees were from rural and remote areas compared with 9.5% to 11.6% for the nine-year period from 1989 to 1997 and 13.3% in 1998. The figures are certainly moving in an encouraging upward trend, although there is still a great deal to be done. This study and that quoted expectation were made well before the government announced its trailblazing regional and rural health care package in budget 2000. I could not conclude without mentioning the Townsville medical school at James Cook University. It is going to train predominantly young people from rural and regional areas. The expectation is that, having trained in a regional setting, those doctors will opt to work in a rural and regional setting. As my colleague the member for Hinkler has said, the difficulty with young medical students is that they have a long period of training. They meet their future partner in the city, and generally that partner is a city based professional as well so they stay in the city. So there is a difficulty, for family reasons, in moving to rural and regional areas. However, if one trains in a rural and regional area in North Queensland, the likelihood is that many of them will opt to work in a rural and regional area. A young lady from our area, Ms Mather from Mackay, has been successful in gaining entry to James Cook University. She lives at The Leap, north of Mackay, and we are all very proud that a young rural person is going to go through JCU in its first intake of medical students. I have to pay tribute to Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert, who, against the sandstone universities in the south, put in an enormous effort to get this medical school. I think it is going to make a great difference for us in North Queensland. He has worked extraordinarily hard to wrest the student numbers from the sandstone universities in the south and make this a reality. We are all pleased to support him, but credit has to go to the member for Herbert, bearing in mind that this has been spoken about by successive governments since 1975. It is a tremendous achievement, and I am so pleased that I was a member of parliament when we saw a medical school go up in the north where it is so badly needed. To return to the bill, the government in introducing this measure has offered 100 young Australians each year the chance to train as doctors in return for what is a very reasonable sixyear service in a designated rural and regional area. I hope to see some of those young graduates in time in the mighty seat of Dawson, as I do in other rural and regional centres around Australia. It is part of the ongoing addressing of concerns of those who live in the rural and regional areas of Australia, and it underscores the coalition’s commitment to those living in those areas. I commend the bill to the House. Thursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20979 Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000. This bill has the qualities that rural Australians need in order to address the shortage of rural medical practitioners. I applaud Minister Wooldridge for his action in assisting rural, regional and remote Australians to access the health care that they are entitled to. The decline in rural health did not happen overnight; it happened over the last 20 years. I am very proud to stand here as a member of a government that has been vigilant in its efforts to arrest that decline and decidedly, determinedly, improve the standards of health for rural Australians. As the member for Bradfield reported in his address on the bill, the life of a country medical practitioner is difficult, with long hours and little time to spend with their families. These medical practitioners face isolation from assistance in diagnosing illnesses, and they face isolation from access to high technology diagnostic services to assist them in their decision making process on their patient’s care. Generally, a country doctor must be equipped to handle a range of duties which may arise day or night. This must indeed be a daunting thought for those practitioners who are considering locating to rural, regional or remote Australia. Having said that, I would now like to take time to record some of the thoughts of new practitioners in the Murrumbidgee Division of General Practice in my electorate of Riverina. Direct from The Pulse, the newsletter of the Murrumbidgee Division of General Practice, I quote the following comments of the new recruits on being asked the question, ‘How are you finding working in the Murrumbidgee area?’ Dr Nick Dreyer said, ‘Very fulfilling. It’s very busy with very good support from the division.’ Dr Pirooz Poursoltan indicated it was very good. He was enjoying it and getting busier all the time. Dr Ashraf Moursi said, ‘I love it.’ A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.35 a.m. to 11.46 a.m. being asked how they liked working in the Murrumbidgee area. The quote from Dr Karin Jodlowski-Tan said that she was busy and ‘had good collegial support from doctors in the region’. Dr Martin Jodlowski-Tan said that he had a ‘heavy workload’ with ‘very little spare time’, and Dr Charles Lew said that he was ‘busy on and off’ but ‘it will be good when theatre in Finley finally opens’. Then you have specialists, such as a fine friend of mine Gerard Carroll. Gerard is a consultant physician cardiologist who has devoted his enormous reserve of energy and enthusiasm to delivering an equity of care for the people of the Riverina. I am so fortunate and proud to have the services of Dr Carroll in my electorate. He is constantly seeking ways of improving our system. At the moment he has devoted himself, in his very limited spare moments, to ensuring that we have a radiotherapy unit in Wagga Wagga that will service areas of Hume, Farrer and Riverina. The one thing in common for all of these practitioners is that I am sure they would all agree that being a citizen of rural, regional and remote Australia is a rewarding and fulfilling experience. The Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000, though carrot and stick in nature, will encourage recent graduates to spend time in rural Australia and, hopefully, after spending their six years there, they will make rural and regional areas their home. I am sure members are aware of the limited access rural people have to adequate medical facilities. However, our communities have spirit and commitment-for example, look at the communities around the Riverina. On 18 August 1999, we held a public meeting to determine whether the communities wanted to raise the funds necessary to build a radiotherapy unit that would service our residents. The meeting determined that we would raise the $3 million required to build this unit. Every village, town and city in the region has raised money for this",123,Representatives Main Committee

252,Mrs Hull,"Before the suspension, I was quoting the comments of the new recruits on20980 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 appeal, and that spirit has now attracted the amount of $2.7 million to its trust. We are awaiting the building works, with a possible opening early in the year 2001. This is what practitioners experience in country areas: a generosity beyond belief from those who can least afford it but who will give it anyhow. Is it any wonder that I am always a proud and parochial member for Riverina? How could I not be? According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the estimates of the number of general practice consultations per capita certainly decline with remoteness. Those estimates support the fact that medical access is a problem in country Australia. Even in Wagga Wagga, the largest inland city in New South Wales, we have a ratio of 2,700 patients to every one doctor. In supporting this bill I can see the potential in expanding the medical rural bonded scheme into other areas of the health professions. Along with the shortages of medical practitioners, there are also chronic shortages of nurses and other allied health professionals. Nurses in country areas have an incredible workload and a significant amount of responsibility over and above that of their city counterparts. Mostly the hospitals that they work in have very few of the ancillary benefits of lifting equipment and patient care assistance. The workload is heavy and painstaking, and they often have very little access to support staff, as the shortages are widespread. Many country hospitals have had to close down wards with as many as 10 urgently needed beds, simply because they have no available nursing staff. Health services are constantly advertising for nurses. However, until we begin to provide benefits for young men and women to train in this admirable profession it will suffer even further decline. The nursing profession must get the credit due to it. I urge the Minister for Health and Aged Care to continue his excellent leadership in the delivery of rural health and to continue his efforts in the critical area of nursing as well. I am sure the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs will see the very valuable role that he could play in assisting the delivery of fully trained nurses back into rural, regional and remote Australia. Mental health and social welfare graduates could also benefit from such a program. We are all well aware that suicide rates in regional, rural, and remote Australia have increased dramatically in recent years. A study published in the Medical Journal of Australia has indicated that male suicide rates trebled, increasing by up to twelvefold in towns with fewer than 4,000 people. If, at a later stage, this bill or its associated scholarship scheme could encompass other health professionals then we would be well under way to even further improving the mental and physical health facilities in rural Australia. In addition, it may become prudent to offer funding to established rural health professions so that they may be able to take on interns in rural areas. I particularly draw attention to rural psychology graduates who must undertake a two-year internship under a qualified psychologist before they are allowed to operate their own practice. A number of students, on completing their four years studying, are unable to find the necessary supervision to complete their training in rural areas. This means that many are forced to leave rural areas to train in cities with a strong risk that they may not return. However, I would like to also highlight some successes in the rural health sector and the ways that this health insurance bill could complement existing training programs. The Greater Murray Clinical School, under the directorship of Professor Mohamed Khadra, is making an outstanding contribution to clinical training in rural areas. The aim of the clinical school is to provide diversified educational offerings in rural health and medical practice and it will play an important role in assisting to deal with the recruitment and retention of medical practitioners to work in rural and remote areas of Australia. The Greater Murray Clinical School is developing curriculum for medical students which is specific to rural settings yet is Thursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20981 still equivalent in standard to urban clinical schools. They are active in enlisting the local medical community to become teachers in this new curriculum. The Greater Murray Clinical School develops support and infrastructure for learning and research at all levels so that there is a specific culture and habit for these activities. A key feature in the learning programs is its patient scenarios which are predetermined by teaching physicians. A student is introduced to the consenting learning patient and will follow them through the health system. The students will go to various appointments with each of their patients. Students keep a learning diary of this experience. If the patient should have to undergo surgery, then the student will be in the theatre, will follow the patient recovery in the ward and will then make home visits to the patient’s living environment. This hands-on experience will enable the student to understand first-hand the differences in the recovery needs of a rural farmer, for instance, who has undergone perhaps a hernia operation. This patient will have differing needs from one that may be from the city with daily access to a doctor’s surgery, a desk job and little travelling. The farmer may have to be on his feet quickly, tend to heavy lifting and physical workload, need to travel on rough roads in a fourwheel drive, open and close countless gates, and be anything up to 12 hours drive to the nearest doctor. Recently, in a small town on the outskirts of Wagga Wagga, a young farmer had his arm ripped off, severed in an auger accident. He was on his own out in the fields and he had to get into a four-wheel drive, drive many kilometres and get out and open and close many gatesas we all know the consequences of leaving the gate open. To a farmer, losing the herd is as bad as, or worse than, losing his arm. All of this he did whilst carrying his severed arm. This aspect of understanding rural life is being addressed by the clinical school by organising a number of excursions during the teaching term to highlight specific aspects of the rural experience. The Greater Murray Clinical School is set to make a real difference in the short and long term for the recruitment and retention of health care workers in the country. In the short term the very presence of the Greater Murray Clinical School has influenced the decision of four doctors in the last 12 months alone to relocate to the area to practise. Through such learning programs the clinical school hopes to produce doctors who are sensitive to, and caring and understanding of, the needs of rural patients. The programs, because they are set in rural context, illustrate the difficulties of practising in rural areas and instruct on methods to best deal with a rural or regional practice. In the long term, the clinical school will train a large number of doctors who have spent their clinical years in rural and regional areas. We owe this to the dedication and commitment of the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson. It was through their commitment and vision that this coalition government funded the Greater Murray Clinical School in Wagga Wagga. I give them my sincere thanks on behalf of all rural and regional people across Australia. This is just the beginning. Because of the success of the Greater Murray Clinical School, the 2000-01 budget saw the commitment to another nine of these clinical schools in rural and regional Australia. It is in the long term that I see the health insurance amendment bill working hand in hand with the programs and teaching strategies of the Greater Murray Clinical School. With the allocation of scholarships to medical students supported by the bill’s legislative framework to enforce the bond, coupled with the opportunity to study at the clinical school, I believe we are moving in a positive direction in overcoming the shortage of health professionals in rural and regional Australia. I commend the minister and the bill and offer it my wholehearted support. 20982 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 Dr WOOLDRIDGE (Casey-Minister for Health and Aged Care) (11.56 a.m.)-in reply-I thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate on this important piece of legislation, the Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practititioners) Bill 2000. I will make some general comments first and then I will make some specific comments about the matters raised in the legislation. The need to get more doctors into rural areas is widely recognised. Many communities have identified having a local doctor as just about the highest possible thing on their list of health priorities. The scholarships will provide $20,000 a year to medical students in exchange for an undertaking to work in a rural and remote area. Those awarded a medical rural bonded scholarship will be contributing to meeting the health needs of rural Australia. By the end of their six years of rural practice, doctors will have gained an understanding of their local community and developed valued skills in rural medicine. It is expected this will provide a solid grounding for any future career direction. The legislation to underpin the bonded scholarship scheme is necessary and sensible. It protects the medical students as well as the Commonwealth. It ensures that all parties know and understand the extent of their obligations from the beginning and that the goalposts cannot be moved. Should a scholar breach the contract of the Commonwealth then they will be required to repay their scholarship with interest and there will be a ban of up to 12 years on practising in urban Australia with a Medicare provider number. The point of this scheme is to add 100 doctors annually to an area of work force shortage-and that is country Australia. The ban provision is to ensure that extra doctors do not end up adding to areas of work force oversupply; that is, practising in urban areas. It would completely undermine the Commonwealth’s intention if this were to happen. I will talk about this a bit more because this is a novel idea and the central underpinning of this proposal. Previous proposals for a bonded scholarship, such as the one proposed by the Australian Medical Association and taken up by the Labor Party in their 1998 election platform, were completely unworkable. It is foolish to think that a bond of $120,000 is going to be sufficient to make someone go to the country if they decide they wish to do cardiology and receive $500,000 to $600,000 a year practising in the city once they finish their medical training. Some medical specialists can earn enormous remuneration by community standards and it is reasonable to think a great number of these people taking the scholarships may be tempted to in fact break them if the penalty is simply a financial one. We are not saying that people who take these scholarships need to be general practitioners. Country Australia needs all sorts of doctors. Just about any medical specialty can be practised in regional Australia; probably the only exceptions are neurosurgery and cardiac surgery. But just about any other discipline of surgery and any discipline of medicine, imaging or other areas is actually in undersupply in regional areas. The other point about this scheme that is unusual and novel is that we are actually providing additional places in medical school. The number of medical students in fully funded places will go up from about 1,200 to 1,300 next year. We are saying to a young person, ‘You can take one of these scholarships and you will get a place in medical school that you would not have otherwise been entitled to.’ That is an enormous prize. In return for that, we are going to take those 100 people from people who are committed to practising in country Australia. In my experience, a lot of people who apply for this will probably not be straight out of school. I meet many young people in their late 20s in country areas who are working as nurses or pharmacists or in other areas who say to me, ‘I would love to do medicine. I am committed to this community. I would come back to rural Australia. There is no mechanism for me to get into medicine.’ Having discussed this recently with the deans of medicine, we believe such a Thursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20983 process is workable. Medical schools will have their normal intake and then an additional intake on top of that. Despite the ban, if a student finds they simply cannot or are unable to work in a rural area, there is a way out. They can repay the money, with interest, and they can work as a doctor. We are not stopping them from being registered. They can work in a public hospital, in education or in biomedical research. So there are many options that they could still undertake. All we are saying is that you cannot go into clinical practice in a city when you have promised to go to the country. There will be some people, a few very bright young people, who might choose to go into biomedical research. I would not want to stop them from doing that. Australia needs young doctors in biomedical research and, under such legislation, if they paid back their bond, there would be nothing stopping them from doing that. The penalties, I believe, are not harsh. All we are doing is asking people to fulfil the obligations that they contracted to do in order to get a place in medical school that they would not have otherwise got and that would have been taken by another person who was prepared to give a commitment to rural Australia. If a scholar breaches, the debt they have accrued would not be for six years from the point of breach. The interest would be calculated only from the point of breach itself, and so the scholar would not be forced to repay the debt if their study turned out to be in another area. The contract provides for the minister to defer the obligation to work in a rural or remote area. This is sensible, as some people will want to have children and some people will have an extended period of illness. So there is the capacity for people to have a life, but not to have a life and break the very serious obligation they have given to help us in country Australia. The conditions of the scholarship will be made very clear to applicants. They will be counselled beforehand and, in an informed way, they will be signing a contract. I have to say that there has been an extraordinary amount of interest. In the first three weeks after we announced this, we received over 1,000 inquiries. Given that there are only 100 places, we suspect there is going to be an enormous demand for these places. It is not our intention to implement a scheme that is onerous and unsustainable. The scholarship scheme is a very significant initiative, and I think it will end up achieving its aim. It will take a long time. I fully concede that. If you look at the range of measures in this year’s budget, there were some short-term measures, medium-term measures and long-term measures. This is one of the long-term measures. I wish one of my predecessors had done it 10 years ago. I would not have the difficulties I am having today had that happened. The scheme provides very generous financial incentives. That is quite reasonable because, in the end, the outcome is one that is very important to the Australian community. I have a few words to say on some of the comments that have been made during this debate. The shadow minister quoted at length from a number of people who have an interest in this area and who have been critical of it. You would expect the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Medical Students Association, which is funded by the AMA, to be critical of this. There is a small element in the medical profession that believes it is an imposition on doctors to tell them to do anything whatsoever. I am very surprised that the Labor Party should be listening to this or giving it any credence. I certainly do not. Let me point to some specific things. I am pleased that the shadow minister thinks she can take credit for the scheme but had we done in 1998 what Labor had proposed, which was just a straight lift from the Australian Medical Association’s policy, it would have been a complete flop. It was not about providing additional places in medical school and it was not about providing a hook by the way of enforcement through a Medicare provider number to actually get people to undertake their obligations. Those were things that have not been thought of previously in Australia and that make this an enormously different scheme. I know the 20984 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 shadow minister is calling this a backflip by the government, and I can understand that. She more than anyone should know about backflips, given her recent humiliation on the 30 per cent rebate. The shadow minister has quoted some statements made by the Australian Medical Students Association, and I think I should put on the record a counter to these quite erroneous allegations. She says I have completely failed to win the support of the profession for this version of the bonded scholarship scheme. I have completely failed to win support of the AMA, and that probably tells me I have got it right. But that is not the case with the 11 deans of medicine around Australia who, I think, are a more significant, important and relevant interest group in this. They are cooperating with the government, even though some of them have some real reservations about the nature of selection and entry. I very much thank them for their willingness to work with the government to try to sort this out. It has not been easy for some of them. I understand that and I appreciate it. The shadow minister has quoted some statements made by the Australian Medical Students Association. I remember what it was like to be a medical student, so I do not want to be too critical of them. I can understand some of their concerns. They are certainly having these concerns fed and whipped up by others quite mischievously, I believe, and quite without foundation. The first comment is that it forces someone to be certain of their career when they are 16. I am sorry, but that is just ridiculous. I was not like that. I did not get into medicine at 16; I got in as a mature age student. As I have said previously, I think a lot of people who will be attracted to this will be people in their early to late 20s who have done another allied health career. The only thing they have to be certain of is that they are committed to country Australia, and I have met many young people who are so committed. The second comment from the Australian Medical Students Association, via the Labor Party, is that this scheme carries with it punitive measures, by denying a student a provider number. I do not concede at all that it is punitive. There are a lot of things you can do in medicine without actually billing Medicare in capital cities. I am an example of one of them, having chosen another career. There are doctors in journalism and, as I have said previously, you can practise in a public hospital, in a health clinic and in a variety of salaried jobs in biomedical research and education. All of these things can be done without a Medicare provider number. All of these things provide a very useful benefit to the community and, in many cases, a much more useful benefit than practising clinical medicine in an oversupplied area. There is no punishment whatsoever if someone merely undertakes to carry out what they are contracted to do in getting a place in medicine they would not have gotten otherwise. The third comment is that we are probably awarding scholarships to those students who would practise in rural areas anyway. This is not accurate. That would have been accurate if we had followed what the Labor Party proposed in 1998 and offered it to existing medical students. But the key to this is giving new places, additional places, over and above the normal medical student selection. Given that, you will get the normal students that you would have into medicine through the normal intake and then you will get your 100 additional students. So it is quite different. We have thought of that and they are just not accurate on that. The fourth comment implies that a lucrative pecuniary incentive is required to attract medical students. This could not be further from the truth. Kids coming from the country actually do have higher costs. We believe the majority of people under this scheme will come from the country areas, and this is meeting some of their higher costs that have not been recognised previously. Finally, there is the argument that it is potentially deleterious to students continuing education after postgraduate training, given that the bulk of this occurs in urban areas. The Thursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20985 logical implication of that is that you can really only practise in a city after your postgraduate training. Clearly, that is absolutely absurd. The shadow minister asks a few questions that I am happy to try to answer. She says these might be called ‘Wooldridge contracts’. I am absolutely delighted with that, and I would be happy if every one of these additional 100 doctors a year were also called a ‘Wooldridge doctor’, because I am about trying to deliver for country people. She asks about how it would interact with existing scholarships-the RMS scholarships-HECS remission arrangements. These would be complementary in a sense. We would not expect anyone applying for this to get a RMS scholarship. They would not be additive in that sense. The HECS remission arrangements are an additional shorterto medium-term proposal, whereas this is a long-term proposal. So they are separate, and they target different people. The shadow minister also legitimately asks what will happen if someone wishes to take time off to have a family. Being a medical doctor myself, I understand that more than 50 per cent of people who go through med school are women and some of them will want to have a family before 33 years of age. There is the capacity here to defer once you have started your six years but not a capacity to get out of it. If someone wishes to defer a period of their six years because they want to take a year or two off to have kids, there is no difficulty with that at all. The contract allows for that. The second thing is what would happen in the case of serious illness. There would be a capacity for ministerial discretion in the case of serious illness. It would have to be pretty serious though. We want to be sensible and compassionate. If either the person concerned or a member of their immediate family contracted an illness that could only be treated in an urban area, that would be legitimate grounds to not serve out the period of the bond. But this is going to be extraordinarily unusual; it is not likely to happen once a year. It does not need a large and unwieldy bureaucratic structure to decide something on compassionate grounds. As Minister for Health, I do this all the time with medical treatment overseas and the special programs that we already have for treatment of leukaemia. I have significant discretion on compassionate grounds across a variety of areas. The shadow minister, if she is ever lucky enough to have the position I occupy, will find that she exercises that discretion as well. This is no different from that, and any minister could be expected to deal with that sensibly and humanely. The Health Insurance Amendment (Rural and Remote Area Medical Practitioners) Bill 2000 is a bill for rural Australia. It is an innovative idea. It has not been tried anywhere else in the world; it has not been thought of anywhere else in the world. We are proud of it, we think it is going to make an enormous difference and we think that particuarly those in the medical profession who are speaking against it are doing so out of self-interest. Country Australia is going to be very grateful in 10 years time that we made the effort to do this. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

253,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (12.13 P.m.),"I would like to move a second reading20986 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 “whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for: (a) not proceeding with the NVE classification; and (b) delaying the implementation of classification reform restricting the availability of violent and demeaning material currently permitted within the X classification”. The bill was listed for debate in this chamber on 8 March; indeed, the opposition was ready to agree to its passage, as we are today, but it was withdrawn after a series of intriguing events, including the display one evening during that week in March of some pornographic video material in one of the rooms within this parliament, including the viewing of a video which had been regarded as being unfit for classification in New South Wales and which had no record of being classified in any other state. Indeed, despite inquiry as to where the outlet marketing this video may have been, there was no evidence of any outlet selling this video. So how this illegal video came into the hands of government members is intriguing, to say the least. In any event, the display of these videos apparently caused some backlash within the government and caused a protest, not about the substance of the legislation, but about the use of the term ‘NVE’ or ‘non-violent erotica’ instead of the X classification. Surely, we as legislators have to look at substance, not simply at labels, particularly when you realise that the classification scheme in this country exists as a cooperative scheme. It is a scheme involving all relevant ministers from the Commonwealth, the states and the territories. Obviously, there is considerable public interest in the existence of that scheme. It is futile, for instance, to have inconsistent classification regimes applying around the country. It would simply mean that people would transport across borders to get hold of material that had been classified differently in different states. While it is appropriate for politicians to be involved in taking note of community concerns, when we start getting into judging the material rather than having an independent tribunal judge the material, we are at risk of overstepping the mark in terms of separation of powers. Coming back to the substance of the cooperative scheme that exists between the Commonwealth and the states, under the scheme, any changes to classification categories must have unanimous agreement. Indeed, the changes to the classification categories contained in this bill have been worked on for over three years at the Commonwealth and state level. A lot of work has gone into it and there has been a lot of goodwill to reach that unanimous position. So the bill that we are considering now, because the government has not yet moved its amendment, contains this NVE classification to replace the X classification. The advantage of the replacement of the X classification is that it will remove offensive and belittling material. The bill talks about material of a fetish nature, any depiction of violence whatsoever, the use of sexually aggressive language and, perhaps of more concern regarding this material, the portrayal of persons over 18 years of age as minors. Clearly, that sort of material is undesirable. I think the feedback we will all get from our electorates will be to that effect. The bill that is before the Main Committee removes that from the classification, and it has the full support of the opposition. On 30 May 2000, the Attorney-General, according to media reports, after being requested to do so by the Prime Minister, withdrew the bill and unilaterally announced that he was abandoning the NVE classification. This is despite the fact that the scheme operates in a cooperative fashion around the nation, as I have said, involving all states and territories. The fact that mere labelling was being relied upon to threaten the goodwill that has existed in the scheme was tremendously short-sighted. As it has turned out, in the course of events the state and territory attorneys-general have agreed to the amendments that the government has proposed. In other words, they have said, ‘Why make a drama of this? Surely the substance is to remove that offensive and belittling material from the classifications. If it is a question of labels, we are not going to get up on Thursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20987 soapboxes as some people have wanted to do. We are all about getting the substance of the bill through.’ That is the position that the opposition takes. The point I want to make is that surely we, as legislators, have to look at substance rather than at opportunities to get up on our soapboxes. In any event, what is going to be proposed in the government’s amendments-which we will ultimately support because of the issues of substance-will involve the abandonment of the non-violent erotica video classification. While that is disappointing, as I have said, we are prepared to agree to that, given the previous agreement. Australia’s system of classification depends on this national approach, agreed to by the federal government in consultation with the censorship ministers from each state, and it requires Commonwealth legislation to be backed up by changes to the laws of each state and territory. To unilaterally proclaim a position in the context where this legislative backup had to take place was, with respect, quite arrogant and offensive to those states and territories that have cooperated. The Attorney-General’s unilateral decision to shelve the NVE classification and then present that decision to the state and territory censorship ministers as a fait accompli can only be regarded as placing at risk the integrity of the national approach that we have. It is more the action of a bungling, incompetent and insecure government that has been captured by people wanting to get up on soapboxes than the action of a government which is more concerned about getting the substance of the job done in consultation and in cooperation with the states and territories. Once again, dogma and ignorance prevailed over balance and reason in this matter. In any event, as I said, in early July the state and territory governments agreed to these further changes. I believe it was fortunate for the government that that meeting took the cooperative spirit that has prevailed in the state and territory governments in respect of this issue and that objection was not raised. While the government’s handling of this issue has been incompetent, Labor will not oppose the amendments that the government will move to retain the current X classification. It will have that offensive and belittling material removed, and the opposition fully supports this. The bill contains a number of other minor amendments, including the expansion of the current range of films exempt from classification-typically those with a limited market and those on specialist subjects. It will also allow for the revocation of classifications for interactive films or computer games that contain material not brought to the attention of the censors in the initial review. The opposition fully supports that, as it does the streamlining of the classification process by allowing the Office of Film and Literature Classification to issue and revoke serial classifications for certain publications. The amendments will also include an expansion in the range of persons and organisations that may be considered as persons aggrieved for the purpose of challenging a decision. The proposed provision will also allow organisations or persons with a particular prior interest and involvement in the contentious aspects of the subject matter to seek a review of the film. This is the first time the act has been substantially amended since it was enacted in 1995. The opposition fully supports the need to review important pieces of legislation such as this to ensure that any loopholes are closed and that it continues to reflect community norms and values. In conclusion, there are a couple of points I would like to make on the importance of the independence of the Office of Film and Literature Classification. I think most people in Australia would agree that our classification system has functioned relatively well. I think that is because we have an independent office in the Office of Film and Literature Classification. 20988 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 It is important to realise that, while most of the sensationalism regarding classifications has been in the area of sexually explicit material, the board also performs a valuable role for parents in identifying material that is or is not appropriate for children of particular ages. It also has a range of other important public interest responsibilities. In 1998 community panels conducted a survey by examining classifications against what they perceived to be community norms. It is refreshing to note that the panels found that the classifications were substantially consistent with those norms. I understand that reports regarding similar surveys in Perth, Adelaide and regional Victoria will be released soon. Last year the OFLC was severely short-staffed. At 30 June last year, there were only six permanent classifiers-which was nowhere near the statutory maximum of 20-and in September last year the Attorney-General finally appointed 12 more classifiers to the board. The board must deal with an increasing amount of material, and it is imperative that it be resourced properly if it is to carry out its functions in a timely and efficient manner. It is also important that board members are appointed on merit. The last time that appointments were made to the board, the process stalled as a result of improper political interference by the government in the merit selection process. The government rejected a list of names put forward after applicants were screened and called for a new list. After sifting through more than 500 applications, interviewing candidates and requiring short-listed candidates to sit a screen test, the selection panel put to the government a list of 20 names recommended for appointment as censors. However, the government rejected that list and added to it people who had not passed the merit selection process. The government’s interference in the merit selection process for censors can only undermine confidence in Australia’s independent system of classification. It is reminiscent of the government’s appointment to the High Court of individuals whom it perceived to have capital ‘c’ credentials. The public expects the government to be fair in its selection of censors, to select them on merit and not allow its political agenda or ideology to diminish the independence of the OFLC. It goes without saying that the government must base selection criteria on merit rather than allowing improper political motivations to intrude. Public confidence in its classification decisions clearly depends on that perception of impartiality. My final point is about the leadership of the OFLC and, of equal concern to the opposition, the government’s failure to appoint a new director of the OFLC promptly despite the position becoming vacant in September last year. Unfortunately, that vacancy occurred as a result of the untimely death of the former director, Kathryn Patterson. A new director, Mr Desmond Clark, was not appointed until April this year. While I commend the work of the acting director, Simon Webb, during the interim period, everyone knows that when an organisation lacks a permanent leader morale can suffer, as can the quality of the organisation’s performance overall. Recent debate about the role of our censors has highlighted a number of problems, including the need for more streamlined procedures and better communication and explanation by the board of its processes and decisions. Good leadership will be required to ensure that the board addresses these community concerns properly. These are matters of substance rather than labelling that the government should consider addressing in cooperation with the state governments. Having made those points, I believe the substance of the bill is sound. It should have been introduced in March and we should not have had this delay regarding offensive and belittling material remaining within the X classification. Be that as it may, the legislation is before the Committee today and the opposition commends it to honourable members.",133,Representatives Main Committee

Brisbane Airport Corporation to the people of Brisbane and, in particular, those 50,000 to 100,000 residents in the city of Brisbane likely to be adversely affected by the impact of the implementation of the Brisbane Airport Corporation master plan. Members may be aware that during 1999 and 2000 a Senate inquiry was held into this matter. The committee reported on 30 June 2000 and contained within its report were a number of adverse observations in relation to the manner and method through which the Brisbane Airport Corporation master plan was approved by Minister John Anderson. On4 July, I lodged an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the minister’s decision to approve the Brisbane Airport Corporation master plan. That matter was subsequently heard by the AAT on 10 August and, as a consequence of that hearing, Deputy President Breen of the AAT in Brisbane found in my favour, providing an extension of time so that I might be able to argue the substantive case on the matter in terms of whether the minister should or should not have approved the Brisbane Airport Corporation master plan. However, come early September, I received notification from the Australian Government Solicitor, that now Minister Anderson had decided in turn to appeal to the Federal Court the win which I secured in the AAT. That, of course, is the minister’s and the government’s prerogative. However, what concerns me in particular is the statement in the application of claims contained within the notification from the Australian Government Solicitor; namely, application claim number three, which seeks costs of, and incidental to, this application. The implication of that, of course, is that not only am I faced with the prospect of fighting a substantive case against the Commonwealth through the minister on this matter, but now I have hanging over my head the threat of financial intimidation from Minister Anderson. ShouldI lose this matter in the Federal Court, the Commonwealth, through the minister, will seek to obtain costs from me personally. Having obtained advice on this matter, it seems that the personal exposure which I would have on this matter would be in the range of $5,000 to $20,000 for a single day’s hearing before the Federal Court. I cannot but interpret this as being a substantial act of legal and financial intimidation. As a consequence of that, I have written a letter dated 25 September to the Australian Government Solicitor, who is acting on behalf of his client, seeking that the minister withdraw this particular claim for costs. I have simply argued the case that in a matter of public importance of this nature we simply argue it on its merits. The Commonwealth has at its disposal the formidable legal resources of the Attorney-General’s Department. I will be arguing my own case, as I have, in fact, argued it already before the AAT. One should not have hanging over one’s head the threat of personal costs against one in a matter of this nature. Surely it should be argued and determined on the merits not which of us happens to have the deeper pockets-and plainly that is the Commonwealth and not me. I would simply ask the question: why is the Commonwealth through the minister going to such extraordinary lengths on this matter? being cognisant of the full information that he has, the thought that this issue may be sub judice has crossed my mind. I urge you to bear that in mind as you continue speaking.",136,Representatives Main Committee

I am loath to interrupt the member but, not20990 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 this matter as well and I plainly have not gone to the substance of the matters which are currently before the courts; I have simply gone to the question of the application of costs. The substance of the matter is a matter for the courts, and I fully respect the independence of the judiciary and their integrity on that question. But what concerns me is this question of cost. It relates to the broader point which I would also bring to the attention of the parliament, which is the coordinated campaign at a local level in Brisbane orchestrated by the Liberal Party of Queensland on this matter. On the south side of Brisbane, we have a takeover of the branches of the Liberal Party by the Santo Santoro faction of the party. Mr Caltabiano, who is now the leader of the Liberal Party in the city council, is a member of the Santoro faction; Senator Mason is a member of the Santoro faction; the entire Griffith division, I now understand, is under the control of the Santoro faction. It was the Santoro faction which, of course, was responsible for negotiating the deal with One Nation in the 1998 Queensland state election which had that extremely unsettling result. Now what is the link between all of that and the Brisbane Airport Corporation? The link is simply this: that the chief public spokesperson for the Brisbane Airport Corporation is Ms Lee Crombie, who is the former senior adviser to Santo Santoro. So we have a plain link between the corporation pursing its commercial interests and the Liberal Party seeking to pursue its political interests. My single challenge to the Liberal Party and to the Brisbane Airport Corporation is this: as we approach this next election, will you be contributing to the campaign against me through a Liberal candidate? (Time expired) Victoria: State Emergency Service of the Dunkley community to the State Emergency Service. Some members are probably aware that the Greater Frankston and Mornington Peninsula area was hit by a violent windstorm on the night of Saturday, 30 September. Worst affected areas were between the Frankston and Mount Martha corridor and on the west coast of the Mornington Peninsula. Wind gusts were recorded at between 100 and 110 kilometres an hour. The SES responded brilliantly to the concerns and to the difficult situation faced by many members of the community that I represent. I was attending a friend’s wedding at the time, and witnessed the concern that overcame the bridal couple and the families when the power went out-everyone was standing there in complete darkness, wishing them a happy life together. At the time, you could see along the Nepean Highway, from the country club in Mornington, that trees had fallen and emergency services vehicles were everywhere, so that the health and well-being of local constituents could be attended to. Those most affected were those who had their houses and property damaged by the wind gusts. Homes were unroofed; a lot of trees fell down and had to be cleared from roads and private property; cars were damaged. The SES responded magnificently to the calls and concerns of the local community. Three hundred and eighty-six tasks were recorded by the SES on that evening of Saturday the 30th and into the morning of Sunday the 1st. Three hundred and eighty-six members of our community were looking for help at a time when they were faced with particular difficulties created by the violent windstorm. Responding to that were 19 units and 196 SES volunteers. The SES units came from Frankston, Sorrento and Hastings, as well as others from Chelsea, Springvale, Moorabbin, St Kilda, Altona, Broadmeadows, Eltham, Glen Waverley, and as far afield as King Lake, Alexandra, Benalla, San Remo and Warragul.

Not only were the SES volunteers there to support those who were in need; it was brilliant how the community itself helped their neighbours. I am aware of a number of cases where neighbours saw their friends, and also people down the street that they had not even met before, in some difficulty and offered their assistance. I am aware of examples of elderly and frail people being supported by neighbours who saw that they were in difficulty and responded to what was a fairly horrific evening. The crews worked through until 11 p.m. on Sunday night, in order to respond to all of those 386 tasks, and did a magnificent job. Behind the SES, a number of other volunteer organisations made sure that the volunteers were fed and had a brief break between their tasks. They make a great contribution to the community. I am very happy to acknowledge that work of SES members not only in the Dunkley community but also those from farther afield. I say to the member for Indi that some tourists from up his way came down to the Mornington Peninsula. I hope that those who did travel a long way saw what a great community it is and come back for a more relaxing visit to our electorate at some time in the future. John Howe, the regional duty officer at the SES, kindly provided me with this information. involved in that as well. The chief is like that; he is keen to get involved in these community activities. But this was John Howe, the duty officer. He provided me with this information when we contacted them to see whether there were some unresolved issues that we could assist with. On behalf of the Dunkley community, particularly those residents who were affected by that windstorm on Saturday, 30 September, I say a sincere thank you to the SES. We are a stronger community because of their presence and their involvement in the community. It was fortunate that they were there for people in their time of need. I am sure that those who benefited from the work of the SES will recognise that they are a volunteer organisation and may choose to get involved themselves or get behind that activity, because they make a very meaningful contribution to the Dunkley electorate. East Timor: Whitlam Government Policy parliamentary debate on the release of the official documents concerning the Indonesian incorporation of Portuguese Timor. Perhaps, like Malcolm Fraser, the pro-Fretilin faction has lost its memory. What they need to do, of course, is to read Greg Sheridan’s opinion piece in the Australian newspaper of 15 September. It is simply superb. Most journalists, especially in the Fairfax stable, have used the book of documents to justify their long-held prejudices and vendettas. Sheridan, by contrast, has allowed the facts to inform his conclusion. He writes as follows: The truth is the documents disclose that Gough Whitlam never gave the green light to the Indonesians for an invasion of East Timor. His policy always had two strands-support for the integration of East Timor into Indonesia and support for an act of self-determination by the East Timorese without the use of force by the Indonesians. It also had a third strand: to try to avoid getting Australia deeply involved in what was almost inevitably going to be a mess. And, further on, he writes: Australia has nothing to be ashamed of in its policy towards Indonesia in the mid-70s. Like thousands of politicians and diplomats before and since, Whitlam set out both his preferred outcome and his preferred process. By any test of logic, this was entirely",138,Representatives Main Committee

262,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (12.39 P.m.),"Surprisingly this week there has been no20992 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 reasonable. He favoured a particular outcome-Portuguese Timor’s inclusion in Indonesiabut also a particular process-an act of self-determination. With the end of Dutch colonial rule in 1949, West Timor became part of Indonesia. With the end of Portuguese colonial rule in 1974, the same option was open to the people of East Timor. Self-determination at this time would not necessarily have produced an independent state. It has always been an arrogant view of history for the anti-Indonesian lobby to have automatically associated self-determination with independence. In reality, Fretilin consistently opposed proposals for a referendum in 1974 and 1975. In fact, it had a very different technique in mind. As Jose Ramos Horta wrote in the Australian on 20 September: Some of us were stupid, immature and irresponsible enough to start a war on each other in 1975. The Indonesian army did not cause the first casualties in East Timor. The criticism of Whitlam’s stance is mischievous and misguided. There was no ambiguity or secrecy. His position was well known both to the Australian public and the Indonesian government. There was no attempt to mislead or deceive. How can a nation run a sensible foreign policy if it has not put forward preferred outcomes as well as preferred processes? This is the bread and butter of international diplomacy. It should be seen as a matter of fact, not as a matter of regret. I have never been able to understand why so many commentators have been so jaundiced on this issue. Perhaps, if not for the death of their colleagues in Balibo, the Australian media would have been more open-minded. At least Greg Sheridan has been able to maintain his objectivity. He has exposed the mythology on the question of East Timor and debunked the mischief of those who seek to discredit a great Labor Prime Minister and what I regard as an entirely honourable period in the history of Australian foreign policy. Victoria Police: S11 Protest and to the hundreds of men and women serving in the Victoria Police who were unfortunately required in the course of their duties to intervene in the S11 protest debacle outside the Crown Casino at the time of the World Economic Forum some weeks ago. We would have seen some of the scenes on television, read about them and heard about them on radio. In the Benalla Ensign of September 20 there is a report written by Natalie Robertson paying tribute in a way, but certainly depicting very graphically the experiences of some of the police. I will read part of it: At the end of a 15-hour shift outside Crown Casino during the World Economic Forum, Benalla Police Constable Wade Spokes and Senior Constable Richard Cameron experienced the worse violence from S11 protesters in the three-day event. Although Const Spokes said “more than half of the protesters” were not violent, some even apologising for the violent ones, he said it was little consolation for the cuts and bruises that he and his colleagues suffered. Of the seven male and one female police officers from Benalla assigned to the eventObviously with many hundreds of other officersone was badly injured and had to take time off from workI hasten to say that was apparently because a police horse caused damage to his foot, so I am not saying one of the protesters did that, but in the melee, of course, it is relevant. The report goes on: “The media made sure to show the protesters being hit by police but they didn’t show much of the violence from the protestors,” Senior Const Cameron said. “We had lots of things thrown at us including bottles, marbles and sticks from their protest signs. I understand that urine-filled balloons were also thrown. The article continues:",139,Representatives Main Committee
263,Mr Lieberman (Indi) (12.43 P.m.),"I would like to pay tribute to the Victoria PoliceThursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20993 “It got a bit scary when we were trapped between the cars and the horses,” he said. Not only was the work very physical, the shifts were long-15 to 16 hours a day. And although none of the officers got much sleep, Const Cameron said they were well fed by the Crown Casino and received a debriefing on the second day by Chief Commissioner Neil Comrie. “We were well looked after by the Police Department and Crown Casino,” Const Cameron said. I personally abhor what happened. Police should not be subjected to this. I support the right of people to demonstrate in our democracy-and we are a robust democracy-but I think it is wrong for protesters to stop people making lawful passage on roads, for example. People trying to get in and out of conferences should be allowed to do so. They should not be impeded. Even worse, our police should not have to put up with the type of violence, filth and abuse that came from some-but not all-of the protesters. It is appropriate that, on behalf of the people of my electorate, I thank very much the police officers, men and women, who served their state very well in the most difficult circumstances. I am alarmed and concerned that they were injured and that they were exposed to this sort of behaviour. I pay tribute to them for their professionalism and the way they coped in the most difficult circumstances. However, I make the point that, if people have the right to protestand I defend to the utmost their right to do so-they do not have the right to stop others going about their lawful business. The media did not cover that issue at all. The issue of people being able to go in and out and having reasonable access to go about their business was not raised or canvassed very much, if at all, by most of the media. It is about time that there was proper public scrutiny and media coverage of all those elements, good and bad, so that a proper balance can be obtained. In conclusion, I am very proud of the work of police officers throughout the community. They do a very difficult job in very trying circumstances. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, would join with me in expressing our sincere appreciation and the hope that their recovery from injury is speedy and they are able to return to normal life without too much trauma as soon as possible. Capricornia Electorate: Family Court Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (12.48 p.m.)-I want to put on the record my concerns, and the concerns of families, family law practitioners and community organisations, about the apparent threat to our Family Court services in Rockhampton. I cannot believe that, less than a year after the Prime Minister’s Nyngan declaration that there would be no more reductions to government services in regional Australia, I am here trying to defend people in my electorate from just such a withdrawal of an important service. Right now, the Family Court is looking to reduce the hours of our Family Court subregistry office in Rockhampton. It is also assessing new ways to deliver Family Court counselling services. Those new ways involve the Family Court withdrawing even further from its responsibility to provide those services, instead lumping the job onto local community organisations. In the registry, we currently have one full-time employee, Stacey Vea Vea, to do the reception and filing work. From all reports, Stacey does a very good job for the practitioners as well as for the many self-represented applicants that we have in Central Queensland as a result of the federal government’s squeeze on legal aid funding. The proposal from the Family Court is to reduce the opening hours of the registry office to two days a week, and full-time during court sitting weeks. The family law practitioners in Rockhampton are not impressed, but they can work around that reduction. The real concern is for the many self-represented applicants and people who have just found themselves in a relationship crisis and turn to the Family Court registry for advice and 20994 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 October 2000 information. I will quote from Stacey Vea Vea’s report to the Family Court on her duties. Among others, she lists: Answering client queries by telephone and counter ... Clients attend the counter daily and require: * blank court documents ... * my assistance with correct completion of Court documents ... * confirmation or rearranging of counselling appointments She also does a lot of work supporting solicitors’ inquiries. About court ordered counselling she says: Clients acting in person will usually ring and ask why they have to attend. I then explain the benefits of the counselling/mediation and advise the purpose of the Memo to the Court. You are not going to get those things from a closed door or an empty desk. This is what the Family Court hierarchy and, in particular, the minister have to understand. You cannot measure the value or the work of an agency in a regional centre like Rockhampton by the number of documents it processes or reports it writes. Having a place where people can get information and advice is vital. In a regional centre, let alone a small rural community, there are not too many options for people. If the Family Court registry is closed, what other agencies are going to fill the gap left? A phone call to the registry in Townsville is not good enough in a lot of cases. We are not talking about people trying to conduct a business transaction. It is usually a time of distress when they just do not need to be messed around. It is important to give people information quickly and to give them back some sense of control over the terrible things that are happening to them and their family, and to try to dispel some of the myths that can cause so much fear and confusion in these relationship breakdown situations. That is definitely my experience from my work in family law. What happens when a person in a relationship breakdown goes up to the Family Court and sees a closed door? It is going to set them back and set back any hope of a quick and amicable settlement. The Family Court have said that the registry can be expanded again if the demand is demonstrated. But they are making it so difficult for people to use the service that the statistics are going to just decline and decline and they certainly are not going to provide a case for expanding the service. This is the thin end of the wedge, and the legal practitioners in Rockhampton definitely know it. When it comes to counselling, the thin edge of the wedge appeared a couple of years ago in Rockhampton and now the Family Court is attempting to ram the rest through. We have gone from two full-time Family Court counsellors working from the registry to one private counsellor working under contract from the Family Court to provide two days of court ordered counselling a week. That contract ends at the end of this year and I can tell the Family Court that it will be watched very carefully. The Family Court is holding talks with community organisations to get them to take on the counselling work. That all sounds great in theory. Yes, we have a number of extremely hard working and competent community organisations in Rockhampton with experienced counsellors who, in a perfect world, could do the Family Court work. But they are flat out and working in a sector that, over the past four years, has had the demands on it increased at the same time as funding has been decreased. I have to ask the Family Court and the Attorney-General: what organisations in Rockhampton are going to do this work and who are the counsellors? I work with these people week in and week out and I know that they are absolutely stretched to the limit. That was confirmed in a phone call to Anglicare, for example, this morning. They already have a Thursday, 5 October 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 20995 waiting list of families and children at risk needing help from their counsellors so they cannot see the scope for expanding their services without a big increase in funding. The Family Court is a few years too late in Rockhampton. Everyone who has pulled out of Central Queensland has said that the community agencies will fill the gaps, everyone has said that for four years until there are now more gaps than services, but the community organisations cannot stretch their resources any more to meet this latest flick pass from the Family Court of its counselling responsibilities. The Family Court and the Attorney-General need to listen to the people who deal with these issues on a daily basis in Rockhampton. They need to listen to their concerns and needs and stop this bean counting reduction in the services. (Time expired) Main Committee adjourned at 12.50 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Medicare: Offices (Question No. 1255) Ms Macklin asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 13 March 2000: (1) What are the addresses of each Medicare office operating on 1 March 2000 and in which electoral divisions are they located.

Mental Illness (Question No. 1280) Ms Burke asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 16 March 2000: (1) In 1996-97, 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000, what sum was allocated from the Federal budget specifically to assist children with a mentally ill parent. (2) What programs does his Department administer specifically to assist children with a mentally ill parent. (3) Are programs planned by his Department specifically to assist children with a mentally ill parent; if so, (a) what programs are planned, (b) what was the consultation process used to develop the policy to guide the programs, (c) which groups and individuals were consulted while developing the policy to guide the program and (d) was the National Network of Adult and Adolescent Children who have a Mentally Ill Parents (Inc) consulted; if not, why not. (4) Will the Government provide funding to any individual or group in 2000-01 to specifically meet the needs of children with a mentally ill parent, if so, will the Government provide funding to national Network of Adult and Adolescent Children who have a Mentally Ill Parents (Inc). (5) Are federally funded respite care programs available specifically to meet the needs of children with a mentally ill parent; if so, what; if not, when will they be made available. (6) Has his Department conducted a survey on the specific needs of children with a mentally ill parent; if so, (a) which individuals and groups were surveyed, (b) when was the survey concluded and (c) when will the survey results be publicly released. (1) No sum was specifically allocated in the budgets of 1996-97, 1997-98, 1998-1999 to assist children of parents with a mental illness. In the 1997-98 Federal Budget, the Government announced $28 million over three years for national reform initiatives as part of the National Mental Health Strategy. $300 million has also been allocated over five years (1998-99 to 2002-2003) to States and Territories under the Australian Health Care Agreements to continue service reforms initiated under the previous phase of the Strategy. (2) The provision of services for children of parents with a mental illness is a State and Territory responsibility. (3) Under the Second National Mental Health Plan children of parents with a mental illness are identified for selective prevention strategies in order to lessen the risk of developing mental illnesses. (a) The Commonwealth Government is currently funding the Australian Infant Child Adolescent and Family Mental Health Association (AICAFMHA) to undertake a project that will outline major activities, identify gaps and make recommendations regarding the future work in this area. The project is nearing completion and a final report will be submitted by mid 2000.",144,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
265,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(b) A questionnaire was dispersed widely to government and non-government agencies that were likely to have contact with or a role in supporting the children and parents/families where one or both of the parents have a mental illness. (c) A wide variety of organisations at State and Territory level that were involved in providing programs and services to children of parents with a mental illness were consulted. (d) Yes. (4) The Commonwealth will consider its role in the provision of funding to provide support for children of parents with a mental illness once the final report of the study on children of parents with a mental illness, conducted by the Australian Infant Child Adolescent and Family Mental Health Association (AICAFMHA), has been considered. (5) No and none are planned. However, the National Respite for Carers Program (NRCP) contributes to the support and maintenance of caring relationships between carers and their dependent family members and friends regardless of the age of the carer and regardless of the disability of the care recipient. (6) (a) to (c) No Overseas Trained Doctors: Australian Council Examinations (Question No. 1366) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 5 April 2000: Further to the answer to question No. 1054 (Hansard, 4 April 200, page 14689) concerning doctors working in regional Australia, what action is the Government taking to implement increases in training numbers in the disciplines of radiation oncology, orthopaedic surgery, and ear, nose and throat surgery. The 2000-2001 Budget provides $48.4 million so that rural and regional people can receive specialist services in their own communities, rather than having to travel long distances. Prime responsibility for implementation of the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee’s recommendations lies with State Governments and the Specialist Medical Colleges. AMWAC has provided detailed reports on these specialties, with recommendations on increased training numbers and the distribution of these further training places across States and Territories. My Department has been working with the Colleges and States to encourage implementation of the recommendations. AMWAC has recognised that the creation of training positions in regional areas is contingent upon the existence of the necessary infrastructure such as teaching staff, equipment, sufficient operating sessions and educational resources. The provision of these is the responsibility of the States. I am pleased to note that there has been an increase in training numbers for Ear, Nose and Throat specialists. The Royal Australian College of Surgeons has also advised that it is working towards meeting the recommended target for Orthopaedic Surgeons for 2000. In relation to radiation oncology, a complex interplay of factors including specialist and trainee numbers, the number of megavoltage machines and best practice in cancer treatment must be considered. It should be noted that the AMWAC review linked the need to expand the workforce with an anticipated increase in megavoltage machines which has not occurred. Goods and Services Tax: Aged Care (Question No. 1445) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 13 April 2000: (1) Did she write to a number of residential aged care providers in October and November 1999, including Robert and Dorothy Stone of Jowett Holdings in the electoral division of Calwell, informing them that she will be making decisions on the GST free status of aged care services shortly, and that she will be informing them accordingly.",155,Medicare Office As At 05 04 2000 Details
266,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Is she aware of anxieties on the part of aged care providers as to the impact of the GST on their services and their desire to receive her explanation in these matters. (3) When will she be making determinations about the GST free services and when will she inform the Parliament and the providers of her decisions. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: In accordance with the question without notice I answered in the House on 29th June 2000 “The new tax legislation clearly sets out which aged care services will be GST free. I would refer the honourable member to sections 38(10), 38(25) and 38(30) of the Act. Section 38(10) sets out very specifically that nursing services and 20 other specific health and allied services will be GST free and require no determination by me to be effective. Section 38(25) establishes that, where any individual in a residential setting requires and is receiving the sort of care that is set out in schedule 1 to the Aged Care Act, that will also be GST free. That is because we wish to treat people in a like manner. Section 38(30) establishes that all HACC and state funded services and payments under the HACC are provided GST free. It provides that where any individual requires personal care, then that personal care will be provided GST free. The determinations that I have made – I confirm that I have made them; they will be gazetted tomorrow -–will activate the provisions of the legislation, but I may not override the legislation, alter the legislation or extend the legislation.” Private Health Insurance Funds: Monetary Reserves (Question No. 1499) Mr Price asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 9 May 2000: (1) Are Health Insurance Funds required to keep reserves; if so, (a) what is the quantum of the reserves required to be held and (b) are they determined by statutory or prudential means? (2) What sums were held by each fund in 1998-99? (1) (a) and (b) Yes. The National Health Act 1953 (the Act) specifies the amount of reserves required by private health insurance funds. Section 73BAB establishes the reserves at $1 million or two contribution months, whichever is the greater. The Act was amended in 1999 to establish new prudential standards for the industry. Divisions 3A and 3B of the Act detail the purpose of the new standards. The exposure draft of the standards has been developed and industry comments are being sought. The new standards must be established by 1 January 2001 in accordance with the Act and the Australian Government Actuary has oversight of the new standards. Reserves as determined by section 73 BAB remain in force until the new standards are promulgated. (2) The information is available from the Private Health Insurance Administration Council’s Annual Report tabled in the Parliament on 7 November 1999. Hazardous Industries: Death Rates (Question No. 1577) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 30 May 2000: (1) Comparing the annual death rates attributable to high-risk industries in Australia, what have been the fatality rates since 1997 in (a) the airline industry, (b) industries using high levels of radioactive substances and (c) health care services, including hospitals. (2) Are adverse medical events (iatrogenesis) among the top ten leading causes of death in Australia; if so, where does iatrogenesis list among the top ten; if not, what does the Government estimate to be the total number of deaths due to iatrogenesis. (3) Can he advise how many citizens die per year or require further medical treatment, due to (a) adverse reactions to correctly prescribed medication, (b) adverse reactions to incorrectly prescribed medication, (c) medical errors during surgery, (d) incorrect medical diagnoses and (e) hospital infections.",156,Medicare Office As At 05 04 2000 Details
267,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) How does the Government keep account of the fatalities arising from the medical treatment it funds. (5) Is there a national inventory of fatalities arising from iatrogenesis. (6) Do the States and Territories maintain inventories of fatalities arising from adverse iatrogenesis. (7) When a patient dies because of medical error, does the (a) Federal Government or (b) State or Territory Government legally require the medical practitioner or hospital concerned to report the death; if not, why not. (1)(a) This falls outside the portfolio responsibility of the Minister. (b) There have never been any deaths reported in Australia attributable to occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. (c) See response to (4) below for information available for health care services including hospitals. (2) No. (3)(a) 153,000 since 1970. (b) Not specifically recorded (c) Not specifically recorded. (d) Not specifically recorded. (e) Not specifically recorded. Information on all deaths including some relating to adverse events is available through the Australian Bureau of Statistics from the Causes of Death Collection. These deaths are classified by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) which include codes for misadventures to patients during surgical and medical care (ICD-9 870-876) and surgical and medical procedures as the cause of abnormal reaction of patient or later complication (ICD–9 878-879). It should be noted that these codes might include cases where the patient had died during surgical attempts to save their life as well as those in which the death occurred due to misadventure. Because the classification is by disease, incorrect prescribed medication, medical errors, incorrect medical diagnosis and hospital infections are not specifically recorded, although each hospital would have records of errors that occurred. The Quality in Australian Health Care Study (QAHCS) suggest that although infection and medication related errors accounted for a significant proportion of adverse events, it was not possible to determine the additional treatment or increased length of stay required for particular types of adverse events. (4) Any sudden or unexpected death that occurs in a hospital is a ‘reportable death’ for the purposes of each State and Territory’s coronial legislation. Therefore these deaths should be reported to the relevant coroner’s office for investigation as appropriate and the coroners’ courts hold records/files of such deaths. (5) There is no specific national inventory of fatalities arising from iatrogenesis. A national reporting system for errors that result in serious injury and death has been identified as a priority area for action by the Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care. (6) Yes. (7) The duty to report a death is covered by State and Territory law, not by Commonwealth legislation. The duty is set out in the Coroners Acts in each Australian jurisdiction. The circumstances in which a death is a reportable death vary between jurisdictions, but generally a death in ‘unusual circumstances’ (which could include adverse medical events) and a death following the administration of an anaesthetic are reportable deaths. The Coroners Acts do not specifically require the reporting of ‘deaths because of medical error’ as whether or not a person has died because of medical error is a matter for the coroner to determine.",157,Medicare Office As At 05 04 2000 Details
268,Dr Wooldridge,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Goods and Services Tax: Overseas Medical Research Grants (Question No. 1608) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister for Health and Aged Care, upon notice, on 6 June 2000: (1) Has his attention been drawn to concern by members of the medical research community that grants from overseas based funding bodies such as the National Institutes of Health in the US and the Wellcome Trust in the UK will be subject to the GST and that no comparable refund will be available, effectively reducing the grant by 10%. (2) Is this concern justified; if so, will he act to ensure that Australian researchers in receipt of overseas sourced grants are not disadvantaged by the GST. (1) I was made aware of the issue. (2) Initial advice from my Department was that GST would apply to the grants but could be claimed back as an input tax credit by an agent of the company residing in Australia. I am aware that this has now been confirmed formally by the ATO. The Government Issues Log, which has the status of a public ruling, states: “Any GST payable on a taxable supply or taxable importation made by a non-resident through a registered agent is payable by the agent. Also, if a non-resident makes a creditable acquisition or importation through a registered resident agent, the agent is entitled to the input tax credit on the acquisition or importation.” This mechanism will ensure that Australian researchers in receipt of overseas sourced grants are not disadvantaged by the GST. Aviation: Separation Breakdowns (Question No. 1642) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 20 June 2000: (1) How many separation breakdowns in controlled airspace have occurred in each year since 1990. (2) Is each separation breakdown in controlled airspace investigated. (3) Which authority or organisation investigates separation breakdowns in controlled airspace. (4) Who makes the decision to investigate or not investigate separation breakdowns in controlled airspace. (5) From those investigations, what factors were found to contribute to separation breakdowns in controlled airspace. (6) Are other categories used for the measurement and recording of airspace incidents, if so, what are they. (7) Are incidents in uncontrolled airspace recorded and reported; if so, by which authority or organisation. (1) The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has provided the following statistics concerning the breakdown of separation occurrences reported to the ATSB for airborne aircraft in Australian controlled airspace. 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 89 89 100 102 98 114 121 124 131 124 (2) The ATSB advises that it is not required to investigate all air safety occurrences. Selective investigation is undertaken to concentrate the Bureau’s resources on in-depth investigations that offer",158,Medicare Office As At 05 04 2000 Details
269,Dr Wooldridge,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,159,Medicare Office As At 05 04 2000 Details
270,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:the greatest potential to enhance air safety. For breakdowns of separation in controlled airspace, each initial report is carefully reviewed to determine what level of ATSB investigation would be appropriate. Airservices advises that its practice is to investigate any occurrence, including separation breakdowns, that on the basis of preliminary information could be attributed to Airservices’ personnel, procedures or systems. (3) See question 2. (4) The ATSB advises that the decision to investigate a separation breakdown in controlled airspace is made by Investigators dedicated to processing initial reports of these occurrences. Where there is any doubt as to the appropriate level of ATSB investigation, the views of the Team Leader, the Deputy Directors or Director of Air Safety Investigation are sought. Airservices advises that all incidents reported by Airservices’ staff are reviewed by Airservices’ management from the operational and safety divisions. The operational line management, responsible for the reporting unit, make a decision based on preliminary evidence, as to whether any Airservices’ personnel, practices or system were attributable to the occurrence. If Airservices is thought to have contributed, an investigation is initiated. The Airservices’ Director of Safety and Standards may also: . require line management to undertake an investigation of an incident which they had previously decided not to investigate; or . undertake an investigation independent of the area responsible for the provision of the Air Traffic Service. (5) The ATSB advises that the factors contributing to separation breakdowns in controlled airspace may include, but are not limited to: . aircraft crew failure to comply with instructions; . air traffic control operator errors; . navigation aid malfunctions; . aircraft equipment malfunctions; . air traffic control equipment malfunctions; and . adverse weather resulting in aircraft diversion from planned track. (6) Yes The ATSB advises that other categories used by the ATSB to classify airspace incidents include: . violations of controlled airspace; . altitude infringements; . turbulence related events; and . wrong track flown by the aircraft. (7) Yes– The ATSB advises that incidents in uncontrolled airspace are required under the Air Navigation Act 1920 to be reported to the ATSB by: . an officer or employee of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA); . an officer or employee of Airservices; or, . a responsible person as defined in the Act (eg a pilot) who becomes aware of an incident. Trade Unions: Fees (Question No. 1735) Mr Bevis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 14 August 2000: Has the Minister received any communication or advice, either written or oral, from the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, his office, Department or anyone acting under his instructions or advice in relation to the payment of union fees by payroll deduction; if so, (a) what was that advice, (b) when was it provided, (c) was that advice communicated to Telstra; if so, what was the nature of that communication and when was it provided; and (d) was that advice communicated to any other Government instrumentality; if so, to which instrumentality and when. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The Minister is unaware of having received any communication or advice, either written or oral, from the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, his office, Department or anyone acting under his instructions or advice in relation to the payment of union fees by payroll deduction. Goods and Services Tax: Prime Minister’s Letter (Question No. 1736) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 14 August 2000: (1) Does his letter to me and other Australians of 20 June 2000 state that some people who have money can afford to minimise their tax through schemes; if so, what action is the government taking to crack down on these schemes. (2) Does his letter say that the old system discriminates against country Australia; if so, will a 10% GST have a more adverse effect on country Australia than metropolitan Australia because prices on many items are already higher in country Australia, and that adding 10% to the cost of the item will increase the city-country price differential. (3) Does his letter state that the old tax system contains hidden taxes; if so, did he expressly reject Labor amendments which would have required the GST to be shown on price tags, and that as a result the GST will itself be a hidden tax. (4) Does his letter describe capital gains tax concessions as a benefit for older Australians, small businesses and farmers; if so, (a) has his government elsewhere described the capital gains tax changes as revenue neutral and (b) if the capital gains tax changes are not revenue neutral, what is the cost to revenue of them. (1) The New Tax System will help ensure that everyone pays a fair share of tax but no more. It cracks down on people who avoid income tax by using loopholes and dealing in the cash economy. The government has also acted on a number of other fronts to remove tax minimisation opportunities formerly available to high wealth individuals, including specific measures to address: . dividends disguised as private company loans; . misuse of charitable trusts to distribute funds overseas; . trust losses; . creation of artificial capital losses; . franking credit trading and dividend streaming; . tax minimisation through luxury car leases; . exploitation of infrastructure borrowings; . abuse of R&D syndication; and . taxation of foreign source income. The New Business Tax System announced by the government will address other flaws in the current tax law that high wealth individuals are able to exploit. (2) Country Australia will benefit greatly from the New Tax System through: . lower transport costs in rural and regional areas;",159,Medicare Office As At 05 04 2000 Details
271,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts",161,Medicare Office As At 05 04 2000 Details
272,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Input tax credits will effectively reduce fuel costs by 9% for registered businesses. Extension of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme to rail and marine transport. Introduction of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme which will significantly reduce the cost of road transport. . reduced business costs of between $7 and $8 billion annually for all Australian businesses, allowing them to compete more effectively with imported goods; . GST-free exports, with the costs to exporters to be reduced by over $3.5 billion (around two thirds of rural produce is exported); and . tax cuts worth some $12 billion a year and a 4% increase in government pensions and allowances. (3) My letter does state that the old tax system contained hidden taxes. The multiple-rate wholesale sales tax was set at the wholesale level, therefore there was no way for consumers to determine how much tax they were paying on their retail purchases. Under the wholesale sales tax system, necessities such as toothpaste were subject to 22% sales tax, while expensive restaurant meals were tax-free. The GST, on the other hand, is set at a single low rate of 10% for taxable items. Retailers are able to identify for consumers those taxable items. Therefore, requiring the GST to be shown on price tags is unnecessary and would increase compliance costs for businesses. The tax on most goods and services can be easily calculated as it is simply one-eleventh of the retail price. (4) The capital gains tax (CGT) concessions announced by the government will result in these taxpayers who are eligible for the concessions paying, on average, a lower rate of tax on capital gains. This results in a cost to revenue in relation to the transactions that would have happened under the old CGT regime. That is, as these transactions would have occurred without the lowering of the CGT rate there is a loss of revenue on these transactions. However, there is a strong body of evidence that suggests that in response to lower rates of taxation on capital gains there will be an increase in the realisation of assets. The increase in the realisation of assets results in more transactions taking place under the new regime than would otherwise have occurred under the old regime. These additional transactions are subject to CGT, resulting in revenue being collected that would not have been collected under the old regime. It is estimated that the increase in revenue from the increase in transactions results in the changes to the taxation of capital gains being mildly revenue positive from 2000-01 to 2004-05. Goods and Services Tax: Family and Community Services Portfolio Compliance (Question No. 1770) Mr Hatton asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 14 August 2000: (1) Is the Minister’s Department and agencies within the Minister’s portfolio compliant in respect of the Goods and Services Tax. (2) What action did the Minister’s Department and agencies within the Minister’s portfolio take to ensure that they were GST ready by 1 July 2000. (3) Is the Minister able to guarantee that no agency within the Minister’s portfolio will suffer negative impacts on its budget or services due to the GST; if not, or if the guarantee was subsequently proved incorrect, would the Minister be prepared to resign. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The chief executives of all agencies within my portfolio provided me with written confirmation in June 2000, that they would be able to comply with The New Tax System from 1 July 2000. (2) The Department of Family and Community Services; Social Security Appeals Tribunal; Child Support Agency; CRS Australia; and Centrelink each established an implementation team, generally involving external consultants to oversight and assist with the process of implementing the Goods and Services Tax.

273,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided theof Finance and Administration throughout the implementation process. Changes were made to systems, policies, procedures and structures to ensure compliance with The New Tax System and GST. The Australian Institute of Family Studies developed and implemented action and contingency plans which involved external and internal training for staff and consultant assistance to upgrade systems, policies and procedures. (3) The implementation and ongoing management of tax reform by agencies is the responsibility of their respective chief executive officers. While the Government will continue to monitor the impact of the implementation of The New Tax System, the reforms are not expected to reduce the level of funding of agencies in this portfolio in real terms. Goods and Services Tax: Job Network Grants (Question No. 1946) Ms Roxon asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 6 September 2000: (1) Have some organisations received Commonwealth Jobs Network grants from his Department that have been grossed up by only 7.2% following the introduction of the GST; if so, why. (2) If a Jobs Network organisation in receipt of a Commonwealth grant was a registered charity and able in the past to claim a wholesale sales tax exemption, is a gross up of its grant of only 7.2% following the introduction of the GST an effective funding cut. (1) No organisations receive grants from the Government for delivering Job Network services. Job Network providers are remunerated for outcomes achieved as determined by tenderers submitting bids in an open tender. The most recent tender closed on 30 July 1999. In submitting prices for this tender, tenderers were asked to bid post GST prices and to include with their bids their estimate of the percentage impact of the Government’s tax reforms. (This estimate was used to adjust prices paid prior to implementation of the New Tax System on 1 July 2000.) (2) At the time of the tender the Government estimated that, on the assumption that cost and price effects are fully passed on, the price impact on the broader industry sector ‘Other Business Services’ – which includes employment services – was expected to be an increase of 7.2 per cent. This information was conveyed to tenderers in the Request for Tender documentation and tenderers were also strongly encouraged to seek professional advice on how the taxation reform package would affect their individual circumstances. The estimates of percentage impact of the Government tax reforms submitted by tenderers varied according to the individual circumstances of tenderers. Prime Minister: United Nations Visit (Question No. 1961) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 7 September 2000: Did he fly to the UN in order to boycott it; if so, why.
