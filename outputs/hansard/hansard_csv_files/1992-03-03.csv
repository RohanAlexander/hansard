We get taunted day by day by on the Fightback package that 'those most in some of the emotionalism attached to a need get the most out of Fightback'. I ask all consumption tax. We have had the courage to of the members of the Opposition to explain say, 'Things are wrong in Australia. We need to us how-when they make a $2 billion cut substantial change; we need to reform taxes. in social welfare, which is the part of the We are going to say very honestly, ahead of Budget designed to help those most in needthe election, that we are going to introduce a they can listen and accept the kind of acuity GST'. that emerged out of the honourable member for Flinders today. But do not any members of the Government for one moment think that there is no such Before dealing with that theme, I would like thing as a consumption tax in Australia today. to say a little about the honourable member The truth of the matter is that the Government for Flinders.

Indeed, He came into this House and, reflecting the the way the Government has engineered that paranoia of his Leader, claimed that somehow has upset most of the motor vehicle retailers the ABC was piased in treating him in that and second-hand car dealers. way. The second thing he came into the House going to find it very difficult to run around and did was to attack the exercise that has the country saying, 'This is a most improper been done by the Treasury as being somehow political exercise. It minimises the impact of politically improper. Let me say that the best inflation resulting from the GST'. But they person to answer that is one of his own excan try to sell that.

But we say that, if they cannot work, He further said: government itself has a responsibility to help them rather than casting them out. . . . as I understand it, is a modelling exercise by the Treasury, which from a purely technical point I now look at the specific proposals the of view is an advance on anything that we've seen Opposition makes to help those in greatest before in this country. need.

When we think back to what the The formula that has been worked out is system was, this is an improvement. A few open to criticism: a parent with one child years back in my electorate I had a case of a pays 18 per cent of salary after some deducfellow earning $700 a week and generouslytions. With five children, the payment grows I say that with real anger-giving his wife to 36 per cent. It shifts up from 18 per cent, $21 a week to support three kids. That was $1 to 27 per cent, to 32 per cent, to 34 per cent a day. Disgusting! He thought he was hard and then to 36 per cent. Some would argue, done by when the rules came in which meant 'How can the Government require a parent to that he then had to increase this amount to 32 pay only an extra two per cent for an extra per cent of his salary because he had three child?'. There may be some valid criticism kids. there. If we look at the tables that are There have been some problems.

The saying that they are not getting enough and spouse pays the money but it never gets to non-custodial parents saying that they are the kids-at least that is the allegation.
