193,The Speaker,"Order! It being 9.30Tuesday, 11 October 2005 ----Gellibrand Electorate: Higher Education Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (4.00 pm)-On2 September this year I met, as I do each year, with 12 students from a number of high schools within my electorate of Gellibrand. They were from Maribyrnong College, Bayside Secondary College, Caroline Chisholm College, Altona Secondary College, Braybrook College, Gilmore College for Girls and Footscray City College. The top-order issue that came up in these discussions was access to university places and the costs of attending university. These young people were universally concerned about their future and their ability to access higher educational opportunities-and, if they do access them, how they will be able to afford to pay for their spot. Worryingly, research released last week from the Monash University study, Unequal access to university places, has given this discussion even more meaning. The study has shown that only 46 per cent of public school students who apply for university received an offer of a place, which is in stark contrast to the 77 per cent of young people from private schools. Approximately 67 per cent of schoolchildren in my electorate are attending government schools, and this study does not bode well for their future. According to figures released in the Age on 6 November, the City of Maribyrnong ranks 29th out of 31 municipalities in Melbourne in terms of median entry scores. The figures for Hobsons Bay are not a great deal higher. These statistics are not good, but they also do not accurately reflect the range of challenges that many of these schools face, such as chronic underfunding by the federal government, English being the second language for many students, the large number of new arrivals, particularly refugees, and some of the relatively low education levels of parents. In fact, the schools do a marvellous job considering some of the difficulties thrown in their way. Of course, there are many bright students, such as the ones I met with from schools in my electorate, who will achieve much higher entry scores, and for others who do not, there are often complex social factors involved. But the point I want to make today is that our education system should have the resources and support to help our children overcome these barriers, not entrench disadvantage. The increasing cost of university is becoming an issue for young people in my area and their parents. Average HECS fees have doubled under the Howard government and the repayment threshold is dropping in real terms. They are legitimately concerned about the financial burden their further education will place upon their families. These young people who came to my office are just a handful of the many thousands in my electorate who have the opportunity to address disadvantage in Melbourne’s west. They are bright, active and engaged, but they are being shut out by the Howard government’s lack of vision in education policy. The government is tired and out of ideas and is neglecting the future of young Australians. The young people in my electorate deserve much more and the schools that they go to need more support from this government. MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Notices
194,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley) Took The Chair At 4.00 Pm.,"Fisher Electorate: Roads ate that once again have made the top 20 worse roads in the region list of the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland. These roads are controlled and supposedly maintained by the Queensland Labor government. This problem comes on the back of the well-publicised headache that is the Queensland health system as well as the problems encountered with the electricity network last year. I await with dread the onset of hot summer weather, which already appears to be arriving early on the Sunshine Coast, and wonder if the power grid will stand up to the demand for electricity from ordinary Queenslanders. I am glad that a state election is not really too far away and that the people of the Sunshine Coast and elsewhere in Queensland will have the chance to make things right by electing a Liberal-led coalition government. The road that I am most concerned about is again Maroochydore Road between Kunda Park and the Bruce Highway. This road marks the boundary between my electorate of Fisher and the neighbouring electorate of Fairfax to the north. It is not the first time that this particularly poor road has made it onto the top 20 poor roads list-in essence, a list of the bottom 20 key roads in Queensland. It is a regular feature on the list collated by the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland, the most trusted and respected motoring organisation in the state. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be concerned to hear that this section of Maroochydore Road is littered with potholes, bumps and humps, and repair jobs have added to the hazards. The road is regularly flooded, and I dread to see what will happen when next the heavens open and we get a heavy downpour. How will Maroochydore Road stand up to it? It has a weary bridge at its Eudlo Creek crossing-one lane each way-that is also in dire need of an upgrade. The remarkable thing is that this road is one of the main roads between Nambour and Maroochydore. For those visitors who follow the signs up the highway to Maroochydore this is their first glimpse of the centre of business of the Sunshine Coast. Heavy trucks use this road but, quite honestly, I do not think the surface is up to the task. One of my staff had a rock thrown up from a passing truck, damaging his headlight. That situation should never arise on the main arterial road into a growing area such as Maroochydore. A second road on the RACQ list is Stanley River Road near Maleny. Respondents to this organisation’s survey have said that this road has a surface that is slippery and loose, the corners are tight, there are very steep gradients and no guardrails. Maleny also suffers with the Maleny-Kenilworth Road, which is affected by a long list of afflictions including loose surfaces, slippery surfaces, narrow lanes and narrow bridges. Motorists have suggested that parts of this road need rebuilding and that it needs more regular maintenance. Frankly, the Queensland Labor government has made a mess of providing basic services to the people of the Sunshine Coast. I ask the Queensland Labor government to show some initiative and compassion and investigate repairing these many problem roads on the Sunshine Coast and elsewhere.

Representatives from antallergy.org met with the health minister, David Llewellyn, on 25 August this year and, I am pleased to say, were successful in gaining a commitment from the state Labor government to extending the existing program and retaining the Tasmaniandeveloped knowledge and expertise. Over the coming weeks the group will be in contact with the minister’s department to check on progress and assist in defining the ways ahead. This group maintains an internet site, www.antallergy.org, which includes a discussion forum where others affected by jack jumper stings can share their experiences and their concerns. Through this web site the group has also launched an online petition to assist those whose lives are in danger through jack jumper ant stings. Over 860 people over the last few days have now signed the e-petition, which calls on the Tasmanian government to immediately allocate the funding necessary to provide lifesaving treatment to those Tasmanians at the greatest risk of death. As the moves to an extended trial take shape we hope that those with expertise in ant sting allergy will contribute to the body of knowledge. The group is currently meeting on a weekly basis and other interested people who want to either provide or receive support can visit the web site or contact the group at antallergy@netspace.net.au. I would like to place on the record my appreciation for the work done by the advocacy group and mention in particular the role played by my neighbour Marcus Allan, whose son Hamish’s life is in jeopardy if bitten by these jack jumpers. Marcus has worked tirelessly with my office to prepare an excellent article that features on the front page of my latest newsletter, the Franklin Focus. Not surprisingly, this article has generated a wonderful response from sufferers, who now realise that this support and advocacy group exists and are willing to ensure that the vaccine will soon be available to the many sufferers throughout Tasmania and the mainland of Australia. Flinders Electorate: Health Flinders Electorate: Education Heritage) (4.09 pm)-I rise today to address two issues within the electorate of Flinders. First is the question of the health needs of residents around Western Port. In particular, I want to acknowledge the fact that the Lang Lang Community Medical Centre has been under threat over the last few months. It was under threat because of its success. The brilliant young doctor there, Natasha Aylen-who came in as part of a rural transaction centre program for Lang Lang-had been so popular that she had been overworked. The question had been whether or not she would be able to continue her work. To continue, she needed special approval for a doctor from the Commonwealth to come into this area-that approval would not have been available but for the intervention of Minister Tony Abbott. I am delighted to inform the House and my electorate that we presented the case to Tony Abbott and we had a response from the minister within a matter of weeks.

That is a tremendous result. Neither would have been possible without the work of the Commonwealth in providing for the rural transaction centre and the support of Minister Abbott in providing a special exemption for this area. It will build on providing new doctors for Grantville and Koo Wee Rup. The next project which we are working on is a doctor for the town of Tooradin and the coastal villages. These are tremendously important initiatives. The second area which I wish to discuss today is in relation to primary and secondary school funding. I am delighted to be able to inform the House that we have just received Commonwealth approval for over $827,000 for 20 schools under the Investing in Our Schools Program. Schools such as Balnarring, Bass Valley, Bayles, Boneo, Cranbourne South, Crib Point, Devon Meadows, Dromana, Hastings, Hastings Westpark, Mount Martha, Pearcedale, Powlett River, Red Hill Consolidated, Somers, Somerville, Somerville Rise, Tooradin, Tyabb and Tyabb Railway Station Primary School were all successful. These are tremendous results, wonderful principals, great towns, tremendous students. Things such as playground equipment, classroom improvements and shade sails are all vitally needed. I compare this with what is happening in relation to the Somerville Secondary College. The Commonwealth recently provided an additional $1.7 million in funding to the Somerville Secondary College, which is currently being constructed. The state’s response was to take that funding away and reduce its own funding by the very amount which the Commonwealth gave. I call on the Victorian government to return the $1.7 million and allow the Somerville Secondary College to proceed. (Time expired) Mr HT Lee HT Lee. HT died on 26 July after complications from heart surgery. He was 56 years old. HT Lee was a remarkable and principled man who lived the values that he believed in. He fought for the causes that he believed in. HT was genuinely an activist in the pure sense of the word. He was born in Malaysia and studied in New Zealand before moving to Australia and becoming a citizen. HT was a photojournalist. He also worked for the union movement. As an activist he worked tirelessly on issues to do with East Timor. In September 1999, HT was one of a handful of journalists who remained in the UN compound in Dili. The Indonesian military and militia were intent on destroying it. Many other journalists evacuated, but HT remained. He saw that the UN staff were about to evacuate. This meant that the 3,000 East Timorese who had sheltered in the compound would be left behind. He organised a petition, persuaded the 20 or so remaining journalists to sign it and gathered UN police officers’ signatures in his own persistent way. As a result, all 3,000 East Timorese were evacuated to Darwin with the UN staff. This is a man who stood out from the crowd in his determination and his ability to make a difference. John Martinkus, in the Green Left Weekly on 3 August 2005, said: HT was someone who worked on principles and often denied accepting payment for his work.

He believed in change and helped make it possible and should be remembered for that. Max Stahl, a producer, director, cameraman and friend of HT is quoted on the crikey.com web site in an article by Hugo Kelly. I doubt I would be able to articulate it any better. Max Stahl said: HT was a real fighter in a just cause, and in his own personal life. He was the kind of guy you could count on when things got tough, when some might find themselves busy, or called away; the kind of guy who would stick with a struggle or an issue for as long as it took because he believed in it and because he believed the truth matters. He was a warm friend, a decent human being, a brave man. I can think of no better epitaph for a man of this standing than to say ‘he believed the truth matters’. Vale, HT Lee.

Indeed, time after time, people who have operations find that they cannot go into the recovery wards because there is no bed to go to or, if they come through emergency, there is no bed in the main hospital and they have to stay in the corridors in emergency. It is not satisfactory. So it was with quite some surprise and dismay that I noted that on Friday the Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie, came to Townsville and made two announcements. He announced $3.7 million for the Townsville Hospital to address 800 extra operations when there are 12,000 in the queue and, at the same time, offered $5 million to the Dairy Farmers Stadium to put in 4,000 extra seats for the football. Our community was just outraged and appalled that that is the way the Queensland government would get its priorities on health. I have been doing a survey in my electorate. I have written to every person in my electorate in relation to the state of the hospital, and the feedback is that the staff who look after the patients are nothing less than wonderful but that the administration, the facilities at the hospital and the funding for the hospital are woeful. Also coming through very clearly in the responses that I have had to my survey of the electorate is the state of the dental services that are available to Queenslanders, in that people have to wait four years to get dental procedures done. Goodness me, what has happened to our state when you have to wait four years to have your teeth fixed? That is an appalling situation. It is no wonder that the Beattie government is under so much pressure in Queensland. The latest alarm bells sounded when my councils told me that the Beattie government has now instructed all its ministers to raid departments for as much money as possible to put into health. That means that there will be a knee-jerk reaction, where money will be spent inefficiently and all the other normal courses of business will not go on as they should; they will be very much affected by this raiding of cash. Please, Mr Beattie, fix the hospital system in Queensland. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Statements By Members
199,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (4.15 Pm),"About four months ago, at the time of the last QueenFuel Prices Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (4.18 pm)-I want to raise the issue of the high cost of petrol and the impact it is having on the community I represent. Some time back, I took up the cost of petrol with the ACCC because I believed that collusion was occurring, in that price rises seemed to always spike on a Thursday, coinciding with pension day. I got little satisfaction from the ACCC then, and that was at a time when the cost of petrol was 94c a litre. At the peak of the petrol price increases, the cost of petrol went to $1.40 over a 20-month period. My concern for the people I represent is that higher petrol prices will inevitably lead into an inflationary spiral and will put upward pressure on interest rates. The very token tax cuts that 90 per cent of my community received through the last budget have been eroded with the increased costs that petrol, education, child care and the like have forced onto our community. Despite the recent drop in prices over the last few weeks, all the predictions are that the price of crude oil could hit somewhere in the vicinity of $US80 a barrel, which would inevitably push up the price of petrol at the bowsers to about $1.50 a litre. My concern on behalf of the community I represent is that this government does absolutely nothing in the face of these pressures. It has washed its hands of the problem and has failed to take any decisive action. In the last couple of days I looked at the petrol-pricing snapshot released by the ACCC which showed that between 30 June and 30 September 2005 refiner margins actually doubled from $4 to $8 per barrel. I would have thought that the least the government could do was to instruct the ACCC to undertake a formal investigation of recent pricing practices in the industry to help put an end to the obvious profiteering that has gone on in the post Hurricane Katrina era. Further, with a record surplus of $13.6 billion, I believe the government has scope to ease the pain either by cutting the excise or by further taxation relief measures. Interestingly enough, in 2001 the government listened to community opinion and froze the excise at 38c a litre and abolished automatic indexation increases. Why isn’t it taking action now, given the much stronger budgetary position that the government finds itself in? Excise is a regressive tax and is hitting families on lower incomes very hard. It is estimated that a cut of even 10c a litre in the excise would cost the government about $3.8 billion less than(Time expired) Hinkler Electorate: Australian Labor Party in Hinkler by overriding the decision of local branches when preselecting a candidate to contest the state seat of Bundaberg at the next state election. Because of the shadowy backroom and factional deals, the ALP powerbrokers have recently overturned a 60 per cent vote for one candidate in favour of another. There is no doubt the party would have struggled to hold the seat in the wake of the Dr Death scandal and the Beattie government’s clear neglect of the region. This will only compound it. One of the privileges of party membership is being able to take part in the selecting of candidates for local upcoming elections. For factional deals to overrule the choice of the grassroots membership shows a total disregard for core supporters and for local party members.

200,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (4.21 Pm),"Yet again the ALP has trampled on its own grassrootsback because of Labor’s affirmative action rules and, although I do not want to enter into a discussion of the personalities or the qualities of the candidates, many people are appalled at the process used to select ALP candidates in the Bundaberg area-one of them being my predecessor, the former member for Hinkler, Brian Courtice. At the local level, party preselections are generally closely contested, with only a handful of votes between the leading contenders. If the head office or state organisation controlling half the votes degenerates into a factional arrangement, the weight of these out-of-town votes will always swamp the local decision. The ALP state director, Milton Dick, said to me that the National Party had its own problems. Not true, Mr Deputy Speaker. The National Party, at its preselections, allows its head office only four votes, a token representation in the selection of candidates. So, if these dodgy ALP practices and the impotence of local ALP members continue and if they continue to deliver unrepresentative results, what confidence can the wider general public have in Labor candidates when it comes to casting their vote on polling day? And, more particularly, what confidence can they have after the fiasco of the Bundaberg hospital scandal? Mr Sabin Zahirovic some months ago for a school based community function. ThereI met and heard speak Mr Sabin Zahirovic. He is the school captain of Ashfield Boys High School. I think Mr Zahirovic represents the best of people who have come to Australia from underprivileged backgrounds in other countries. Mr Zahirovic came from war-torn Bosnia to make Australia his home. I have a copy of a letter that Mr Zahirovic wrote to Mr GaryC Smith and members of the 3 Transport Association about ANZAC Day of this year. I want to read some of it into Hansard: Following my nomination to be the bearer of the 3 Transport Association banner, I have come to the realisation of the gravity and the honour and pride this opportunity has invigorated in me. To be part of the ANZAC Day procession was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for someone like myself. I cannot emphasise the gratitude that I feel towards you personally, the RSL and members of 3 Transport Association. My family, peers and teachers are extremely proud, and rightly so. It is an immeasurable honour for a young person to be associated with such an integral part of Australia’s history and identity. As a survivor of the war, genocide and ethnic cleansing in my birth country of BosniaI recognise more than most people the value of Defence Force Personnel. I also empathise with those who have lost loved ones in war, as one life is an immense loss for the nation as a whole. That is why I recognise that it is a necessity to allow the ANZAC legacy to continue transcending the generations who are yet to come. The privilege of carrying your banner in the ANZAC Day March is one way which you have cemented this process of remembrance. As I have said to Mr John Walsh, it is a true honour to be associated with such a dignified organisation and part of the Australian identity. It is important to continue the strong ties between the school body and the military history and association of the area. That is why I will do everything possible to inform others of the school’s affiliation with 3 Transport Association, the Coo-ee Marchers and other military contingents over the last century. This is the best of the Australian story.

Eden-Monaro Electorate In recent times there has been some criticism from the other side of politics regarding the government’s regional programs-various regional assistance programs we have had over a number of years. What those opposite have done in recent times is effectively cherry picking. In fact, when put to the real test, it has been shown that the criticisms are totally political and not substantial. I thought that today I would quickly provide an example of the benefit of regional programs. Often you do not see the benefit until a little further down the track. In that sense, a few years ago, after the announcement that we would have a multipurpose wharf at Eden for Defence, the local community, particularly Sapphire Coast Tourism, saw an opportunity to utilise this facility beyond the use by Defence. Sapphire Coast Tourism was successful in getting $31,900 under what was then our Regional Assistance Program. The aim was described as follows: The project will promote the potential of Eden as an International Cruise destination. To harness Eden’s potential, an innovative creative promotional concept will be used to promote Eden as an International Cruise Destination and capture the current focus on Australia as a place to visit. That was on 8 February 2002. I am pleased to say that on 7 November, in a few weeks time, we will see the first cruise ship, the 30,000-tonne P&O Pacific Princess, with 700 passengers, coming to Eden. Another six cruise ships will come between now and March. The ships range from P&O’s 45,000-tonne Artemis, carrying 1,200 passengers on an around-the-world cruise, to the much smaller Oceanic Princess, carrying 76 passengers on a cruise from Sydney to Hobart. This is great news-seven big cruise ships between now and March coming into Eden, spending some time there, with international visitors or locals coming and looking at that part of the far South Coast. It is a great example of how a relatively very small amount of money, $31,900, has translated. The money was given to Michelle Robinson from Sapphire Coast Tourism to go out there, market Eden, find out about the cruise ships and ensure that our tourism industry, which is 10 per cent of our work force in Eden-Monaro, continues to grow-and grow substantially and in a new area that was not there before. agreed to on 10 October 2005, the time for members’ statements has concluded.

I am pleased to hear the ABC referring to it as a terrorist atrocity. It was not undertaken by militants; it was undertaken by terrorists-terrorists who killed four of our fellow Australians as well as 15 Indonesians and a Japanese citizen. The speeches were followed by very dignified and moving remarks by two local members whose constituents were particularly affected by the murders in Bali-the members for Paterson and Newcastle, from the Hunter, where three of the four Australians who were killed lived. I would like to take this opportunity to add my condolences and those of all of the people in my electorate to the families of Colin and Fiona Zwolinski and Jennifer Williamson, all from Newcastle, and Brendan Fitzgerald, of Busselton. Let us also remember the families of the 15 Balinese killed-hard working people who died providing the services which we as tourists take for granted. I visited Bali more than 20 years ago and have had an abiding affection for the place since. Like the Minister for Health and Ageing, as seen in his article in the Courier-Mail, I will probably go back there simply as a way of defying the terrorists and showing support for the people of Bali. I want to add my voice to the praise expressed yesterday for the rapid and effective response to this latest atrocity by both the Indonesian and Australian governments and by the defence forces, law enforcement agencies, emergency services and health and other professionals, including those of Indonesia. I saw General Pastika there on the spot; I had the honour of being at a dinner with him when I attended an Australian ministerial conference in Jakarta two years ago. I expect the Indonesian security forces will eventually hunt the terrorists down as they so efficiently tracked down the murderers and terrorists from the first Bali bombing. We have witnessed a most impressive and efficient cooperation between all these agencies in the care of the wounded and the bereaved. I hope Indonesia will track the terrorists down as it did with our cooperation before.

204,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),"BeforeI call the first speaker, I note that",134,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
205,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (4.31 Pm),"Yesterday the Prime Minister and the Leaderattack. The four Australian dead in Bali join the 88 killed in the first Bali bombing in October 2002. They join Sam Ly killed in London in the July bombings. They join four other Australians who died in the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States. They also join a former constituent of mine, Malki Roth, who was killed at the Sbarro pizza shop, also by a suicide bomber with a backpack-the first Australian killed that way-back in 2000. These Australian victims of the jihad against Western society being waged by jihadists, whether al-Qaeda, its South-East Asian franchise, Jemaah Islamiah, or Hamas, should all be remembered. TodayI want to look at why these Australians died, at the people who killed them and at what our response might be. Once again this week we have been told by various commentators that these attacks were the result of the presence of Australian forces in Iraq. But when we look at the pattern of attacks it is clear that Australians have been a target since at least 2002, before the invasion of Iraq. We know from statements by Indonesian jihadists that their grievances against Australia go back to our role in the independence of East Timor, which they see as part of an Islamic world stolen by perfidious Christians-even though the great majority of East Timorese were and are Christians. These murderers and terrorists also noted our participation in the first Gulf War of 1991 and our role in the liberation of Afghanistan from the mediaeval regime of the Taliban. Of course, our participation in the war in Iraq has made us a target for attacks of this kind, but that is only part of the picture. This is obviously true, and I do not know why the government bothers denying it, but the connection is not as simple as those commentators who want to blame the war in Iraq exclusively are willing to admit. The Madrid bombings and the London bombings struck at capital cities of countries prominently identified as members of the coalition of the willing. So far there has been no such attack on Australia. YetI note the concerning comments of the Deputy Commissioner of the Victoria Police in the immediate aftermath of Bali 2. He said that it is only a matter of time-that it is inevitable that these people will be able to penetrate the so far marvellous work of the security agencies and the defence forces and bring their evil to Australia. I note his remarks in the context of the forthcoming Commonwealth Games that the Commonwealth government has some 1,800 people from the defence forces deployed for Melbourne. The Victoria Police have 20,000 people ready for the Commonwealth Games and a further 5,000 private security people prepared as their auxillaries in Melbourne. Victoria is as well prepared as possible-I have personally looked into this; some of the activities will be in my electorate-and I congratulate the state government. But how can anyone prepare for a single person, a fanatic who comes with a backpack full of explosives and, more devilish, ball bearings and nails? The next step will be for these people to do what they so infamously did in other places-to cover the shrapnel in rat poison and other things that prevent blood coagulating or poison so that the victims suffer afterwards. Al-Qaeda seems to have franchised its South-East Asian operations to Jemaah Islamiah. However, Jemaah Islamiah has an agenda of its own, which is allied with al-Qaeda but not identical to it. JI’s agenda is not primarily to attack Australia or to kill Australians; its objective is to take power in Indonesia, to make Indonesia the centre of a great Islamist state in South-East Asia, embracing Malaysia, Brunei, East Timor, southern Thailand and the southern Philippines. Its means to that end are to attack the Indonesian economy and political system and to prevent Indonesia becoming a stable, prosperous democracy and thus immune from the MAIN COMMITTEE poisonous doctrines of jihadist Islam. It is abusing a great monotheistic religion, Islam, which has nothing to do with the political ideology that these people seek to perpetrate. Twenty-year-old Joe Frost asked if this was about religion. The brilliant speech of that young man in the Newcastle cathedral made me think about the motivations of the terrorists. As I have said, it is true that Iraq is a factor: it is a small factor in a world view, particularly with the terrorists in Indonesia. The Jemaah Islamiah people have other agendas, mainly against the Indonesian government, but they all, like all the Jihadi International, have a pervading world view that transcends all their dark deeds. It is best described by Bassam Tibi, a Muslim professor at Gottingen University, who said a few months after September 11: Both sides should acknowledge candidly that although they might use identical termsA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 4.39 pm to 4.58 pm Gottingen University, who was talking about the difference in the understanding of terms. He said: Both sides should acknowledge candidly that although they might use identical terms, these mean different things to each of them. The word peace, for example, implies to a Muslim the extension of Dar al-Islam-or House of Islam-to the entire world. This is completely different from the Enlightenment concept of eternal peace that dominates Western thought. Only when the entire world is a Dar al-Islam will it be a Dar a-Salam, or House of Peace. That is the view of an extremist jihadist ideologist; that is not the view of mainstream Islam. Driving Australians out of Bali and wrecking the Indonesian tourism industry centred in Bali is key to part of Jemaah Islamiah’s strategy. Tourism is an engine of growth in developing countries, as Thailand, in particular, has demonstrated. The whole of Indonesia has huge tourist potential, but at the moment Bali is by far the country’s biggest tourism revenue earner. It is also a major portal for Western ideas and Western influence to enter Indonesia. JI want to destroy it for both those reasons. From their point of view, Bali is a target and killing Australian tourists is a collateral benefit, however macabre that sounds. The fact that the Balinese are Hindus is convenient from the jihadist point of view, as they are polytheists, not ‘people of the book’. They are worse than Christians, even worse than Jews and can be killed with impunity, according to this mad, evil ideology represented by the tiny minority that supports JI in Indonesia. It is important for Australia to continue to support the people of Bali and Indonesia and to continue to support the great democratic experiment in Indonesia and the wonderful work of President Yudhoyono. In May this year, I had the opportunity to meet 25 people from the new democratic parliament at a seminar at the Centre for Democratic Institutions here in Australia, which was cojointly held in Jakarta. Someone recently showed me a T-shirt which is currently popular in London. It says, ‘Stuff al-Qaeda-I’m taking the tube.’ The actual word used is stronger than ‘stuff’, but I will not use the expression in this parliamentary venue. Knowing the spirit of Australians, we will soon say, ‘Stuff JI-I’m going to Bali.’ After the 2002 bombings, the Indonesian police and courts acted with great speed and efficiency in tracking down those responsible. I hope that they will be equally successful in this case, although, as the bomb carriers are dead, it may prove more difficult this time. But catchMAIN COMMITTEE",134,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
206,Mr Danby,"Before the suspension, I was quoting Bassam Tibi, a Muslim professor ating the small fry is only a relatively minor part of the necessary response to these attacks. More important is finding and breaking up the political leadership behind these attacks-the ones who recruit deluded village youths and turn them into homicidal zombies. It is true, as many commentators have said, that groups like JI are not hierarchical organisations which can be killed by cutting off their heads. They are loose networks with many heads. By reducing the heads the network’s effectiveness is reduced-at least for a while. It was very alarming to hear Sidney Jones, probably the best acknowledged expert on Indonesian jihadism from the International Crisis Group, say that Jemaah Islamiah has established a new super secret special force unit. She argued that there are major cleavages in extremist Islam in Indonesia-cleavages which, I suggest, intelligent people in the Indonesian and Australian academic, security and police establishments ought to be able to use to help divide and capture the extremists who are behind the murders of our fellow Australians and the innocent people of Bali in the most recent attack. The jihadi terrorists seem to be led by Azahari and Noordin Top, who are the bomb maker and financier of the particularly violent subfaction of JI which Sidney Jones identified in her interview on Lateline on 3 October, the week after the Bali bombings. I know from examples in Israel that democratic societies learn to adapt strongly to suicide bombers. United action by a society like Australia or Indonesia can effectively end support for terrorists. Defeat of terrorism will require strong efforts by Indonesia. I spoke in praise of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono before, and I retain my high opinion of him. He is a vast improvement on his predecessor. He was elected by a coalition of forces which include Islamic parties whose views are not necessarily all that different to JI’s-although they are democratic parties and not terrorist groups. No Indonesian president can afford to alienate moderate Islamic opinion in Indonesia. This is presumably why he has been reluctant to tackle JI’s-which in Indonesian means Islamic community-head-on. The people of Indonesia probably understand that this group-as the recent ASPI paper shows-has a long history going back to Darul Islam, which killed 20,000 to 40,000 people in Indonesia in the early 1960s. This militant, extremist minority has a long history in Indonesia. We should not underestimate the difficulties under which the Indonesians have to act against those who would return the whole world to the 12th century. However, the failure to ban JI formally would not matter so much if we could be confident that Indonesia was serious about putting the organisation out of action in practice. Unfortunately, the saga of the trial of Abu Bakar Bashir does not necessarily engender such confidence. It is striking that moderate opinion leaders in Indonesia who supported President Yudhoyono’s election are starting to lose a bit of confidence on this issue. Endi Bayuni, the influential editor of the Jakarta Post, wrote last week: No-one is blaming the president for Saturday’s attack but the public expects him to do better than his predecessor. There will be no rest for the president and his security advisers until they catch the perpetrators. Of course, the President of Indonesia has a difficult task; he cannot just arrest people and throw them in jail as Suharto used to. Indonesia must become a society ruled by laws, not by presidential decree. Both Indonesians and Australians have a right to expect him to take firm action against terrorist groups like JI. At the moment, Indonesian law does not give the government the same powers that Australia has, and perhaps the new democratic parliamentarians MAIN COMMITTEE of Indonesia, whom I met in May and who are such decent people, ought to consider those kinds of things. I will conclude by saying that the second Bali bombing is the latest twist in Australia’s tangled relations with Indonesia since the fall of the Suharto dictatorship in 1998. This relationship reached a low point during the liberation of East Timor and a high point during the outpouring of sympathy and money in the aftermath of the Boxing Day tsunami. Now it is under strain again, with many Australians asking questions about a country which allows a man like Abu Bakar Bashir, who is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Indonesians as well as 92 Australians, to get away with a few months in jail while nine young Australians face the death penalty for drug offences-offences for which I believe they should be prosecuted with alacrity but not face the death penalty. I am not defending their stupidity or their activities, but in my view the disparity in treatment is striking and serves only to undermine what is Australia’s most important bilateral relationship. Australia must continue to work closely with Indonesia both at the government level and at the level of civil society to make that relationship grow closer and stronger. The people who carried out the Bali atrocity hope to wreck that relationship. We must make sure that they do not succeed. ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (5.07 pm)-I am pleased to join this debate but-like, I am sure, all those contributing to it-I wish it were not necessary for the parliament to hold it. We are, in a condolence motion, combining our concern for those who have been killed in natural disasters in Guatemala, where the entire side of a mountain has swamped all beneath it and where the hand of God has wreaked havoc upon the unsuspecting, and, equally, our concern for those who have been killed in Pakistan, India and Afghanistan, where the hand of God has shaken hard, just as it did on Boxing Day in the same general region. Our concern for people in the subcontinent region is most profound-they are people who are very familiar to us-as it is for those in Guatemala. The member for Melbourne Ports made an expansive contribution to this debate-quite understandably so, because he is proudly a member of the Jewish community of Australia. Whilst he did not mention that, he can speak with great observation from that perspective about the real hurt and impact of those who seek to create a disruption in the good conduct of people of many different religious backgrounds. He was right to talk about the evil of Bali both in 2002 and 2005. Perhaps this debate will centre more on that than the other two Godinduced natural disasters. The Bali bombings in both years make no sense to anybody with any intelligence, but unfortunately we are dealing with people who are preying on those who are, in a lot of ways, illiterate-unable to read and write the language that they speak. They are simply persuaded by those with the biggest voice, the biggest set of guns or the biggest set of thugs around them. They are told simplistic stories such as: ‘If you’ve got a problem, blame them. It is because of them that things aren’t working the way you want them to, so extract more than a pound of flesh by targeting them; they don’t matter.’ Yet those who are the true followers of Islam, as the member for Melbourne Ports reflected, know that the Koran itself talks about how God created many tribes. The Jewish traditions talk about the same thing, just as the Christian traditions talk about the same thing-that God created many tribes so that they could travel the world and all get to know each other.

207,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Minting to know each other comes a sense of knowledge, just as the very best science outcomes come from the catalyst of difference introduced to something that is the same. In homogenous, monocultural societies around the world, there are people who stand out. I had a Korean girl on an exchange program in Rockhampton some years ago say to me that the thing she found most astonishing about Australia was all the differences in the faces and the range of people in our community. She said-and I do not know if it is right-that in Seoul if you see someone who is not Korean you know they are a tourist. That is simply not true in Australia. In fact, I have the most culturally diverse of all the electorates in Queensland. I have people who have come from all the faiths and all the lands to be a part of the Australian family. It is critically important that every one of them feels a sense of confidence that they are connected to, belong to and have a responsibility for the business of Australia. It is the time of the holy month of Ramadan for the Muslim community, and the Islamic Society of Algester throw a big barbecue on Saturday nights during Ramadan. The community fast between sun-up and sundown-I do not know how they manage to do that-to test their faith; I do not know how they do not get cranky in the process. But many of my mates do not seem to have that problem. But at 10 o’clock on a Saturday night there is an enormous barbecue and everyone comes together. Last Saturday night at Algester mosque was a time of enormous sombre reflection on the hurt inflicted upon innocents in Bali both in 2002 and 2005 and upon the hurt inflicted upon those innocents in Pakistan in particular. Members may have forgotten, but in my electorate was the first mosque anywhere in the world that was burnt or damaged as a result of the September 11 bombings of 2001, the Kuraby mosque. The Islamic Society of Kuraby responded by not blaming the broad Australian community for the actions of one person. Instead, they said, ‘Let us not condemn all Australians because someone has done something so silly as to torch the mosque.’ It was an old Anglican Church building in Kuraby which was used by the Islamic society as a mosque. They built a new mosque in its place. To their great credit, the people around Sunnybank, Eight Mile Plains and, indeed, Kuraby, came to the mosque the morning after the fire and apologised to Imam Yusuf Peer for what had occurred. Equally, the Bosnian born community that worship at the Islamic Society of Eight Mile Plains-and they are not the only ones who worship there-have walked away from hurt and conflict based on ethnic and religious lines in their old country to find a real peace and certainty here in Australia. They cry tears of concern for Australians killed. They fight back tears of real concern for all who have been killed. That is their way. They have been through too much hurt themselves. They understand very clearly the sorts of bloodshed and torment that happen along ethnic and religious lines. I know that the Somalian born community equally have been through all of that, and they are in my own electorate. I think Australians in reflecting upon the very poor conduct of a very small group of people in Bali need to remind themselves that we as a nation have to do better than those people that we are angry at. We are as a nation literate; we are as a nation intelligent; we are as a nation multicultural, culturally diverse in every possible way. Not only are we a nation which says to people new to Australia, ‘You are free to be who you are,’ but we challenge them on an everyday basis to be that for Australia. We are an example to the rest of the world of a nation where difference is celebrated and where people are challenged to contribute something that is perhaps different to the business of growing a stronger nation. We are as a nation not a counMAIN COMMITTEE try which pushes people to hide away in corners. It is absolutely critical that we do not create a set of victims in our own society on top of the victims that exist in other societies, that we in fact go out of our way to cross the street and embrace the difference that might happen to be in our schools and in our suburbs, that we invite people to be part of community groups and challenge them to contribute all that they are to the business of Australia. That is what we do as a nation; we do it darn well, and so we must. Australians are and must continue to be an example to those few with the loud voices and the big guns and the big thugs that violence and attack on innocents is not ever the way to get your point across, that this cowardly way of killing innocents should never be rewarded and that there is no place in paradise for Jihadists, there is no place in paradise for extremists and there is no place in paradise for those who set out to murder others to try to prove a point. I make one point which some might think I should be careful to make, because the popular view is that maybe we should try to contain that difference and try to get people to assimilate-in other words, change who they are and fit into the mould. I make the point about the dress code that Australia does not have. We actually do not have a dress code in this country. If we did, we could introduce on-the-spot fines for bad fashion, I suspect. The other week I went and talked to students from the Islamic School of Brisbane and found bright and intelligent young ladies making choices. I said, ‘Freedom of choice, as long as you freely make that choice-you are not being forced to wear clothes that your parents or others are inflicting upon you-then I respect the choices you make.’ One girl said, ‘I wear a hijab because I want people to know of my virtue and of my love of God.’ That was an interesting comment. I told her that it was a pretty proud statement to make and that she should continue to hold that view and congratulated her for it. Whilst others might say, ‘Let’s not have this; let’s do something different,’ we need to understand the fundamental point that we do not have dress codes in Australia and that people who make and exercise their right to wear certain things must take a certain amount of responsibility for the decisions they make. We need to be very certain when we have discussions about dress that we are not in fact feeding into the fervid hate behind the few who perpetrated the crimes against us all in Bali. We need to make certain that we do not create victims in our own society. We need to make certain that we give a sense of attachment and commitment and connection and that we challenge people to be part of this nation and do not drive them away. We need to make certain that people have confidence in their belonging in Australia. The way in which the Islamic community is now reacting strongly to violations of their religion by those few in other places and rightly condemning those actions needs to be noted in this place. We need Muslims in Australia to take charge of their religion and the public relations associated with their religion at this time. We need Muslims in Australia to stand ready as an example to the evil in other places that their actions are not going to change the way in which we are bringing people of all backgrounds and beliefs together for the business and best benefit of Australia as a nation. day at the Sari Club in Bali. We will not forget the horrific events of 12 October 2002 and how a favourite place for so many Australians changed forever. Following the attack I spoke in this House of how the event had scarred my local community. TodayI again want to honour MAIN COMMITTEE",138,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
208,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (5.18 Pm),"Tomorrow it will be three years since the tragicthose from my electorate who lost their lives: Debbie and Abbey Borgia, Robyn Webster and Louiza Zervos. Our thoughts are again with their families and loved ones as we remember, three years on, the loss and grief that they have had to endure. They have been recognised by the local community. I attended the funeral service of Robyn Webster at St Clement’s church next to my office in Marrickville where Brian, her husband, and Kristy, her daughter, who was also severely injured in the Bali bombing, were present, along with other family members. It was indeed a moving ceremony, one which I will never forget. I also attended the service at St Bridget’s in Marrickville for Debbie and Abbey Borgia, who were remembered by Debbie’s husband, John, and the rest of their family and school friends. Since then the community have indeed united. Outside Petersham Town Hall-thanks to the assistance of the then mayor, Barry Cotter, and the Marrickville Council-on Crystal Street, is a permanent memorial. The Debbie and Abbey Borgia Community Recreation Centre is an extraordinarily fine facility down at Steele Park in Marrickville. It is a facility where young people from the local community and schools practise basketball and martial arts and where people have community meetings. It is a focal point for the community, just as the Robyn Webster Centre in Tempe is a focal point particularly for young people in the community. There, recently, as I understand it, was the largest Indigenous art mural in the world. I say to those present here in the House and to others, as you fly into Kingsford Smith airport-and you may recall this from my comments on other issues-you will fly very close and low over my electorate. Literally, as you fly in from the north and also from the west, on landing you can see that mural. It is indeed enormous. The community has continued to rally around. I remember the function that was held at the ANZAC club in Marrickville. I got an invite through a phone call. I do not think there was a letterbox drop. I think it was just word of mouth. I turned up there about 15 minutes before the function was to start. You could hardly get into the club. The local community-the working class people of Marrickville, St Peters, Dulwich Hill and Tempe-showed the best of what makes this country a fine place in raising funds to give assistance and support to people in their hour of need. Marrickville identities such as Jeff Fenech made contributions and donations of memorabilia which was auctioned; local businesses kicked in. From that tragic event there was unity in the community. The community’s young people were particularly affected. In Bali at that time were members of the Dulwich Newtown Basketball Club, and students from Casimir college in Marrickville and Dulwich Hill High School were caught up in the tragedy. Many of them were injured, and all who were there experienced the trauma that only those who were there could have understood. These were young adults with their lives ahead of them-lives cut so cruelly short. Many of them, and we know the football team from Western Australia, were sportspeople-young, active and engaged in their communities-who were celebrating their end-ofseason victories. Whilst three years ago we grieved with many families who had lost their youngest members, today we think of the children who have lost their parents. Families have again been split apart in the cruellest of ways. As families were enjoying a meal together on the shores of Jimbaran Bay, that peaceful beachfront was overturned by an evil act. I was moved by the words of the young man from Newcastle who spoke on behalf of the families at the commemorative service at the Sacred Heart Cathedral last week. Joe Frost explained how that MAIN COMMITTEE bomb had hit our whole community. Joe Frost showed incredible strength in the face of this cowardly act. He asked the questions that plague us all: why did this happen? He asked how having dinner on the beach with your family and friends can be so offensive to these people, the people that their fundamentalist supporters now call heroes. It is quite clear that these people must be brought to justice. They must be caught and brought to trial. Jemaah Islamiah must be outlawed. TodayI want to focus on the communities and the families that have been so terribly affected. As Joe Frost said, we will stand together and make it through. We must all stand together as caring local communities-and, indeed, together as a nation. We must fight this evil with compassion, humanity and tolerance. We have to make sure that in our response to these actions the terrorists do not win. Terrorists do win if we give up the important civil rights that give us in Australia our freedom and that make us proud as a community. We must reach out to our Balinese neighbours, whose families too have been torn apart, whose businesses are empty and whose communities have been divided. We must also reach out to the members of our local communities who have suffered vilification as a result of acts of terrorism across the world. As a society we must foster tolerance. Division on the basis of religion has no place in Australian society. Terrorism is the act of cowards. It is wrong whether it is committed by individual suicide bombers, by terrorist groups or by states. Terrorists promote fear. In the face of this fear, we must encourage the opposite. When our children now ask us the hard questions, it is humanity and compassion that must frame our answers. It is with compassion and humanity that we must also reach out today to those who suffer in South Asia in the aftermath of a horrific natural disaster. The devastating earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale has taken many lives. Over 30,000 lives have been lost in Pakistan alone. These figures are set to rise. The United Nations has estimated that there are over 2.5 million people now in need of shelter. Many of these people are in remote areas. The need for international aid is urgent. The scale of this need is overwhelming. The nation of Pakistan has been the hardest hit. Classrooms that were full of children have been reduced to piles of rubble. Many villages and townships have lost a generation of their people. We must stand in solidarity with the people of Pakistan at this horrific time. Our thoughts are with the members of the Pakistani community in Australia, including those in my local electorate in the inner west of Sydney who have friends and relatives in the affected areas. Australians gave generously in 2002 when our friends and Balinese neighbours needed our assistance. Now again we must do all that we can. We again gave money and showed great generosity in the aftermath of the tsunami. The Pakistan High Commission has launched an appeal for the victims of the earthquake. Medicines, tents and emergency food provisions are all desperately needed. I urge all Australians, local businesses and indeed the government to dig deep and to show once again what compassionate, generous people Australians are. spoken numerous times about the need for strong counterterrorism measures. My background was in the Victorian police force, where I was a senior sergeant at the counterterrorism coordination unit. The reason I am so strong on counterterrorism is that I want to prevent a condolence motion like this arising from a terrorist attack on home soil. MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
209,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (5.28 Pm),"I stand in support of the condolence motion. I haveWith the member for Prospect and other members of parliament, I recently had the great opportunity to go to the Australia-Indonesia youth exchange forum. Whilst in Indonesia, we had the great opportunity of meeting Indonesian people and experiencing their great way of life and how friendly they are. We spoke about various issues, including terrorism. The big wake-up call was when we drove past the Australian Embassy, which had previously been the subject of a terrorist attack by JI. The person behind that attack, and also the Bali bombings, was Dr Azahari. I am not sure what type of doctor practises and preaches terrorism. I stand here today after the latest attacks-the Bali bombings on 1 October 2005. Again Australians experienced a tragedy and the death and injury of Australians in Indonesia. On1 October 2005, with horror, I watched our TV screens to see a terrorist attack. It was like deja vu, knowing that young Australians and also those on family holidays had been subjected to a horrific attack. Straightaway when I saw this attack I realised that one of the people behind it would be Dr Azahari. On my trip to Indonesia, I had the great pleasure of seeing the Australian Federal Police at the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation, which is probably the best $35 million the Australian government has spent in Indonesia. At that time they had a large number of international police in charge of various counterterrorism units; I think there were approximately 28. I also had the pleasure of seeing Dr Rohan Gunaratna, the world expert on al-Qaeda, give a presentation. He went through the Australian Embassy attacks and showed the suicide bombers. Quite amazingly, we looked at how these people are indoctrinated. The suicide bomber on that occasion did not even know how to drive a motor car. Two weeks before the bombing, he had his first drive. He would have been a lot more devastating if he had tried to drive through the gates, but he did not have the skills to do so. During his presentation Dr Rohan Gunaratna showed us a safe house which Dr Azahari had stayed at and since left. In this house he had left behind a number of incendiary devices-explosives which had various nails and ball bearings-on little lunch boxes. The sad thing is that a number of these were still out in the community ready to go. When the news coverage after the latest bombings occurred, we learned that 22 people had been killed, including four of our own. A 16-year-old boy from Western Australia, Brendan Fitzgerald, perished in the Kuta explosion. Jennifer Williamson, one of the many holidaymakers from Newcastle, New South Wales, also perished. Husband and wife Colin and Fiona Zwolinski, also from Newcastle, whose safety was uncertain for some days, have now been confirmed as having been killed in the blast. Australian survivors being treated in hospitals include Bruce Williamson, husband of Jennifer Williamson; Paul and Penelope Anicich; Terry Fitzgerald, father of Brendan; Jessica Fitzgerald, sister of Brendan; Eric and Jenny Pilar; Maryanne Purkis; Nicolas and Jennifer Scott; George Drake; Aleta Lederwasch; Kim and Vicki Griffiths; and Anthony Purkis. An Indonesian man and two Japanese nationals are also being treated in Australia. Sadly, all these people, as I have said before, were holidaying. Did they deserve this? The answer is no. The saddest thing is that these terrorists honestly believe that they are enforcing God’s will and that, if anyone has been killed, God has chosen those people to be killed. If the victims, innocent people, are killed, they believe that these people go to heaven as they will. MAIN COMMITTEE In the days following the bombings, images from the Kuta explosion began to appear on our news coverage, particularly images of a young man with a backpack who was subsequently identified as a suicide bomber. We cannot escape these images of explosions as we see amateur footage of people fleeing from restaurants amidst the chaos. Australia’s response to the attack was efficient and timely; unfortunately, we are now more prepared for these incidents. Having the emergency response team on the ground in Bali the next day was an exceptional effort. A team of experts arrived, including medical personnel, counselling staff, consular officials and emergency management and bomb blast specialists, to offer their expertise. The AFP sent disaster victim identification specialists to Bali. I am sure you will find that other state police will be helping in this task. Australia is committed to helping our partners in South-East Asian countries and ensuring that we can give the best possible assistance in preventing further terrorist attacks. Our relationship with Indonesia has been stronger since the first attack on 12 October 2002, when 202 people died-tragically, 88 Australians. Today we are commemorating the third anniversary of the 2002 bombings at Kuta’s Sari Club and Paddy’s Bar as we mourn more loss of Australian life. These attacks are a result of a growing global terror threat, which in our neighbourhood is currently led by JI in Indonesia. Again, I have no doubt that Dr Azahari would be behind these attacks. JI has claimed responsibility for attacks on Australians. Abu Bakar Bashir is serving a prison sentence for his role in the 2002 attacks. Further Australian interests have been targeted by JI since 2002, as we saw in 2004 when a suicide bomber drove a van into the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. Australians were also injured in 2003 when the American-owned Marriott Hotel was targeted by a suicide bomber. As we mourn the loss of Australian life in 2002 and 2005, we cannot help but mourn the loss of the Balinese people. Australians have developed a warm relationship with these people for many years as Bali has grown to be a popular holiday destination for Australians. The Balinese have experienced not only much loss of life but also loss of means of survival. Tourism is their main economic sector, supporting roughly 58,000 jobs, with more than 20 per cent of the population directly dependent on this sector. Tourism contributes between 60 and 70 per cent of Bali’s economy. Travel warnings have had a serious impact on Bali, with the level of international arrivals in Bali dropping from 150,000 in September 2002 to 31,000 in November 2002. Unfortunately, the same thing will occur again. The Bali tourism industry had begun to improve in recent times, but I do not know the future of the Balinese people and their tourism industry. Sadly, the terrorists would look at this as some sort of victory-to destroy a person’s life and income. As we remember today the victims of the 2002 and 2005 Bali attacks, who came from all corners of the globe to enjoy the beauty and wonder that Bali offers, we can only hope that, as Australians rebuild our strength and resolve against global terror, so can the people of Bali. again discussing a condolence motion after a tragedy where innocent lives have been lost at the hands of extremists who have no regard for other human life-indeed, would seem to have no regard for their own or for those who they claim to support and act on behalf of. MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
210,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (5.37 Pm),"It is a matter of great regret that the parliament is onceI am sure that the recent bombings in Bali brought back to the minds of all Australians the terrible events of 2002. It is hard to comprehend how people can set upon a course of action to take lives of innocent people who, as Joe Frost quite dramatically commented, were doing no more than having dinner with their family and loved ones. Yet, in some respects, that appears to have been the cause of the anger. It is a factor of modern political life in the world in which we live that some groups involved in non-state terror will take it upon themselves to conduct these sorts of atrocities. Whether it is in Bali, London, Madrid or New York, the actions are largely predicated on the same basis-that these indiscriminate acts of terror will somehow break the spirit of the people who are the targets of these attacks and that that will somehow advance the cause of those involved. The resolve of the people in Bali and of many of the tourists whom we saw on television demonstrates the folly of that, as did the resolve of people in London, New York and Madrid. We should pay special tribute to those who were involved in the hours immediately following the tragedy for the work that they did in looking after the wounded and the ill. For the Balinese people themselves-who have had to endure these attacks, the lasting effects on their lives and the short-term effects on their economy and livelihood-this is a terrible burden that they have had to deal with through no fault of their own. I think that most Australians would want to convey a warm and heartfelt sense of thanks to the people of Bali. Our own personnel-our Defence Force, the Australian Air Force, Federal Police officers and others-that have been involved in the immediate relief work and the subsequent investigations of these bombings know that they have the full support of the people of Australia and the parliament of Australia. They did their work in the immediate days after the explosion with the professionalism and dedication to which we have become accustomed. I am sure that the work of the AFP officers who are there now conducting the investigations will, in the end, bring those responsible to justice. It is a matter of great concern that these events occur and that we, as a parliament, are then confronted with the need to respond to terrorism in order to ensure that Australian safety is improved. I agree with the comments of my friend the member for Grayndler in saying that it is important in conducting those matters that our response does not take away from us the very liberty that distinguishes our free society. I am reminded of a very prominent United States civil liberties lawyer from the early part of the last century, Clarence Darrow, who said: You can only protect your liberties in this world by protecting the other man’s freedom. You can only be free if I am free. There is a message in that that we can take on board here in terms of our own domestic response. Also, hopefully, we can echo to others around the world that in those words lies an important message. It strikes me as more than coincidence that the region in which these attacks occurred happens to be an area in which there is a degree of instability and organised criminal activities. I was recently looking at the global incidence of piracy and ships being hijacked and was a little surprised to discover that the greatest number of those incidents occur in South-East Asia and, overwhelmingly, in Indonesian waters. You have to wonder whether or not these are also activities of the people involved in financing some of these terrorist operations, in much the MAIN COMMITTEE same way that the poppy fields of Afghanistan are used to finance al-Qaeda’s operations elsewhere in the world. The figures are somewhat startling for the year 2004. There were some 68 ships boarded and an additional four were hijacked. That is better than one a week. There were another 20 where there was an attempted boarding. If you include Malaysia, the Malacca Straits and the surrounding areas, you arrive at a figure of about two acts of piracy a week on ships in our immediate north and north-west approaches. It is time that we increased our efforts to work with our neighbours as partners in dealing with this problem. The people who perpetrate, finance and organise these acts pay no regard not only to human life; they pay no regard to international boundaries and borders. These issues are not going to be addressed by any single nation acting unilaterally. It requires the close cooperation of a broad coalition. In this we share a common interest with all of the countries of our region. I am aware that the government has undertaken measures in this regard and the opposition has advocated it on many occasions. We need to double our efforts in this area. Without the cooperation of all the nations in the region, we will continue to be on the back foot in this debate and sadly find ourselves on similar condolence motions in the future. BeforeI conclude, I want to add a couple of words about the natural disasters in Pakistan. It is not that long ago that General Musharraf was in this building and many of us attended a dinner in his honour. There was a genuine closeness at the function that evening between the Australian members of parliament and the visiting Pakistanis-certainly between General Musharraf, the Prime Minister of Australia and the Leader of the Opposition. There was a warmth and common purpose, not least of all in dealing with the question of responding to non-state terrorists. That warmth should now translate to action on our part as a nation. The Australian people have demonstrated their generosity in the past. The government had made an announcement of some financial support, and I would urge the government to act swiftly and generously. These are times when Pakistan needs not just fine words of comfort but also material support, and it needs it urgently. There have been 30,000 deaths, with a total death toll anticipated to increase substantially above that level. Entire towns have literally been swallowed up and villages no longer exist. Where once a village stood on the hillside, there is now a valley, a large mass grave. The people of Pakistan need compassion but, more than compassion, they need material support. We have the opportunity to do that, and we should be providing the sort of assistance they need. Pakistan authorities have urgently requested airlift capacity, for obvious reasons: the areas that require support are not able to be accessed by road. They also require medical support and field hospitals, and we are one of the few countries in the world that can rapidly mobilise a field hospital and have it on site in a matter of days. I strongly urge the government to take on board these measures, in addition to the financial support that has been provided so far, as a concrete means of supporting the humanitarian effort. It is important for the humanitarian effort that countries like Australia provide swift support. It is also important, and not unrelated to the other discussion we are having here today, that we provide the maximum amount of support that we possibly can to General Musharraf in dealing with the problems he has within his own borders and on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan. I strongly encourage the government to do that. MAIN COMMITTEE bombings of the Sari Club in Bali on 12 October 2002, in which 91 Australian citizens and residents lost their lives in an act of savage, mindless violence designed to terrorise free people-the free people of Australia and the free people of Bali. It was a destructive, mindless, terrorist act. That act on 12 October 2002-12-10-was for us as much a loss of innocence as 9-11 had been the previous year for the people of the United States. Of course, wherever disaster strikes in the world, there are likely to be Australians. There are one million Australians spread out all over the world; we have an enormous diaspora. In many respects, every corner of the world is a part of Australia-and nowhere more so than Bali. The awful tragedy of 12 October 2002 has now been repeated, with another bombing on 1 October, almost on the anniversary of that first tragedy. This time, we have lost four Australians: Jennifer Williamson, and Colin and Fiona Zwolinsky, all of Newcastle, and Brendan Fitzgerald, a 16-year-old boy from Busselton in Western Australia. These add to the list of Australian victims of international terror, and they add to the Australians killed and injured in the London bombings on 7 July this year. London, in a different way, but in many respects in the same way, is as much a part of Australians’ sense of the familiar, known world as Bali is. Tomorrow there will be a commemorative service at Dolphin Point in Coogee to commemorate the third anniversary of the Bali bombing. It will be dedicated to all the Bali victims, and there is a special place for the survivors and the victims’ families. It is a place that is visited daily by people who wish to pay their respects and is a focal point of Coogee Beach. Whilst we do not need a monument to ensure it, it re-enforces the assurance that we will never forget that tragedy, and we will never fail to celebrate the life and resilience of the Australians who perished in the Sari Club. When we attend tomorrow’s ceremony, we will also be thinking of the Australians who perished only a few days ago in yet another act of terrorism. A new plaque will be unveiled at the ceremony with a photo engraving of each of the 20 eastern suburbs victims, many of whom were members of the Dolphins football club from Coogee. This battle against terrorism in which we are engaged is one that will rely for its successful prosecution on, above all else, intelligence and education-intelligence, so we can find out what is in the minds of the terrorists first; education, so we can ensure that young minds do not become terrorist minds. Good intelligence is the key to counter terrorism. Of course, the pressure on the forces fighting against the terrorists are enormous. Our counter-terrorist agencies, our police, our soldiers, have to be right 100 per cent of the time; the terrorist only has to be right once. So it is right that we have increased our resources in intelligence; it is right that we have increased and improved our relationship at the level of every federal agency with our neighbouring states and in particular with Indonesia. In that sense, disaster-the disasters in Bali and late last year the extraordinary tsunamihas brought Australia and Indonesia closer than the two countries have ever been before. Not all of the human tragedy with which we seem to be dealing in successive condolence motions in this House has been the result of terrorism, but much of it has been. That is avoidable if we are successful in identifying the terrorists before they can strike, if we can root them out and if, above all, we can ensure that those people who seek to pervert the minds of young men and women are stopped from persuading young people that their highest religious service is to destroy themselves in the company of dozens or hundreds or thousands of innocent people. MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
211,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth) (5.47 Pm),"Tomorrow is the third anniversary of theIt is an extraordinary thing, this phenomenon of suicide bombing. There has been, I fear, a neglect on the part of many nations to recognise what was welling up in their communities. It comes back to me again and again that one of the bombers in London on 7 July was a young man, the son of a small business man, from a comfortable family; he loved cricket and taught in a school. Surely this is not the profile of a murderous terrorist-at least we did not think it was the profile of a murderous terrorist. Something strange is happening in the Islamic communities outside of the traditional Islamic world. It is a matter that many writers have struggled with in Europe. What is happening that is making young Muslims outside of the majority Islamic countries of North Africa and the Middle East-the Muslims of Europe-so radicalised? What is turning them into the bombers? Nine-eleven had more to do with the mosques of Hamburg and London than it did with the mosques or madrassas of Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan. There is a real challenge for the traditional Western world to understand and engage with the Muslims among us. That is why it is greatly reassuring that in Australia, while we should not be complacent at all, we have seen very recently our Prime Minister engage directly and compellingly with the Islamic community. He sets a great example for all of us, because we must be one family of many religions and faiths-and of no faiths. We must be engaged together for a common Australian purpose. BeforeI leave the subject of terrorism, like many other speakers in this House, I want to refer to what will, I suspect, be one of the great Australian speeches. It was not given by a great statesman or a great orator, it was not given by a general, a prime minister or a president; it was given by a 20-year-old man, Joe Frost, a survivor of the bombing in October this year. He said at the memorial service in the cathedral in Newcastle: Now one question on my mind is: why did this happen ... And apparently it’s about religion ... But we were eating dinner on the beach with our friends and families. Who does that offend? Who doesn’t eat dinner with their family and friends? It’s the most common thing in the world. And now the cowards who planned and who advocate and champion this horrific act say that they are heroes and that the people who did it are heroes. But what’s heroic about murdering the innocent and leaving families ruined? He concluded his magnificent speech with this: These are our darkest hours, the worse days of so many of our lives. This sad and sickening act has torn us open. But we’ll stand together and we’ll make it through. And so we will. The challenge of global terrorism is the greatest political challenge the Western world has faced, certainly since the fall of the Soviet Union. It is a more intangible threat but it is one that we can deal with with determination, collaboration and remembering always that the keys are good intelligence and a focus on education, ensuring that there will be no more young men, cricket loving or not, who decide that their mission in this world and the next is to bring death and destruction on other people. This has been a year of natural disaster as well. We have had the tsunami, of which much has been said in this House and where Australia has played a heroic role in every respect. The Australian nation played a heroic role in assisting our neighbours struck by that disaster, in particular, of course, the Indonesians. We have had more recently the enormous earthquake near Muzaffarabad in Pakistanadministered Kashmir. The death toll is expected to go well beyond 20,000, without counting MAIN COMMITTEE the dead from neighbouring North West Frontier Province. Muzaffarabad, a city of 100,000, is without power and water, and food is getting scarce. The sewerage system was also ruptured by this quake. Ahead lies the risk of more deaths from disease and exposure in this bitterly cold, mountainous part of the world for nearly 1½ million Kashmiris. India’s offer of help is a positive sign for the peace process with Pakistan. The two countries have both been hit, of course, but Pakistan by far the worse. Again, it may well be that disaster brings these two countries, which have had so many differences, closer together. The Australian government has been quick to help, with the provision of $500,000 for immediate medical and relief assistance. The gulf state of Kuwait has pledged $100 million in aid to Pakistan, while a plane has landed at Islamabad in the last few days with the first shipment of a $50 million United States aid package. The World Bank has earmarked $20 million and the Asian Development Bank, $10 million. Authorities estimate that it will take up to six months to complete the rescue and relief work. All the time, the rescue workers are battling against the clock, because by the end of this month Kashmir’s harsh winter will have begun. We live in a world beset by troubles. Some of them are acts of God, or nature, such as the earthquake and the tsunami. We have to deal with those, and the tragedies are no less real. Others are the work of our fellow men and women, misguided and destructive. Whether these disasters are wrought by man or by nature, the response must always be the same. It must be founded in teamwork, in a love of humanity, in collaboration with the people of other nations and, above all else, in a deep commitment on the part of all Australians to work together and, as Joe Frost said, ‘to make it through’. Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (6.01 pm)-I want to make a contribution on the Bali condolence motion and the other tragedies that this condolence motion unfortunately comprehends. Like many hundreds of thousands of other Australians, I have had the opportunity to visit and to holiday in Bali. I have done that on two occasions: on the first occasion with my sister and her children, my niece and nephew; on the second occasion with my sister, my nephew and a friend of my nephew’s. As we recall-and as this motion tells us-the first Bali bombing was on 12 October 2002, on a Saturday. I returned from my second trip to Bali on the Friday morning, so when the bomb went off on 12 October 2002 I felt very much how near I was to being there at the time of those events. With this dreadful tragedy on 1 October, you can imagine yourself in the settings where these tragedies have occurred. I visited Raja’s with my family members on many occasions to eat a meal there. I have eaten a meal on the beach, watching the sun go down and eating freshly cooked seafood, as have so many other Australians who have holidayed in Bali. So many hundreds of thousands of Australians can imagine themselves or their loved ones in that space because they have been there, they have seen it, they have enjoyed it, they can visualise it. The very fact that they can imagine themselves or their loved ones in that space brings home to all Australians in a very graphic way the callous randomness of these acts of savagery. You do not know who it could have been or who could have been there. There are people enjoying very simple holiday pleasures, only to find themselves confronted, maimed or possibly killed by a barbarism that seems beyond understanding. It is on that basis that this parliament is working its way through these condolence motions and trying to come to grips with something that has so deeply affected our nation. It has affected the Australians involved, those who have been killed or injured and their loved ones, MAIN COMMITTEE but it has affected us more broadly because, as the member for Wentworth has said, there was a loss of innocence on 12 October 2002, and that loss of innocence has been compounded on 1 October this year. The fact that we can imagine ourselves or our loved ones there brings home that loss of innocence in a very clear way to each of us. On 16 October 2002, I spoke in the Bali condolence motion about the dreadful events of 12 October 2002. On that occasion, I spoke particularly of a member of my electorate, Mr David Stewart, who is known as Spike Stewart. On 16 October 2002, I said of Spike Stewart: His son, Anthony Stewart, 29 years of age, is still missing. He is a member of the Kingsley football team. He was last seen on the dance floor of the Sari nightclub. Obviously Mr David Stewart and his wife, Marilyn, have been devastated by anxiety as they have waited for news. Mr David Stewart is actually travelling to Bali today to look for his son. His trip is being paid for by his employer, in a wonderful act of generosity. Mr Stewart is in contact with consular officials and they will meet him on his arrival in Bali. My heart goes out to David and Marilyn. I note that this family has already suffered a great deal, having lost Anthony’s twin brother four years ago in a car accident. Our thoughts are with you in this very terrible time of suffering. Tragically, when David ‘Spike’ Stewart made that trip to Bali, commencing on 16 October 2002, it was to discover that his son Anthony Stewart, 29, was not missing but had been killed in the Sari nightclub. It was a special tragedy for a man who had lost Anthony’s twin brother some four years before. To have lost twin sons is obviously a special kind of tragedy for Spike Stewart and his wife, Marilyn. It is something that I think people would struggle to understand and come to grips with-how anybody could get beyond such a series of tragic events and go on to live any form of life beyond it. Speaking to this condolence motion, I can report that Spike Stewart has gone on to confront and deal with this tragedy. He is someone who has played an important organising and supporting role for those who were affected by the devastating events of 12 October 2002. He has organised events like family barbecue days for the Victorian people who were touched by the events of 2002, to create an opportunity for them to meet and catch up. He was a prime mover in encouraging the Victorian government to dedicate a memorial to the victims from Victoria. He is often a spokesman for those who have lost someone in Bali or whose loved ones have suffered. Indeed, I suspect that many Australians have seen Spike Stewart on their TV screens in recent days with words of wisdom about how those who have suffered in the current events can get through it and beyond. Our condolences obviously go to the current victims of the 1 October bombing and to those who are still grieving, mourning and affected by injury from the bombings on 12 October 2002. As Spike Stewart’s example shows, there is a way to rebuild and to show, even in the darkest of events, some positive flicker of spirit. He certainly continues to do that. As well as the Australian victims, our thoughts turn to the Balinese. Like many Australians who have holidayed in Bali, I have been struck by the gentleness of the Balinese people. In these times of crisis, they certainly have done much to assist Australians and other foreign nationals caught up in these devastating events. We know that many Balinese people were killed both on 12 October 2002 and 1 October this year. Many were injured. Beyond those who were killed and injured, many face the loss of their livelihood because of Bali’s dependency on tourism. MAIN COMMITTEE Last time that I spoke in the condolence motion for the 2002 event, I talked about meeting a man in Bali who acted as a tour guide for my sister and me. He had gone to work in a hotel as a 14-year-old houseboy in exchange for the hotel owner paying his school fees. Some 16 years later he was still working in that hotel. He talked to us about the nature of the Balinese medical system and the fact that it was very expensive and that people had to pay for medical treatment. He said that the birth of his first child had cost two million rupiah, a huge amount of money from his perspective. He talked about the problems with the tourism industry at that stage. There were some concerns about date rape drugs in Bali night clubs, and he was worried about the effect that that would have on the number of Westerners who came to Bali. One can only imagine the despair of Balinese people such as this man looking at Bali’s tourism industry and now knowing that these acts of brutality not only have caught people in the immediate incidents but are likely to devastate the economy, with all of the implications that that has for life prospects and opportunities for the Balinese involved. Today, we must grieve for and note the hurt that is being experienced by the Balinese people as a whole. It goes without saying that any right-thinking person would condemn without reservation the acts of savagery that have resulted in these deaths and injuries and so much beyond. In this place from time to time there are obviously differences of opinion about the best way of fighting terrorism. Finding the right balance between the competing interests of ensuring security, to the best of our ability, and valuing our precious freedoms is not an easy task. It is a task on which reasonable people can differ and do differ and have the opportunity to debate those differences. One thing that saddens us as we have those debates in this parliament is that sometimes, when they proceed on a partisan basis, it is assumed that there are people in this parliament who lack the will to fight terror, who do not want to fight for democracy and who do not see the need to stand up to terrorists. Of course, none of that is true. Every member in this place understands the need to fight terror. Every member in this place loves democracy and would be prepared to fight for it. Every member in this place is a true Australian patriot, and I think we cheapen the debate by questioning those things about each other. Rather than engage in that cheapening of the debate, we should recognise that working out a strategy to fight terrorism is a very difficult task that requires all our goodwill and intellectual labour. It is a task about which reasonable people can differ, and those differences should be debated through in civility rather than partisanship. We have seen too much of that. I turn to congratulating those members of our health services who, both in 2002 and in the past few days, have once again gone above and beyond to assist the victims of these incidents in Bali. Our health services on both occasions have performed magnificently. Whether it is doctors on the ground who have rushed to provide aid to the victims, whether it is the Royal Darwin Hospital, whether it is those who have come up with an innovative treatment for burns-which happened in the 2002 bombing-or whether it is the John Hunter Hospital, doctors, nurses and hospital staff across the country have been involved in providing support. I want to record my thanks for their heroic efforts. Each and every one of them does much beyond what they are paid for, particularly when it comes to dealing with events like these. As other speakers have remarked, this has been an amazing year for disasters. We are obviously focused now on the pain that has been caused by terrorism so recently, but it has also MAIN COMMITTEE been an amazing and tragic year for natural disasters. Whether it was the tsunami, whether it was the hurricanes that have devastated America-particularly the suffering of the people in New Orleans-whether it is the suffering we are now watching on our TV screens in Guatemala and tragically in Pakistan, this will always go down in our memories as a year where nature wreaked a terrible toll on humanity. It is important, as it was with the tsunami and with the catastrophe that hit the United States-most particularly New Orleans-and as it is now with Pakistan and Guatemala, that a nation such as ours, which enjoys comparatively with the world such great levels of wealth, does everything that it can to assist those in need. I add my voice to those who have already spoken in this debate about the tremendous, urgent need in Pakistan as people continue to go through the amazing search for survivors and still manage to find, almost beyond hope and reason, under piles of rubble, children and adults who have somehow survived for days in those circumstances but will only survive further if they get good medical assistance and aid. Then there are the many who have not been directly injured but, without the benefit of food and shelter, will ultimately pay with their lives for this natural disaster. That concludes my remarks on what I think is a very difficult and emotional motion for this parliament and something that gives us cause to reflect on the very great luck so many of us experience in our lives. We are very lucky not to have been caught up individually in these events and we are very lucky that we have the opportunity, safe and well here, to do something to assist those who are far from safe and far from well. Heritage) (6.15 pm)-In rising to address this motion of condolence, I acknowledge all three tragedies which are recorded. Firstly, and most recently, is the Pakistan earthquake. There has been tragic loss of life, with well in excess of 40,000 souls lost and potentially many more. Numerous families have been sundered and communities have been damaged. Secondly, I acknowledge the tragedy in Bali and the atrocity which brought it about, the killings there on 1 October 2005. Thirdly, I recall those whom we have lost and those who have survived the killings of 12 October 2002 in Bali, the first Bali bombing. In looking at this condolence motion, I wish to do three things. First, I give my sympathy to all of those who have survived but have lost loved ones along the way in each of these tragedies. I wish to focus particularly on the most recent Bali bombing. We have had the deaths of three Australians from Newcastle and another from Western Australia, and each is survived by people who have expressed their love and have suffered loss. And there have been many other Australians who have connections with those in Bali. To all of those people from Bali, Indonesia and other countries, I also pass on my genuine sympathy and the sympathy of my constituents in the electorate of Flinders-the people of the Mornington Peninsula, Western Port and Bass Coast. I also want to acknowledge, on behalf of my constituents and myself, the great debt of gratitude we owe to emergency workers, to authorities, to hospital workers, to our military forces and to Indonesian forces who have placed themselves in harm’s way. They have worked without any desire for recompense or favour but simply out of a sense of common humanity and of commitment to others. That sacrifice, that willingness, is a wonderful testimony to what we are, to what Indonesia is at its very best and to the relations between the two countries. MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
212,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andIn looking forward, I think it is very important that the message which has come out from survivors and those who have known and been close to the deceased is that they would not want us to give up. They would not want us to lose that sense of optimism and resolve and celebration of life which was part and parcel of a visit to Bali. It is the reason that people go: to mix both cultural experiences and joie de vivre with a beautiful environment and the wonderful Balinese people. That sense of Australia’s openness is something which we have to protect. It is critical that we protect that sense of national spirit. I do not feel that we are at threat of losing it, but it is indispensable. We must recall, remember and recommit to retaining that sense of who we are. In doing that, I think it is important to examine two key additional things in this speech. Firstly, there is the matter of condolence. ThenI want to move on to the question of the threat we face and the response. In dealing with the threat, what we see in Bali-both this time, in 2005, and on 12 October 2002-is this. I am speculating, but everybody is of the view that it was Jemaah Islamiah or an affiliate that was involved on this occasion. What we see is an attempt to do a number of things. At the grandest level, it is an attempt to try and remake the world as we know it. What we see is a philosophy, whether you call it Waharbism or it is an offshoot of that, and the way in which it has transpired in Afghanistan as the legacy of the Taliban amongst some of the affiliates of al-Qaeda or direct al-Qaeda linked people in Iraq-those who carried out activities in the United States on 11 September, those who have acted under Jemaah Islamiah’s banner in Bali and those who are acting as supporters of al-Qaeda in the London bombings. This is a group of people who seek to do two things. Firstly, they are seeking to break down the order and structure of the principal Islamic societies within our world today. What they are seeking to do is to impose a Taliban style regime, whether it is in Indonesia, Pakistan, Egypt or Saudi Arabia-to break down the internal structures within those societies, which are essentially Islamic, and to try and take them as their own, to recast them in the model of the Taliban. We saw what this would mean to the world when, in one of the poorest countries of the world, Afghanistan, they had a fundamental base. That base was lost after September 11, but they have now sought to move onto a broader stage, to capture one of those countries. That is part of the 30-year vision. The 30-year vision is of establishing a base, a platform, for themselves on a grand scale by destabilising the authorities, by breaking down the economies, by severing the links with Western society and by causing as much damage and harm to people of Islamic faith as possible so as to break down confidence in the existing governments and, through that, to remake those societies in the image of the Taliban, al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah and those who would create a perverted form of Islam. This is not in any way representative of true Islam or mainstream Islam, a religion with a great history. It is an attack upon mainstream Islam. One of the means is either attacking the West directly or attacking the areas where the West engages with these societies on their own lands. The bigger goal still is to establish a caliphate in some of these countries and spread that throughout the world. That is a 100-year vision, as can be seen when you go back over the writings of many of the thinkers who have informed the work of al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah and their affiliates. MAIN COMMITTEE In response to that, there are a number of things to say. The first is that those people are utterly perverted in their objectives. These objectives cannot stand, do not represent Islam and must be resisted. It is worth noting that on at least three occasions in the last decade the West has stood in defence of Islamic societies against attacks upon them-in Bosnia, Kosovo and Somalia. All involved activity of a military form and risks to our troops-to our sons and daughters who serve in the alliance and in the cause of the defence of our shores, whether in Australia, the United States or the European nations. On each of those occasions, our troopswhether ‘our’ applies to Australia or to our allies-have been put in harm’s way to defend the right, the structure and the organisation of Islamic societies. That is a fundamental point to remember. As we look forward, the question must be: what is our response? What is the response to this sort of threat? The first thing is not to panic. Our fundamental nature as a democracy is dependent upon ourselves. These threats succeed not through the wholesale destruction of human lives but if they disrupt our social order, our thinking and our confidence in ourselves. That is what these threats are attempting to do. As one person has put it to me, the statistical likelihood of being caught in a bombing is infinitely less than that of being in a road accident. But the nature of these propaganda attacks and these activities is such that they are intended to produce fear on a wide scale. It is important that we keep it in perspective. These are attempts to disrupt our society by disrupting our confidence, and in response it is important that we retain our sense of who we are. That is the single thing which we must do first: we have to look internally as to how we respond. Secondly, in dealing directly with the threat, there is, of course, a united need to act with a defensive military response. Whether that means on the Afghanistan front, on the Iraqi front or in other areas, we have to work in cooperation with authorities in each of those countries to defend and protect and to wipe out the elements that have no ground for compromise, that have no basis for discussion and that seek nothing other than the destruction of Islamic society and Western society and the re-creation of the world in a form utterly foreign to anything we know. In addition, in our response we have a critical role in looking at democracy-the spread of democratisation around the world. That process, which is slow, painful and difficult, is nevertheless something which, over time, will be a fundamental bulwark against this sort of outrage. One of the criticisms of the West, legitimately, over the last 50 years has been an overtolerance of authoritarian regimes if they were supportive of a Western presence. Those authoritarian regimes have ultimately provided breeding grounds for people who have been unable to express their views. Of course, there will be some for whom nothing other than absolute violence is the response, but democratisation is an end in itself and is also a means for dealing with this problem. Finally, we have to contribute directly to the construction of new societies in Iraq and in Afghanistan and to the development and spreading of greater access to wealth and productivity within a lot of the Islamic world. There is no doubt that that will contribute. It will not solve the problem: when we look at September 11 we see that many of the people involved were extremely well off. Nevertheless, it is important to try and deal with some of the possible wellsprings of dissent and grievance within these societies. MAIN COMMITTEE What is the way forward? Firstly we have a responsibility to ourselves. Secondly, we have a defensive task from which we do not shirk-whether that is in Afghanistan, in Iraq in cooperation with other forces or in Indonesia in cooperation with the Indonesian government. Thirdly, we have a responsibility in relation to democratisation. Fourthly, we have a contribution to make in terms of development. That is the way forward. That is the way to honour those whom we have lost and whose lives have been taken from us. Ultimately, in recalling the meaning behind this condolence motion, it is a very simple thing: it is to say to those whom we have lost that we will miss you, to say to those who remain that we are with you and to say ‘we thank you’ to those who have helped restore order to protect us and to search for and save people at risk. do not have to deal with motions such as this again. This is a time to mourn those who have died; it is a time to remember those who have helped in the rescue; and it is a time to resolve afresh to defend our liberties in the face of the threats which now present themselves to those liberties. I would like to support the Prime Minister’s condolence motion and express my heartfelt sympathy to those who have lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks at Jimbaran Bay and Kuta Square on 1 October. My thoughts and prayers are with those who are grieving right now the loss of family members and friends but also those who are still recovering from their injuries, many of whom will continue to suffer from those injuries for some time to come. The horror of this attack on Australian families enjoying their holidays in Bali has of course been exacerbated by the timing of the blasts, almost three years to the day after the terrorist attacks of 2002 which killed nearly 200 innocent civilians, including nearly 100 Australians. Rather than reflect only on the horror of this attack, I would like to take this opportunity to reflect also on those who responded to that horror with humanity, with practicality and with compassion. I would like to formally pay tribute to the many Indonesians who extended the hand of friendship and offered their assistance and support to Australians who were injured in the bombings. The list is long. It includes the doctors, the nurses and the medical staff at Sanglah Hospital and the smaller medical clinics across Bali who treated and tended the wounds, both physical and psychological, of those affected by the bombings; the Indonesian government officials, including the Immigration Customs officials at Ngurah Rai Airport, who facilitated the use of a hangar which became the unofficial departure lounge for the most seriously injured; the Indonesian Air Force officers who facilitated diplomatic clearances, including the RAAF evacuation flights to land and take off from the airport with speed and without impediment; the Indonesian police who immediately went to work securing the crime scene and beginning the hunt for those responsible; and, here in Canberra, the staff of the Indonesian embassy who helped around the clock to make much of the above possible. In addition to those I have already mentioned, who performed their professional duties with such skill and dedication, I would also like to acknowledge the many Indonesian citizens who went out of their way to assist a stranger, to assist Australians and other victims of the bombing that night. I would like to pay tribute to these unnamed, unknown and unrecognised individuals-the Indonesians on the beaches and on the streets of Bali who offered their assistance that night, including the taxi drivers, the bar staff, those waiting on tables from nearby cafes and restaurants, local shop owners, hotel staff and security guards as well as simple passers-by who stopped to help those affected by the bombings. MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
213,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (6.29 Pm),"In this place I think we look forward to the time when weI would also like to thank the many Australians who assisted, including the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and particularly the staff of the Australian consulate in Bali, the Australian High Commission in Singapore and the consular staff answering the phones in the DFAT crisis centre in Canberra, who have unfortunately become only too skilled at handling crises of this nature. I also thank the Royal Australian Air Force flight crews from RAAF Base Richmond No. 36 Squadron and the crews and medical staff from RAAF Base Amberley who tended to the most seriously injured and ensured their safe and early return to Australia. We should also thank the Australian Federal Police officers and staff in Bali, Singapore, Darwin and Sydney who, in addition to their investigation into the terrorist attacks, provided an invaluable family liaison service to those affected by the bombings. I also thank Centrelink counselling staff, who continue to provide support services to victims and their families. I thank the surgeons, doctors, nurses and other medical staff at Royal Darwin Hospital, the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle and the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick for their care and treatment of the injured and the doctors and staff of International SOS who evacuated severely wounded Australians to Singapore. This condolence motion is an opportunity for us to reflect on the underlying strength of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia. Nowhere is this more evident than in Bali. Nowhere is this more evident than at times such as this when our two peoples are brought together to face a common enemy, that enemy being terrorism. Cooperation between Australian and Indonesians at all levels-government officials, medical staff, police, military and, just as importantly, at the people-to-people level-has left many of us deeply impressed. We have seen in these tragic events of recent times the best of our common humanity on display, just as we saw that common humanity on display tragically three years ago in the bombings of October 2002. Reflecting on this motion, we are also required to think again about how we best deal with the continuing threat posed by terrorists and terrorism. Our approach as the alternative government of Australia has always been simple and straightforward: when we are dealing with terrorists, when we are dealing with terrorism, our policy must be one of zero tolerance. We must, therefore, in terms of law enforcement procedures, security and intelligence work, adopt a hard-edged approach. There is no alternative to that. Equally, however, for that hard-edged approach to work, we must embrace a comprehensive strategy which deals also with the social and economic conditions in countries like Indonesia, elsewhere in South-East Asia and elsewhere in the developing world, where underlying conditions make it easier for terrorist organisations to recruit. Any serious analyst of the challenge which terrorism represents today will tell you that any effective strategy for dealing with terrorism and terrorists must have both these dimensions operating simultaneously-a hard-edged approach to the difficult and dangerous work of intelligence, security and police operations and, at the same time, an embracing, compassionate approach to the underlying social and economic challenges confronted by much of the developing world, where the presence of poverty and degradation is such that terrorist organisations find it easier to recruit members. These then must be the elements of our approach to the challenge of terrorism in our region, and for these reasons we as the alternative government of this country advanced our approach to a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy for South East Asia some 12 months ago. That is part of our challenge. The other part is this: in defendMAIN COMMITTEE ing our country’s civil liberties, we must be careful not to concede the ground to terrorists by circumscribing our civil liberties so much that we in fact concede defeat. Achieving this balance between the defence of our civil liberties and empowering our police, intelligence and security services with the powers necessary to deal with terrorists on the ground is one of the greatest general challenges confronting modern parliamentary democracies today. We must be vigilant on this question. We must get the balance right. We must proceed in our debate on these questions in a rational and informed way which clearly identifies what additional powers our agencies may need but which does so in a time-limited fashion and in a manner that explicitly acknowledges the loss of civil liberties which must temporarily be suffered in order to enable our police and intelligence agencies to be equipped with those new powers. One of the great concerns on our side of politics, and I believe it is shared more generally by the Australian community, is that, if we simply have a continued accretion of additional powers to our police, intelligence and other agencies over time and we roll the clock forward a decade or more, we will in fact have created circumstances under which Australia itself, its fabric and our assumptions about our civil liberties then change. The argument on our side of politics is that we must not allow that change to occur by default. If we are going to embrace these sorts of changes, and some of these changes must be embraced because of the nature of the challenge we face, then we must do so in an explicit, conscious fashion, particularly in this institution, the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia-the parliament where the people, through their representatives, makes laws. Preceding parliaments in other countries have established over many centuries, through careful deliberation, the proper balance between the powers of the state on the one hand and the liberty of the individual on the other. That dilemma confronts us again today. Let us be conscious of that dilemma; let us weigh it carefully as we continue to weigh the challenges which will again present themselves to us afresh if and when, God forbid, another terrorist attack occurs. In conclusion, as we contemplate this motion, our nation must be vigilant; we must be vigilant in the fight against terrorists and terrorism. We must be vigilant in our defence of civil liberties and we must as a people maintain the common sense which is the essence of the Australian character and nature to make sure that we achieve continued balance in reconciling these two great objectives. We support the motion. gowa, I too would like to express my support and my community’s support for the Prime Minister’s motion. As we all struggle to come to terms with the terrorist attacks in Bali over the weekend, my community starts to question why it happened-as we all do. Why would anybody choose to kill innocent men, women and children? Many articles in the media have claimed that holiday-makers from Western countries have been directly targeted, perhaps because of our country’s involvement in Iraq or other countries’ involvement in Iraq. But I do not think that argument can be sustained; it is far from the truth. We all know that there have been a number of bombings all over the world. More Muslims have been killed than Westerners. There have been a number of terrorist attacks in countries spanning the globe in the last three years, including in India, Israel, Russia, Tunisia, Pakistan, Turkey, Morocco, Spain, Egypt, the Philippines and Great Britain. MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
214,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (6.39 Pm),"On behalf of the people of Townsville and ThurinEarly reports on the Bali bombing indicate that the bombers might have belonged to a radical militant brigade believed to be a splinter group of JI. What concerns many of us is that these terrorist groups claim to carry out these acts of terrorism in the name of their Islamic faith. If you have a look at what the Islamic faith means, you will see that Islam does not preach or condone any form of terrorism. The Arabic word ‘Islam’ actually means ‘peaceful submission to the will of Allah, the sole creator of the universe’. Therefore, Islam is opposed to all antihumanitarian terrorist activities, detrimental aggressive use of power or the infliction of torture and miseries on the poor and the downtrodden. I want to make this quite clear: there is no question that these fanatics are members of the Islamic community. They do not come from Islam; they come from fanaticism, from terrorism. According to the tenets of Islam, if any individual kills one human being of any religion or caste, he is believed to have killed all mankind on earth and stands convicted for punishment accordingly. Certainly the very good people in Australia who are Muslims do not deserve to be in any way condemned for what we are seeing in these outrages, and I think the people of Australia understand that. In July this year, three months ago, I was on the beach at Jimbaran Bay at one of the restaurants. Those of you who have been there will know that there are perhaps 30 or 40 restaurants all lined up side by side on the beach. It is the last place you would expect a terrorist to strike. I made that comment to my family, who were with me. But the horrible reality is that I could have been there this time. The terrorists could have struck while I was there. Earlier speakers in this debate from both sides have made the point that the people of Bali are gentle and kind. After the first Bali bombing their economy suffered terribly. Think about the people of Bali. A taxi driver’s total income for the day is $A7. It is an economy that just exists, and they need the tourists to come. Yet these terrorists have just set the scene for their livelihood staying away. It is a terribly distressing situation. A week and a half ago I was in Pakistan. I was in the area adjacent to where the earthquake occurred last Saturday. Again, when I found I was going to Pakistan, I had some reservations. But when you go to Pakistan you find the people of Pakistan are just as friendly and open as the people of Bali or as friendly and open as the people of Australia. These days, we all live on the one planet. We all live together. We are all the same. We might have different colours and creeds but deep down we are all the same and the people of Pakistan are no different. I pay a tribute to General Musharraf. He is kind of a benevolent dictator, but Pakistan is a democracy: it has a national assembly and it has a senate. They have the same problems as we do-with the Senate, that is. They have a clerk of the parliament. He is as wise as the Clerk of our parliament, but he has more hair! They have the deputy speakers from the opposition as they have the deputy speakers from the government. President Musharraf is presiding over the headlong rush to modernise Pakistan. He has made some very brave decisions. He rejects terrorism, just as we all do. It is such a pity to see this terrible tragedy happen to his country. There are still issues in Pakistan. When I was in Lahore, perhaps five days earlier, there had been two bombings. They were bicycle bombers. When I was in LahoreI had to travel with police motorcycles front and rear, police cars front and rear, special service commandos front and rear and an ambulance in the rear with a doctor just in case something did happen. But Pakistan will grow out of that, because the country, the people, are determined to reject the militancy. MAIN COMMITTEE I went to a madrassa and the first thing the head of the madrassa said to me was: ‘Never misunderstand. We are a peaceful people and we preach peace and harmony in this madrassa to all of our people. We utterly, utterly reject the terrorism that has been going on. These people are not of the Islamic faith. We utterly reject them.’ It was good to hear that message. I guess all of our hearts go out to the people of Pakistan, who have been so dreadfully devastated by this earthquake. I know that the Australian government’s initial response has been welcomed by the Red Cross and Red Crescent organisations. I know that the Australian government will provide further assistance when it becomes clear what that assistance required might be. The member for Griffith was absolutely correct: the Australian Labor Party’s policy of zero tolerance of terrorism is the same as the government’s-we are of one mind. All of us must continue to utterly reject these atrocities that have been going on from time to time. Again my condolences on behalf of my family and my community go to the people of Bali and Pakistan. previous speakers who have emphasised the question of Bali, the bombings and the deaths and the suffering of the families involved and the assistance given to those who were affected, by churches, by hospitals, by Australian government employees, by Indonesians et cetera. Tonight, however, I will emphasise the question of Pakistan. It is quite close to home in one sense, insofar as the husband of my adviser, Aisha Amjad, is working for the Pakistan government at the moment. Where he was residing has huge cracks in the walls, and the air conditioning fell down and he suffered concussion. He is very fortunate in a sense because he had contemplated moving to one of the buildings that was totally demolished during these events. So he was very fortunate indeed. This is close to my heart insofar as my region of Western Sydney is characterised by significant Pakistani migration. Admittedly, Pakistanis are less concentrated than many other ethnic groups in Australia. However, of the 11,000-odd Pakistani born and the 12,500 people who said that they were of Pakistani ancestry in the last census, it is fair to say that the significant belt of suburbs from Auburn out to Campbelltown and to a lesser degree parts of the seat of Mitchell, held by Mr Cadman, are the main centres of the population in Sydney. It is indeed a very devastating series of events, with 30,000 people seemingly dead and speculation about another 30,000, with four million people affected. On a personal note, I understand that one Pakistani government minister has lost 15 family members and now has a grandchild who is alone. Similarly, there is one report of a family with five children who were all in their first classes for the day and are now all dead. In a broader sense, there are a number of problems that increase the difficulties. There is the onset of winter and the major devastation of roads linking the region. It is also the second week of Ramadan, when many of the people who are giving assistance are fasting for long periods each day, but they are still making very significant efforts to save people. The UN has launched a flash appeal. I am pleased to note that the Australian government today increased their initial commitment of $5 million to $10 million. It is interesting to note that this has hit home with the Australian public. I do not for one moment claim that telephone polls in the Sydney Morning Herald represent Australia; however, it is interesting to note that 60 per cent of respondents have said that government assistance should be increased. The situation is also reassuring insofar as large numbers of countries have responded positively. MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
215,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (6.48 Pm),"I would certainly associate myself withAmongst them are Australia, the US, the UK, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands, Spain, Malaysia and Turkey-in a very significant way. There have been reports of Israeli assistance as well, which would be a very good gesture by the Israeli administration. I note that, on the Australian front, a number of charities have launched donation appeals: the Red Cross, World Vision, CARE Australia, the Fred Hollows Foundation, Oxfam et cetera. The Pakistan Australia Association’s president, Ejaz Khan, is a very respected lawyer, migration agent and businessman in the Western Sydney region. He is well known to me. The member for Parramatta, Julie Owens, is tonight chairing a meeting of the Pakistan Australia Association and other interested organisations to move towards a major fundraising event. I also note the activities of Councillor Saeed Khan on the Marrickville Council, who has ensured that the Local Government Association of New South Wales will write to all councils seeking financial support. I hope that the gesture earlier this week of a $5,000 contribution from the Parramatta City Council, in the area where I reside, leads to that donation despite a few initial difficulties. The Sydney City Council has promised the use of Paddington Town Hall for a fundraiser. Generally, there has been a strong reaction in Sydney towards the people affected. Whilst the earthquake largely concentrated on the north of Pakistan, parts of India and disputed Kashmir have also been affected. A pleasing aspect is that there has been a degree of cooperation in Sydney between the Muslim and Hindu, Indian and Pakistani communities. President Musharraf stated, ‘It is a test of our nerves, our government and the whole nation.’ We are all aware of the major difficulties that Pakistan faces with regard to extremist elements in the country, which have targeted Ahmadi and Shiite religious centres in an attempt to exacerbate religious tensions like they have in Iraq, where that is also part of their strategy. We know of the very real inequities in Pakistan and the need for modernisation-towards which the Musharraf government has strongly moved. I recognise the efforts made in Sydney and internationally and join with others in trying to make sure that assistance is mounted strongly and quickly. Guatemala is a nation with far fewer migrants in this country. The main international coverage of Guatemala is about the deprivation of the indigenous population and their suppression over many decades and, in more recent years, a major problem being created by the United States sending back delinquents from California to increase the street gangs in the capital cities of Guatemala and Honduras, increasing their inability to control crime problems there. It is a society that is very challenged. It will not get that much interest in Australia. But this latest hurricane, Hurricane Stan, is leading to very significant devastation, with whole villages wiped out. Officials have basically decided that some villages will just be regarded as cemeteries. These mudslides, these hurricane rains, have meant that 118 communities are still unreachable because the water is so dense with mud. The devastation is far worse than that caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and it is estimated that rebuilding will cost at least $2 billion. Once again, we join in feeling compassion towards these people. Many of them do not have the benefits that we have. They do not have the society that we experience, even in the best of times, and this is obviously a very grave challenge to both of these societies. by the Prime Minister about the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings and the Pakistan and GuateMAIN COMMITTEE",159,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
216,Mr Richardson (Kingston) (6.56 Pm),"I rise today in support of the motion movedmala national disasters. I extend my deepest sympathies to all victims and their families. On a beautiful Sunday morning in Adelaide I, like everyone else, woke just over a week ago to the tragic news that more lives had been lost in yet another Bali terror attack. My heart sank as I turned on the TV and searched the newspapers for word of Australians caught up in the tragedy, my horror compounded by the fact that only 10 weeks prior my wife and I had celebrated our wedding anniversary in Bali at that same beach. As I watched the images of people lighting candles on a beach where I had recently walked and of the restaurants where I had eaten now blown apart, what shocked me so much was the realisation of how easily a life can be changed or lost at the whim of a terrorist. We are again reminded of the indiscriminate nature of terrorism-that those who embark on a mission to kill and maim do not limit their attacks to a targeted group but will ruin or end the lives of any individual, black or white, Hindu or Christian, Australian or Indonesian. In my mind there simply is no justification for an act of terror-no cause so worthy, no belief so strong that it would justify the mass killing of innocent people and the intentional and determined injuring and maiming of as many others as possible. WhatI will never understand about those who embark on terrorist acts is their determination in spite of their failure. The rest of the civilised world will never embrace their cause or sympathise with their plight because they embark on a systematic attempt to kill our people and instil a sense of fear in those remaining. The thing that has struck me so incredibly after these most recent attacks, as well as following the 12 October 2002 attacks, is the acts of kindness and courage of those who work tirelessly to help the victims in the aftermath. These selfless acts stand eternally as a message to those determined to break our spirit that we will not be broken, that the human spirit, the Australian spirit, is stronger than any attack they can mount and that every time they attack one of our own it serves only to bring us closer together as people and to make us more resolute in our determination to defeat them. My heart goes out to the Balinese victims of these attacks, not just those who suffered direct loss in the bombings but those who will suffer long after the TV cameras have gone and the victims have left the hospitals-those whose livelihoods will be destroyed by the inevitable decline in tourism which will follow this devastation. I can assure you from personal experience that the Balinese are a beautiful people, a kind people, who suffered heavily after the 2002 bombings. There are entire families who rely on the tourism trade as their only means of income, and those people will suffer incredibly in the months and years to come. I listened in the House yesterday as the Prime Minister spoke of the call for the Indonesian government to outlaw the terrorist group Jemaah Islamiah. I wholeheartedly support the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister in their calls. This group is directly responsible for the taking of so many Australian and Indonesian lives. Its purpose it is to kill and maim the people of our nations in an attempt to terrorise those left behind. There is no justification for condoning their behaviour by allowing them to lawfully exist. We should and we must condemn them and their behaviour from every corner of the globe. There is no more appropriate response to terrorism than to simply go on living life in a free and democratic society, refusing to be afraid. Australians who stand by each other determined not to be afraid ensure day after day that terrorists continue to fail. In closing, I reiterate my sincere sympathy to the families of those who lost their lives and who were injured in this MAIN COMMITTEE tragedy. WhilstI cannot personally feel the pain they are suffering, my heart goes out to them and I assure them that they will be in my thoughts and prayers over the coming weeks. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (7.01 pm)-I want to join with my colleagues in this place in expressing my horror at the senseless loss of life in the recent Bali bombings. This recent round of attacks on innocent people is a sober reminder of the serious threat that terrorism continues to be for Australians, for our neighbours in Indonesia and for the entire world community. As so many of my colleagues before me have said, Bali is a much loved place, frequently visited by people from around the world, who consider it to be a very special place. Bali has for years been a popular holiday destination for many Australians. Many from my own electorate of Calwell flock there with friends and family. AlthoughI have never had the opportunity to visit, I have many friends and family who have holidayed in Bali. On returning home, they are forever smitten by its beauty and in particular are impressed by the friendliness and charm of the Balinese people. The 2002 Bali bombings horrified and outraged the entire world community. No-one could believe that this much loved island paradise could have been violated in such a vicious and lethal way. We came together and mourned for the huge loss of life, including the significant number of Australians, and we struggled to cope with and to understand the motivation for these bombings and their tragic consequences. We came together with our Indonesian neighbours and we forged a new relationship based on our cooperation and acknowledgment that we were all facing a common threat and that, as such, we had to stand together. The healing process has been a long and difficult one, but we could have said-until recently, that is-that in recent times a new-found confidence had emerged in Bali. Tourism was thriving, people were beginning to return and everything appeared to be back on track. The events of 2002 were slowly being put behind everyone. But then the second Bali bombings took place, and they leave us once again mourning for our dead and wondering why. No-one can make any sense of these senseless killings. They are horrific acts that leave pain and suffering in their tracks, acts that in a split second cause loss of life for innocent people and a lifetime of grieving for those who have lost their loved ones. As a nation and as members of the world community, we must again stand together with Indonesia and offer support and compassion to the victims and their families. However, today I want to take the opportunity to reflect on the actions of terrorists who are prepared to take their own lives in a cause that is committed to nothing more than murdering innocent people. As we all know and have seen, suicide bombing attacks result in widespread carnage. As is the nature of indiscriminate acts of terrorism, the action itself is wilful, calculated and well planned. It is not the spontaneous action of uncontrolled rage or mental illness; it is the premeditated action of killers with a cause. As we struggle to understand the motivation of terrorists, we constantly ask ourselves questions. Is it a case of a clash of civilisations? Is it religious fundamentalism? Is it poverty and disadvantage? Is it the result of dominant foreign policies and military activities? Can the resentment bred by the war in Afghanistan and the ongoing war in Iraq be to blame? Whatever the mix of reasons that seek to explain the motivation behind terrorism, one thing is certain: no cause, divine or secular, can ever justify the deliberate taking of innocent life. These acMAIN COMMITTEE tions are criminal. They are immoral and they are sins against faith. Indeed, in this instance, they are sins against the teachings and principles of Islam. My very large Islamic community constantly reminds me that, like other religious faiths, Islam teaches peace and compassion. It requires its faithful to practise in a manner that is benevolent and loving and rejects totally the killing of innocent people in its name. We need to reflect on this tragedy, both as a nation and as an active member of our geographical region. We also need to consider our relationship with our largest and closest neighbour, Indonesia. People are brought together during times of adversity. The tragedies of the Bali bombings in 2002, the bombing outside the Australian embassy in 2004, the Boxing Day tsunami and now the most recent bombings in Bali have forged, and indeed strengthened, our relationship with our closest neighbour, Indonesia. In July, I and the member for Melbourne Ports were members of a delegation that visited Jakarta. We were there with other colleagues from the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, and our visit was sponsored by the Institute for Democratic Studies. The delegation aimed at developing relations between Indonesian and Australian members of parliament. I want to record the warmth of the reception we received from our Indonesian colleagues. I was very impressed, as was my colleague the member for Melbourne Ports, by the interest they took in learning about Australia and its people. This is the basis upon which we build our mutual relations-getting to know each other fosters better understanding; it helps demystify and breaks down barriers. We have a lot to learn about our neighbours, but they, too, want to know more about us. Communication and cooperation at all levels between governments, parliamentarians, diplomats, security officials and ordinary people in general are an effective way of tackling the propaganda and prejudice of radicals and fundamentalists who prey on the hearts and minds of malleable people, leading them to commit mass murder and leading them to their own selfdestruction in the service of an evil cause. As a country, Australia can play a significant role in maintaining the communication channels needed to allow for the exchange of dialogue between ourselves and the Indonesian people. We are already doing this, but we must increase the effort. Our national security depends largely on the success of the dialogue and on cooperation between our two governmentsindeed, between our people. To this end, we also need to acknowledge and commend the work of all the people who have rallied yet again, starting with the Balinese medical staff, the Indonesian police and the Indonesian government officials. In relation to the Australian relief effort, commendations must go to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade personnel, the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Federal Police, the Royal Australian Air Force, the medical teams at the Royal Darwin Hospital, officials at the Australian embassy and, in particular, our ambassador Mr David Ritchie, whom I met on our trip to Indonesia in July. Most of all, we have to thank the public for their assistance in this great time of need. I also take this opportunity to offer my sympathy to the people of Pakistan and India who are enduring massive loss of life and destruction of property as a result of last Saturday’s earthquake, which has, as we know, devastated north-east Pakistan and the Indian-held areas of Kashmir. We are looking potentially at a loss of up to 40,000 people, and this is a staggering number. In addition to dealing with so many deaths, the people of Pakistan and India who have survived this crisis will now face the long and difficult task of trying to rebuild their MAIN COMMITTEE lives. Australia needs to do whatever is possible to assist in the immediate aftermath as well as into the future. Rescue efforts, I understand, are being hampered by mountainous terrain, but I want to commend our efforts and the efforts of the international community. In the midst of the tragedy we will also learn of happy moments, such as the story of the rescue of the young boy and girl who were pulled alive from the rubble of their collapsed school. This is so typical when natural disasters unfortunately strike. In the last 12 months our world community has been stricken with natural disasters that have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. I would like to take this opportunity to express some thoughts for the people in Guatemala who are also experiencing hardship and loss because of the hurricane activities and the rains which have resulted in severe flooding and mud slides. In countries like Guatemala, which many Australians do not know very much about, there is extreme poverty. People, particularly those in the indigenous community, are forced to live in the most difficult and deprived conditions. These floods and mud slides have wiped away homes and livelihoods on a grand scale. There does not appear to be any hope of recovery. Again another corner of our world community faces grief and an uncertain future. These natural disasters are a constant reminder that we live in a world that is very fragile and unpredictable. For those of us who are fortunate enough to live in better circumstances, such as we who live in Australia, our duty must always be to lend the best possible assistance we can. We have a good record of doing so and we must continue to do so. We must be fully aware that a great number of people in the world community rely on our support. families of the four Australians murdered in Bali just over a week ago. The moment of death captured on television footage brought to our living rooms the graphic illustration that this is a war that has no national boundaries. The victims are innocent casualties in a conflict that has nothing to do with them; rather, the action is directed fanatically at another regime. I well remember the bombing of three years ago, when the toll was much higher. I suppose in that respect we should be grateful that the toll was contained this time, tragic though even one death is. Three years ago we just could not believe what had happened. It took some time for the impact to sink in. It brought home the fact that we could not feel insulated against what was occurring elsewhere in the world. This was reinforced to the people of Newcastle, where many of the victims came from. My sympathies go to you, for I know what you are going through. My sympathies also go out to the peace loving people of Bali, who have also suffered as casualties of a war in which they too are innocent bystanders. This is a time when courage and understanding are required. In the first Bali bombing, two local boys from my electorate were lost from the small community of Ulladulla on the south coast. Because it is such a small community, the impact was far reaching and emotion ranged widely. As a result of that loss, the family and friends of Craig Dunn and Danny Lewis, who died in the first Bali explosion, resolved to erect a memorial to them. The Australian government will be contributing a quarter of a million dollars to the cost of the construction of a memorial recreation centre in Ulladulla. The impact of the event three years ago was far reaching and led us to realise that our geographical remoteness was no insulation against a terrorist attack. Nor is time an effective dilution when you are dealing with the fever of religious zeal. Those who went to Bali probably felt that, after three years without an event, it was safe to go there again.

217,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (7.11 Pm),"We stand here today to extend our condolences to thewhat it must have been like to be sitting there one minute, relaxed and comfortable, enjoying time with friends, and in the next experiencing the shock of the explosion, followed by confusion and then the pain and horror of it all? My friend Sandra McCarthy, the Mayor of Kiama, and her husband and son, must have been thinking, ‘There by the grace of God go I.’ They were there barely four hours previously. She told me of her experiences and was particularly concerned to praise the men and women of the Australian Federal Police who are assisting the Indonesian authorities. Too often we are quick to condemn those in authority. Therefore I would like to read her letter to endorse the fact that we do recognise and appreciate those trying to do a job under extreme circumstances. The letter states: Dear Mrs Jo Gash As you may be aware, Jeff, my son Michael and myself have just returned from Bali. We were the first flight (Australian Airlines) out of Bali after the Saturday night Bombings. Australian Airlines did a wonderful job, keeping people calm on the flight and also waiting for those passengers who had been delayed by the incident so they could fly home. On our arrival at Sydney AirportI was impressed by the conduct and professionalism of our Federal Police. They boarded the plane and each passenger was asked to complete forms listing personal details for data (i.e. so the Government can determine who is missing) and we were also asked to list our whereabouts on the trip and evidence of any suspicious behaviour or circumstances. It was very comforting on our return to Australia to see the quick response of the Federal Police and immediately we felt safe and secure. It is reassuring to Australians to see the role the Federal Police are performing in Bali and their assistance to the Balinese people. Would you please convey our thanks and appreciation to the Federal Police. They are doing a great job. Yours faithfully, Councillor Sandra McCarthy MayorI commend all those Australians who step in to lend a hand in moments like this without any thought of reward or recognition. I also take this occasion to express my condolences to the people of the Kashmir region of Pakistan who were devastated by the earthquake. Having spent considerable time in that region in past years, I can well appreciate the extent of the devastation that has been caused by an earthquake of this magnitude. The remoteness of the area has been made even more so by the extent of the damage to roads and infrastructure and will add to the suffering of the survivors. It is my earnest hope that the world can marshal aid quickly to bring relief to all those in need due to the Guatemalan disaster. We need to contribute as best we can and join with other countries in delivering aid that will be needed in the weeks and months ahead. These are terrible tragedies but they can serve to unite the peoples of the world in the common good and distract us from a preoccupation with the obscenity of terrorist acts. We cannot fight nature but we can unite to overwhelm the insanity that drives these fanatics to kill themselves and others with them. Thank God we live in a country as stable as Australia where we can still live in peace and harmony and continue to be masters of our own destiny. Yet Australians have always been able to demonstrate great compassion to others in times of need. Let us hope we can again turn to our neighbours in their time of need, saying, ‘How can we help?’ MAIN COMMITTEE supported by the opposition, we are dealing with acts of God, from one end of the world to the other, and acts done in the name of God. We are dealing with natural disasters in the earthquake in Pakistan and by Hurricane Stan and the hurricanes that have occurred recently in Florida. We are dealing with the impoverished peoples of Guatemala and Pakistan and those people who earlier, in an associated way, had their lives completely torn to pieces by the hurricanes that had an impact in Florida, Texas and Louisiana. Violence on that scale in the natural world is hard to comprehend for anyone who is not directly in the middle of it, but, in the series of natural disasters over the past 10 years, we have seen a great deal of it. It instructs us again that we live in a turbulent and violent natural world where there is not a centre of safety for people. It is a world of turbulent natural change impressed upon us particularly by the hurricanes occurring around the Gulf of Mexico through to Guatemala and also in the Asian region with the recent one that was visited upon Vietnam. Over both historical and geological time, these are natural phenomena that occur readily. There seems to be enough scientific evidence to indicate that not just the regularity of the storms’ occurrences but their strength is related to an increase in temperature caused by excess greenhouse gas emissions and that, as the oceans heat, we will get more and more of these hurricanes and typhoons that can wreak such terrible damage on the natural world and on the peoples who suffer from them. The level of natural violence and the numbers of people killed are very high. In the Kashmir incident, it looks as though they are somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000, and they may go higher than that. We remember what happened in Banda Aceh and the associated provinces in Indonesia with the tsunami, which was caused by earthquake activity. People in their hundreds of thousands were killed. The magnitude of those natural disasters is very difficult to deal with. But we have seen the United Nations organisations, the Red Cross, the Red Crescent and governments such as Australia’s pledging $1 billion to assist those people affected in Indonesia. We have seen Australian efforts not only from the government but also from individual people giving to relieve the effects of those natural disasters all around the world. We have seen the goodness of humanity where people, either individually or through organisations or government instrumentalities, have sought to redress the damage done by the natural violence of the planet and its emissions. In insurance terms, they are called ‘acts of God’-acts which have wreaked so much damage over the history of this planet. Our world population is now so high, at six billion plus. We are moving towards a world population of nine billion by the year 2050, with the possibility that the world population may stabilise at that level then. We are dealing with a period of time where, with increasing climatic change, the level of intensity of hurricanes and typhoons will have a greater impact on people in littoral areas. That greater impact will be because of the greater densities of population. So we can expect to have to plan for and take into account more disaster recovery action, and more of our national production will have to be directed towards ameliorating the consequences of natural disasters, which may increase in frequency and certainly in ferocity. All of the governments, individuals and organisations that have played their part in trying to mend what was broken deserve our greatest and deepest thanks. All of those people who have suffered so greatly as a result of the disasters need speedy help, help that is directed towards trying to put back their societies into a shape that is strong and good. MAIN COMMITTEE",164,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
218,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (7.16 Pm),"In this motion put forward by the government andIn a way, it is easier to deal with the natural elements-in insurance terms, the ‘acts of God’-and the great numbers of people who have had their lives shattered by them than it is to deal with the actions taken in the name of God. Quite rightly, the general thrust, the common thread, of commentary since the original attacks on Bali, the attacks that we have seen in London, New York and Washington and these most recent attacks in Bali is that, although these things are done in the name of God, you have to separate out the people who believe in a particular religion-in this case, Islam-and the fundamental tenets of that religion, from the people who, from an extremist or a fanatical base, attempt to distort it. The member for Herbert quite rightly said that Islam means ‘peaceful submission to the will of Allah, the sole creator of the universe’. Most of the commentary coming from Islamic groups-and also other commentary-has stressed the fact that in Islam there is no place for violent action against others. There is no place for taking people’s lives, whether in a deliberate way or just as a consequential action of attempting to overthrow a government, a state or a people. They have used a series of quotes to show that it is not on and that you have to separate it out. I think it is important to make a qualification to that. Historically, particularly during the period of the crusades between Christendom and Islam, there was great devastation and great violence in the long wars between those two groups and the country groups that were driven forward and that used as their excuse either Islam or Christianity. At base they had justifications which they sought to make and to have embedded in their religion because they were the fundamental ideological purpose for what they were supposed to be doing. If you look either in the Old Testament or in the Koran, because of the nature of the human beings seeing these things through their eyes, you can find express conditions which could justify a just war in the case of the Christians or which could justify actions that are violent towards those you are against in the case of Islam. When most people talk about the fact that there is absolutely no place for terrorism or violence in Islam, they leave out a rider in the Koran; there is a specific provision that this is seen to be done against the will of Allah. So they are leaving out the conditional extra that the fundamentalist groups tag on to an interpretation of Islam that is at odds with modern, tolerant Islam but that is certainly there and capable of being used. Yesterday in the party room the Leader of the Opposition said something that was profoundly important in relation to this. He said that basically we are dealing with a confrontation between the 21st century and the 12th century. It is between modernism and medievalism. It is between progress, both technological and social, and a drive to either bomb us back or take us back into the past and embed us there forever. These are not isolated incidents. You can go back to 1979 and Ayatollah Khomeini’s revolution in Iran. You can look at the nature of modern democracies, whether it be Pakistan or Indonesia, and think about their attempts to build their countries as modern democracies and to be forward-looking, to be Western-like, to take account of a secular approach to these things. If you look at the contra in relation to this, it is simply that, in 1979, the Iranian revolution took a modern, advanced, Westernising, secular state in Iran and turned it upside down. It was the template for the Taliban to attempt to overthrow and then succeed in overthrowing the government of Afghanistan and to impose an Islamic state that was based on a severe, extreme fundamentalism. They provided another template for people world wide. MAIN COMMITTEE We know that the Taliban have been directly connected to al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and all of the works of ‘the base’, or al-Qaeda, from the early 1990s on. The core of their appeal is an appeal for their brand of fundamentalist Islam and an attempt to use that as a rallying call to people around the world but also to use it to subvert and overthrow Islamic states in the Middle East and, in the case of Jemaah Islamiah, to create, in concert with al-Qaeda and other groups, an Islamic state in South-East Asia. The people who are pursuing this have utterly no concern for the value of human life whatsoever. Whether people are of the Islamic faith, the Christian faith or the Judaic faith, where the value of life is placed as a central element of Yahweh or Allah or a Christian God, where the centrality and importance of human life is valued, all of that is utterly swept away by what these fundamentalists are attempting to do. From this point on, as we have since the September 11 actions in the United States in 2001, we can and must prosecute the war on terror against these people. We must hunt them down and bring them to justice. Otherwise, they will know that they do not need to extend any justice to any individual being on this planet and, therefore, that without being brought to task they can continue to do what they have done in Bali this time, what they did in Bali three years ago, what they have done in London, what they have done in the United States and what they would seek to do here in Australia. These are people who are extreme and fanatical and who have had bred into them an ideological passion. Inculcated in them is a drive towards nihilism, towards creating a state of nothingness, with a deliberately fractured view of what religion should be. It is right for all of those people in my electorate who follow Islam to directly debate, repudiate and refute all of the tenets that these organisations are putting up and all of their attempts to destroy, in the name of their God, those people who have lost their lives. I commend the motion before the House and I commend the fact that both the government and the opposition fully support it. I link myself to the previous speakers on this. We must continue to do all in our power to overcome both the natural and unnatural disasters that have been visited on people. were once again caught up in a terrorist bombing in Bali. Three closely timed explosions took place-one at Raja’s restaurant in downtown Kuta and two at Jimbaran Bay at Cafe Nyoman, a beachfront seafood restaurant-killing 24 innocent people and wounding a further 100. These were popular tourist places where many Australians have spent memorable holiday time. I wish to support the motion and extend my condolences and support to the families of all those who were either killed or injured by these cowardly and barbaric acts of terrorism, including those of the four Australians who lost their lives. Sadly, the youngest Australian among those killed was Brendan Fitzgerald, a 16-year-old Western Australian boy from a Busselton family. Brendan apparently took the brunt of the blast from the explosion in Raja’s bar in Kuta, together with his father, Terry. Brendan’s father, Terry Fitzgerald, had taken his children-Brendan, 16, and Jessica, 13-to Bali for holidays. The Fitzgerald family were enjoying a week’s holiday in Bali and were due to return home the following day. I understand that Brendan’s body is being returned to Perth today. The Busselton community has paid tribute to Brendan Fitzgerald. He has been described as a perfect friend and team-mate as well as a keen sportsman. Brendan enjoyed playing football MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
219,Mr Prosser (Forrest) (7.32 Pm),"On Saturday, 1 October at about 7.30 pm Australiansand was a talented cricketer whose skills were highlighted as an opening bowler in the country week tournaments in 2004 and 2005. Brendan was in year 11 at Busselton Senior High School. He was a very popular student with many friends. He will be sadly missed. The Fitzgeralds are a close-knit Busselton family and very strong supporters of the Busselton community. The Busselton and wider communities are ready to support the Fitzgerald family in any way they can with the Fitzgeralds’s grief and recovery. Brendan’s father, Terry Fitzgerald, and 13-year-old sister, Jessica, who is a student at the Georgiana Molloy Anglican School in Busselton, were flown to Singapore General Hospital for emergency treatment for burns and shrapnel injuries. Jessica suffered burns to the front of her body and multiple serious shrapnel wounds and extensive facial injuries and is said to be in a serious but stable condition. The condition of Terry Fitzgerald is reported as critical, with serious abdominal wounds and serious spinal injuries. We hope that as each day passes there are signs of improvement. Terry’s parents, Trevor and Win Fitzgerald, along with Brendan and Jessica’s mother, Lisa, are in Singapore now to be with Terry and Jessica to assist in any way possible with their slow recovery. Indeed, I am informed today that Terry Fitzgerald has shown encouraging signs of movement, albeit small, but we can be assured that both Terry and Jessica are receiving the best possible care and treatment. Bali is a very popular holiday destination for many south-west residents, and the Busselton community is unfortunately no stranger to the horrors of the terrorist attacks in Bali. Indeed, nearly three years ago today, on 12 October 2002, when the previous terrorist bombings ripped through the Sari Club and Paddy’s Bar in Bali killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring more than 300 people, Busselton resident Carol Johnson, a teacher from the Busselton Senior High School-the very school that Brendan attended-was one of those killed. Another Busselton resident, Connie Watson, was also seriously injured and is still recovering, just recently having a second lot of skin grafts. Since 2002 Indonesia has experienced two other bombings, both in the capital Jakarta. Those blasts were at the JW Marriott Hotel in 2003 and outside the Australian Embassy in 2004, killing 23 people. I would like to praise the tremendous efforts of all those involved in the provision of assistance to the victims of the bombing, most particularly the emergency response personnel, the health providers in Indonesia and all those individuals and volunteers who assisted in the aftermath. The efforts of Qantas, state emergency service and health officials and Australian government officials should be commended for the expedient and professional coordination of medical evacuation and hospitalisation plans. The emergency response team, including consular, medical, counselling, emergency management and bomb-blast specialists, remain in Bali and a consular and counselling team are also in Singapore. All Australians share the grief of the people of Bali and the wider Indonesian community, who have suffered this terrible crime on their soil. The Australian government supports the Indonesian authorities in their efforts to hunt down and capture those responsible for the latest terrorist acts. The Australian Federal Police are working closely with the Indonesian National Police in the investigation. Many Australians, particularly Western Australians, have enjoyed holidays in Bali. It is a fun-loving place to be. It is very much like Busselton in a lot of ways-it is friendly and reMAIN COMMITTEE laxed. Indeed, my family and I have visited both places. We have eaten at Jimbaran Bay Beach. It sends a shudder up your spine that it was just another family at the wrong place at the wrong time when these cowardly acts were perpetrated upon the people of Bali capturing innocent Australians in their wake. I wish to extend our sympathy to the families of all those affected by these cowardly attacks, which tragically underscore the importance of our ongoing efforts in our fight against terrorism. across the chamber to register my profound sympathy for the families of those who lost their lives in Bali and to express my very strong condolences to the families of the victims and all those involved. Parliamentarians will have the opportunity tomorrow morning to gather outside the parliament to again express both our sympathy and our support for those affected by this terrible event. One thing we can say is that we see the best of people in the worse of times. I think that has been very much in evidence both here in the parliament with the speeches that have been made and the acknowledgements by members of the efforts not only of family members but also of Foreign Affairs staff, Federal Police and members of the community both in Australia and Indonesia who, when something as terrible as this does happen, jump in and help. We might describe the events in Bali-the bombing of two years ago and most recentlyas the end of innocence for Australians as they travel abroad. Most Australians up to that point in time would not have had exposure to terrorism in any shape or form, thankfully. It is a terrible conclusion to the innocent period of Australians taking their holidays in other countries to find that a fate of this nature can befall them. That end of innocence that has happened in Bali is made all the more poignant because of the nature of the island itself: its very precious physical beauty, its distinct and unique culture and the nature of the Balinese themselves. What a capacity for compassion and solidarity with Australians they have demonstrated through both of these horrible events and associated events. Yet it is something of a shockwave when it happens again and Australians again lose their lives. I know it is difficult for many people to discern any reason, any sense of coherence, in a random act of violence of this kind. It is clear that the intention is to harm people, and that goes against the grain of all communities, of all countries and certainly of all people who believe that we need to live with a view to peace and peaceful coexistence. With regret, I note that the shockwaves have been felt very strongly in my own seat of Kingsford Smith. A number of Australians lost their lives in the first Bali event: members of the Coogee Dolphins football team, members of Souths Juniors, members of Brigidine College and members of the Coogee Surf Lifesaving Club. A number of those who lost their lives were living in my electorate and were valued members of the community. Their families and friends, their school friends and their sporting club mates experienced not only the shockwave but the grief of losing people they loved and also the task-which I think is as difficult, particularly after the first Bali event-of coming to terms with what had happened. The unexpected, shocking, sudden and violent nature of people’s passing means that communities experience the psychology of grief and grieving, and it takes some time for them, even with the very good assistance of counsellors, people in the church and school communities and families who provide that support. Notwithstanding the support that is there, the community takes some time to adjust to that psychological grief, and the grief remains. MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
220,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (7.38 Pm),"I rise to join with parliamentary colleaguesButI have to note that the community response has been a profoundly empathetic one. In fact, in Kingsford Smith, on the north head of Coogee, we now commemorate the passing of those who lost their lives in the first Bali bombing. I attended that event. It was one of the first official duties I had as a member of parliament. Despite the great sadness associated with that event, I also came away from it with a sense of the capacity of the community and people to stick together and provide support. Again, last Sunday, the local community at Malabar held a family day of remembrance for those lost in the Bali tragedy. I will record in the Hansard that this smaller and more private gathering did take place at Cromwell Park at Malabar Beach, where Malabar families of the Bali victims had organised an informal community and family day of remembrance. Each year, nine Australian flags are raised-the flags which covered the coffins of the nine locals who died in Bali-and subsequently there is an opportunity for the community to gather for a sausage sizzle. This year there was a talent quest as well. All members of the community in that particular area-it is a close-knit community-are invited to come along for the day. I want to take the opportunity to note both victims’ names and also the names of family members who were commemorated on 9 October at Malabar: Gayle Airlie and her family Mr and Mrs Patricia and Noel Minton, Mr Michael Sant, Mr and Mrs Gary and Leanne Forster and Ryan Sant; Abbey Borgia and Deborah Borgia and the surviving family members Mr John Borgia and Mr Ben Borgia; Gerardine Buchan and Steve Buchan and the surviving family members Mr and Mrs James and Brinald Brougham, Candice Buchan, Mr and Mrs Jim and Maureen Buchan, and Dave Seelin and family; Chloe Byron and surviving family members Mr and Mrs David and Tia Byron and Jarrod Byron; Shane Foley and surviving family members Ms Pascale Saad, Mr Todd Foley and Mrs Cynthia Foley; Adam Howard and surviving members Ms Emelia Armytage and Mr and Mrs Don and Joyce Howard; Joshua Iliffe and the surviving family member Mr Peter Iliffe; David Mavroudis and surviving family members Mr and Mrs John and Colleen Mavroudis and Ms Jane Mavroudis; Lynette McKeon and Marissa McKeon, a mother and daughter, and surviving family members Mr Ross McKeon, MsL McKeon and Mr Steve McKeon; Ben Roberts and surviving family members Mr and Mrs Alan and Janice Roberts, Ms Lucy Roberts, Ms Caroline Chan and Mr Kevin Lynch; Kathy Salvatori and surviving family members Mr and Mrs Noel and Barbara Hackett, Mr Craig Salvatori, Olivia and Eliza Salvatori, Mr and Mrs Simon and Angela Morgan and Mr and Mrs Bryan and Lisa Briggs; Catherine Seelin and surviving family members Mr Dave Seelin, Matthew and Todd Seelin, Mr and Mrs Jim and Maureen Buchan and Candice Buchan; Julie Stevenson and surviving family members Mrs Azelda Stevenson and Mr Rolfe Brown; Tom Singer and surviving family members Mr and Mrs Peter and Megan Singer; Clint Thompson and surviving family members Mr and Mrs Robert and Sandra Thompson, Mr Trent Thompson and Brock, Fallah, Kaleb, Ryan and Ziade Thompson; Robyn Webster and surviving family member Mr Brian Webster; and Gerard Yeo and surviving family members Mr Paul Yeo, Mr and Mrs Paul and Kier Yeo and Ms Judi Yeo. We remembered those people in a ceremony that was simple and meaningful and that brought together the community of Kingsford Smith, and particularly Malabar, to express not only their sympathy but their memory of what this loss means and how the community can respond in a positive way to something as traumatic as this. MAIN COMMITTEE What do we take from the Bali experiences? Apart from the great and ongoing necessity to provide support for the families of those victims and apart from the fact that we see a resolve amongst community and friends to commemorate-to move on but also to honour the memory in events such as the one I have described at Cromwell Park at Malabar Beach-in a broader sense we take on a commitment to maintain a connection with the people of Bali to support, through the offices of the parliament that we speak in and also more generally in the community, the democratic impulses in Indonesia which will be so necessary to counter terrorism. As well, we need to more extensively build our capacity in the region, where the challenges are great-not only the challenges of managing and containing terrorism but the challenges of allowing for people to grow out of poverty and have fully realised lives. Finally there is a better understanding of what all of us can take from the commemoration-a recognition of the preciousness of life and the necessity always to honour and remember those who have gone before us. seems such a short time ago that we were all shocked by the events in Bali. In the last event some six young people from my electorate were killed. It was a great tragedy. I spent a lot of time, when I was requested by the members of the family, ringing hospitals, ringing morgues, ringing the consul-general, trying to find the loved ones of those in my electorate. How horrified they were when we confirmed that their loved ones had died. There was one particular family who had gone to Bali. There was a group of four young women-all under 30, all good friends, two of whom were sisters and a sister-in-law. They went to Bali and all four were killed; they had been to the Sari nightclub. To speak to their mother, even to this day, is a time of sadness for me. The mother cannot quite bring herself to face the reality of two young, beautiful girls who were just destroyed. In the centre of Cronulla, very close to the beach which was loved by the members of my electorate, particularly the young women who were killed-and the six who were killed were all young women-there is a memorial that reminds us, every day that we go down there, of the unnecessary loss of life. They were young women who were full of life, full of adventure and full of love of the water and the surf, which of course was why there were so many from my area who went to Bali-the surf culture is part of the way of life in the Sutherland shire. Going to the funerals of those young people was a great tragedy. Listening to the heartfelt comments and to eulogies from husbands, lovers, mothers and fathers was just so heartwrenching. You thought to yourself: ‘Do the terrorists have any idea what they are about? What is the sense of this? From what do they gain their momentum and their purpose in perpetrating such awful deeds?’ I am sure that all of us here in the House know fundamentalism in its various guises. But there is no thing such as the fundamentalism that encourages young people to blow themselves up and take others with them in a great desire to promote the values of a cause which others do not relate to. Moderate Muslims cannot relate to the terrorism ideology that they believe. I was in Israel in July this year. They had a special monitoring service of Palestinian television which showed programs, particularly for teenagers and even children, promoting the great glories of terrorist suicide and saying that young men would be greeted by 72 virgins in MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Indonesia Terrorist Attacks
221,Mr Baird (Cook) (7.50 Pm),"Here again we have the tragedy of another Bali event. Itparadise. They discussed on the television programs that none of them wanted death but, if it meant that they would die as martyrs, it was something different. In the Western world, we cannot understand this. We see the great devastation wreaked on families, on people who were there with no political agenda-young people just out to have a good time in Bali. It is devastating. For us this event brings forth memories of September 11, as we watched the collapse of the World Trade Centre towers and the destruction of several thousand people. We recounted those events as we watched what happened in Bali, with over 100 Australians being killed. We all felt caught up in global terror. Some six weeks after the terrorism attack at the Sari nightclub, I went to the Christian memorial service in Bali. We had the Hindu cleansing service, which the then minister for health went to, and then I went to the Christian service after it. For me, it was a very moving occasion. Some 10,000 Balinese people gathered to remember those who were killed or injured and to reach out to the families of those who were affected. I met those who had been injured and burnt in the Sari blast and the families who had lost loved ones-Indonesians. We often forget that the majority of those killed were Balinese people. After the service I got into a taxi and the taxi driver expressed vehemently his opposition to those who had perpetrated this event. There are no more wonderful people on earth than the Balinese people. They are gentle, carefree and loving in their approach. This event is a great travesty. We had a real paradise on earth in Bali-the wonderful environment, the wonderful waterways that surround Bali and, of course, the lifestyle. Bali is predominantly Hindu; there are also Christians and Muslims. Undoubtedly, there is resentment from those in other areas of Indonesia: they see the prosperity of Bali as they respond to the tourism demands of the West. We joined with some 10,000 people in the rain that night. There was a sense of oneness from people who had come from different parts of the world but also of great sorrow that we lived in a different world. As we think of these latest events in Bali, our hearts go out particularly to those from the Newcastle area but also, obviously, to those from different parts of the world and the Indonesians involved. We express our sorrow for them and our heartfelt sympathies for the families who mourn them. As the Hobart Mercury said on 4 October: For many Australians, Bali is a paradise. But in the wake of the latest bombings on the Indonesian island it is more like a paradise lostto use the Milton phrase. I was invited by the Indonesian tourism people to be part of a group that went up there after the bombings to try and look at what they could do to redevelop tourism in Bali. Of course, we looked at many ways. Now that we have had these terrorist attacks at Jimbaran Bay, which is where many families from Australia would stay and go out at night to have dinner on the beach, it changes the whole dimension. We thought the Sari club was perhaps just a one off; perhaps it was just an accidental thing that some terrorists got together and it will not happen again. The fact that we have had three bombings-one in Kuta and two in Jimbaran Bay-gives it a whole different dimension. I think it is unlikely that we are going to see tourists return to Bali in anything like the numbers we have seen in the past. Every Australian who loves the place would love to go back, in sympathy for the Balinese, and yet they cannot ignore the realities of terrorism that exist. I commend the Australian Federal Police for their efforts in working with the Balinese and Indonesian police to track down those who brought this crime about. Obviously, it is too late MAIN COMMITTEE for the three young people who acted as suicide bombers, but tracking down those who were responsible is the main ingredient. On behalf of my electorate, I extend my sympathy to those who have suddenly lost loved ones as a result of this terrorist attack. We have experienced the loss of six young people from the area. We went through it as a community-we had services together-and it brought the community together. Terrorism has changed the world in which we live. We want to support the Indonesians-it is a time of great terror for them-as they come to grips with the changed tourism dimension on the island of Bali. Most importantly, we think of the loved ones of those who were seriously injured and those who were killed. Our sympathy and hearts go out to them. On behalf of my electorate, I express my great sorrow at the events that took place in Bali such a short time ago. will be very brief. I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and all those who have participated in this condolence motion about the terrorist attacks in Bali. In particular, I pay attention to the two backbenchers who participated in the House-the honourable member for Paterson and the honourable member for Newcastle. I thought they both made very good contributions. Obviously, Bali is a special place for Indonesians and the Balinese, but for Australians it is almost a rite of passage for so many of our young folk. Notwithstanding this second tragedy, I have some sympathy for the Minister for Health and Ageing, who advises people that we should always pay attention to the travel advisories that are issued but that we should not let the Balinese down either. We just hope that this will be the last such atrocity, the last such outrage. To the victims and their families in Newcastle and to the family of Brendan Fitzgerald in Busselton, I extend my deep felt sympathy, not only from me but from my electorate. I have a very large Pakistani community in my electorate. I am Deputy President of the Australia-Pakistan parliamentary group and every year I travel to Ryde to celebrate Pakistan Day there. The earthquake in Pakistan, which has also affected Afghanistan and India and appears to have taken 40,000 lives, is a horrific tragedy. I support the government totally in its donation of some $5.5 million to date. I hope we will be generous and dig deeper if we can help and if there is a continuing need. I know that the President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, has asked all Pakistanis living overseas to be generous and to dig deep. I know that Ejaz Khan, President of the Pakistan Australia Friendship Association, and his members will indeed organise most generously on behalf of the victims. I know that the children of the King Abdul Aziz school in my electorate will dig deep, and I ask all those who attend the mosque adjacent to the school to be generous and to dig deep. The loss of 40,000 lives is something we find very hard to understand and to come to grips with. On my behalf and on behalf of all my constituents, I express my heartfelt sorrow at the tragedy that has unfolded in Pakistan. That further proceedings be conducted in the House. Question agreed to.

Utilities Allowance (Question No. 1179) Ms Hoare asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 10 May 2005: (1) Can she confirm that recipients of the veterans’ affairs pensions of age pension age receive a utilities allowance twice a year; if so, what is the amount of the utilities allowance paid to (a) single and (b) couple pensioners. (2) Can she explain why veterans in receipt of veterans’ affairs pensions under age pension age do not receive a utilities allowance. (3) Is it the case that the living costs of veterans receiving veterans’ affairs pensions is independent of age and that all veterans would benefit from the payment of the utilities allowance. (4) Will she ensure that all veterans eligible for veterans’ affairs pensions are paid the utilities allowance; if not, why not. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The utilities allowance is paid to veterans’ affairs pensioners who receive service pension and income support supplement and are of veteran pension age (5 years younger than age pension age). The utilities allowance is paid in two instalments of half the annual rate each March and September. The rate is currently: (a) $100 per year paid to eligible pensioners who are single, or who are members of an illness separated couple or respite care couple; and (b) $50 per year paid to each eligible member of a couple. (2) The utilities allowance was introduced as part of the Government’s 2004 election commitment “Recognising Senior Australians – their needs and their carers” and was directed towards senior Australians. The payment recognises the difficulties some older Australians have in meeting regular household bills. (3) While living costs for veterans’ affairs pensioners of all ages may be similar, those over pension age are less likely to receive outside sources of income such as wages and therefore rely more heavily on income support. The utilities allowance was directed to older Australians, in recognition of this. (4) There are currently no plans to extend the utilities allowance to veterans’ affairs pensioners who are below veteran pension age.

(2) Is the Minister also aware that the RAN has eight guns in its fleet, six on board the FFG class Frigates, one at the West Head Gun School in Flinders and a rotatable spare under refurbishment at Bendigo. (3) Can the Minister confirm that ADI Limited Bendigo holds the manufacture licence from Oto Melara to maintain and service these gun mounts in Australia, that a program to refurbish a gun each year was established and that it would continue for the life of the FFG Frigate (approximately 16 years). (4) Can the Minister explain why ADI Limited Bendigo has not received an order for the next refurbished gun. (5) Is the Minister aware that if an order is not placed immediately the electronic testing and measuring equipment will not be maintained and will fall into disrepair, and that specialist tooling and equipment will be lost or sold off as scrap. (6) Is the Minister also aware that if an order is not placed immediately the livelihoods of six technicians at ADI Limited Bendigo will be jeopardised. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The existence of the licence from Oto Melera, now Oto Breda, is used as the basis for sole sourcing repair orders of the gun to ADI Limited Bendigo. A refurbishment program was established in 1992, based on an overhaul periodicity of approximately seven years per gun. The future MK 75, 76mm gun overhaul program is impacted by the withdrawal from service of HMA Ships Canberra and Adelaide. The periodicity of gun overhaul is, therefore, being reviewed. (4) Pending the outcome of the Commonwealth’s review of gun overhaul periodicity, ADI will be asked to provide a quotation to overhaul a mount as a rotatable pool item or insurance spare to support a move to a reliability centred maintenance philosophy. (5) ADI has indicated that if sufficient work is forthcoming it would reconsider the commercial viability of support of this system. (6) ADI has indicated that reduction in support requirements for this gun will impact on staffing levels at ADI Bendigo.

226,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for the Arts and Sport has provided the following answer toon the application as soon as practicable but in any case not later than 90 days after the day on which the application is received by the Archives. The National Archives of Australia has advised that section 40 applies to applications under the Archives Act 1983 for access to open period Commonwealth records. Section 40 does not apply to personal records. (4) The National Archives of Australia has advised that in June 2004 they referred item 4 of series M1767, which was subject to the January 2004 application, to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for advice on whether its release may constitute an unreasonable disclosure of personal information. Consultation occurred between officers of the relevant areas in National Archives of Australia and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. In November 2004, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet provided advice by letter to the Director-General of the National Archives. (5) I am advised that the Prime Minister will be providing the information requested in his response to Question number 1511. (6) The National Archives of Australia consulted the Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor General about item 4 of series M1767.

(b) The Government currently pays the basic daily care fee for former POWs in residential aged care, both high (nursing home) care and, since January 2005, in low (hostel) care. The fee is set by the Australian Government and administered by the Department of Health and Ageing. The basic daily care fee which means-tested pensioners pay for their care can be no more than 85% of the basic pension. Currently (as at 8 September 2005) this is up to $27.86 per day. Non pensioners can be asked to pay a basic daily care fee of up to $34.76 a day. The Government can only advise the maximum fee because providers may choose to charge less, although this rarely happens.

(2) What is the Government’s response to these remarks and what steps has he taken to convey its views to the Chinese authorities. (3) What was the response of the Chinese Government to the Government’s views. (4) What is the Government’s assessment of the likelihood that China will resort to force to resolve the China-Taiwan issue. (5) Will he explain the Government policy on the right of the people of Taiwan to determine their future by democratic means without the threat of force by China. (6) Has he communicated the Government’s views on Taiwan to the Chinese Government; if so, (a) when, (b) by what means did he most recently do so, and (c) what was the response of the Chinese Government; if not, why not.

We therefore encourage both sides to engage in constructive dialogue, to minimise the chances of such a miscalculation and to establish the basis for a peaceful, negotiated settlement of their differences. (5) The Government has consistently urged both China and Taiwan to avoid acts or statements that might unilaterally alter the cross-Strait status quo and put regional stability at risk. The Government has also made clear that it opposes any resort to the threat or use of force to resolve crossStrait differences. (6) (a) I have conveyed the Government’s views to the Chinese Government regularly in meetings with Chinese Ministers and in public statements.

(b) No. Pine Gap Defence Facility (Question No. 2092) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 17 August 2005: (1) Is the Minister aware of the provisions of Article9 of the Agreement between the Australian and United States Governments relating to the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap (JDFPG) that deals with the application of Australian taxation law to non-Australian contractors, sub-contractors, personnel of contactors and sub-contractors and associated dependants, working in Australia in connection with the JDFPG. (2) Can the minister explain the contemporary policy justification for Article9 of the Agreement which was negotiated in 1966 and remains unchanged since that time. (3) Will the Government undertake a review of the operation and appropriateness of Article9 prior to consideration of the next ten-year extension of the Agreement; if not, why not. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) The provisions of Article9 of the JDFPG Agreement are consistent with similar arrangements under the 1963 Status of Forces Agreement with the United States, which remains in force. (3) The Government reviews all articles of all arrangements before extending them. The JDFPG Agreement was last extended on 16 November 1998. Naval Communications Station (Question No. 2095) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 17 August 2005: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 524 (Hansard, 10 May 2005, page 232), which section or part of the Department of Defence employs the fourteen Defence civilian personnel working at North West Cape Naval Communication Station (NCS) and what are the duties of those personnel. (2) What section or part of the Department of Defence is responsible for overseeing the operation of the NCS. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Eleven of the Department of Defence staff working at Naval Communication Station HaroldE Holt are Defence Materiel Organisation employees. All of these staff are engaged in either contractor management and/or base administration duties. The remaining three staff are from the Corporate Services and Infrastructure Group. Their duties include environmental, occupational health and safety, security and facilities management. (2) The operation of the Station is overseen by the Defence Materiel Organisation, on behalf of the Royal Australian Navy and United States Navy. Strategic management is provided by both nations via equal representation on an Executive Steering Committee. National Security (Question No. 2107) Mr Danby asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 17 August 2005: (1) Has he seen reports that Mr Abdul Rahim Ayub, the alleged head of Jemaah Islamiya’s “Mantiki 4” terrorist cell, and co-author of the plan to assassinate Rabbi Joseph Gutnick and bomb the Israeli Embassy in Canberra, is currently at large in West Java, Indonesia. (2) What is his response to the comment by Mr Neil Fergus, a former head of ASIO’s Middle East Department, saying that he was at a loss to know why Mr Abdul Rahim Ayub has not been charged with conspiracy to murder over the plan whose other co-author, Mr Jack Roche, has already been convicted. (3) What is his response to the comment by Mr Rohan Gunaratna of the Singapore Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, blaming Mr Abdul Rahim Ayub’s escape to Indonesia on the Australian Government’s slowness to use the powers given to it by Parliament to combat terrorism. (4) Were Mr Abdul Rahim Ayub and his brother Mr Abdur Rahman Ayub persons of interest to the Australian authorities at the time of their departure from Australia; if so, why were they allowed to leave Australia; if not, when did each of them become a person of interest. (1) Yes, I have seen the reports. (2) Mr Roche was arrested by the Australian Federal Police on 18 November 2002 and convicted on charges of conspiracy to commit offences under the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976. Matters relating to the raising of criminal charges against Mr Ayub are the responsibility of the Australian Federal Police. (3) I have seen Mr Gunaratna’s comments. I am unable to provide comment on specific investigations. I reject the notion that Australian Government agencies have been slow in reacting to terrorist threats and in combating terrorism. Further, I am confident that the relevant agencies have used, and continue to use appropriate powers when applicable. (4) In February 2002, Mr Abdul Rahman Ayub’s protection visa was declined and he was deported from Australia. Mr Abdul Rahim Ayub departed Australia for Indonesia in October 2002. There was no legal reason preventing Mr Rahim Ayub from departing Australia. The Ayub brothers were known to Australian Government agencies prior to their respective departures. The Ayub brothers departed Australia before Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) became a proscribed organisation under legislation, precluding the establishment of any criminal offences. Pensions and Benefits (Question No. 2109) Ms Hoare asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, in writing, on 18 August 2005: (1) What is the maximum (a) fortnightly and (b) annual allowable level of income for recipients of (i) Age Pension, (ii) Disability Support Pension, (iii) Newstart, (iv) Youth Allowance, and (v) Austudy Payment to maintain the maximum rate of payment. (2) Is it the case that when a recipient’s fortnightly income exceeds the allowable level the recipient’s payment will be reduced even where that income on an annualised basis falls short of the allowable annual income. (3) Is he aware that income for the purposes of payments such as Family Tax Benefit is considered on an annualised basis. (4) Will he consider allowing income earned by recipients of the above payments to be annualised to the maximum annual amount; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (i): Age Pension (a) $124 a fortnight for singles",222,Questions In Writing
235,Mr Ruddock,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,227,Questions In Writing
236,Mr Hockey,"The Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services$220 a fortnight for couples (combined) (b) see question 2 (ii): Disability Support Pension: (a) $124 a fortnight for singles $220 a fortnight for couples (combined) (b) There is no annual allowable level of income for recipients of Disability Support Pension. (iii) Newstart (a) The maximum allowable level of income to maintain the full rate of Newstart Allowance is $62 per fortnight. (b) There is no annual allowable level of income for recipients of Newstart Allowance. (iv) and (v): Youth Allowance and Austudy payment For each of these payments, for full-time student recipients (single or partnered), the maximum fortnightly amount of allowable income is $236. However, a recipient may have a credit balance in their Student Income Bank which may be drawn upon without affecting their entitlement even if they earn more than $236 a fortnight. A student may accumulate the unused amount of their income free area each fortnight, thus building up a credit in their Income Bank. For each of these payments, using the fortnightly income free area amount of $236, full-time student recipients are entitled to a maximum $6,136 annually. This is the cumulative total of 26 fortnights, at $236 per fortnight, over the period of a year. (iv) Youth Allowance (other) (a) The maximum allowable level of income to maintain the full rate of Youth Allowance (other)* is $62 per fortnight. * young people under 21 years of age who are not full-time students or apprentices. (b) There is no annual allowable level of income for recipients of Youth Allowance (other). (2) Is it the case that when a recipient’s fortnightly income exceeds the allowable level the recipient’s payment will be reduced even where that income on an annualised basis falls short of the allowable annual income. Age Pension No. Under the Social Security Act 1991 the pension is an annual amount based on current income. The way that an Age Pension customer’s earnings impact upon the rate of pension will vary depending upon the frequency and nature of the person’s employment. Where a person has regular earnings of, say, $200 per fortnight, the income is assessed as being $5,200 per annum during the entire period the person is earning the amount. Should the person cease working, the income is coded to nil. When a person has variable or fluctuating wages, the amount he or she earns is averaged over a reasonable period, usually 3 months, and then annualised. For example, a person earns $2,600 wages over a 3 month period, which is annualised to $10,400 per annum. This amount of income is used when working out the person’s rate of pension for the next 3 months. If the pensioner ceases working, their income assessment is reduced to nil. Where a pensioner does seasonal work, such as exam marking or works as a Santa Claus, the amount he or she earns is held as income for the full year. For example, an Age Pension customer who earns $200 per week over an 8-week period is assessed as having annual income of $1,600. This amount affects his or her rate of pension for the whole of the next 12 months and so is not reduced to nil on Centrelink’s records during that time. Centrelink staff are instructed to apply the assessment method which most accurately reflects the person’s current income. Where more than one method may be appropriate, the most beneficial treatment is applied. Disability Support Pension, Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance (other) No. There is no allowable annual income level for Disability Support Pension, Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance (other). Also, working credits may reduce the amount of employment income that is counted under the income test for recipients of Disability Support Pension, Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance (other) in a fortnight. As a result, recipients may have fortnightly income in excess of the maximum allowable level but still receive the full rate of income support payment. Disability Support Pension, Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance (other) recipients accrue working credits in fortnights when their income is below $48, to a maximum of 1000. One working credit offsets $1 of income from employment. Youth Allowance and Austudy Payment No, Youth Allowance and Austudy are payments that assess a person’s entitlement on a fortnightly basis. If a full-time student recipient has a Student Income Bank balance of nil and income over $236, their fortnightly entitlement will be affected. (3) Is he aware that income for the purposes of payments such as Family Tax Benefit is considered on an annualised basis? Yes, Family Tax Benefit (FTB) PartA and PartB provide payment on the basis of annual taxable income. The provision of FTB PartA and PartB on the basis of annual taxable income recognises the different purposes of FTB (help with the costs of children) compared to payments that are intended to provide income support. (4) Will he consider allowing income earned by recipients of the above payments to be annualised to the maximum annual amount; if not, why not. Age Pension Under the Social Security Act 1991 the pension is already an annual amount based on current income. Disability Support Pension, Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance (other) The Australian Government has no plans to subject working age payments to an annualised income test. An annual income test is appropriate only where a person is likely to be in receipt of the relevant payment for the entire year in question, and works best when people’s incomes are relatively stable. A fortnightly income test allows more precise targeting to current need and this is more appropriate for payments that many people receive for only short periods at a time and where fluctuations in income are likely to be common. Youth Allowance and Austudy Payment In terms of full-time students on Youth Allowance or Austudy, the Government considers current personal means testing arrangements to be appropriate and in line with community views and expectations. The availability of the Student Income Bank provides considerable flexibility for students undertaking part-time work and the income-free area is generous. Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (Question No. 2157) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Trade, in writing, on 18 August 2005: (1) What has been the impact on Australia’s two way trade with Singapore since the implementation of the Singapore Australia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) compared to the previous period. (2) What has been the impact on the growth of Australian (a) exports to and (b) imports from Singapore following the introduction of the FTA compared to the previous period. (3) What has been the impact on Australia’s trade balance with Singapore following the introduction of the FTA compared to the previous period. (1) It is too early to assess the medium term impact of the Singapore – Australia Free Trade Agreement. We expect most benefits to accrue in the area of services and investment given that, prior to implementation of SAFTA, Singapore duties on goods (with the exception of beer and stout) were zero. (2) As above. (3) As above. Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (Question No. 2158) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Trade, in writing, on 18 August 2005: (1) What has been the impact on Australia’s two way trade with the USA since the implementation of the Australia-USA Free Trade Agreement (FTA) compared to the previous period. (2) What has been the impact on the growth of Australian (a) exports to and (b) imports from the USA following the introduction of the FTA compared to the previous period. (3) What has been the impact on Australia’s trade balance with the USA following the introduction of the FTA compared to the previous period. (1) It is too early to assess the impact of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA). The success of the FTA will be judged beyond trade in goods services trade, government procurement and investment are also important elements of the Agreement. Many of the opportunities created by the AUSFTA will have significant lead times. The Government is working to assist business to take advantage of the AUSFTA including through the appointment of 30 new export facilitators (23 of whom are located in the United States). (2) As above. (3) As above.
