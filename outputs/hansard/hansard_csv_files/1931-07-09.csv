The reply given by the Treasurer and myself was that gold was obtaining the same price on the world's market as hitherto, and, in addition, the producers of gold were benefiting by a very high rate of exchange, which gave them a premium of approximately 24s. an ounce.

Would such reductions have been sufficient to balance the budget for estimated commitments in 1931-32 and 1932-33? the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No. Reductions in salaries on the basis proposed were estimated to produce approximately £800,000, whilst the reductions simultaneously proposed in cost of living allowances and extraneous payments in tlic Public Service were estimated to produce an additional £000,000. If all these reductions had been made, the deficit for 1930-3.1 would still have been between £9,000.000 and £10,000,000. 2. No. Without the adjustments provided for in the rehabilitation plan now before Parliament, very substantial deficits, which could not have been financed by the Commonwealth, would have remained in the accounts for 1931-32 and 1932-33. upon noticeWhat was the amount received in overtime payment and travelling allowance during the financial year ending 30th June, 1931, by (a) the private secretary to the Minister for Trade and Customs; and [b) the private secretary to the Assistant Minister, Senator Daly? to private secretaries.

It also involves the question whether it would be desirable to take over the existing mints at Melbourne or Perth, or establish a new mint at Canberra. In view of existing financial conditions, the present time is not opportune for a consideration of these matters. 4. The latest published figures'show that the Australian mints have not been conducted at a profit, but at a loss-the losses for 1929 aggregating £18,239.

Has the Victorian Government, in its economy proposals, exempted superannuation fund pensions up to £104 a year? 2. Can he approve of a similar exemption to federal superannuation pensions? 3. Was £54,S02 placed to superannuation reserve fund at the last quinquennial investigation in 1928? 4. Would the surplus of such investigation fully provide for such exempted £104 pensions without risk to the fund? 5. As there was an actuarial surplus of £97,862 at the last quinquennial investigation, would the £104 exemption be fully justified? 6. What is the amount of £104 pension pay/-ieuts ? 7. W ill he allow the Public Service associations to arrange the superannuation reductions so as to exempt the £104 pensions, if the total reductions are the same as proposed? The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No. The exemption applies only to the free pensions granted under Victorian Act 100. The State Government has not yet announced its policy regarding reductions in superannuation pensions. 2. It is regretted that this is impracticable. If pensioners receiving £104 per annum or less were exempted, the balance of the pensioners, numbering less than 2,000, would be called upon to bear an additional burden of approximately £35,000 per annum. Moreover, many persons drawing pensions of £104 per annum were eligible to contribute for larger pensions but elected not to do so. 3. Yes. 4. No. 5. No. The difference between the actuarial surplus and the amount placed to reserve has been earmarked to enable additional benefits to be provided. A superannuation pension is made up of two separate and distinct amounts, viz (a) a pension from the superannuation fund representing the contributions paid to tlie fund by the employee; and (6) an equivalent amount, at least, from The basic wage of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The moneys of the superannuation fund, which belong to the contributors, cannot be used to make up for any reduced payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. 6. £201,009, of which the Commonwealth The procedure f o l share is £173,770. 7.

I , therefore, intend to oppose it. Much has been said of the arbitrary conduct of the Government in bringing about these reductions, and of its violation of the Labour principles upon which it was returned at the last general election. This aspect of the matter cannot, I feel, be over-emphasized by those who still retain their Labour principles, and would, if they could, force this Labour Government to honour them. I have here a leaflet which was circulated during the last elections among the Commonwealth public servants, appealing to them to support the Labour party. I propose to quote from this document so that those to whom the appeal was made may in future know how much trust to place in those who made it. On another occasion they will require something more than pamphlets before they will accept the word of those who then deceived them.

That this mass meeting, therefore, record* its uncompromising hostility to this raid on pay and pensions, and urges its members to -support tlie election or re-election of any The candidate who opposes the plan, and confidently expects and invites the support and co-operation of the general community in resisting a policy which, as recent) experience has proved, cannot relieve, but must intensify the calamities of business depression and unemployment. The resolution expresses definitely the views of the Commonwealth Public given to the Service organizations in Victoria. Their reference to the agitation that occurred They undoubtedly supported a few months ago, when the Eederal Arbitration Court cut real wages by 10 financial per cent., is extremely pertinent at this time. I well remember that at that time the Government expressed strong oppoThat is what the Pubsition to the action of the Arbitration Court in"" that case. As a matter of fact, the Government intervened, and asked It is, however, pleasing to obthe court to withhold the application of its determination because of a new have had monetary policy that it proposed to put into effect. The Government then conprotended that the 10 per cent, cut in real abjeetly, wages should not be applied until such time as its monetary policy had been applied, and, as is well known, Recently a meeting of the Attorney-General attempted to prevail upon the Chief Judge to defer the application of the award, in order to give Little Collins-street. It was the Government an opportunity to give",17,Commonwealth Public Service Arbitration System
71,"Bourne Citizens, Among Them Mr Black","effect to its new policy. At that time it was proposed to introduce legislation to that end, by which the Government had definitely declared it would stand or fall. The Public Service organizations, in the resolution I have just read, draw attention to the fact that it had been said by the court, at the time when the 10 per cent, cut was made, that increased employment would follow that reduction. The members of this committee will recollect that the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) then said, "" If the court has determined on this course, as the Government accepts arbitration as a means of deciding these questions, the responsibility now rests on the employers to provide the extra employment which the court declares will follow, if this 10 per cent, cut is applied "".

Yet the Government is now following the very policy that it denounced but a short time ago. statements made by the Public Service organizations in this regard are important. Those statements are emphasized by the circumstances in which the workers find themselves to-day, and it is fitting that now that Ave are considering the clause before the committee the whole of the facts should be recorded. In New South Wales, the Public Service organizations have also taken steps to declare member's time has expired. oppose the fixation of wages by Parliament. While we have an arbitration system, Parliament should not assume the power exercised by the court to determine wages. system is breaking down, all along the line. able member's opinion. June, an application was made to the Industrial Courti n Brisbane for a reduction of the basic wage from £3 17s. to £3 7s. 6d. per week; but, despite the statement by the Postmaster-General( Mr A. Green) last night, that 17s. 6d. will purchase as much now as could be bought with £1 a short time ago, even the judges of the Arbitration Court in Queensland would not agree to the reduction sought. I was surprised to hear the Postmaster-General remark that I had spoken twice previously on the second reading of the bill. When the Labour party was in opposition, he was one of the militants, and was foremost in the singing of "" Solidarity for Ever"", and I think that he is the member concerning whom the Senate carried a resolution of condemnation for the singing of in Canberra. The Minister need not Thousands more abuse members in this chamber merely because they do not see eye to eye with him. If I had spoken four times yesterday on the second reading of the bill, it would have been the duty of the Speaker, and not the Minister, to draw attention to it. All members have the same rights in this chamber. If the power to fix wages is taken from the courts, as proposed under the bill, it will not be long before men like the PostTherefore, the master-General will object to those opposed to him expressing their opinions either in the House or out of it. I was remarking that, when application was made to the Industrial Court in Brisbane for a reduction of the basic wage from £3 17s. to £3 7s. 6d. a week, a reduction of 5s. a week was agreed to. by the board there. cation to which I refer was made on the 4th June. For the information of the honourable member, I may say that certain awards have gone by the board. The pastoral workers' award has been wiped out, and men in Queensland, on account of the prevalence of unemployment are being asked to work as station hands for the arbitration practically nothing. That is what .the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Morgan) desires, and every member of the working class should realize that. On the 4th If the workers are not careful, there will be a return to the open economic ring that was talked about a great deal prior to the.",18,Commonwealth Public Service Arbitration System

Least of all should this Government introduce a proposal which would have that effect! Prior to the 1929 election, we cent, of the awards of the Arbitration bitterly condemned the Bruce-Page Government and its supporters for attempting to destroy industrial arbitration. Mr people of this country hundreds of thousBruce said in 1929, that he intended to abolish all arbitration awards; but the people gave their answer to that statement ,on the l l t h October of that year. This Government was put in office for the purpose of defending our arbitration system. Yesterday I said that the whole of the postal workers' unions had agreed to the application of the cost of living reductions three months earlier than was necessary. I find that two of these unions, one of which was Third Division Telegraph and Postal Workers Union, were opposed to that course. I do not know the name of the other union that opposed it. employment in Queensland and New South Wales arc 13 per cent, and 26 per cent, respectively. tion of the pastoral workers award in Queensland the number of men employed . in the industry has fallen below what it was when the wage was £3. The cancellation of awards does not lead to an increase in employment. ' The honourable gan) should know that. The Brisbane City Council is now applying for the cancellation of certain awards governing its employees, yet the citizens of Brisbane are paying higher rates on a higher valution than ever before. If these awards are cancelled, no additional employment will be made available. there is less unemployment in Queensland than in any other State. any case, the Commonwealth Government should be the last to interfere with the living standards of the people. Organized labour has fought for 30 years to build up a good standard of living, and particularly to set up wage-fixing tribunals. Some members of the Labour movement do not believe that this is the best method for the fixation of wages; but I think otherwise. Not so very long ago Mr Justice Powers said that 90 per Court were honorably obeyed. Our arbitration system has saved the working ands of pounds, which they would otherwise have spent in strikes. I do not believe that the destruction of our arbitration system would be beneficial to the workers. From my reading of the history of the earlier years of the Labour movement, I have formed the opinion that long drawn-out strikes, which result in the cessation of industrial operations and the unemployment of thousands of men, have not been beneficial to the workers. On the other hand, the adoption of industrial arbitration has been an absolute boon of the workers. If this Parliament, by passing this bill, interferes with our arbitration system, private employers will consider that they also have the right to do so. I hope that no employees of the Commonwealth Government will be asked to work for a wage below the basic rate operating in the State iu which they live. Why should neople doing similar work in the same State be paid different wages? If this proposal is agreed to, there will be a difference of l is . per week between the basic wage applicable to Commonwealth and that applicable to the State servants in Queensland. Even at this late hour, I appeal to the Government to drop this bill. I feel inclined to move that the sitting of the committee be suspended to give honourable members an opportunity to hear the fine gramophone record made by the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) prior to the last election.

The views of the Treasurer at that time will, however, be poor consolation to the public servants now. The public servants contributed their money to make possible the manufacture of that record. In the speech which he delivered on that occasion the Treasurer attacked the Bruce-Page Government and the Nationalist and Country parties in fine style for daring to attempt to destroy industrial arbitration. He also quoted the following limerick:There was a young lady of Riga, Who went for a ride on a tiger; They returned from the' ride, With the lady inside, And a smile on the face of the tiger. Our public servants are, to-day, well inside the banking tiger. The Treasurer, in 1929, vigorously defended industrial arbitration; biui he is now doing his utmost to destroy it. Such a disregard of ethical principles on his part, and on the part of his colleagues, is deplorable. This party was returned to power to maintain industrial arbitration. I remind honourable members of the contents of the scrap of paper which the honourable member for ""West. Sydney( Mr conditions of labour, we should have the Beasley) read a few minutes ago. If such things can go on, the very name of democracy, and the institution of parliamentary government, will, alike, stink in the nostrils of the people. We have heard a good deal lately about faith and confidence. How can the people maintain faith in democracy when they cannot be sure of the integrity ""and honesty of purpose of the so-called democratic representatives whom they elect? This party was returned to power upon its solemn promise that it would safeguard the interests of the people; but it is now proceeding ruthlessly to destroy the very institutions which it is under an obligation to protect. Honourable members in this corner did not challenge the right of Parliament to reduce the salaries of Ministers and members, and of the officers directly under its control, although we did not necessarily agree with the course that was taken. But we deny the . right of Parliament to destroy the standards of living of the people which . have That record been built up by arbitration. It is a retrograde step in our national life for Parliament to interfere with arbitration awards. liament have the right to reduce wages? that right. It has long been held by every political party that Parliament is not the proper institution to increase or decrease wages other than the wages of those officers directly under its control. The honourable member has now joined with his political enemies in order to reduce wages. He interjects a lot from the back bench, but he has not the moral fibre to stand up and declare his attitude in this, chamber. He does nothing to assist in the proper conduct of this committee. honourable member himself? member reminds me of Satan reproving sin. It is a recognized principle that the fixing of wages and conditions of labour must be regulated, not by Parliament, but by the Arbitration Court established for that purpose. If the Parliaments of this country undertook to fix wages and spectacle of one Parliament increasing wages and another Parliament decreasing wages. The position would be impossible. Yet this Government is now legislating to permit Parliament to interfere with wages and conditions fixed by the Arbitration Court.

The Attorney-General( Mr Brennan) in""formed me yesterday that he intended to 'bring down an amending arbitration bill. That is utter nonsense.

How can tliis Government pretend to be safeguarding the, interests of the workers when it is using this Parliament asan instrument with which to destroy their conditions? been reduced outside. the extent to which the wages of the public servants are now to be reduced. This Government has no right to call itself a Labour Government, and those honourable members on this side who are supporting it on this issue will shortly lose the right to call themselves Labour members. Why should this Government do something which its opponents would be afraid to do if they were occupying the treasury bench? The next election will undoubtedly be fought on this issue, and the sooner it comes about the better. It is regrettable in the extreme that honourable members who were elected to this chamber as the representatives of the workers are not now prepared to safeguard their interests. When the division is taken on this clause, and on every other vital clause of the bill, every honourable member who calls himself a Labour member should, if he has any self respect left, vote against these proposals. I hope that provision will be made iu this bill to ensure that Commonwealth public servants in New South Wales will not be victimized to a greater extent than their colleagues in other parts of Australia. The Parliament of that State has been unmercifully slashing wages without authority from the people, and without reference to the Arbitration Court. If Mr Lang and his colleagues dip further into the pockets of the public servants a serious injustice will be done. against that in clause 17. N that assurance. Although the Government of New South Wales was elected to carry out Labour principles, it has abandoned that important plank of the Labour platform which provides for the fixation of wages and salaries by arbitration. I cannot understand how any man elected to represent the workers oan endorse such a policy. I was elected to this Parliament to maintain the wages and conditions of tbe workers, and I have always believed that arbitration is the only just system of regulating industrial conditions. For 30 years the Labour party has advocated the principle of arbitration, and has opposed the fixation of wages and salaries by Parliament. If the legislature assumes the right to regulate the wages of servants of the State, it can, with equal justice, assert that claim in regard to all other employments. Such an attempt would produce chaos. Having had extensive experience in the Arbitration Court, I am convinced that wages and"" salaries cannot be equitably adjusted without full inquiry into the conditions of employment. Such an inquiry is beyond the capacity of Parliament. This bill proposes a general reduction of Comnionwealth salaries and wages by 20 per cent. The Public Service has been thoroughly combed, thousands of temporary men have been dismissed, and we are entitled to assume that those remaining in the Service are necessary, and are rendering services commensurate with the payment received. Why should they not receive the rates awarded by the court? The Government is in a quandary, and I sympathize with its efforts to balance the budget, but I gave a pledge to the electors that I would oppose ""Ihe reduction of wages, and I would be recreant to the trust reposed in me if I voted for this bill.

It is not right that extravagant governments should create deficits, and then reduce public service salaries in order to balance the budget.

We should not allow ourselves to become panic stricken. will do no good. lieved that this plan would improve the conditions of the workers, and would create more employment, I would vote for it. But I believe that it will have the opposite effect. Every £5 taken off wages correspondingly reduces the purchasing power of the community. I regret that the Government has introduced this proposal, and my pledges to the, electors oblige me to vote against it. importance of this bill is indicated by the state of the committee. A few minutes ago not two members of the Opposition were absent, but ou the Government side the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) is left to ""carry the baby."" supporters are absent. It is right that the tion. I have never seen the honourable Treasurer should carry the baby, because there is no doubt of the paternity of this bill; its every feature bears a striking resemblance to the Treasurer. The clause now before the committee is not complete. It commences, ""Notwithstanding anything contained in this act"". It should read, "" Notwithstanding anything we have said or promised at any time, notwithstanding any principle we have advocated or anything we have said we would do for the benefit of the workers, notwithstanding the money voted by Labour supporters to return representatives to Parliament, the crucifixion must take place, because the Government, with the aid of the Opposition, has the necessary numbers."" The division which took place on the second reading of the bill last night was a pitiable spectacle, for of those who were elected to the chamber as Labour members, 22 opposed the Government and seventeen supported itsproposals. This Government came into office not two years ago, condemning the administration of its predecessor, and promising to rectify it. It undertook to preserve the salaries and conditions of the public servants. Instead of honouring that undertaking it is now proposing to rob men who are giving a fair return for the wages awarded them by the Arbitrator. This interference with the principle of arbitration, this removal of one of the corner stones of the temple of Labour, is an act of unprecedented treason on the part of the Labour Government. One Minister correctly stated in the Senate yesterday, "" I am afraid that the Government must admit that it has surrendered."" It has thrown up its hands and cried "" Kamerad "". away. gone over to the enemy and trained its guns on its former comrades. In the army such traitors would be shot on sight, and that I believe will be the fate of those who have deserted Labour principles when the workers have a chance to train their electoral guns on them. One thing that should dissuade honourable members on this side from voting for this bill is the joy of the members of the Opposimember for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) happier than he is to-day. honourable member that this is not a second-reading debate.

110,Mr Yates,"I am dealing with the Government. We have been told that this action is necessitated by the nnancial position. The responsibility for the present position lies with the Government, and the consequences should not be borne by the public servants. The burden they are asked to shoulder would not have been created if the country had been properly administered, and the Labour party had done its job as it said it would and could. I am not able to say whether the present wages and salaries in the Public Service are just, or whether a 20 per cent, reduction would make the wages more commensurate with the work. That is the job of the Public Service Arbitrator. The Government has signally! failed in its duty to do the job it was elected to do. We cannot forget the promise made by the Treasurer, as Labour Campaign Director in New South Wales, that the Labour Parliament if elected to office would preserve the rights and conditions of the public servants. Apparently the plan of which this bill is a part, is the last word of a hopeless government. We are told that if we do not accept this proposal, Australia will drop over a precipice. I deny that. When the Eisher Government promulgated its idea for the benefit of Australia and trespassed on the perquisites of the bankers by initiating the Commonwealth note issue, the Argus declared that Australia was on the edge of a precipice. Allegedly, we are again on the edge of the precipice. I say that we are not. from the ineptitude of a government that gained office by making false promises. The slogan of Mr Bruce when he was Prime Minister was, "" Produce, produce, and lessen the cost of production."" Last year the present Prime Minister urged the people to grow more wheat. They did so. honourable member to connect his remarks with the clause. do so. This clause should not be in the bill. The Government has no right to determine what a .letter-carrier .shall receive, or whether there shall be a reduction in wages. The Prime Minister urged the people to grow more wheat, and they did. He has no right to take it out of the civil servants because he missed the bus. The civil servants have done their job well. I do not suppose that a more efficient service could be found. This clause clearly proves the incapacity of the Government. It is quite unnecessary to reduce wages. I can submit a fool-proof alternative plan, which does not involve wage-slashing in this country of Opulence, with a big "" 0 "". honourable gentleman is better ""off now than he was before he became a member. I remember when he wanted to take men out to sea and dump them, and when he talked about the wines of this country being coffin varnish. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons) knows that there is an alternative to this plan. If he does not, he was a fraud when he supported Labour. I do not say that offensively. The honourable member was elected as a supporter of arbitration. He knows that the wages and conditions at which"" this Government is going to slash are the result of the struggling and toiling of the workers. honourable member's inflation policy he was always demanding from me, "" What is your alternative?"" This is it. man never thought of . this plan until the Opposition took him to its bosom. Mine was a practical alternative. Had my We are merely suffering policy been adopted, the honourable gentleman, and those associated with him, would not now be wage-slashing and pension-pinching. This is one of the most disgraceful episodes in the political life of Australia. I am hopeful that the time will come soon when the true supporters of Labour will have an opportunity to rehabilitate the party which has been so grievously betrayed, so that again the interests of the workers of Australia may be preserved. We have leaned on broken reeds and painted laths. But the time will come when the movement will again be led by men of purpose, who will stand by their promises, and do the job they are elected to do. have no illusions as to how the division on this clause will go.

I intend to move amendments in an endeavour to save something from the wreck of the salaries that it is proposed to pay civil servants; to provide that recognition shall be given to the procedure that has always been adopted by the arbitration courts of Australia. I do not propose to dilate upon the generalities that have been indulged in by honourable members. I do not think that they will help me and those with whom I am associated to gain our objective. should be prevented from interfering with wage rates. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) stated that the Debt Conversion Bill would override the provisions of any other act. down, that means that this or any future government may ignore the system of arbitration that the Labour party has so strenuously fought for and advocated for many years, and make another slash at the wages of the workers. The wage slash of 20 per cent, that was agreed upon by the Premiers Conference is outrageous. It will be remembered that the decree of the full Arbitration Court to reduce wages by 10 per cent, was received with horror and amazement by the Labour movement, and also by this Government, which briefed counsel to intervene, in an effort to protect the general public. Like the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr E. Riley), I am not blind to the position of the Government, but when alternatives have been proposed-perhap s they were crude, but they were none the less honest-the y were received in stony silence. I believe that this Parliament could have been saved from the disgusting position in which it is to-day; when, during a time of decreased national spending power it proposes to reduce wages to £3 Is. per week, and to cut pensions. This is the most deadly blow that has ever been dealt to the wage system of Australia. The position of the nation does not warrant it. I venture to say that within two weeks after the passing of this bill every private employer in the Commonwealth, whether his business is showing a handsome profit or not, will approach the Arbitration Court and urge that, for national reasons, the wages of employees be reduced a further 10 per cent., to coincide with a reduction effected by the Commonwealth Government. Even at this late hour the Government should endeavour to meet those who are opposed to the plan, by agreeing to a smaller reduction. Ten per cent, is bad enough in all conscience, but it would at least be in conformity with the reduction made by the Arbitration Court. It is outrageous that a wage of only £3 Is. should be paid to an adult male worker. Clause 8, upon which I intended to speak, is almost as bad as this one. I have as I do believe that Parliament great an experience of awards as has any other honourable member. I came into this House at £1,000 a year, but after this measure is passed my net salary will be £335 per annum, or £6 9s. a week.

Of the 253 disputes during 1929, 129, or 51 per cent., were settled by this method. The proportion of dislocations settled by compulsory conferences, or tlie intervention and assistance of officials under State or Commonwealth Arbitration Acts, has varied considerably during the period under review, ranging from 2 per cent, in 1923 to 15 per cent, in 1920. That completely disposes of the laudation by the honourable member for Werriwa of the Arbitration Court, and of the idea that it cannot be done without. I submit, as I have done on half a dozen other occasions, that the whole system of compulsory"" arbitration in Australia is tottering to its fall, and will soon be in a state of complete collapse. The former leader of this House, Mr Bruce, told the people that definitely at the last election. They refused to believe him; but everything that has happened since is conspiring to bring the truth of that assertion home to the people, and I do not hesitate to declare that, in the near future, compulsory arbitration, as we now know it, will have ceased to be in the Commonwealth. Sooner or later a responsible leader, will arise and abolish the system.

128,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [4.19],"is almost inconceivable that a Government, whose members have subscribed to the platform of the Labour party, and whose supporters were elected by reason of the declarations made in support of this basic public policy, should to-day be departing widely from it. The last election was fought by the Labonr party for the maintenance of compulsory arbitration. It was the proposal of the opposite policy that brought about the downfall of the Bruce-Page Government. economic dangers have occurred since the last election. I feel that nothing has occurred since then sufficient to justify the Government in departing from the basic and fundamental principles which it was returned to maintain. If a Government cannot carry out the policy which it declared when the party which supported it was elected, there is only one honourable course for it to pursue, and that is, to go back to the electors and secure a mandate for any change that it considers necessary. Ordinary standards of ethics demand that men who accept position and pay in return for the promises that they have made to the public, should certainly carry out their pledges to the full, or vacate the offices thus obtained. ber speaking to the amendment or -to the clause? the Chairman will put me right. I ask the Treasurer neither for his advice nor his assistance. than the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) in having the rules of debate observed when he is in the chair. An amendment has been moved by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) which relates to ,the differentiation between adult male officers and adult female officers, in respect of deductions from or increases to salaries. I desire to know, therefore, if the honourable member for Hindmarsh is now iu order in discussing the measure generally. involves a departure from vital principles upon which the Labour party was elected to power. It threatens the principle of arbitration and also other principles that to Labour are regarded as dear. Consequently, I submit that this discussion cannot be circumvented by confining the debate to the specific question that the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) has mentioned. clause generally. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member for Hindmarsh will be quite in order in speaking to the and clause or to the amendment. infringe in the slightest degree the recognized rules of debate, nor to offend against parliamentary decorum. The clause constitutes a departure from one of the most cherished ideals and principles of the party to whose policy the Government has subscribed. Only recently, when the position of Public Service Arbitrator had been vacant for many months, a new appointment was made by the very Ministers who now propose to make this wide departure from the hitherto recognized principles of the Labour party. ment was a mistake or not, it was made, and is surely evidence of the fact that the Government quite recently considered it desirable to maintain the standards and practices observed -in the adjustment of wages and conditions in the Commonwealth Public Service. This proposal, If I am uot in order coming so soon after that appointment, is a startling circumstance, indicating plainly the abandonment of a principle recently insisted on. by the Government in regard to the conditions in the Service. I feel that this is only theprelude to something which will be far more serious in its effects upon the adjustment of wages and conditions in private employment throughout Australia. I have at least some justification for saying that, because the Leader of the Opposi-' tion in another place recently uttered these wordsUnless financial reconstruction is followed by proposals for economic reconstruction, Australia will not be on a sound basis. That is going to be just as distasteful, and just as the Government failed to take the necessary steps to bring about reconstruction, I fear that it will not have the courage to take those that are necessary to ensure economic reconstruction.",27,Commonwealth Public Service Arbitration System

138,Mr Makin,"Whethe r the appointOnly one interpretation can be placed upon that statement, and it is that the speaker had in mind the abolition of the principle of ""arbitration so far as it applies to industrial conditions outside the Public Service. This Parliament will establish a dangerous precedent if it adopts this clause, because to do so will involve a departure from what has been the fixed policy of this country in regard to arbitration, for the last twenty-seven years, and so far as the Public Service is concerned, for almost two decades. The Government cannot possibly be excused for taking this line of action, and trespassing on one of the most cherished principles of the Australian Labour movement. Some may ask, "" What other course could be taken for the re-adjustment of the financial position? "" I recognize that governments must live within their income; but I remind this committee that these are by no means normal times. Surpluses were enjoyed in recent years, and it was possible to re-adjust the financial standing of governments from time to time by reason of those surpluses. I feel that when the days of prosperity return, this country could substantially provide for the financial arrears which recur. There are other measures that might be taken to meet the present situation. There could and should be closer co-ordination of State and Federal services. The present duplication of public activities is very costly and unwarranted. If the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers had devoted its time to seeking to eliminate duplication and to effect economies by the co-ordination of services, its action would have been more scientific, and the results would have been more enduring, than the reductions' that were agreed to. The adoption of the policy which the Government has put before us must inevitably lead to the accentuation of the depression from which the country is suffering, for it must bring about a reduction in the spending capacity of the community. The effecting of economies now proposed will not help to provide work for our unemployed, but will rather tend to increase the volume of unemployment. Because the people will have less money to spend, the demand for goods will be reduced. If the Government had taken steps to increase the spending power of the people to what it formerly was, the depression, in my opinion, would have lifted. No matter from what angle I examine the policy of the Government, I can see no justification for it. It is a serious departure from the policy on which we were elected. It will lead to the establishment of a dangerous precedent in respect to the adjustment of the wages and conditions of those engaged in private industries; and it will not solve, but will add to, the problem of how to re-establish industrial and economic stability. In these circumstances I cannot support it. I was returned to this Parliament pledged to support a definite policy, and I feel that that policy should not be departed from, at least until the people have been consulted. I would rather retire from public life, and through the Labour movement consult the electors again than support the Government on this occasion. We cannot expect to maintain honour in public life by the adoption of a policy of this kind, which really amounts to a repudiation of the promises given to the people. The Government would have acted wisely had it referred its original monetary policy to the people. We should have had the satisfaction of knowing that we had not sacrificed our principles, but had fully observed all the requirements of a high public morality. gest that the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) should give honourable members a fuller explanation of the effect of the amendment of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane). The explanation hegave us a few minutes ago was extremely brief. [4.35] -In accordance with the practice which at present prevails, female adult members of the Public Service are affected by cost of living adjustments either upwards or downwards to the extent of £4 a year, and male adult members to the extent of £6 a year.

In spite of that, this Governit because I desire the arbitration system ment is now contradicting and swallowing its previous public statements that Parliament has no right to interfere with wages and working conditions. I do not believe in that principle. I consider that Parliament should review the economic conditions of this country with the object of establishing a proper basic standard of living foi the people. 1 That procedure has not been attempted in this country, and Parliament has not as yet adopted it ; but I believe that Parliament should fix the standard working week and the minimum wage, and review its decisions from time to time in the light of the growing intelligence of the community, That is not now the law of this country, nor is it the desire of the people, and perhaps I should not have introduced the subject. Buti t was the desire of the majority of the people to continue the Arbitration Court, and to have the wages and the conditions of the workers fixed by award, and not by legislative act of this Parliament. For that reason I oppose this measure. I oppose it also because it will give an incentive to the people outside-manua l workers, clerical workers, too-to fall back on their, industrial organizations, and not dependas they have for the last ten years and which they desire to continue doingupon Parliament and the Arbitration Court to review their conditions from time to time. I have urged the people outside to .allow Parliament to perfect the arbitration system and to rely upon it for the rectification of their grievances. If this plan is adopted, my advice to the workers is to make the industrial machinery more and more perfect, so that they may ultimately rely upon their own organizations. They will suffer considerable hardship unless they do that. I believe in constitutional methods, but no reform has been won by the Labour movement in this country, except as a result of developing and educating the great volume of public opinion outside. No Labour government or any other government has ever given the workers of this country any benefits except at the demand of the majority of the people. This legislation will,"" more than anything else, tend to push the workers back on their own resources. I oppose to be properly tested, and constitutional methods adopted in place of direct action. If the Government's plan is put into operation, wages will be reduced, and will continue to be reduced, because, according to the Statistician's figures, the index figure for wages falls three times as rapidly as tliat for the cost of living. The lionorable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), when quoting cost of living figures, selected a peak year to suit his argument. I do not say that unfairly, because I recognize that the honourable member is one of the fairest debaters in this House. Copland's figures, and not thefiguresfor any particular year. member quoted figures for one year. 1 shall quote figures over a complete decade-fro m 1921 to 1931.

If this plan is given effect, a reduction of 10 per cent, will actually become a reduction of 20 per cent., because in a decade the minimum wage has fallen 27.9 per cent, as against the fall in the cost of living of 8.9 per cent. For that reason I oppose the bill. speaking to his new electorate. quite independent of any electorate.

The honourable member for Flinders( Mr turned the Government down. If he is so Holloway) has referred to the arbitration system, upon which, he contends, this legislation will have a seriously detrimental effect. I reiterate the opinion which I have expressed repeatedly in this chamber that the so-called arbitration system is one of the curses of this country: It has brought about most of our unemployment, and the overlapping of Federal and State awards has been largely instrumental in causing the present financial crisis: The Arbitration Court and the tariff are the two curses of Australia. Flinders apologized for the ineffective operation of the arbitration system. There has been too much apology for the Arbitration Court. It should have been abolished long ago. The honourable member has said, with his tongue in his cheek, that he is free and independent; but we all know that he has his eye on the electorate of Melbourne Ports. This Parliament should awake to the fact that the Federal Arbitration Court is an anomaly and an incubus. Until we get rid of it Australia will never progress as it should. Amending arbitration bills galore have been introduced into this chamber. The Prime Minister is now contemplating bringing down another amending bill. There is no need to tinker with arbitration any longer. It should be abolished altogether. What brought me principally to my feet was the speech of the Makin). He expressed his views on this legislation and, to put it mildly, he soundly slated the Government. I support this clause and the Government'3 plan generally.

160,Mr R. Green,"If the aphorism ITlie only way in which Australia can be restored to a level keel is by everybody in the community making some sacrifice. Later, I shall refer to one section that has voluntarily agreed to make a substantial sacrifice. The alleged spokesmen of organized trade unionism have sought to tell us what is necessary to the welfare of Australia, but I know that they are uot stating the view of people whose judgment counts. Australia has lived beyond its income; it has indulged in luxuries such as the Arbitration Court. It must mend its ways and return to the simple life before it can regain prosperity. I support the proposals which the Government has put forward for the implementing of the Melbourne Conference plan, which has been signed even by that peculiar individual, the Premier of New South Wales. am opposed entirely to this clause. WhilstI do not ignore the difficulties which have beset the Government ever since it assumed office, I am justified in protesting against its adoption of methods such as are expressed in this bill. agree with those speakers who have declared that this measure is a violation of election pledges, and an attack upon the principle of arbitration. But I rose particularly to urge that more attention than has yet been given by this committee should be paid to the condition of those persons who will be most acutely affected by the proposals now before us; I refer to the members of the Commonwealth Public Service. The majority of them are the employees of the Postal Department, the administration of which has been criticized by me on more than one occasion. Two-thirds of the total number of employees in our Public Service are in receipt of a wage of less than £6 a week. The basic wage for the Service on the 1st July, 1930, was £216 per annum, plus child endowment, in accordance with the Statistician's cost of living figures for the twelve months ending the 31st March, 3930. This wage was ordinarily due under awards for reduction from the 1st July, 1931, by £18, because of the fall in the cost of living for the twelve months ended the 31st March last. That would have made the basic wage from the 1st July £198, plus child endowment. The Service unions, however, agreed that the reduction should take place from the 16th April, or two months before the due date. Because the Government has ignored these facts, its present proposals become additionally severe. The provisions of this bill strike most heavily against the most defenceless sections of the Service. We are entitled to remember that these officers do the real work of the Commonwealth in all the administrative departments. They have to pass all manner of tests and examinations before and after entry into the Service. They are subject to the closest supervision, and their slightest mistakes are visited with disrating and various other penalties. The majority of them are kept on the bread line virtually all their lives. The liigher paid officials are not affected by these proposals to the same extent. I mention that especially in relation to the plausible claim voiced in this committee that the bill imposes equality of sacrifice. The Bruce-Page Government was responsible for the appointment of an officer who has been receiving £80 a week. I Under this clause he will be expected to live on a paltry £60 a week. When I first sought, in this Parliament, information relating to the colossal increases in his salary, I was met with the anger of members of the Opposition, who then suggested, and have since repeated, that I am animated by motives of personal animosity against that officer. I assure the committee that that is not so. I do not know the gentleman, and I doubt if I would recognize him if I saw him. My objection to him is solely because his appointment, salary and administration give the lie to the statement that the reductions in salaries of Commonwealth employees are proposed in the interests of economy, and because the country has no option. His extravagant administration has produced conditions which make it all the more barbarous that the lower-paid officials, who have done their work faithfully and well, should be expected to pay the penalty. On the 18th December, 1923, Mr Brown was appointed to the Postal Department. In :that year, immediately prior to his appointment, the profit in the postal branch amounted to £1,365,064. In the' first year of Mr Brown's admiuistra-",32,Commonwealth Public Service Arbitration System
161,Mr Eldridge (Martin) [5.6]),"Ition, the profit of the branch shrank to £502,667. Since then it has continued to shrink. In the last year prior to Mr increase by 190 per cent.; to almost treble Brown's appointment the losses of the telegraph branch were £78,460; within twelve months of his assumption of office, they increased to £188,982. Every subsequent year of his administration has been carried on at a loss. The maximum loss for one year was £312,075, in 1928; that for 1929 was £22S,134. A similar story of poor administration is revealed in connection with the telephone section of the postal services. attack upon the administration of the Director of Posts and Telegraphs any connection with clause 9? as an attack upon anybody. It is merely an endeavour to prove that the salaries of some officials will not be reduced sufficiently under this scheme. concrete examples to prove that the selfrighteous pleas of honourable members Opposite about equality of sacrifice are without foundation, in 1922, the year prior to the appointment of Mr Brown, the profits of the telephone department -amounted to £179,455. Within twelve months the profits fell to £50,667. Within two years of his appointment they had disappeared entirely, and were replaced by a loss in that year of £258,619. Thereafter the losses continued to mount rapidly. In each of the three branches of the department administered by Mr educated in different schools of thought. Brown, in which are employed the great majority of the public servants who will be affected by clause 9, there has been an unparalleled story of tremendous losses. And he is an official who has been receiving £80 a week. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr take advantage of the position of the Paterson), when expressing indignation that I should dare to draw attention to the high salary paid to Mr Brown, stated that the £41,000 per annum that he was receiving was nothing, that Mr Brown had saved the country many times that amount each year. I am demonstrating that that claim is extravagantly wrong. The figures that I have quoted show in unmistakable terms that under his administration the profits of the Postal Department have diminished by 61 per cent. The telegraph section was working at a loss, which this official contrived to what it was prior to his term of administration In the telephone department, Mr Brown has performed the mathematical impossibility of taking away more than the whole; for he has caused the entire profits to disappear, and replaced them with a gigantic lo3S. Official records indicate that the decrease in profits represents no less a figure than 237 per cent. The man under whose administration that has occurred will in future receive £60 a week, ""while tlie bread-line wages of a few paltry pounds a week of the majority of his men, who do the real work of the department, are to be savagely attacked by the operation of this clause, in the name .of economy and of equality of sacrifice. orable member's time has expired. clause, which is in accordance with the decree of the Melbourne conference, pror vides that Commonwealth public servants shall be subjected to a 20 per cent, reduction in salaries and wages, in order tharAustralia may be financially rehabilitated.

I have a very vivid recollection of the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) endeavouring to impress upon the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) the necessity for such a reduction. The right honourable gentleman then said that he would never be a party to reducing the salaries and wages of Commonwealth public servants; that that would be equivalent to a special class tax. I agreed with him. Unfortunately the Prime Minister has changed his policy enunciated by the Opposition. It was claimed at that time that, if a reduction were made in salaries and wages, there would also be a reduction in interest. Nothing was said about a conversion loan. It is absolutely wrong to call upon the Commonwealth public servants to suffer an aggregate salary reduction of £1,750,000. They bear their proportion of taxation just as does any other section of the community. If the Government found that it was imperative to raise additional revenue, it could have done that by imposing extra taxation, which would have made the burden an equitable one. Some honourable members have claimed that this is merely an emergency measure. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) intimated that he will move an amendment providing that it shall apply for only three years. It is not an emergency measure. Once it is brought into operation, stepswill be taken by honourable members opposite and their friends to ensure that it stands for all time. Many public servants will make greater sacrifices under this scheme than honourable members realize. They have entered into contracts, and I fail to see how they will be able to carry them out. Those who are about to retire will lose an appreciable portion of the superannuation for which they have contributed for years. Honourable members opposite talk glibly about the good time that these public servants have had, and contrast the position of the unemployed. .Certainly I should like to see our unemployed enjoying a good time, but I fail to see that a reduction in pensions and in the wages of public servams will improve the condition of our 4-00,000 unemployed workers. It will merely accentuate the existing depression. The purchasing power of the people will be reduced by £7,000,000. The right honourable member for North Sydney admitted that these reductions will not place one more person in employment. The bill is a try-out. We have already had a similar try-outa reduction of wages by the Arbitration Court equal to 10 per cent. We were told by Professor Copland, and other economists who also view, and has accepted the attended the Melbourne conference, that, if the workers of Australia were prepared to accept a 10 per cent, reduction in wages, that would result in the re-employment of a large number of workless. The experiment was tried; the standard of our workers was reduced. Instead of putting more men into work, it threw thousands out of employment. The purchasing power of the people was decreased, and business houses that anticipated an extension of their activities had to dismiss many employees. The people had not the wherewithal to purchase their commodities. It has been stated that those who oppose the plan have not the courage of their convictions. Every man' who expresses his opinions, whether they be for or against the bill, has the courage of his convictions. I have always been prepared to express my opinions, and have always had the courage of my convictions. I have not attempted to shelter myself behind any organization, whether that of the public servants, or of the trade union movement generally. I have lived and worked in a hard and bitter school, and I know something of the struggles of the class which I am here to represent. Some honourable members take exception to the attitude of those who oppose the Government's proposals, and attribute our opposition to selfish motives-to a desire to imorove our position. I do not believe that any honourable member who opposes the reduction of pensions and wages or the setting aside of Arbitration Court awards does so from selfish motives. We all believe that we are doing the right thing. I am opposed to my colleagues on these measures, and it is possible that I am not doing what is right, but I think 1 am. I came into this Parliament to support Labour principles, and on those principles I take my stand. If I am defeated, I shall at least have the pleasure of knowing that I have not sacrificed any of the principles for which I have always fought. -The honourable member who has just his speech, or the arguments which he put resumed his seat was good enough to forward in favour of his proposed amendrefer to me, and to my attitude on this ment that the plan should operate for measure. He raised the issue to which three years only. In answer to the query I referred last night, namely, the durawhich he has directed to me, however, 1 tion of the Government's plan.

Mr Hughes,"The Government hasbelieve that any honourable member in this House, who desires to see his country advance and civilization progress, would agree to a permanent reduction in our standard of living. Some honourable members who have spoken rather give the impression that, in their opinion, they alone stand for improvements in our standards of living, and that Labour representatives who disagree .with them have abandoned their principles, have become recreant to their trust, and have thrown overboard their pledges; that they have in short, dishonoured themwhich he had accepted. In February last selves as representatives of the people of Australia. That kind of argument is too paltry, to take seriously. the Treasurer's own speeches in support of our contentions. bers have frequently quoted from my speeches, and I do not object to that. Some honourable members who have spoken on this clause appear to be unaware of the tremendous changes which have taken place since 1929. They have referred to conditions existing in 1929, when the general elections took place, and complain that the policies outlined then are not in harmony with the measures which the Government has now introduced. That is perfectly true; but any one who expects that the policies of to-day must conform, in every respect, with those advocated in 1929 in this or any other country, is simply ignoring what has happened since 1929. The honourable member for West Sydney critical in his references to this clause. He blamed the Government for departing from its policy of February last. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) did the same. He said that the Government had endorsed a policy, and then changed it ; that it had framed another policy, and changed that, and that it had then agreed on still another policy, and changed that also. I remind the honourable member, however, that at least five of these policies were adopted while the honourable gentleman himself was a member of the Government. What has he to say about that? He was prepared to draw his salary, to remain in the Ministry, and to keep silent. He can wax very eloquent when he has a gallery to listen to him; he becomes impassioned when tickling the ears of the groundlings. He gets into the limelight when he has a public to appeal to; but he did not raise his voice in opposition to this policy when it was before the Parliamentary Labour Party for adoption. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) again trounced the Government for having gone back on its pledges; for departing from » the policy which it adopted in February. Why, he himself ran away from the policy the Government adopted a monetary policy which, if we could have effectuated it, would have created credits for stimulating industry. He stated yesterday that he supported that policy, but the fact is that, no sooner had the Government formulated it, than he deserted the party, and set out to criticize the Government, in an attempt to ruin it. surer more when this is over. member must take his share of the responsibility. He stayed in this Government as long as he could, but made his position impossible, because, while a Minister, he advocated a policy diametrically opposed to that of the Government of which he was a member. He even sought re-election to the Ministry, while denouncing the Government to which he wished to return. If there has been any somersaulting, or modifiacation of pledges, or throwing overboard of principles, let him, therefore, examine ( Mr Beasley) was very his own recent record. I do not wish to refer or reply to all the nonsense that has been talked lately from the corner occupied by members of the Lang group, or to answer all the futile charges made by them. They are playing to the gallery continuously. They boast of their courage in espousing the cause of the workers; but their first regard is for their own political salvation, and they talk as they do because they are the representatives of certain industrial districts. glad that the Government will not accept the amendment suggested by the* right honourable member for North Sydney.

Every honourable member on the Opposition side has looked upon it in that light. I was one of the first to suggest the general reduction of expenditure, ibeoause I knew that it was inevitable. Were it possible to avoid these cuts, I would certainly have done all in my power to prevent them. Not one member on this side of the chamber supports with pleasure the reduction of wages and pensions, and, so far as we are concerned, the reduction will not operate longer than is necessary for the restoration of financial stability. At the earliest possible moment, members on this side will stand behind'any proposal for the restoration of the wages and, conditions that have been enjoyed by public servants up to the present time. Possibly in three years the circumstances of the Commonwealth will have so improved that the old conditions can .be restored. have been forced back. my part to force them back. My course of action is dictated by stern necessity. I give the honourable member for Denison( Mr Culley) credit for honesty of purpose, and I feel sure that he will accept my assurance that in my judgment these reductions are unavoidable. Nothing would be achieved by agreeing to the amendment. Under this clause the Government is introducing a principle that I have always opposed. It is endeavouring to have the wages of public servants determined by an act of this Parliament, and I claim that Parliament is not qualified to give a decision of such a nature. It has not the necessary organization available to enable it to collate all the facts needed to enable a decision to be reached regarding the wages and working conditions that should obtain in the Public Service. Within the last two months, a request, has been made in Queensland by the Employers' Federation for a reduction of the basic wage by 9s. 6d. a week, and the court decided to grant a reduction of 3s. a week, making the wage about £19.2 a year. The Federal Government desires to reduce the basic wage of the public servants to £182 a year, or £10 a year less than the Queensland rate. If the Parliament were to accept that proposal, the employers in Queensland would be induced to ask the court to reduce the basic wage in that State to a likeamount. The! honourable member for Flinders( Mr Holloway) expressed the opinion that Parliament should deter% mine the number of hours for which the members of the Public Service should be employed weekly, and the minimum wage that should be paid to them; but such a scheme would be unworkable, as the conditions would probably be varied with each change of government. It seems clear to me that the Arbitration Court is the proper authority to deal with this matter. The policy of this country regards arbitration as the best means of settling industrial disputes. The honourable member for Darling Downs referred to the large number of grievances that had been settled without the intervention of the court. That is so; but, if the court .had not been in existence, the conference at which disputes have been settled by conciliation would not have been held. In Queensland ihe employers refused, at one timeto confer with their employees, although they now recognize that good' results can be obtained by a conference of tbe narties directly interested as employers or employees. Under the present system, if the parties do not voluntarily confer, the court may order them to do so. In many cases the court has brought the parties together, and much good work has been accomplished. The bush striker of the 'nineties, and the maritime strike of 18S9, were the outcome of the cruel conditions imposed on the men by their employers. In .1891, I , with the rest of the bush workers, was urged to return men to Parliament who would place legislation on the statute-book to provide for the settlement of industrial grievances.",37,Commonwealth Public Service Arbitration System

182,Mr Martens (Herbert) [5.50],"I still consider that arbitration and conciliation are the best means of dealing with industrial disputes, and the settlements reached by conciliation are usually more permanent than any others. In the near future, when applications are made to the court by employers' organizations for a reduction of the basic wage to the amount proposed by the Government, under this bill, the present attitude of the Prime Minister ancl his colleagues, ancl the other members who support this proposal, will be referred to as an argument in favour of the reduction. I regret that this measure has caused so much conflict between members. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Various honourable members have R. Green) referred to Mr Speaker in terms which lower the whole tone of parliamentary debate. They were unworthy of any member of the National Parliament. I do not agree with the honourable member for Flinders that Parliament should fix a minimum wage for public servants. With a Labour jrovernment in power, the Parliament might declare that the minimum wage should be £4 or £5 a week; and if an anti-Labour Ministry were in office tlie amount might be reduced to £3 or £4 a week. Only the Arbitration Court should be permitted to decide the matter. the good of the country, the sooner this bill is passed the better. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Holloway), and the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) have indulged in rather fatuous remarks, and have based their speeches on false premises. The former voiced the usual platitudes, but proved nothing, and convinced nobody but himself. The honourable member has been given credit for sincerity, but what is the value of the opinion of a Labour organizer who has qualified at the Trades Hali? We are dealinpwith a financial emergency bill. We have reached the edge of a precipice, in a great measure because of the actions of the socialist section. I am somewhat amused over the socialist party opposite calling itself a Labour party. and leads them to believe that, if only they elect a Labourgovernment to office, Australia will be a Utopia for them. The present Government came into this House with an enormous majority, and since that time Australia has experienced unemployment to an unparalleled degree. Yet the honourable member for Flinders opposes any reduction in the wages and salaries of public servants no matter no'w, serious the situation. He has taken exception to an interjection to the effect (Jhat his speech will assist in his election for Melbourne Ports. He may deny that as he will, but there was a wonderful synchronization between the resignation of the honourable member from the Ministry and his selection as Labour candidate for Melbourne Ports. advanced reasons why the salaries of civil servants should not be reduced. The trouble is that our Civil Service has been over-organized. The greatest enemies of peace in industry are the federal executives of the various unions. These men have, for many years, battened upon the workers, who have been required to pay tribute for the right to work. In these days-and I am speaking of the Civil Service of Australia, not of Russiaa person is obliged to join the particular branch of the Civil Service organization which covers his calling before he can obtain the advantages of the arbitration awards which relate to it. That provision was introduced by this socialist Government. . Actually, an officer of a certain Commonwealth department was informed that he was not eligible to join the union, and so he was prevented from obtaining the benefits of an award which applied to his fellow-officer who worked beside him-. Happenings like these have brought us to our present pass. The Labour party has won a certain spurious loyalty from the workers by making promises which cannot be f u l -filled. Trade unionism has ceased to be an ideal for the uplift of the oppressed, and has become a domination of the man by the official. A false idealism has been preached to the workers, who have become dominated by union officials. I admit that mauy men have joined the Labour party under the inspiration of worthy humanitarian It hoodwinks the workers, ideals; but the party has not been, able to give effect to those ideals. On the other hand, certain individuals, like honourable members who sit in the corner",38,Commonwealth Public Service Arbitration System

It must be remembered that wages are only part of the economic fabric of the nation. Wages must necessarily vary according to the capacity of the country to pay. It has been said by some honourable members opposite, and particularly by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr proportion to our revenue and our popuKeane), that the Civil Service is being forced to accept a wage reduction of per cent., whereas the Arbitration Court has reduced wages by only 10 per cent. The honourable member was a union secretary for many years, and he must know that that statement is not accurate. It is true that the Arbitration Court recently made a reduction of 10 per cent, in wages; but quarterly adjustments had previously been made in accordance with the cost of living figures, the total result tain other honourable members have been of which has been a 23 per cent, reduction, or more than the reduction that civil servants are being called upon to make. In addition wage reductions have been operating in the outside industrial world for many months.

This measure is termed a ""financial emergency bill."" I should like to see the Government effect economies in certain extraneous payments.

184,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [6.6],"Ithe fact that under the provision of the clause, as amended, they -will suffer a reduction of only £22 10s., as against £34 for male employees, will no doubt be a help to them. The short title of this clause is "" General reduction of salaries and wages."" A couple of weeks ago I advocated that there should be no reduction of the basic wage. In my opinion Parliament should have the power to determine the minimum wage and the standard number of hours which should apply to workers throughout the Commonwealth. Such a power is conferred upon the South African Parliament by the Constitution of that dominion. Australian Constitution is deficient in that respect. One great disadvantage of our system of arbitration is that too many lawyers and too many legal maxims are associated with it. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) and I each possess a medal which was presented to us hy the Federated Tramways Union of Australia for services rendered. That union was obliged to spend £18,000 in order to secure its first award from the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. In my opinion our system of arbitration should be greatly simplified. Napoleon inaugurated a system of industrial arbitration which was incorporated in the Qode Napoleon, and applied to every territory that, during that period, came under the control of all-conquering France. Mr Bruce, promised me that, while he was abroad on one occasion, he would try to obtain an up-to-date book on this subject for me. Unfortunately, he was too busy to do so. I have now asked the present Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), if he will try to secure a modern volume on this subject, and place it on our library shelves. The most up-to-date book that we have available at present is A Sovereign People, written by Henry Demarest Lloyd, and edited by Jolm A... Hobson, the chapter on the Conseils des Prud 'homines being the best I have ever read. this subject in a speech that I delivered on the Maritime Industries Bill on the 6th September, 1929, and , which is reported in Hansard, volume 121, at page 723; but an extract which I took from page 155 of the book is worth of repetition. It reads as follows:The employers and employed in each'group of trades elect their representatives, fifteen for each side, to form a conseil. The numbers choose by ballot a committee consisting, of a president, vice-president, secretary, and vice-secretary, the presidency and the other offices being held alternately by an employer and a workman, with tlic further proviso that, when tlie president or the secretary is an employer, the vice-officer must be a workman, and vice versa. The work of tlie conseil is divided as follows. First comes the conciliation board, consisting of an employer and a workman, who preside by turns. This board has summary powers of decision in cases involving sums not exceeding twenty francs. In case of disagreement between the members, or Unfortunately, the where sufficient evidence for a summary judg ment is lacking, the case is referred to the second board, the tribunal. The Tribunal des Prud'hommes consists of a president, three employers, and three workmen, hears evidence and, where necessary, summons experts and gives final decisions in cases not involving more than 500 francs. Cases involving larger sums arc carried to the third court, a chamber of appeal, which consists of a president, five employers, five workers, and a secretary (without a vote). Finally, certain cases where competence of jurisdiction is disputed aro referred for decision to a mixed court composed of two judges of the court of justice (nominated by this court) and three prud'hommes chosen from among themselves by the chamber of appeal. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. Prud'hommes is the only place to which The former Prime Minister, legal men are admitted. There are two judges, but they are outvoted by the three members of the Court of Wise Men.

He* then made a vicious attack upon the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) and myself, and in the course of his remarks he dealt with something that happened in February of this year, when, he said, I had run away from a policy that had been determined by tlie Government. If the charge of running away from policies, not particularly during the last few months, but over a long period, is to be brought against anybody, there is no one who has offended more in that way than the Treasurer himself. member run away from the policy decided upon in February last? greater surrender, and runaway from the policy of last February than did the Treasurer himself. He ran away from a decision to declare a state of national emergency in order to solve the problems that confronted Australia at that time. from himself. tbe position. The Treasurer has charged me with running away from a policy when it was he himself who ran away. That policy is apart altogether from the Gibbons proposals. Every honourable member knows what happened in regard to those proposals, and the complete surrender and run away that was made when he was re-elected to the Cabinet. In defending myself against the charge of the Treasurer, let me say that in February last the Treasurer decided to give effect to a policy of national emerhope that before we vote on gency in order to overcome our economic difficulties. That was his policy when he left Sydney to attend the Premiers Conference, after having failed to obtain the acceptance by the bank board of the Gibbons proposals. It was at that conSouth ""Wales made a declaration as to the course which would be taken by him, which is now known as the Lang plan. Who ran away from the Labour party's policy on that occasion? The Treasurer knows that I came to Canberra with him for the purpose of discussing the details of this policy with the Premier of New South Wales; but when it was put to the Prime Minister he shook at the knees, and was afraid to go on with it . The Treasurer then ran away from that policy. He completely surrendered at that stage and no more was heard of the national emergency proposals. He should be the last honourable member to accuse other honourable members of running away from a policy. My action in remaining in the Ministry has been questioned. It can be claimed by the honourable member for Bourke and myself, that when we were members of the Ministry, we were able to hold out against the violation of Labour policy and principles. The Treasurer was not a member of the Ministry when the ex-Postmaster-General( Mr Lyons) submitted his proposals, which he now says were modified. Perhaps they were, hut in any case they were not so vicious as those which are before us to-day. But the ex-Postmaster-General can inform honourable members that in the discussion that took place on his proposals, the honourable member for Bourke and myself, and the Minister for Home Affairs( Mr Blakeley) fought strenuously against him so as to prevent him from giving effect to his policy. was a violation of Labour principles. I think that the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons) will endorse what I have said regarding our attitude towards him. ' I come now to the attitude of the Ministry. At the time that the honourable member for Bourke and myself were associated with the Ministry, we did not run away from any",42,Commonwealth Public Service Arbitration System

Let me remind the Treasurer that when he was out of the Ministry he had some very good friends within it, who were pleading-his cause, and defending him against others who, although now voting with him, were ready six months ago to sacrifice him and destroy himi politically and socially. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Mackay) I have allowed the honourable member considerable latitude, and I now ask him to confine his remarks to the clause under discussion. insinuated that those honourable members who are opposing the Government's proposals are doing it for political reasons, so as to improve their position in the eyes of their electors. Let me say that the Treasurer himself is a master in the art of political expediency. In the course establishing new precedents, and laying of his political career he has shown himself more capable of moulding political policy to suit his own interests than any other honourable member in this chamber. That is my answer to the charges that have been hurled by him at those who are refusing to support the Government's plan. Those honourable members of the Opposition who are supporting the Government on this occasion are doing so only because they know that the policy put forward by the Government is that formulated by the interests which they represent. interests of my constituency only. While I have a seat in this chamber I shall always defend and advocate the principles of the Labour movement, whether I represent West Sydney or any other electorate. This bill will create a precedent which perhaps may provide opportunities for action to be taken which will be the direct should apply, whether it is sound, and opposite of that now proposed. The Government and the Opposition have now declared that Parliament can decide the wages paid in industry, because they are now supporting a proposal under which Parliament is to reduce wages. It can therefore no longer be regarded as necessary to set up a tribunal for the fixation of wages and conditions of labour. According to the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), wages are now to be fixed in accordance with the financial circumstances of the country. I remind him that when times were prosperous there was no move on the part of the National party to vest in this Parliament the power to fix the wages and conditions of labour. for Fawkner then contended that this should not be clone. able member for that reminder. Now that conditions have changed, and we are faced with what is called financial stringency, this Parliament is reducing wages ancl changing the conditions of the workers. The precedent which is now being established may be used at some not far distant date to bring about the opposite effect. That position will satisfy me at .this juncture. By this bill the Government is down a policy for the future, and I hope the opportunity will present itself before long to apply it in a direction opposite from that in which it is being applied to-day. [8.16] -The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), in the course of his opening remarks, referred to the necessity for examining some of these clauses in greater detail in order to discover whether more severe disabilities I do not consider the were being imposed on public servants than are represented by the mere cuts of salaries. If the honourable member would indicate the particular features which he wishes considered, we could discuss them with him; but, instead of doing that, he and his supporters in the corner seem to take every opportunity to indulge in a general debate as to whether the plan agreed to by the Melbourne Conference whether it represents a change of attitude on the part of the Government. This general discussion makes it more difficult for me, as the Minister in charge of the bill, to consider specific objections to individual clauses. in principle, we cannot right it in detail,",43,Commonwealth Public Service Arbitration System

197,Mr Cuetin,"If a proposal is wrongindulges in second-reading speeches we have to reply. ""hardly fair. I have addressed myself to this clause only once before, and then only after, every member of the corner party had spoken in general terms. The honourable member for West Sydney started to rake over the embers of recent history in order to assail the policy of the Government, and he wrongly accused me of having started the recrimination which has developed during this discussion. After moving the second reading of the bill, I did not speak on it again until this ceed. He slightingly referred to the foreafternoon. The Constant gibes and jeers hurled at me from both sides of the committee do not cause me any particular hurt or offence. I am becoming more or less insensitive to bitter personal and vindictive attacks, and they do not disturb me. But the honourable member for West Sydney referred to the policy which the Government was evolving in February last. Since it came into ofiice the Government has had to consider, not once, but several times, the evolution of monetary policy. For that I make no apology. Those who have watched the course of events can easily understand that the modification of the Government's attitude on these questions was necessitated by the revolutionary changes that, have been taking place in the economic situation. knew all about it from the beginning. of the loud guffaw, which is one of the peculiar characteristics of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates). Some honourable members have a particularly uncouth way of replying to arguments that do not agree with their ideas. In February the Prime Minister( Mr responsible officers of the Government.

When the budget was formulated last year we thought that we could very nearly balance the budget by the measures we were adopting. were not a great success.

Such criticism makes no allowance for the extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances that developed immediately after the preparation of the Estimates. Australia had an experience, not differing in degree or character from the experience of most other countries in the same period, whosefinanceswere thrown out of all reckoning as a consequence of the unexpected and calamitous decline in commodity prices. From June of last year to February of this year commodity prices in Australia, as measured by the general index numbers, had declined by 25 per cent. Customs revenue had fallen off to an extent that nobody could have foreseen. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, ' who was a member of the Bruce-Page Government for several years, should have known from experience that a Treasurer's estimates are not the result of his own computations and calculations of revenue and expenditure in every phase of governmental activity; they are based on the calculations of the treasury, customs, and taxation officials, and various other But the honourable member is pettyminded and mean-spirited enough to take advantage of the unrealized estimates to cast a personal slur on me, and to impugn my capacity. delivered I predicted that the estimates would not be realized. ruary, we were considering this calamitous outcome of the economic disturbance that had been felt with particular severity",44,Commonwealth Public Service Arbitration System

I gave figures to prove that, under Mr Brown's administration, the profits of the postal branch diminished by 61 per cent. The telegraph section of the department was working at a loss, which Mr Brown contrived to increase by 190 per cent.

I indicated that the majority of those employees are in the Postal Department, and I then proceeded to show that the representations made by the Government, and the supporters of this measure, that the bill has been introduced in the interests of economy, and to effect an equality of sacrifice, are not warranted by the facts. I am endeavouring to demonstrate that I am right in that contention. I have shown that a highly-paid official has been responsible for constant and heavy losses in the revenues of the Postal Department. He and his associated highly paid officials endeavour to make good those losses by penalizing and hounding out of existence the entirely blameless lower-paid officials of the department, so bringing about a situation the details of which this committee is entitled to know. [124] An attempt is being made to abolish male positions and to displace male officers with cheap female labour. The matter of equal pay for equal work was debated in this chamber in connection with the Public Service Amendment Bill of 1924, when the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) moved that the following new clause be inserted:109A. Section 30 of the act is amended by adding the following proviso:"" Provided that where female officers perform similar duties to those of male officers, the salaries of such female officers shall be equal to those of such male officers "". The present Attorney-General( Mr Brennan), during that debate, saidAs one who has had some little experience in gauging the value of employment, I contend that in those classes of work which women perform side by side with men, the value of their services to their employers is at least equal to, if not greater than that of the serThose principles have not been observed. The departure from them has operated against the male employee most unfairly and seriously, especially to those in the lower grades of the Service. I am attempting to place facts before the committee which warrant its attention, as they disclose circumstances that prejudice that quality which honourable members opposite particularly profess to worship-efficiency . The effect of this clause will accelerate the devastating influence of the forces to which I have referred. I have here a statement that has been issued by the employees of the Postal Department, and I ask that it be incorporated in Hansard for the information of honourable members, and of the community generally. of honourable members that the statement be incorporated in Hansard. 11 bers opposite are very anxious that the practice of concealing important facts, which has been the policy of the administrative head of the Postal Department, shall be perpetuated, to the disadvantage of the country.

At the same time we were faced with immediate commitments amounting to £10,000,600, making our total floating indebtedness £28,000,000. It policy which he afterwards adopted is evident, therefore, that we are faced with no crisis now which has not existed from the time the Government took office. I have nothing further to say on this matter at the moment. Holding the views that I do, I consider it inevitable that we must take some new road. As the Treasurer told us, this cataistrophe is the outcome of the monetary situation. He remarked that there was no possibility of remedying the position without an alteration of the monetary system. Therefore, willy nilly, sooner or later we shall pect the Nationalist party and the he driven by the sheer force of events to do what we refuse to do to-day, and we shall be driven to do it by reason of the crisis that is developing. bei"" never supported me in the Cabinet on that policy.

We could no more expect that body to"" endorse a Labour policy than a Labour Senate could have been expected to endorse the policy of the Nationalist party. The Treasurer, from the outset, both within the Cabinet and within this party, was the opponent of all progressive measures involving any new policy. As a matter of fact, he was the opponent of the through stress of circumstances. He accepted no policy until he was out of the Cabinet, and then he formulated a new one. These recriminations do no good to anybody; but we have the right to oppose this measure by every means at our command. There was an alternative policy. There was another road; there were other methods and they meant the adoption of new principles. It is useless to link Labour's proposals up with those of the Nationalist party. Labour could not exNationalist Senate to adopt the measures that it thought necessary, but which.comprised the only policy which could in any way relieve the situation. member thought that there was a sound alternative plan it is strange that he did not favour us with his advice in the party meeting's. meeting held, after the Treasurer had, in his able way, stated the position in connection with the economic crisis that was before this country, I ventured to suggest that the policy which had been initiated could not improve the situation, and I made several proposals based upon Labour principles and upon the nationalization of banking, for which the Labour party is supposed to stand. should not be wise after the event.

The object of the amendment is to apply the reductions to certain Commonwealth employees who are not controlled by the Public Service Board. -This is a particularly vicious clause, for it carries the so-called economies right outside of the scope of the Public Service, in the ordinary sense of that term. even in the turmoil in which it finds itself, the Government would have been content to legislate only for the employees directly under its control, through the agency of the Public Service Arbitrator. But it is actually carrying its proposals into a sphere in which they will conflict with State awards as well as other Commonwealth awards. only to Commonwealth employees. employed in such undertakings as the naval dockyard. carrying on a class of work known as shipbuilding and general repair work, but it is well known that they also do other classes of engineering various governments and for private individuals also, if they can get it. Side by side with the employees in these undertakings, there are men engaged in State and private enterprises, doing exactly the same class of work. instance. at Mort's Dock. In both instances these employees are governed by awards of the Commonwealth or State arbitration authorities. No doubt this clause is being made to apply to the naval dockyard employees, because the dockyard is a semi-government institution, although it is alleged to be beyond the control of Parliament. It is deplorable that this Government should attack the wages and conditions of these employees, who will be placed at a distinct disadvantage compared with other employees engaged in the same class of work. This is carrying the fight for economy far beyond the realm of decency. The Government inserted:-""o r should confine. its activities to those persons who work under awards of the Public Service Arbitrator. I should like to hear what some other honourable members who have had more experience in Arbitration Court work than I have think of this clause. Probably, they would be able to inform the committee just how far-reaching it is.

The clause makes provision for the appointment of a committee, consisting of a member of tlie Commonwealth Public Service Board of Commissioners, the Public Service Arbitrator, and a person appointed by the Governor General.

In respect of the ordinary method of determining wages and conditions, and of making application to courts and tribunals, great care is exercised by the employers to make certain that every avenue is open to them to put their case. If they fail to obtain what they consider to be justice in the lower tribunals, they have the right to appeal to some other body I should like to know what line of investigation will be undertaken by this committee, and if the same protection is to be given to workers. I understand that those who will be affected by this clause are government employees governed by State or Eederal awards. Whatever conditions they now enjoy have been obtained by the advocacy of their representatives before the various tribunals which have fixed those conditions. Is this committee to fix arbitrarily the conditions of the employees, and if so, is there to be an appeal to another body or is the Minister to have arbitral authority over the whole matter? After all, the Minister's job will be to slash the wages of the workers. If a Minister is able to do that when this bill is passed, another Minister will be able to do the opposite on some future occasion. I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane). He has advocated the adoption of a principle that has long been recognized by the Labour movement. He has suggested the appointment to the committee of a representative of the employees in the Public Service, or of the unions concerned, so that every avenue may be open to them in preparing and placing their cases before the committee or the Minister.",54,Paibs

The provision in the bill contains the 1 very essence of non-unionism, and indicates the length to which the Government is prepared to go to destroy every industrial and political principle of Labour. Apparently the Minister for Defence( Mr Chifley) has been selected for this job because of his special knowledge of the industrial organizations, and the tactics they sometimes employ. He is to see that there shall be no delay. There is to be a star-chamber adjudication, and the views of the employees are not to be considered. The Minister's statement that, because 50 or 60 organizations are concerned, one man cannot be chosen to represent all, is moonshine.

The Minister knows the fight waged by his own organization for the right to a voice in fixing the wages and conditions of its members. Yet he adopts the old conservative attitude"" We will not have any of those persons. They have no place on our committees. We shall decide these things arbitrarily "". I record my bitter disappointment, disgust, and contempt for the whole sorry business. The Minister for Defence( Mr Chifley), as a former advocate in the Arbitration Court of the engine-drivers of New South Wales, will recognize the justification for giving to the large army of men who are to lose £1,800,000 through the reduction of their salaries. They are to make that sacrifice without . being heard. third member of the committee is to be appointed by the Governor General. Why should not this Parliament take the responsibility? When men's wages and working conditions are being adjusted, they have a right to be heard, and I am sure that the Public Service organizations could, within 24 hours, select a representative to serve on this committee. At one time the Minister represented engine-drivers in the Arbitration Court; the Australian Workers Union had another representative, and the Australian Railways Union yet another. Amongst the Public Service unions also there must be many experienced advocates, and no difficulty would be experienced in selecting one of them to represent all organizations. Surely we are not going to take away the few remaining rights of these workers. To preserve their interests, I move That the word ""person"", sub-clause (1), 'be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof murder. If it is deemed to be right for the words, "" representative of the employees "". I am sure that the Treasurer ( Mr ancl conditions, we can imagine what a Theodore) would agree to that amendment if he were here. I know that the Minister for Defence( Mr Chifley) has «, thorough grasp of arbitration matters. If this were a case which affected the engine-drivers, he would quickly justify the claim that provision should be made for that body to be represented on the committee. I hope that he will recognize that the public servants of the country have just as much right to representation as have the engine-drivers, the Australian Workers Union, or any other section of workers, and that it will not be necessary to divide the committee on my amendment, which should be carried without wasting further time. further this discussion proceeds the more convinced I become that the suspicions entertained by me earlier in the day were justified. The Government made it as clear as possible that this cut was to be restricted to salaries and wages. Upon further examination it is revealed that conditions also are jeopardized. It was appalling enough to learn that there was representation tq be a salary reduction amounting to £1,700,000, but, as the plot unwinds, it becomes, apparent that it is more vicious than anybody imagined.

It is a most impudent suggestion, particularly as it emanates from a Labour Government. The personnel of the committee will consist of a member of the Commonwealth Public Service Board of Commissioners, the Public Service Arbitrator, and some mysterious person who, the Minister admits, will not represent the employees. The least that could be done would be to provide for the combined unions to nominate a representative to participate in the proceedings of this committee. In the circumstances, while the amendment of the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Biordan) has my support, I oppose the clause as a whole. port the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for. Kennedy( Mr Biordan). I conclude that the clause has reference to the naval, military, and air forces, and that this mysterious third member will be a brass hata major-general, or something of the kind. I know a good deal about that type of individual, from my association with the army. The military administration did me the honour of keeping me for about 60 days at its expense, and it provided somebody to look after me. I learned then the conditions of the permanent men who were in charge of me. Their pay and allowances were none too generous, although they were doing their job just the same as any other class of workmen. I do not want to say anything offensive about "" brass hats "", but I tion. He has done good work in the do thiiik that this representative should not be appointed from among the officers.

I was in the militia before the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) was born. the militia when I was nineteen years of age, and now I am 60. There would be no dearth of applicants for this position. It is important that the men should be adequately represented when these cuts are being made. We know that a little bit . will be lopped off here, and another little bit there. Their allowances will be reduced, and the process can be made very irritating to them. The Minister must know that in the army, as in a business, it is impossible to get the best out of men unless they are contented. The whole purpose of this provision is to pinch wherever possible, in order to balance the budget; it is not designed for the benefit of the employees. Every opportunity will be taken by the committee to cut down costs. I do not believe that the Minister has forsaken all his -Labour ideals now that he has joined the coali^ arbitration sphere before to-day, and he must know that it is imperative, if the workers are to receive a fair deal, that they should be represented by some one who knows the conditions under which they work. The request I make is a fair one, and I hope that honourable members opposite, who are the other party to the present political coalition, will let up a bit, and not drive the workers right over the precipice. the Minister has given no indication as to who will be the third person to 'be appointed to this committee.

When it was suggested to the Minister that the third representative might be some one nominated by the employees, his only objection was that the time would be too short to secure a suitable nominee. That objection, I believe, is purely imaginary. I am convinced that the unions could, at very short notice, find a suitable person to represent them on the committee. The proposed amendment is a fair and reasonable one, and I shall support it. Honourable members opposite have suggested that some nebulous person, probably a union representative, should be the third member of this committee. remind them that the affected by this provision are, for the most part, members of the navy, army, and air force. They do not want anything to do with union officials. The others comprise only a few employees in munition works, in the arsenals and in the dockyard. Yet honourable members opposite suggest that there should be appointed a union secretary who has a knowledge of conditions in the army. Surely the services themselves should have a representative'! for Adelaide( Mr Yates) said that the Government should not appoint a "" brass hat"" to the position. means that it should not appoint a senior officer, who would know something of conditions in the forces. The members of the navy, army, and air force have no union. They have been rationed, and their pay cut down; but we have heard no complaints from them. tion. desire to be union-ridden. .They do not want agitators to batten on them. The third member of the committee should be some one nominated by the Ministerwhether of senior or junior rank is immaterial provided he knows the work. The entire personnel of the navy, army, and air force are to suffer this cut, and I should like the Minister for Defence( Mr Chifley) or the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) to give an assurance that their deferred pay up to date will not be affected; that the cut will apply only to deferred pay accumulating from this date onwards. The navy and army have a permanent personnel of approximately 1,500. Besides these men are a few artisans who will come under this provision, but they are already covered by Arbitration Court awards, and have means at their disposal for putting the case before the authorities. There is no doubt that the representative of the forces should be an oflicer properly qualified to speak on behalf of the three services, and possessing a f u l l knowledge of matters I pertaining to their pay and other emoluemployees ments. -When speaking to the first bill dealing With the rehabilitation plan, I attempted to forecast the effect of this legislation. I said then that its effect on wages and pensions would not be fully realized until it had actually been put into operation. During the committee stage of this bill the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) said that he also could see the far-reaching nature of these proposals. Instead of dealing merely with wages, the bill cuts across those things which have been established by trade unionism through its organized strength. The point I wish to emphasize is that, I suppose he although wages are determined on the basis of the Statistician's index figures, the conditions of employment, and the pay for various classes of work, apart from the main trade or calling in question, have been established by the advocacy of trade unionists either in the courts or on the job. This clause provides means whereby those conditions may be attacked :by a method entirely different from that by which they were obtained. I assure the committee that I found the Minister's speech very interesting, because of my knowledge of him, and of his association with the organizations he represents. The Minister's reference to the necessity to do this job quickly was particularly illuminating.

When it was a case of a downward trenda slash in their wages-the slogan of the locomotive engine-drivers was, "" On with the Westinghouse brake, and keep it on hard "", in an endeavour to save their wages by prolonging the proceedings. One thing which must v appeal to the average worker is that whenever, in the course of the development of a country, the necessity arises for certain jobs against their interests to be done, at the psychological moment the forces arrayed against Labour can always get a man who has been trained in the ranks of Labour to do the job, and do it quickly. The Minister knows what has been done in the past by delaying proceedings. Now he will act speedily against the workers when the power is in his hands. "" Line clear "". to visualize the time, not many years ago, when, on nights that were bad, and the weather conditions cold and wintry, he stood on the foot-plate, and peered out through.the trap-door looking for signals. As he ploughed through the black night did he not sometimes think of the conditions that had been won for himself and his comrades-extr a for overtime, shelter from the weather-by the union to which he belonged? How different his attitude to-day! Let me remind him of the great struggle that took place in 1917a struggle in which he, together with his comrades in the locomotive shop, took part. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Hon. R. A. Crouch) -Order! The honourable member is straying beyond the limits of the clause. with conditions of employment. The Minister who is now in charge of the bill has been entrusted with the task of carrying out this work on behalf of the Government. I think that it is very fitting that he should be reminded of his own circumstances not long ago, so that when the occasion arises for this work to be done, he will, be mindful of the conhave only the appearance of being ditions he has experienced, and which his erstwhile comrades are still going through, seeing that they have not been elevated to high positions as he has been. I am merely asking him to consider these things when the time comes for him to act. I do not wish to be personal in thiB matter, but I think that the Minister will appreciate what I am saying. We work in a very comfortable atmosphere in this chamber, but the workers who will be involved in these changes are not so favourably situated. They are still in the position which the Minister occupied only a few years ago. These proposals are to apply to others than actual public servants. When dealing With a previous clause I said that it would apply to dockyard workers, painters, clerical workers and others working under both State and Federal awards. I pointed out that they will apply to the men at Garden Island, many of whom are not public servants. They will apply to men in all the different trades, whose menibers are organized in trade unions. As I have said, the Minister has been a locomotive engine-driver and, consequently, he knows all about that class of work; but what does he know of the details of the work carried out by boiler-makers, engineers, ship painters, or electricians? How will the members of the committee know these things unless the men are represented? Does he know the reasons why extra payment is given for certain classes of work in other trades? I have worked on submarines as an electrician. In that class of work there is extra pay for working in confined spaces. No person can appreciate the necessity for that extra pay unless he has worked as an electrician in such spaces. The Minister may be genuine in submitting these proposalsI say that in fairness to him. If so, I ask that he will see that the men affected will be given a chance to present their views. If , on the other hand, the bill is merely so much camouflage and the Minister will arbitrarily carry out the job assigned to him-and he has admitted that he is to be given a discretionary power in the matter-le t him be honest and. say that these proposals democratic, because, in reality, it is useless to wait, seeing that there is no time to make a real investigation, speed being the essence of",60,Pairs

I remind other Ministers that they, too, have come from the workshop, the shearing shed', or the factory, where they earned their living under conditions which had heen gained by the efforts of the organization to which they belonged. I hope that they have not forgotten the source from which they have sprung. If they remember these things I cannot understand how they can put into this measure a clause which provides for the breaking of one of the most important principles of the Labour movement. On my first glance at the clause I thought that it was intended for the adjustment of position than has been given. There is anomalies that might occur in regard to salaries, but on further investigation I concur in the views expressed by other honourable members. It would be far too dangerous to permiijSa Minister to have the power conferred by this provision. Its operation might -vitally affect the actual conditions under which men are required to work in Commonwealth employment, yet the committee will not have on it a representative of the employees to assist in the determination of their conditions. ""When Labour was in opposition, and industrial legislation was under discussion, we always pressed on the Government of the day amendments providing that the organizations interested should be represented on the various boards and tribunals appointed. That was regarded as a fundamental condition, and it is astounding that the Gotatives to be appointed I would be favorvernment should now bring down a measure of this character which does not embrace a provision such as was regarded as essential when we were in opposition. While. I realize that the Minister for Defence( Mr Chifley), who is now in charge of the bill, may be relied upon to see that fair and just decisions are made, he is only a creature of the moment, and there is no guarantee that whoever may succeed him will be as familiar as he is with the conditions of those with whose cases he will have to deal.

The artisans' wages will be brought into line with the arbitration awards. provision were contained in the clause, the honourable member would be justified in setting it off as an adequate reply to my contention, but the clause gives full power to the Minister to determine these matters, and that is too great a power to place in the hands of any individual, particularly when provision is^not made for the full facts of the case to be presented. We are entitled to a more satisfactory explanation of the no more important feature of the bill than the clause under discussion. I ask the Minister to. recognize the merit of the case presented, and inform the committee to what extent the power given under the clause will be used, and what provision is to be made for those affected to have their case adequately presented before a decision is reached. for Defence) [10.35] -Despit e the unkind personal references to myself by certain honourable members in the corner occupied by the Beasley group, I may say that all the points that have been raised regarding this clause have been considered by me, and I have discussed various aspects of it with those likely to be affected by the operations of the committee. Where it would be possible for union represenable to following that course, but I am not prepared to accept the amendment, because a good many of the matters that would be dealt with by the committee do not affect any organization.

The Public Service organizations will be interested in a number of the matters with which the committee will deal.

Several representatives of the organization have met me, and discussed the matters likely to he deali with by the committee, but I cannot accept the amendment. that a union representative would take up too much time in putting his case. away from anything.

I have already promised to give favorable consideration to requests made to me by the representatives of a number of organizations. So far as possible, I will meet them in regard to seeing that they obtain a proper hearing, and have an opportunity of putting their case before the Minister himself. It has been stated, for political reasons, that I have no sympathy with the workers, but, despite these unkind remarks, sympathetic consideration will be given to the representations of the Public Service organizations, and even to those of the members of the Beasley group.

The Minister has referred to travelling expenses for military and naval officers. There would certainly be no representative of those officers upon this committee even under the proposal of the honourable member for Kennedy, and the representative of the organizations would have no knowledge of the details, but he need not have a voice on that particular matter. amendment that the matters mentioned by the honourable member shall be referred to the committee. is still more necessary that a representative of the employees shall be appointed to the committee. If a man of the right type were selected by the unions for this purpose, it would be to the advantage of all concerned. A man accustomed to submitting the claims of the workers to arbitration tribunals would be excellently suited for such a position. I u view of the fact that the munition workers at Lithgow and at Maribyrnong, and the employees at Garden Island, the Naval Dockyard, and other places will be involved, they should have the opportunity of nominating one member of the committee. to by the honourable member will not be affected. this bill will affect not only those, working Under awards of the Public Service Arbitrator, but also employees of the It was only Commonwealth Government who work under awards given by other Commonwealth and State industrial authorities, so the workers to whom I have referred must be involved.

I am quite ready to believe that practically every member who sits on this side of the committee would, if he were in ministerial office, give sympathetic consideration to the representations which the workers might make to him.

The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr majority of the members of their respecParkhill) might be called upon to discharge them, in which case, God help the workers. The workers would also be in a very sorry plight if they had to rely on the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley), or the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons), for sympathetic consideration. Our bitter experience as industrialists teaches us that we must look on the worse side of things. I have been a member of this Parliament for a number of years, and have usually sat on the Opposition side of the chamber. On numerous occasions, when anti-Labour governments have proposed the appointment of commissions, committees, and boards, we have fought hard for the appointment of a representative of the workers. We should therefore be guilty of hypocrisy if , having fought for such appointments when we were in opposition, and had no chance of getting them, we failed to enact them now that a Labour government is in power. That would be the worse kind of political cowardice. We know very well that the plan underlying this bill was formulated by the bankers and their representatives, who practically forced the various governments to agree to wage reductions. It would not bo surprising, Davidson, or some other banker were appointed to this committee. ber would like to see Mr Jock Garden appointed to it. workers a fair deal, at any rate.

The wording of the clause is "" any salary, allowance or amount payable under any contract or agreement."" Supposing thatsome one in the country enters into a contract or an agreement with the Postmaster-General's Department to carry mails from a country town to some outlying district, and, in order to do so, has to purchase a motor car and provide other necessary equipment. The clause is sweeping and all-embracing, and I should like to know whether it would cover such a set of circumstances. How would that man fare in regard to meeting his payments under the contract? that he bought a car on the hire-purchase system: how would he keep up his payments? The majority of these contracts or agreements that are entered into for the carriage of mails are cut fairly close to the bone. If the clause provides an opportunity for the department to cut across these people, I am sure that the committee will riot stand for it. for Defence) l""11.291 I direct the attention of the honourable member to the fact that the clause refers to any contract or agreement "" in pursuance of this part."" The part in question relates to salaries and wages. I give the assurance that it is not intended to cover the matters which the honourable member fears may be covered. It does not refer to such things as mail contracts. an agreement to which it actually does applv. member studies the clause he will see that it refers to the matters set out in the bill tractor had to be brought back from the itself. This part of the 'bill relates to salaries and wages, and the clause refers to ""any salary, allowance or amount payable under any contract or agreement""; which is reduced in pursuance of this part. That clause is sufficiently wide and embracing to permit of interference with many contracts relating to postal services. Contracts to carry mails involve the payment of. allowances. Semi-official post offices involve wages and salaries paid under contract, and it seems to me this clause will permit of the definite repudiation of contracts and agreements. The Minister has assured us that such contracts will not be affected, but I do not know that his denial will be sufficient. A sum of £1,000,000 is to be saved by administration in respect of adjustable expenditure, and in order to effect that economy, contracts may be interfered with under cover of this clause. Because of the meagre explanation given by the Minister, and the apparent disinclination of the Treasurer to enlighten the committee further, I propose to vote against the clause. The clause is so wide that I am convinced that mail contracts will be subject to a 20 per cent, reduction, regardless of what plant the contractors may have acquired, or what other arrangements they may have made for the conduct of their service. Many of the mail contracts have been cut to the bone, and are not capable of further reduction, specially as sales tax will have to be paid on benzine and horse feed. If mail contractors suffer a reduction of 20 per cent, their margin of profit may be wiped out. Because of the breach of contract, some will immediately discontinue their services; the department will be protected under this clause, and the contractors will have no redress. The clause might also apply to contractors preparing runways at aerodromes for the Defence Department. It is very convenient at times, when a contractor repudiates or abandons his job, for the department to leave his' employees high and dry. I know of three such cases. One the Government rectified, but only after a considerable lapse of time. The conNorthern Territory, and, meanwhile, his employees were stranded at Camooweal, over 200 miles from the railhead. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Hon. R. A.

If this kind of business is tolerated, contractors' of the class described could put in almost any price, get a contract, carry on for a month or so, draw progress payment for the work, and then disappear. hope that the Minister will make this clause a little clearer. The part of the bill with which we are dealing is headed "" Salaries and wages"", and earlier clauses relate to' salaries and wages fixed under statute, under regulations, or under awards and determinations. This clause enacts that the payment of any reduced salary,, allowance, or amount payable under any contract or agreement shall be taken as f u l l settlement _ and discharge of the liability. In itself, the clause is probably unobjectionable, even to those honourable members who are opposed to the general plan, because the scheme having been adopted, obviously some such provision is necessary. When, however, we turn to clause 15, we find this general provisionWhere the amount of any payment, fee, or allowance (to which this part does not otherdoubt which I have indicated. It may wise apply) in 'respect of the performance for the Commonwealth or for any authority under the 'Commonwealth of the services of the Chairman or of any member of any board, committee or other authority, is fixed by. or under any act, the payment, fee, or allowance contracts are independent contracts, and shall be reduced by 20 per centum of the amount which would otherwise bo payable.

With that contention I do not agree. General thinks that there is nothing in the point, he will have an opportunity to give his reasons for that belief. I am not satisfied that there is not something in it. Let us take the case of a mail contractor. So far as I am aware, such a contract is made under the Post and Telegraph. Act, and it appears to me to be possible to affirm that payments made to such contractors are payments for services rendered to the Commonwealth. The Minister has stated that it is not the intention of the Government to have any ambiguity in any provision of the bill, and I submit that there is room for the be contended that sub-clause 2 of clause 15 does not apply only to cases where the act actually fixes the amount.

We do not desire that Commonwealth public servants shall evade bona fide unemployment taxation in any State, but we wish to have uniformity throughout the Commonwealth, and to that end we retain the right to prescribe the maximum taxation which shall be applicable. I regard as a very dangerous innovation the delegation of this reserve power to the Governor General in Council to limit the amount of taxation which may be imposed on a highly privileged class of the community. I admit that, in view of the attempt made in New South Wales to impose taxation of an especially severe character, some such provision is prov bably justified; but it is a mistake, I believe, to alter the date in this clause from 1931 to 1930. twelve months, taxation has been made very much heavier in every State of the Commonwealth, and not in New South Wales only. The Is. in the f l unemployment tax in New South Wales is not excessive, as compared with the taxation in some of the States, particularly in South Australia and Queensland. is in addition to greatly increased income taxation. I admit; but it is not a devastatingly heavy tax compared with the taxation in force in some of the States, whicli* are less well of f , possibly, than New South Wales. I could accept the granting of this special power to the Governor General in Council, if it were not proposed to date the provision back to 1930. It will be undoubtedly very hard on civil servants if they have to suffer a cut in their remuneration, and pay heavy State taxation as well, but that is the lot of people in all walks of life these days. If there is not enough jam to go round, then it must be spread a little thinner. If the jam on the bread of the public servants is left too thick, the other sections of the community will have to make shift with too little. I intend to oppose the proposal to alter the date from 1931 to 1930, but I offer no opposition to the other proposed amendment. Sitting suspended from 12 midnight to 12.S0 a.m. (Friday). [120] Friday, 10 July, 1931. a.m.] I understand that while in its present form the bill exempts Commonwealth public servants from the payment of special taxation imposed by a State, the Treasurer has agreed that regulations shall be framed requiring them to share in any reasonable taxation which a State might impose. no objection to the alteration from 1931 to 1930. This clause raises again the question of the liability of Commonwealth public servants to pay State income tax, and of the State public servants being liable for Federal income tax. Any provision to exempt' Commonwealth public servants During the last from State taxation might have a boomerang effect, for the State Parliaments would probably retaliate. power to do so. some years ago this point was tested in the courts, and that it was decided that Commonwealth public servants were not liable to pay State income tax. is a heavy impost, given this Parliament legislated to make it possible for the States to impose income tax on Commonwealth public servants and members of the Federal Parliament. The States impose their income taxation in the exercise of a permission given by this Parliament. has never been any question of the constitutionality of State public . servants being taxed by the Commonwealth? question raised. State public servants pay federal income tax without question. federal public servants from State taxation, the States might be led to explore the possibility of retaliatory action being taken.

There is a general impression that members of this Parliament receive £1,000 per annum, and that they are not being called upon to share in the sacrifice which is demanded of the people. I want to correct that wrong impression. When I was elected to this House, the allowance I received was £1,000 per annum, but since then there has been a reduction of £100 a year. This bill proposes to reduce the allowance still further, making it £800 per annum. A member of this Parliament who represents a rural constituency, remote from Canberra, has the following deductions made from his original allowance of £1,000:-The reduction made last year, £100; the further reduction now proposed, £100; income tax, Eederal and State, £45; 40 weeks' hotel expenses at Canberra at £3 a week,, say £140. In addition, he has to pay car hire, and hotel expenses in rural electorates, 'amounting to at least £150 per annum; donations £75; moiety of election expenses £50 ber is only just learning these facts, I may inform him that the position gets worse every year. £660 of the £1,000 allowance is definitely earmarked, leaving only £340 per annum, or £6 9s. a week. That is the position in which I find myself; other members may have an even worse story to tell. I give these particulars in order to disabuse the minds of the citizens of Australia of any illusions they may have on this subject. HadI been in the chamber when the clause dealing with the allowances of members was dealt with, I should have opposed any reduction, or at least have urged that members representing rural constituencies should be granted a special allowance. Some members necessarily incur heavier expenses than others are called upon to meet. If a man is to be above suspicion, he must be paid a reasonable amount for his services. BeforeI entered this Parliament, I was receiving two and a half times as much as I now receive. Unlike the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Morgan), who said this afternoon that certain members were sheltering behind the public servants in order to save their own allowances, most of the members on this side of the House have no other means of livelihood than their parliamentary allowance. I understand that the honourable member for Darling Downs has certain business interests which place him in a strong financial position as compared with others. I want to see Parliament open to any man in the community who is able to secure the confidence of the electors. An honourable member's advocacy of the policy of no wage reductions should not be construed as an effort to retain his own allowance. If my £200 will help Australia, the country can have it, but I do not think that that will be the result. The gesture might have some moral effect, but that is all. moral about the bill? bill, because I am opposed to all wage reductions. I want the citizens of Australia to know that the members of this Parliament do not have so rosy a time as is sometimes pictured. Eor the greater portion of the year, they are away from their homes, performing their multifarious duties, all for £6 9s. a week, or about £1 a day. I hope that other honourable members will endeavour to enlighten the electors on this subject. Some allowance should be granted to members representing rural constituencies. the honourable member suggest? tude of the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) towards this bill, as indicated by his votes to-day, I shall not answer his interjection.

When the dore) was Treasurer of Queensland, members of the Commonwealth Parliament were allowed a deduction of £50 for State income tax purposes. Later, durthe deduction was increased to £100. During Mr Theodore's regime, the members of the State Parliament were also allowed a deduction of £50. There, was? no difference between the allowance granted to a State member representing, say, South Brisbanea small electorate which could be covered on foot in about half an hour-and the deduction to which, the representative of a large federal electorate such as Kennedy or Maranoa was entitled. It costs me £50 for the hire of a car for one trip through my electorate. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane), it costs a member of Parliament £150 a year to live in Canberra. When a member, living in any of our capital from Canberra, his expenses cease, but that is not so in the case of members representing rural districts. I think the Federal Treasurer should take the matter up with the State Treasurers, so that provision may be made for the deduction allowed by the Federal Income Tax Department to be also allowed for State taxation purposes. Many are under the impression that members of Parliament are paid travelling expenses. Last week I received an anonymous typewritten letter from Brisbane, in which the writer expressed his pleasure that members of Parliament were to have not only their salaries, but also their expenses cut, and he incidentally accused members of expecting the Commonwealth to pay for the hire of the motor cars in which they travel about. Many have the idea that all that a member of Parliament has to do is to fill in a voucher on his return to Canberra and to have recouped all the expenses he has incurred whilst travelling. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) is the first member of Parliament I have heard attempt to explain the position clearly. For some reason or other members generally are rather diffident about doing so, because they imagine that the people outside will think that they are whining, and because they fear that they will be met with the question, "" If such is the case, ""why do you remain in Parliament""?

Some years ago wben I recorded my vote in support of a measure introduced by tbe Fisher Government providing for the payment of a maternity allowance to assist the womanhood of this country, I little dreamed that the action now proposed would ever be taken by a succeeding Labour Government. At St. Mary's Hospital, at Paddington, near London, every case came under my immediate care and supervision. I have a keen memory, and I vividly recall the gratitude expressed by some poor women who were supplied by the hospital authorities with clothing which was little better than as much rag. I also remember one awful night, when sleet and snow was, falling, so that I would not call upon a student to undertake the task that was before me, I went to some mews in a district in which the wealthy Duke of ""Westminster owned a great deal of property, and there in an apartment which measured 10 feet by 11 feet by 10 feet, I assisted in bringing into the world a child which made the eleventh in the family. The place was so small that the other members of the family had to stand in the doorway to provide sufficient room for me. Trudging home through the sleet and the snow I could allow the people in any city to live under such conditions. On Martens, G.

Under a later clause it is provided that only certain people shall be entitled to it. What did the opponents of the Fisher Government say when this act was passed? They called the maternity allowance the baby bonus, the bangle bonus, and other similar names, and expressed their inten tion of doing what the present Government is doing to-night; but they found that many of their women folk, who occupied high positions in the social world, were claimants for it. That being the law, what man would deny them the right to receive it? This amendment, however, will change all that.

One reason given for the proposal is that it' is necessary to exercise economy'; and another, that the £4 will be equal in purchasing power to what £5 was previously. The amount of £5 was fixed by the Fisher' Government, which introduced the act in 1913, and the allowance remained at that figure throughout the period of rising prices that followed. Prices are higher to-day than they were in 1913; therefore, on that ground-' the argument for the reduction fails. This reduction is nothing more or less than miserly cheese-paring by a government that' is prepared to take the pennies of the poor, the sick, the blind,' the lame, tbe halt, and the dumb, in order that it may conform to a bankers' policy-to rehabilitate this country by the economic degradation of the people. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) that it places on the Labour party a stigma whicli it will take a long time for that party to outlive. I regretas deeply as any man can that thisis the action of a so-called Labour Government. I repeat that that Government can never again honestly call itself a Labour Government. Labour means. It has not within it a vestige .of the idealism of Labour. For a paltry few thousand pounds it is prepared to cut into this allowance; and, in a later clause, it proposes to do some' thing even worse. I protest as vigorously as I can against the proposed reduction.' It is a degradation of the Labour movement -that I bitterly oppose. I view the proposal with disgust and loathing,. and hope that the electors will adopt a similar attitude towards it. I trust that .when they have the opportunity, they will hurl into political oblivion those who are responsible for it. I support the principle of this proposal, but suggest an alternative scheme for the consideration of the Government: I ought to. be.a The charities boards, which are au fait with the workings of our hospitals, might well be consulted. If that were done, I believe it would be found that those hospitals would approve of the payment of the maternity allowance to institutions that deal with maternity cases. The giving of the allowance is admitted to be a humanitarian act; but frauds have been perpetrated in the obtaining of it, because it has been procured by some persons who are not entitled to it. It is also known that the money has not always been spent in the way intended. If it were paid to these institutions, the patient would get that measure of medical attention which is necessary. vernment introduce an entirely new arrangement, under which maternity hospitals would be established, and the money be paid to them? member is aware that there are' such institutions, in Melbourne at any rate, 'at the present time! I suggest that the payments be made to those institutions, many of which are working under great difficulties and with heavy overdrafts. In numerous instances the services of the best doctors are given gratis. If my suggestion were adopted, the patient would be assured of the best medical attention and the mortality rate would be considerably lessened. The administration of the, act It does not know what would be a simple matter, and I feel quite sure that a greater saving than £225,000 would be made.

As Christians, our .first care should be the sick and the .ueedy. There should be no question of balancing budgets where the health of the people is concerned. If children are to be brought into this world, we should at least see that those who bear the pain and the suffering birth are succoured by the nation to the fullest extent. To balance budgets at the expense of the mothers of this country is, as the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) has said, a disgrace that is unfathomable. should the mother and her child be called upon to make this sacrifice? Children born in Australia have always been regarded as our best immigrants, and we as a Labour party have always prided ourselves upon this humanitarian act of giving some assistance to mothers in their time of travail, when, in a large number of cases, the expense' causes considerable hardship. I cannot recall any more disgraceful proposal in the history of legislation in Australia. The honourable member for Balaclava, asserted that in numbers of cases the money had been ill spent; but when his bluff was called he could not mention such a case. When the maternity originated, the money manner I think that the gentleman who, for some years, has been representing Australia in London, was credited with saying that some women purchased bangles and other trinkets with the maternity allowance. That, of course, was untrue, at all events of the workers' wives, because in the majority of the workers' homes, the greatest treasure that enters is the new baby. The one desire of the parents is that the child shall have a good start in life, and a better opportunity to make good than they enjoyed. Now, because of the ineptitude of our legislators, this much-needed and very welcome assistance is to be substantially reduced. blame the Treasurer to a large extent, because he is the kingpin of the whole show; but the blame does not rest entirely upon his shoulders. Mr Yates. support him must accept some responsibility for this repugnant proposal, which I regard as one of the worse features of the present Labour Government's plan. It is unthinkable that an attempt should now be made by a Labour government to tear down the temple of social services which has been erected with such care by those who have been connected with the movement for so many years. To seek to just if y this paltry economy on the grounds of associated with expediency, is, I think, unworthy of any government, because this will not balance the 'budget, or provide employment for a single person. I , as a member of the Labour party, believe that all the benefits of our social services should be available Why to every citizen of the Commonwealth, and if I had my way, I would make the old-age pension as free as the air. There should be no embargo against its acceptance by any person in Australia. If I cared to take up a different attitude upon this, and other issues now before this Parliament, I could be assured of a free run for the City of Adelaide, and be in the same position as some Labour men who have shifted from this side of the House, and are now the nominees of the Liberal union in that State. But I am not going to do that. Political considerations of that nature do not weigh with me. This proposal is repugnant to every true member of the Labour moveallowance was ment. I submit, also, that it is not necesit was argued that sary. If the Government were sincere in would be spent in a its determination to effect real economies, that was not intended. it would cut out a great deal of overlapping expenditure that is being incurred in all the States.

The clause proposes to effect certain economies in connection with the payI ment of the maternity allowance. Eor what? To balance the budget at the expense of the babies! There is an alternative, but as soon as I or any other honThose who orable member who is opposed to these proposals mention alternative schemes,",77,Paiks
455,Mr Yates,"That is just what I amwe a IB told to "" stick "" to the clause. I am sticking to it. The Government estimates to save £180,000 by this miserable economy. Instead of seeking to balance its budget at the expense of the babies, it should get rid of a big crowd of useless politicians, and other ineffectual ensite, and I suppose it will be carried. tities, who are supposed to be representing this country overseas. Instead of doing that, it brings down a scheme to economize at the expense of expectant mothers. For many years prior to the accession to office of this Government, the Commonwealth expended hundreds of thousands of pounds in bringing immigrants to Australia. It would not be wide of the truth to say that, under the aegis of the previous Administration, more Italians came to Australia than during the whole of the time from the colonization of this country until the year when the Bruce-Page Government got possession of the treasury bench. For several years there was a steady inflow of Czecho-Slovakians and the flotsam and jetsam of Southern Europe, the idea being, so we were told, to develop Australia according to British traditions; but the real intention was to bring about a rethem. I , as an Australian, and a Labour duction in the cost of production, and a consequent lowering of the Australian standard of living. I am proud to be able to put up something of a fight in opposition to this proposal, and I repeat that if some of the alternatives which I have suggested were adopted, it would be unnecessary to make these economies. There are a hundred and one ways in which we could rehabilitate the finances of the Commonwealth if the Government cared to adopt them. Instead, it prefers to follow orthodox lines to restore confidence. Then, when confidence is restored, the Government still following good old orthodox lines, will approach investors in Great Britain, borrow more money, and in that way will increase the interest burden which these unfortunate babies will have to pay some day. But first, of all we must restoreconfidence! Everything then will be all right. I have no time for these financial jugglers, these three-card tricksters, these thimble and pea people. This proposal is nothing more nor less than bare-faced, daylight robbery. A burglar is a gentleman compared with the man who would take money from an expectant mother on the eve of her accouchement and rob her of 20 per cent, of the amount which hitherto has been payable to all mothers in Australia. But this proposal is approved by honourable members oppoI n my opinion, no language allowable in this chamber can properly describe it. This proposal is a portion of the plan. Those who sponsor it ought to be ashamed of themselves. It is an unworthy attempt by a Labour Government to do what the Nationalists have been clamouring for during many years. It should not be forgotten that Nationalist Governments for many years allowed a number of services to be carried on for the benefit of the wealthy interests of this country. They were not concerned about the balancing of budgets, otherwise they would have eliminated many of the non-paying activities which cost this country so much. This Government, in giving effect to a Nationalist policy, is prepared to rob expectant mothers of £1 of the amount which should be paid to representative, and one who was proud of the achievements of the Fisher Government, which gave effect to the whole of its legislative programme, feel absolutely disheartened in knowing that a Labour Government, in a time like this, has associated itself with such a miserable and unworthy project. If ever there was a time when every effort should be made to reduce infantile and maternity mortality, that time is now, when, owing to widespread adversity, 400,000 of our workers are unemployed, and, therefore, unable to provide their womenfolk with the ordinary comforts of civilization. Honourable members will have read in the press, within the last few days, of the appalling experience of a number of expectant mothers who were accommodated in the unemployed camp at Happy Valley, near Sydney. The cyclonic storm which swept over that city a few days ago utterly destroyed the Happy Valley encampment, and city ambulances had to be requisitioned to rescue many unfortunate expectant mothers who were living there. The enormous loss of life which takes place every year among mothers and",78,Paiks
456,Mr C. Riley (Cook) [1.42 A.m.],"infants should justify us in at least main' 1 taining the present amount of the maternity allowance. rate ishigher in Australia than in England and in Wales. How many honourable members of this committee have taken the trouble to read the report of Dame Janet Campbell, who was invited by the Bruce-Page Government to visit Australia and report upon child welfare ? I have read the report, and was deeply moved by its contents. In Australia we lose, each year, about 5,000 infants before they reach the age of twelve months,'and, of that number, almost 50 per cent, die within two or three weeks of birth'. It is during this time that the maternity allowance of £5 is so useful in a great many' families. It is much better to spenjd money in this way than on the Federal"" Capital, or on the Navy and Army, se'rvices.' We can find millions' ' of pounds for defence purposes, but, in order to balance our budgets, we-, must pare down by £1 the already sufficiently small allowance paid to mothers so that they may have a chance of 'preserving their own lives and' those of their' infants. It is disheartening for a..man who has always supported the Labour movement to be told that' it is necessary to resort to such methods ih order ' to balance the budget. 'than'agree to this proposal, I would hand over the job to the party opposite, Which isj' to a large extent, responsible for the difficulties in which Australia' now finds itself.' The whole of our troubles are not due to the diminution of the national income. Many of them can be laid at the door of the last Government which, by its destroyed the financial stability of the Commonwealth. Now the Labour Government, instead of resolutely carrying out its policy, is trying to patch up the national finances by knocking something off maternity allowances, civil servants' salaries, and the pensions paid to our 'soldiers, and to the aged and infirm. I will not associate myself with such action, and I am angry that, as a Labour supporter, I am compelled to oppose the legislation of a Labour Government. It is over two years ago since the Bruce Page Government called applications for the position of Director, Division of Sir. O. Riley. Maternal and Child Hygiene. What has become of the proposal to The maternity death appoint this officer? Has not the Minister for Health any responsibility in regard to the matter? This was a most worthy proposal, but a government which could find salaries of £2,000 a' year for heads of public departments, and £4,000 a year for the Director of Postal Services, was able to offer only a miserable £1,100 a year to the man who was to fill the post of Directordf-'Maternal Hygiene. Why has the position not been filled? We are told that'-the' Government cannot find the -njoney to establish this most important 'branch of the Public Health Department. -I-'felt ""once that when a Labour govera! nlent gotinto -power it would make it its business to 'provide liberally for public health activities, but in that we have and other unprofitable failed miserably. I regret very much that the Government should seize on this method to secure money for balancing -the 'budget. ' I shall resist the Government's proposals, and vote against them. (i I , register a strong protest against this .clause. . Of a bill which is infamous .throughout, this is,one of the most lament. able features. At an earlier stage in this debate I expressed the opinion that, so Rather .far. .as; the. people of this country were concerned, we might as well have had Sir .Otto Niemeyer as head .of the Government, supported by Sir Robert Gibson. ,At. the. present stage one might venture the 'opinion that we might as well have Herod as Treasurer of the Com, nionwealth. I compliment the venerable recklessness and extravagance, member, for Melbourne ( Mr Maloney) for his. magnificent contribution to the debate to-night, in spite of the frivolity of certain members of the Onoosition. I congratulate also the honourable member for Cook( Mr C. Biley) upon his stirringspeech. In connection with a. proposal of this kind, one regrets that -a country enjoying adult suffrage is not .represented hy even one Woman in this Parliament,' although at least 50 per cent, of the electors are women. I remind the honourable member for Melbourne that, when he spoke in justifiable condemnation of the present so-called Labour party, he may have overlooked 'the fact that, after all, only a remnant",79,Paiks
457,. Mr Eldridge (Martin) [1.50 A.m.].,"of the original party is really responsible for these infamous proposals. Out of a total of 47 which comprised the party after the last federal elections, the last division to-night revealed that only eighteen are left to support the disgraceful legislation proposed by the Government. I register the strongest protest against this clause of which I am capable, and I trust that, when the next appeal is made to the people, the women of Australia will rally to the cause of motherhood in such a way as to annihilate politically every member of this Parliament who votes in favour of this proposal. Tliere are certain periods in the history of the Labour party upon which its supporters have always been able to look back with pride. From my earliest association with the Labour movement, those who were seeking the suffrages of the electors have always been able to refer to the regime of the Fisher Government between 1910 and 1913 as demonstrating the benefits of Labour rule. They have pointed to the institution of the maternity allowance for which that Government was responsible,and to other humanitarian legislation. If one looks up the parliamentary debates of that time one will find, however, that the Fisher Government carried the Maternity Allowance Bill in the face of the most hostile opposition. It succeeded by virtue of sitting early and late, and eventually tiring out a most strenuous Opposition. Now, in 1931, only a. small coterie of Labour representatives are left to defend those things for winch Andrew Fisher fought. . Honourable members who 'have followed the history of the Labour movement have no doubt come' across a book published by the Australian Workers Union. In this publication there appears a cartoon depicting a little child holding a £5 note in his hand, while underneath rhe picture are the words, "" Thank God the Fisher Government gave me a chance to live"". It has been left to another Labour government to rob the child of its chance to live. One by one the principles of Labour are being abandoned at the behest'of the' capitalistic press, 'and of those who are forcing the hand of this 1 Government. Well may honorableanembers opposite smile with satisfaction to think that a Labour government is doing that which they desire, but have not the courage to do themselves. The honourable member for Martin( Mr Eldridge) referred to the breaking up of the Federal Parliamentary Labour party. The present Government was elected with 47 followers about eighteen months ago. A year later, six members left the party, and joined the Nationalist party. After that, five members, now known as the Lang group, left the party, and about the same time the Parkes seat was lost to Labour. Of the 47 Labour members returned at the last election, seventeen are now voting against the Labour Government in an endeavour to protect Labour principles, and it has now the support of only eighteen Labour members. The position of the present Labour Government in relation to the members of tbe Labour party reminds one of the story of the mother and father who came ' to the city during the war to see their son march past with the troops, aiid who, after watching them go by, declared that all were out of step but their Johnnie. If we have to remain here all night and all to-morrow we shall ""fight every clause of this bill in an endeavour to defend, the principles for which Labour has always stood. At a time like this, when 400,000 people are out of work, the maternity allowance is a greater necessity than ever. To many of those who are bringing children into the world""at the present time the bonus means a ' very great deal-muc h more than it did'wheri their husbands we're in work. It is not right to say that the money has been wasted. Perhaps in isolated cases'it has been spent unwisely, but in the main the maternity allowance has been used in the interests of the infant child. Even now, infant mortality is high; but it would have been higher but for the maternity allowance for which, the Labour party was responsible. A reduction of the allowance will result in the death of many infants. As the honourable member, for Adelaide( Mr Yates) said, we have spent thousands of pounds in bringing migrants to Australia. Although no migrant can equal the native born childj it is'now proposed to save £125,000 on the",80,Paiks
458,Mr Lacey (Grey) [1.57 A.m.],"maternity bonus. If that saving results in the death of even one infant who otherwise would have lived, the reduction cannot be justified. that the opposition to this clause will be greater than that which has been offered to any clause which has already been dealt with. The Government should' deal with the maternity allowance as it dealt with soldiers' pensions; it should have an inquiry made into the matter, to see whether the same amount could not be saved in other directions without interfering with this humane legislation. I associate myself with the protest of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) against the proposed reduction of the maternity allowance. I feel strongly on this subject because I regard that allowance as one of the most beneficent forms of social legislation for which the Labour party has been responsible. The maternity allowance stands in the very forefront of Labour's wonderful achievements in the betterment of social conditions in this country. When legislation providing for a maternity allowance was introduced in 1912, it was not thought that £5 would cover the whole of the expenses associated with the birth of a child; it was regarded as a reasonable contribution towards the additional expenses of a home at such a time. If that was the position in 1912, what justification is there for reducing the allowance to £4 now, when prices are at a much higher level than they were then? By reducing the allowance we may do irreparable harm to the race, because of the injury which may be caused to our future citizens in their first hours of life. Generally, the parents with the largest families are found among the poorer people in the community. still get the allowance. their reduced incomes, cannot afford to lose £1 at a time when their expenses are an allowance of £4 is justified. particularly heavy. In times such as these we should endeavour even to increase the maternity allowance, not obtained from an alternative scheme. to reduce it. Those who have at heart the social and moral well-being wants to do away with the maternity of our people cannot view with equaniallowance altogether. mity any proposal to reduce the maternity allowance, because of the probable effect onour future manhood and womanI hope hood. If we were earnestly to seek fora permanent solution of the problems which confront us, we should find a way of avoiding the necessity for reducing an already inadequate allowance. Mr Ciitchley Parker, the editor of the Industrial Australian and Mining Standard, demonstrates that this proposal is but the beginning of a campaign for the abolition of the maternity allowance. If this reduction is accepted, a precedent will be established for further reductions, until finally the allowance will disappear entirely. Those who have opposed this plank of Labour's' humane policy in the past will not shrink from depriving mothers of this assistance altogether. In these times it is incumbent upon us to protect those who are unable to protect themselves. The motherhood of the country should be preserved from danger in its most critical hour. -The fears expressed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) impel me to say another word in support of the alternative plan which I have already suggested. As stated by the honourable member for Cook( Mr C. Biley), our infant mortality is alarming. Most of the deaths among children under one year occur in their first few weeks of life. That is largely because the nursing is at fault. I speak with some knowledge of this matter. The best value for the money spent in maternity cases is obtained when proper attention is given to the mother and child. When. I said that the allowance is sometimes abused, I had not overlooked the fact that in other cases it has proved a boon. Unfortunately, it is not always the mother who gets the benefit of the allowance, for frequently it is spent in drink or squandered in some other way by the father.",81,Paiks

If the money now paid in maternity allowances were used to assist those institutions, it would be spent to better advantage. I realize that in country districts the allowance would have to continue, although on a lower basis. Now that the Government is at the cross-roads, it should consider alternatives to the present arrangement. which I have mentioned, both mother and child get the best attention possible. Those institutions are in urgent need of financial assistance. If the Government were to call a conference and inquire into this matter, as it did in the case of soldiers' pensions, I feel sure that a workable scheme could be evolved. The Government should consult with those skilled in obstetrics to see whether a scheme could not be evolved which would reduce the present rate of infant mortality. I submit my suggestion in all earnestness. We have reached what is probably the most sordid phase of the plan which has been submitted to us. alternatives to that plan are not so absurd as some in this chamber would have us believe. ( Mr Scullin) recently said that it was anticipated that the acceptance of the Hoover plan would benefit Australia to the exent of over £3,000,000. Government did not expect that relief when the Premiers Conference plan was evolved. In view of the probability of the Commonwealth benefiting to that extent, it might be well to remove from the plan the proposal to reduce all pensions and the maternity allowance, which provides for the saving of practically the same sum that would be gained under the Hoover plan. I believe that, on this question, every member of the Ministry has the same views as every supporter of the Ministry. able member believe that? of Ministers I can believe 'in their sincerity. The payment of a maternity allowance is a part of the Labour platI want to see the best form that has for many years been widely advocated in Australia. It was provided that the allowance should be given to every member of the community without reservation, so that people in the ranks of Labour could, like any other class of the community, accept it without indignity. No. salary limit was fixed; there was to be no suggestion of charity; the allowance was to be the right given to every mother, whether she were rich or without means. If anything in this plan In the institutions is more to 'be deplored than any other part of it it is this interference with the maternity allowance. I believe that there should be no reduction, but I agree that perhaps the money could be spent in a different way. There may be something in the suggestion that skilled hospital treatment should be provided, and inquiries might be made by the different State Governments to see if f u l l effect can be given to that suggestion; but the question immediately before the committee is what the amount of the allowance should be. It is useless to suggest that the reduction in the cost of living will make up for the £1 reduction of the allowance. Medical fees, the cost of drugs, nursing fees and all the items I Some of the have mentioned during the last few days still remain high, and there has never been a time when the payment of the full The Prime Minister allowance. has been more urgently required than the .present, because the women likely to be affected by this reduction are the wives of .men whose work The is casual or who have no work at all. I have heard no justification for this feature of the rehabilitation plan except the general statement that budgets must be balanced. Some weeks ago, at Bagshot, in my electorate, I was speaking at a church gathering, held in aid of hospital funds. The audience was by no means Labour. At that time the plan had not been evolved. I said that a Government of the movement I represented would never stand for the squaring of State balances or Commonwealth balances by reducing social services. Yet this Government is doing so. The corollary to the Commonwealth's adoption of this plan must be a reduction of hospital grants by the State Governments, and there will be greater need than ever for home treatment.

469,Mr Keane,"Knowing the historyclause is equally objectionable, because it provides an income limit for the recipients of the maternity allowance, and every one will know the worldly position of every applicant for the allowance. That, also, is an infringement of the original intention of Parliament that the allowance should be the right of every woman in Australia, whether she be the wife of a wage-earner or the wife of a millionaire. Eor these reasons, and because I am in general opposition to the' whole plan, I shall vote against this clause, as I have voted against others. I have always been opposed to any reduction of the maternity allowance, and I never thought that the time would arrive when I should be called upon to oppose an attempt on the part of a Labour government to interfere with one of the most humane pieces of legislation ever' placed on the statute-book of the Oommonwealth by Labour. I have had some little experience amongst the working classes, and know of the benefit that has come to them from the payment of this allowance. Buti t seems that, in order to meet the wishes of people politically opposed to Labour, the Governdoing so to prevent something worsement has been forced to bring about a reduction of the allowance. During the hist election campaign our political opponents mooted this reduction, and, if my memory serves me rightly, the ex-Prime Minister indicated that if his Government were again returned to power, the reduction would be brought into .effect. If my memory also serves me rightly, every Labour candidate opposed that proposal. It may be true that'many people are in a position to meet all the expenses attaching to maternity, but, in my opinion, aiiy attempt to distinguish between the rich and the poor will be the starting point of interference with the 1S92, when we were confronted with a payment of the allowance and possibly tbe starting point of its abolition. ""When the act was passed, it was said that it would be abused. It was called the bangle bonus act. All sorts of fancy titles were Griffith when he advocated the paygiven to it. But no case in which the allowance has been abused has yet been brought under my notice. In support of this legislation it was claimed that the money would be spent on Australia's best immigrants, or the nation's priceless assets as they were termed. The first few weeks of a child's life are the most critical, and the payment of this allowance may make all the difference in the world to itdetermining whether it will grow to be a sturdy citizen or not. I feel that I should be breaking the pledges I gave when I consented to stand as a Labour candidate, and violating the principles of the platform of the party to which I belong, if I supported this clause, and it is therefore my intention to vote against it, as I shall vote against other clauses in. the bill. a.m.] I do not think £5 is too much to pay as a maternity allowance. I do not think that £10 would be too much to pay. I should like to go further and pay a £20 allowance upon marriage. There is nothing I should be more pleased to do than to increase the salaries of public servants instead of reducing them. But we are not here to-night to deal with that. We are in a position that forces us"" to choose between two evils. Those who are supporting the plan are from happening than a reduction of salaries, allowances, and pension's. It is not the mere question of whether £4 or £5 should be paid. We cannot carry out the Labour policy. I pay homage to representatives of industrial centres who' are taking their political lives in their hands and risking defeat because of their support of this plan. I also look with' respect upon those who honestly, and with pertinacity, are fighting for Labour principles. But I shall vote for the-plan because I do not want to see something worse in the shape of repudiation. In very serious position in Australia, there was no maternity allowance. I was in_ public life in New South Wales' and strongly supported Mr Arthur ment of a maternity allowance, and the matter wasafterwards taken up by the Commonwealth.

As the reduction provided in this clause is part of the plan, I intend to support it even if it means my political extinction. I am doing what I think will in the end be in the best interests of the people. At present, this Government is not sufficiently strong numerically to carry out its policy, particularly as some honourable members elected to support it are endeavouring by tiddly-winking methods to misrepresent what the right honourable the Prime Minister has said. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member must discuss the clause. before the committee is repugnant to members of the Labour party, but as there is no alternative, I intend to support the Government.

Unless this plan is adopted, we shall be faced with default, and that will cause more misery and distress than at present exists. a.m.] I desire to associate myself with the protests made by honourable members who have already spoken in opposition to this clause, and to congratulate them upon their fight to retain the present rate of the maternity allowance, which is one of the most important principles of the Labour party. This is a definite instance of pounds, shillings, and pence being regarded as of greater value than human life. The payment of this allowance has, in many instances, been the means of saving life. As previous speakers have pointed out, this money is made available at a period of great consequence, not only to the mother, but also to the .child. When medical attention is needed, there should not be any absence of financial aid; Honourable members who have families can fully appreciate the necessity for this assistance. Yet honourable members make the reduction of the allowance from £5 to SA a feature of the so-called economy proposals! The members of this group cannot in any circumstances associate themselves with that. Labour's policy is based upon humanitarian ideals and inspirations. When the Labour Government, led by the late Mr Andrew Fisher, first put through Parliament a bill providing for the payment of the maternity allowance, the humanitarian features of the policy weighed heavily with those who were then members of the party. It would be impossible to assess the value of the allowance in the saving of life. It is tragic that Labour members of this Parliament should, in 1931, have to witness the sorry spectacle of another Labour Government interfering with a policy such as this established by a former Labour Government. I agree entirely with the prediction of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin), that this is merely the beginning of a general attack upon the maternity allowance. No doubt, when further cuts are made in order to balance budgets, this item of expenditure will be wiped out altogether. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) referred to the advantages of nursing homes. I do not deny the need for providing facilities for the nursing of mothers, but this suggestion is only put forward by those who are using it to support a proposal which I believe will eventually mean the cutting out of the allowance altogether.",84,Paiks

Therefore, I , andother honourable members opposing the Government's proposals, are not too much inclined to rely upon the result of such a gathering.

It is a sad commentary upon our present social system that, at this period in our history, we cannot continue the present rate to those who are in need. The present allowance should be retained for the preservation of the lives of our future citizens.

I am not concerned with whether ©r not the Minister who is in charge of the chamber for the moment considers that they are political speeches. I have frequently heard him and other members of the Government make speeches which could not be characterized as anything but political speeches. venient for the Minister to apply that term to the speeches that have been made this evening; but I do not think there are many honourable members who speak without considering the influence that their remarks may have upon the people outside. Consequently, the use of such terms is merely another form of political hypocrisy. I want to know whether the responsible members of this Government are so ashamed of this miserable cheeseparing cut, this attempt to rob the babies of this country, in the interests of the banking institutions that, having absented themselves from the cliamber during the whole of the debate, they now decline to say one word in justification of the proposal. Speech after speech has been made, attack after attack has been launched, against the viciousness of the principle embodied in this clause, yet not one word will they say in its defence. They are dumb in their shame and their degradation. They cannot justify it . In all my experience in this Parliament I have never seen a government so dumb and so incapable of answering or of attempting to answer criticism such as has been hurled against this proposal. Ministers are destitute of any sense of shame. I shall continue to protest. If the members of the Government will not in this, the national Parliament of Australia, say u word'HI justification of this action, by their silence they themselves condemn it . That silence shows that they are ashamed of it, and that they realize the political iniquity of it.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. this subject seriously, I should like the Clause 24 (Who may be claimants). a.m.] -This is the clause which seeks to pauperize those who claim the maternity allowance. I am reminded that on one occasion the present Prime Minister( Mr over were to be ineligible for the materScullin) said that the cost of policing such a provision would practically eat up any saving which would' be effected by it. Minister, there was an agitation to restrict the maternity allowance to persons with small incomes, but Mr Bruce, a Nationalist Prime Minister, refused to alter the basis of the allowance, largely because the saving would not be very, great if the cost of policing the provision were taken into account. Apparently, the present Labour Government wants to deal with the maternity allowance in the same ruthless manner that it dealt with the honourable member for Martin( Mr posal was made in 1929, it ""was strongly Eldridge) a few minutes ago. One is fillr-il with disgust that that Government should lay its unworthy hands on this h-tfislation, of which the Labour party h»s always been justly proud. However had the condition of the finances of the ""try, they cannot justify an action of this kind. How much will the reduction of the allowance by £1, and the further reduction which this clause will effect, aisisr towards balancing the budget? Apparently, the doctrine of the equality of sacrifice must go right to the cradletho unborn child is to be robbed of the ""mvision made in its' interests. Government regards the reduction in the marprnity allowance-the pauperizing of Australian children at birth-as a.sacric '-< equal to that of a Minister of the j frown' whose salary is cut down to £35 a week, or of a member of this ParliaMakin, N. J. 0. ment, who, even under these proposals, Maloney, Dr. will have £16 a week, or even to that Riordan, D. which the Governor of the CommonRowe, A. E. wealth Bank, with his £70 a week, will be Tellers: called upon to make! No argument, Lacey, A. W. however plausible, can justify the proRiley, C. posal. The Government which makes i l stands condemned for all time. So Martens, G-. W. ashamed of its own proposals is the GoJames, R. vernment, that it remains dumb, and will Watkins, D. not even attempt to defend them. Mathews, J. at this late hour it is possible to treat committee to consider whether it is really worthwhile making this distinction for the small saving which is likely to accrue from it. In 1923 an estimate was made of the saving which would be effected if persons in receipt of £300 per annum and nity allowance. It was then. estimated that the saving would amount to about £29,000 per annum. The present estiWhen Mr Bruce was Prime mate of £100,000 per annum has admittedly not been made on figures which are at all likely to give an accurate result. On this subject the women's service guilds in the several States appear to be fairly unanimous. They regard the maternity allowance"" as a recognition of maternity, which should be given without class discrimination. There is a very strong >iiiection on the part of women to making which they regard as a declaration of pauperism. When a similar pronbiocted to on the grounds which I haveindicated. In view of the considerable cost which would be incurred in policingthe provision, it would be well fbr thp committee to consider whether, after all., it is worthwhile giving offence to so manywomen to gain such a small amount. This clause is even worse than the onewhich preceded it. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) has put th*-. position temperately, yet very clearly He has voiced the opinion of theThe women of.

541,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [3.49,"oath that the statements contained therein are true, must inflict hardship on those who are to 'be paid the maternity allowance. They must swear that the family income is not over £260 per annum, and, like the old-age pensioner, must submit to be cross-examined by a special magistrate in the department as to the truth or othershe makes out a claim, which is wise of the statements they have made. Such an investigation always goes beyond the actual requirements of the application form. I have had numerous complaints that it is an application of the "" third degree "" in the case of old-age pensioners. I should say that the money is most urgently required at the birth of a child. At any rate, that is the time when special attention is needed, and the mother is cerber for Perth( Mr Nairn) about tainly not then in a position to appear before a special magistrate and declare what is expected of her before she can establish her claim to the allowance of £4. She should not be required to do so. A second point to be raised about this clause is: What is covered by the word "" income "" ? In New South Wales, during the course of the preceding twelve months, the husband may have had partial employment of a character entitling him. to receive assistance from the State in the shape of child endowment. Another in New South Wales is poor relief from the Department of the Chief Secretary. Another form of assistance may be the war pension, no matter how small, payable by the Repatriation Department. These items will all be included as income. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) has shown that the amount that will be saved under tliis provision is so small that it is hardly worth botherof loyalty to one another, and the ing against it should receive the sympathetic consideration of the Treasurer. 1 think that applicants for the allowance should not be put to the humiliation of having to run the gauntlet of investigation, and that any allowance in the form of assistance from a State should not be taken into consideration in estimating income I feel disposed to support the conten[3.55 a.m.] -The honourable member is unduly delaying the passage of the clause by stating at great length a point very easily explained, and has conjured up difficulties respecting the making of an application by the mother for an allowance. The claimant need not go before a special magistrate, nor will she be subjected to the inquisitorial investigation which the honourable member has imagined. At present, witnessed by the medical officer or nurse, and the ouly additional requirement will be a declaration which can be made before a person authorized by the act to witness declarations. a.m.] I am pleased to be able to endorse the remarks of the honourable memdistinctions. I know that many women's societies resent any distinction being drawn between mothers who are married and those who are single women. I have been thanked by them for having burnt many cards describing patients as unmarried. I hope that the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) will apcept the suggestion of the honourable member for Perth, and drop this clause. It will not save much money, which, after all, is not the greatest thing in the world, but it will fix form of relief given the stigma of poverty on women who get the allowance. I am glad to see that the words ""ex-nuptial,"" first incorporated in this legislation by Mr Andrew Eisher, have been retained by the present Prime Minister( Mr Scullin). The Commonwealth Yea/r-Booh no longer uses the word "" illegitimate"". It employs the words "" ex-nuptial "". Deep down in the hearts of women there is a sense about. The objections raised women's organizations are earnest in their appeal that no distinction should be made in the payment of the maternity allowance. Let us leave the provision as it is to-day, so that the stigma of poverty may not be attached to the recipient of the maternity allowance. tion of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn). The anticipated saving is so small that I do not know upon what, grounds' the Government bases its calculations. Owing to the depression which, now exists, the social life of the com-",93,Pairs

543,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [3.56,,94,Pairs
544,Mr Cusack (Eden,"Monaro) [4 a.m.]..munity is so disturbed that the number of persons claiming the allowance will not be great. Persons receiving even more than £260 a year, who have recently established homes, should be able to participate in the allowance, because of the numerous expenses which they have to meet. The Minister should move an amendment to increase the amount from £260 to £500 instead of quibbling over matters of this kind. The Government's proposals have been formulated with the object of saving millions of pounds, but if this clause is passed in its present form a very small saving will be effected, and deserving mothers will be deprived of an allowance to which they are justly entitled. The Government should have given more consideration to the contentions of those who are opposing its nnancial policy. The deletion of this clause would, I submit, afford satisfaction to practically every honourable member, as the payment of maternity allowance under the proposed system savours of a class disruption which is contrary to the spirit of the act. Notwithstanding the arguments adduced by a large number of honourable members in opposition to this and other clauses, we have not had a reply from a Minister. Whatever may be urged against those in opposition to the bill, I think it will be conceded that we are opposing some of its provisions on a sound basis. I have not charged the Government with insincerity, because I have realized that it is faced with a tremendous proposition. But I have suggested that, as the Government's commitments may be reduced by £3,090,000, under the international debts arrangement, this amount could be used in such a way as to avoid the reduction of pensions and maternity allowance, which is repugnant to every honourable member. Even at this late hour, some effort should be made by the Government to meet those members of the Opposition who are carrying on the work of the committee while so many other honourable members are either asleep or absent from the chamber. The only reply we have had to the numerous points raised was from the Minister for Defence( Mr Chifley), who said that those opposing the Government's proposals were merely making electioneering speeches. Those who are opposing the plan ,are taking more risks politically than are those supporting it. In view of the small amount likely to be saved I trust that the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) will withdraw the clause. a.m.] I am not satisfied with the reply of the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) to the points raised by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) in connection with the form to be filled in by claimants. The Treasurer, in his usual airy manner, endeavoured to make it appear that it was not the intention of the Government to embarrass those who submitted claims. We are all aware of the inquisitorial nature of the investigation conducted in connection with invalid and old-age pensions, and there is every justification to assume that a similar procedure will be followed under this clause. In endeavouring to ascertain the actual income of the husband of an applicant, inquiries of a most rigid nature will be conducted, and in some instances persons entitled to the allowance will refuse to make an application, .because of the indignity to whicli they will have to submit. Since consideration of this measure in committee was commenced, honourable members on this side have been ineffectively hammering away at the Government, but Ministers have not even replied to any of the points raised. As the reduction of the allowance, and the conditions under which it is proposed to pay it, destroys a fundamental principle and an important plank of the Labour party's platform, I intend to oppose the clause. dore) intend to reply to the points I raised with respect to the allowances to be included in calculating annual income ?

563,Mr Yates,"It is useless to .argue asfeatures of the Arbitration Act, which this Government amended soon after it came into power, was the excessive nature of the penalties that were provided for offences. Yet this bill proposes, under the clause we are now considering, a penalty of £100, or imprisonment for one year! Eveni f a person, in furnishing information, made some slight mistake, or wilfully supplied particulars that were not truthful, could it be argued that such suggest, would be met by a smaller a vindictive, vicious penalty should be inflicted? limitation on such penalties by stating that they shall not exceed what is stipulated. Discretionary power is given to magistrates to assess the enormity of the offence. The giving of inaccurate information may be due merely to forgetfulness, and might easily be explained by the individual concerned in the presence of a sympathetic examiner. Sympathy is not always shown in such cases. I know from experience that there are many persons who will not appear before some magistrates for the purpose of giving evidence. Eveni f the statement made be not wilfully untrue, the claimant will be guilty of an offence, and punishable under this provision. One might think that unless the allowance is reduced the financial consequences will be so disastrous as to send this country clean over the precipice; whereas, if the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) is rightly informed, the total savings will amount to only £29,000. obnoxious to me. It savours of the dark ages. Certainly it is not in keeping with this progressive age, when it should be the duty of all governments to show every consideration to the people. I ask the Government to reconsider the information upon which the Commispenalty proposed for offences under this sioner would be able to save a little more clause. It is provided in section 10 of at the expense of expectant mothers. It the principal act that the penalty for the is iniquitous to require any person to be a submission of fraudulent claims shall be spy upon his neighbour; yet under this a maximum fine of £100 or imprisonment clause the Commissioner may call upon for one year.

The Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) hasendeavoured to persuade the committee that the Commissioner or deputy commissioner would determine whether or not the information supplied was satisfactory. I think it is dangerous to leave too much to the discretion of any particular individual. The penalty is altogether too severe. A member of a claimant's family might be called upon to furnish a report, and if he refused to do so within a reasonable time, he would be guilty of an offence. Personally, I should refuse to act as a spy upon my neighbour in a matter, like this, and yet if I refused'a request by the Commissioner to supply information concerning an applicant, I should be liable to the penalties provided in this clause.

This whittling away of principles for which the Labour party has always stood, is repugnant to me and to several other honourable members on this side. Undoubtedly it will seriously damage the prestige of the Labour party. The committee has already decided that the amount payable shall be reduced from £5 to £4, and this clause gives power to the Commissioner to have made such investigations as appear to him to be desirable concerning the circumstances of auy claimant. The same procedure is followed in the administration of the -Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and I have not heard of complaints. I believe that these new provisions will be administered with the same sympathetic regard for the position of claimants. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) that the penalty is too high, and I suggest that it be reduced to, say, £50 with a corresponding shorter term of imprisonment. what is, after all, a minor offence, I shall accept an amendment to make the penalty £10 or imprisonment, say, for one month. surer's assurance, I move That the words "" one hundred pounds or imprisonment for one year "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof tlie words "" ten pounds or imprisonment for one month "". a.m.],I am entirely opposed to the clause, because it is out of touch with the mentality of the Australian' people.

I do not approve of the proposed differentiation between those who areeligible to apply for the maternity allowance and those who are not It suggests an intention to pauperize people who may be claimants, and it is most unfair that they should have to answer a questionnaire concerning their circumstances. Also it is most improper to impose a fine of even £10, or imprisonment for one month, upon any person who refuses to give in formation concerning some other person in connection with claims for the maternity allowance. An old-age pensioner has a right to get some friend who has known him for years to come forward voluntarily and certify on his behalf, but there is nothing in the act, I submit, which would justify a provision of this kind.

As was pointed out by the lionorable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), it is possible that in the case of an applicant for a maternity allowance, information may be sought by the department from the applicant's next-door neighbour. The whole thing is too inquisitorial, having regard to the paltry amount involved. Even on the estimate of the Treasurer it is expected to save only £100,000 under these proposals, and according to the honourable member for Perth( Mr Curtin) the amount to be saved is only £29,000. for Perth was proceeding on the assumption that the allowance will be payable only to those with an income of less than £300 a year. makes my British blood boil.

To the proposal to reduce those pensions I offer the strongest objection. It is said that 17s. 6d. to-day will buy as much as £1 bought a year or two ago. In this connection I wish to quote from a letter I have received from an old-age pensioner, 70 years of age. He writes. I am very disappointed in Mr Scullin. Why not take some of the princely salaries down. Labour again. I live in a room-10s . a week, it is a policy which they would like firing Is. Od., groceries 7s. (id. shilling for clothing.

One could tay a lot on this subject, but it brings as back to the point we have been emphasizing all along-that in order to obey the behests, demands and commands of financial institutions and other powerful corporations, the invalid and old-age pensioners must lose half a crown a week -My feelings are intense when I have I agree with the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) that the £1,625,000, by which, by means of this cut, the purchasing power of the people is to be reduced will not provide employment for one individual; it will simply go towards paying off the country's debts. As I have said before, these proposals resemble an attempt to take a dent out of a rubber ball by making a fresh dent here and a fresh dent there, until the ball have heard the Treasurer ( Mr is all one dent. But even if to deprive the old-age pensioners of their half-acrown a week would balance the budget, it would be too dear a price to pay. If this step is taken it will take years of strenuous fighting to restore one of the most cherished ideals of the Labour movement to which Ministers claim to belong. It is a true saying that it is easy to take away but hard to replace. And when honourable members say that they hope later to restore the pension to the full amount of £1, I fail to follow their line of reasoning. To me it seems uneconomic if not stupid. If we had only had the courage, we could have carried into effect a plan by which, before now, the Government would have been provided with four or five times the amount proposed to be saved by the cheese-paring plan now under consideration.

The proposal to reduce the rate of the pension is, I feel, contrary to the basic principles of the Labour movement, and to what is tlie duty of any government entrusted with the responsibility of giving effect to Labour's policy. situation that confronts us at this moment cannot be squared with that plank in the platform of the party which distinctly declares for "" increased invalid and old age pensions"". the platform which every honourable member on this side of the House has pledged himself to support and have carried into effect, and how any person who has attached his signature to that declaration can support clause 30 of this bill is beyond my comprehension. The specious argument that to vote for a reduction now actually means increasing the pension is also one that I cannot accept. Yet honourable members appear quite annoyed because they cannot convince others that by voting for a reduction of the pension rate they are actually giving an increased pension. A few such increases like that and there would be no pension at all then. Of course, there is no logic in such reasoning, and the people who use it are merely seeking to sooth their greatly disturbed consciences. The full sacrifice the invalid and old age pensioners are required to make is not only the flat reduction of the flat rate provided for in clause 30. It.has gone out to the public that there is to be a reduction of invalid and old-age pensions by 2s. 6cl. a week, and most pensioners are under the impression that that will be the only contribution expected general sacrifice. however, will not be confined to 2s.

I shall be able to extend that argument a That is a plank in little later, but it can be seen that there is no limit to the percentage that may be taken off the invalid or old-age pensioner. The reduction may actually reach 100 per cent. Is that equality of sacrifice? I ' strongly object to the inroads which are being made into the rights of invalid and old-age pensioners in this and in some of the following clauses. It is said by some that those persons whose pensions are to be reduced from 20s. to 17s. 6d. a week will not be inconvenienced owing to the decrease of the prices of certain commodities. This statement is more illusory than actual except perhaps in regard to the prices of boots and clothing, but these are not everyday lines. But let us now consider the other side of the matter; the value of a pensioner's home is to be calculated upon inflated values fixed by the municipal authorities. The Government, therefore, proposes to catch the pensioners both coming and going. There is no fairness in such a proposition, which I do not hesitate to condemn in the strongest possible terms. There are no words in which I can adequately express my feelings of resentment towards this action of a government comprised of them towards the of members of the party to which I have The deduction, always belonged, and which could have submitted a policy to benefit these aged and infirm people. I earnestly call the attention of the Government to this matter, and ask for some relief from what now is a most inequitable position. I realize that the amount which has to be provided out of the consolidated revenue to meet the payments of -invalid and old-age pensions is increasing; but the Government should place the pension system upon a proper basis.

The increase in the number of pensions paid during the last few years is due largely to the unemployment caused by the abnormal conditions which prevail.

""When prosperity returns-it s return will be delayed under this plan-w e can expect a decrease in the number of claims, and there will then not be such a heavy demand upon the revenue. In view of all the circumstances, the Government (should introduce a scheme of national insurance to be supported by regular contributions from members of the community, and payments from a fund so created would not be regarded as an act of benevolence on the part of any government. a system would bring in sufficient money for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions at possibly an even higher rate than is now being paid. No one would experience any hardship, and the recipients would then be receiving what they had contributed for. If the Government had been prepared to give effect to a which is part of the Labour party's policy, it would not now be compelled to make such an unfair demand upon our old-age pensioners. I cannot support the Government in this proposal jjp reduce the amount paid to invalid and old-age pensioners, and I intend to vote against these other clauses which further restrict the pension provisions. I trust that a majority of the committee will see the wisdom of maintaining the rate which the pensioners now receive, as they should not be deprived of what is their due in the eventide of life. Kr. RIORDAN (Kennedy) [5.38 a.m.]. I again register my protest against this iniquitous form of taxation being imposed upon a defenceless section of the community. It was astounding to me to hear the Postmaster-General( Mr A. Green) say last night that although a reduction of 2s. 6d. was to be made in the .amount of the pension it would actually mean an increase to the pensioners, owing to the reduced cost of living. A reduction of from £52 to £45 a year will inflict a severe hardship upon many of these old people. Under the existing law they are allowed to earn up to £78 a year, but their prospects of increasing their earnings at a period when thousands of' able-bodied men are vainly searching for work are hopeless. In most cases, the pension they receive represents their total income, and the statements of those whosay that they will be better off on a pension of 17s. 6d. a week, is a mere absurdity. Old men in the country cannot obtain a room for less than 5s. a' week. If they purchase 3 lb. of beef, 2 lb. of sugar, 3 loaves of bread their weekly expenditure is 10s. If we allow for a little butter, tea, jam and a few other essentials, they have nothing left to purchase clothing, medicine or a little tobacco. In prosperous times, many of these old chaps Such worked on stations, and in some instances pastoralists employed them in dummying selections. To-day, these selections are either not worth dummying or they are so closely policed by officers of the Lands Department that the system has broken down. I support the remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr system of national insurance, Makin) in advocating the introduction of a platform of the Labour party providing for a scheme of national insurance under which all sections of the community would contribute to a fund from which persons reaching the evening of their lives could receive an amount which could not be regarded as a"" charitable gift of the State. I do not believe that this country is in such a desperate state that it is necessary to impose this form of taxation. Although there has been a big fall in our national income it ill becomes a government supposed to represent the masses to inflict this form of taxation in order to help it out of its difficulties. Some contend that the bondholder who has saved his money should not be compelled to make a sacrifice, and that the poor old pensioner should.

599,Mr C. Riley (Cook) [5.53 A.m.],"Ihonorable member for Kooyong( Mr definitely that the opinion which I held Latham), as well as by the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons), when he was a member of the Federal Labour party. The Government and those who now support it have stubbornly resisted at all times any suggestion that there should be an interference with the pensions of the old and the infirm. Therefore, the present somersault by the Government is most extraordinary. Ho uncertainty exists as to the nature of pension cuts, &c, and I regret that this plan lacks definiteness in the direction of providing employment for our people. We have seen the pensions bill soar higher and higher during the last eighteen months or two years, due entirely to the deliberate restriction of credit by the banks. Those institutions have been assisted by a majority of members of another place, with the result that the Government has not been able to give effect to its financial brought forward proposals to increase policy. But that failure is no justification for an interference with pensions. This proposal affects men and women who have done much to build up this country, and who have made it possible for us to enjoy the conditions and services that operate at the present time. Its advocates attempt to justify it to a certain extent, by claiming that there has been a decrease in the cost of living. Perhaps the statistician's figures may be quoted in support of that contention; but I want more substantial proof of its accuracy To my mind, the fall in the cost of living is illusory rather than real. I had hoped that, before being called upon to consider this proposal, I would have had an opportunity of testing out what actually could be done by a person with £1 a week. It was my intention, had the opportunity presented itself, of -living largely as a hermit, doing my own buying and attending to the preparation of my own food. I would have bought in the most favorable markets, lived as economically as possible, and eliminated all unnecessary expenditure. that I had not that opportunity. It is not likely that the recital of my experiences would have influenced the Government or the supporters of the plan, but it certainly would have given me the additional satisfaction of knowing Mr C. Riley. in regard to the cost of living was well founded. The people who are to he affected by this reduction will not be satisfied merely with the statistician's figures. The so-called decline in the cost of living will not butter their bread, nor will it enable them to purchase those commodities which they need in their old age. The advocates of the plan have put forward the plea that there should be equality of sacrifice, and that that sacrifice should be spread over all sections of the community. Eveni f an attempt has been made by the Government to effect an even spread over all sections of the community, I consider that a little extra pressure has been applied in the case of pensioners and others who enjoy the advantages that result from our various social measures. If the Government had employment, the position would have been immediately reflected in the figures relating to expenditure on invalid and old age pensions, as many persons at present in receipt of old-age pensions would be absorbed in employment, and there would be no need now to consider this reduction to 17s. 6d. a week. Bather than support this proposal, I would favour the imposition of a special tax upon all young wage-earnersthose young people who, under existing taxation measures, contribute nothing by way of income taxation to the revenue. Throughout the Commonwealth there must be many thousands of this class of wage-earners, who might very well be called upon to make some contribution to the maintenance of' our aged and worthy pioneers, instead of expecting these unfortunate people to struggle along on 17s. 6dper week. I very much regret that the Government has weakened to such an extent since the conference of Premiers in February last. I have studied carefully the whole of the reports of that gathering, and have failed to find the I regret slightest suggestion that the Federal Government was then prepared to entertain a proposal for a reduction of old-age and invalid pensions. I am also convinced that if such a suggestion had been made by the Government at the time, the view of the party would have been made known in no unmistakable manner. I regret that the Governmeut did not earlier frankly inform Parliament that it would be impossible to continue these social services on the scale hitherto obtaining. Much of the present trouble could have been avoided. Ministers waited until the end of the financial year, when the banks had delivered their ultimatum at the point of a revolver, so to speak, and then responded to the threats of the banks. It is to be deplored that we should now be called upon even to consider such a proposal as this. I certainly will do all in my power to defeat it. have already stated that, in my view, a reduction of the old-age and invalid pensions is unthinkable. Every honourable member came into this House pledged to serve the interests of those who sent him here, and I suppose that all have done their best. It is now the duty of this committee to arbitrate on the claims of our aged and invalid pensioners. SinceI have been zealous in my support of our secondary industries, I must be equally zealous in standing by the provision to be ma'de for the care of our aged pioneers and invalid persons. In my position as head of the organization which I represent in Victoria, I gave certain rulings last year when this matter was under discussion. I take the view that, as a party, we 'cannot be continually shifting our ground. As our course is definitely mapped out for us in the platform upon which we were elected, it should be our duty in this House to do all in our power to give effect to it. The Government has declared that unless these economies are approved the financial, position of the Commonwealth will be quite hopeless. I cannot accept that view. Certainly I am strongly opposed to the proposed cut in invalid and old-age pensions. The provisions relating to the value of house property will operate harshly against a large number of old people who live in their own homes. The cost of living has not declined sufficiently to warrant this reduction. The absurdity of the claim is easily capable of proof. The Government has accepted the Statistician's figures, the of my attitude towards these proposals I accuracy of which is challenged by the Labour movement. During the lasttwelve months there has been an alarming increase in the number of applicants for this class of pension, owing to the absolute dislocation of industry. Many old people who, formerly, were supported by their sons or daughters, are now claiming the pension because members of their family are no longer able to maintain them. I believe that this position will be aggravated under the plan. Rationalization and mechanization of industry will throw 150,000 wage earners upon the dole, or whatever system of maintenance may be adopted, probably for the rest of their lives. The need for the full amount of pension payments was never more urgent than it is at the present time. The authors of this plan would have disarmed the majority of its critics if some attention had been paid, even last year, to the interest burden of our overseas debts. Now that the crisis is upon us, we who believe in the maintenance of our social' services, in which Australia has given a lead to the rest of the world, must close up our ranks and fight in the interests of those who certainly deserve the best that this country can give them. It is to be regretted that the continuous agitation for a reduction of our social services has at last succeeded. SinceI have been a member of this Parliament I have given wholehearted support to all measures approved by the party, although not all of them helped me in my electorate. This is practically the only proposal upon which I have not followed the decisions of the majority. I regard this as the most momentous session in the history of this Parliament, and I am amazed at the poor attendance of honourable members during this sitting. With the honway), I am beginning to realize the futility of these long-winded parliamentary proceedings.

Many arguments have been advanced as to why these cuts should be made. been given to the Bruce-Page administration for increasing the old-age pension, but at the time that Governmeut raised the pension from 17s. 6d -to £1, Sir Robert Gibson, the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, had already notified the leaders of the Government that the crisis, which is now upon us, was threatening. depression cannot be advanced as an excuse for reducing pensions. One thing at least must be placed to the credit of the old-age and invalid pensioners. increased very greatly, but that is because a great many of those who were previously entitled to claim pensions refrained from doing so as long as they were able to obtain employment of any kind. The increase in the number of pensioners is not due to an increase in population, or to the fact that a large number of persons have recently become infirm, but to the fact that large numbers declined to make any demand upon the State until they were absolutely compelled to do so. It is also necessary to point out that pensioners are liable to suffer through the operation of this plan, apart from the direct reduction of their pensions. has been claimed for the plan that, if it is put into operation, it will result in the release of credits, the stimulation of industry, and the raising of prices. I do not know whether the plan will work out in that way, but if it does, it is clear that the pensioners will be worse off than ever. Not only will they have had their pensions reduced, but even the pension they receive will be worth less than it was before. Apart from that, however, there is no equality of sacrifice under this plan as between pensioners and other sections of the community. As I pointed out before, the taking of half a crown from an old age pensioner's income of £1 a week represents to him a much greater sacrifice than an equivalent percentage reduction in a larger income. The loss of half a crown by the pensioner is immediately and severely felt, while a substantial deduction could be made from the income of a man in receipt of a large salary almost without his feeling it. Moreover, Credit has under the plan some pensioners will have their pensions reduced by as much as 70 per cent.; others will be reduced by 50 per cent., and so on down the scale until we arrive at the minimum reduction of 12$ per cent. Many pensioners who live in the cities own homes of which the valuat i on for municipal rating purposes is as much as £800. This is £300 more Therefore, the present than the limit fixed in the bill, so that their pensions will be reduced by £1 for every £10 in excess of £500, making a reduction of £30. Under the 12$ per cent, reduction, £6 10s. will be cut ofi their pensions of £52 a year, making a Their numbers have recently total reduction of £36, which is equivalent to 70 per cent. Now let us consider the case of a man living iD a house of a ratable value of £700. The block of land on wbicL the house stands may quite easily be valued at £200, so that, even if the house itself is valued at only £500, the total valuation will be £700. The deduction in respect of excess value in this case will be £20 which, addnl :o £6 10s., makes a total reduction of £26 10s., or 50 per cent, of his pension. When we compare this with the maximum reduction of 22$ per cent, imposed on other sections of the community, it is evident It that there is no equality of sacrifice here. I do not believe that the majority of honourable members of this House desire to penalize any section of the community to this extent. Presently honourable members who, exhausted by the long sitting,, are now sleeping in various portions of the building, will come in and vote on",107,Pairs
602,Mr Lacey (Grey) [6.15 A.m.],"I ttliis proposal, perhaps without knowing that they are imposing a sacrifice amounting to a 70 per cent, reduction of their income ou many aged people, while those in affluent circumstances are called upon to sacrifice only 22$ per cent. It is not the fault of those who oppose these provisions that they find themselves in the position of having to vote against the Government. Members of the Government were told before ever this plan was agreed to that a majority of the Federal Labour party were not in favour of the drastic cutting of wages and pensions. I trust that the Minister will give some consideration to the representations I have made on behalf of the pensioners. I am strongly opposed to this clause, which, if carried, will impose great hardships on a deserving section of the community.. I have met and know many of these old-timers, and it is not right for the Government to demand this heavy sacrifice of them, The Labour party has always claimed that it was largely responsible for the introduction of such humanitarian legislation as old-age and invalid pensions, and I never expected that the time would come when I should be fighting my own party to retain for the old-age pensioners their meagre £1 a week. It has been said that the pensioners will be as well off on 17s. 6d. a week as they were formerly on £1 a week. I cannot accept that contention, because I do not accept the figures of the Commonwealth Statistician. No doubt he based his figures upon the data supplied to him by storekeepers, land agents and others, but we who have prepared cases for presentation to the Arbitration Court, know that the figures produced by the Commonwealth Statistician's Department, and those supplied by householders, often show a wide divergence. The reduction of pensions by 2s. 6d. a week will impose a very real hardship on old-age and invalid pensioners. all; the tightening up of the legislation in other directions will impose further burdens upon them. Many Labour members have for a considerable time been desirous of amending the legislation dealing with invalid and old-age pensions with a view to correcting anomalies which make it very difficult for persons entitled to pensions to receive them. This bill will make their position even more difficult. It is not easy to vote against men withwhom I have been associated for many years. There are some who would endeavour to persuade the people that the opponents of the plan which was evolved at the Premiers Conference are actuated by political motives, and are not earnest „ in their opposition. I believe that every opponent of that plan is perfectly sincere in his opposition to it. A few months ago, when it appeared that there was a likelihood of an attempt being made to reduce these pensions, I told a number of pensioners in Tasmania that I would never be a party to a reduction of invalid and old-age pensions; that I would.rather go out of public life standing firmly for the principles in which I believe. I said that I would stand by those who had played an important part in building up the nation and making it a better place for subsequent generations to live in. When I think of the struggles of the pioneers, I realize that a pension of £1 a week is all too meagre. I feel that I am doing the right thing in opposing this bill. I intend to do so. a.m.] -In my second reading speech on this bill I outlined my objections to this clause fairly fully, so that it is scarcely necessary to cover the same ground again. The Australian Labour movement has rightly boasted -that it has accomplished many social reforms, which, so far, have not been given effect in other countries. We have spoken of the standard of our wages, of the conditions which obtained in industry, and of the reforms which have been obtained by returning to State and Commonwealth Parliaments men pledged to support Labour principles. Pointing to these accomplishments, we have urged the workers of other nations to go and do But that reduction is not likewise. Sitting with me in this Parliament to-day are two members who represented Australia at a conference on the other side of the world which had for its object the securing of social reforms by bringing backward countries up to the standard of the more advanced ones.

At the conclusion of the war, it was pointed out that if world peace was to be established and maintained,' it ""was desirable that the more backward -countries should be brought up to the standard of the more advanced nations ^ in the matter of social reform. Having boasted of our higher standards, we are now asked by a Labour Government to go backward ourselves instead of bringing others forward. Tbe policy now being inaugurated will, I feel sure, be pursued later on beyond a reduction of pensions by 2s. 6d. a week. Words fail me when dealing with proposals of this nature, beThe best way to prove whether those who cause upon a Labour Governmeut devolves a greater responsibility than rests be to make it apply to them as it now upon its opponents to uphold the humanitarian principles for which Labour has fought. Our political opponents look upon these attacks on our social conditionsin an altogether different light from that in which we view them. I shall give one example from my own experience. At the conference which I attended on the other side of the world, the representative of the Nationalist Government then in office in Australia supported a backward policy more in keeping with that of countries like Austria being stolen from these old people by this and Czecho-Slovakia than that of Australia. His attitude on that occasion proved that only by political and industrial organization had the people of Australia been educated to the necessity for these social reforms, and that the opponents of the Labour party had accepted those reforms not of its own free will, but cuss the rehabilitation plan. I am not combecause public opinion demanded them. Otherwise, their representative at the conference, Sir Joseph Cook, would not have adopted the attitude that he did. To-day the members of the Opposition are the most pleased persons in the community-although they have not expressed that pleasure in words-becaus e of the situation which has arisen. opposite rejoice because they have forced a Labour Government into such a position that it is doing an anti-working-class by this plan. job which they themselves want to see done.

Without reflecting on any one, it seems to me that some honourable members are speaking to the gallery rather than endeavouring to arrive at the truth.

Some honourable members who have spoken have not fully understood the operation of the provisions relating to pensioners.

The bill provides that in the case of a home valued at £800 a deduction of £500 is permissible, leaving a balance of £300. property? sioner is allowed to deduct a further £50 in accordance with the act as it stands, which leaves £250 to be treated as property, and for every £10 of that amount £1 is deducted from the pension, reducing the pension by £25 a year. In the case of a married couple who are both pensioners, the balance of £300 is divided by two, leaving an amount of £150'irom which £25 is deducted. The £1 in £10 then applies, and the pension in each case is reduced by £12. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) said that the Labour party at one time prided itself on being representative of a very advanced policy, and that it had the right to appear before the world as a party that had accomplished great reforms. That is true, but in what sense can it be said that we are no longer able to claim that we have advanced this country or accomplished great reforms?

I ask the Treasurer to deal with the clause. Mr ""THEODORE -If I am not doing so, what of those who have spoken upon it earlier this morning? I am dealing with pensions. Australia's system will remain comparatively the best in the world even after this reduction has been made. It is only approached by one or two countries so far as the old-age pension is concerned, but ;t is approached by no other country so far as the treatment of invalidity is concerned. I cannot recall one country where persons are entitled to pensions from the Government on the be treated as ground of invalidity except under some contributory scheme. In our library can be found some up-to-date information upon pension schemes operating in various couutries. The report of a Canadian royal commission which in 1929 investigated the question of liberalizing or bringing under dominion control the pension schemes in Canada gives a conspectus of the legislation relating to pensions in various parts of the world, and of the benefits arising under that legislation. It shows that Australia stands alone in the liberality of its pensions system. New Zealand approaches it to some extent, but even with this alteration we still have the most liberal scheme in the world. If , in the face of the financial and economic difficulties through which the country has been passing, we can maintain a scheme which is the most liberal in the world, the Government should not be decried, merely to make political capital by opposing this plan. Very good arguments can be advanced in defence of the plan. The increased payment of £1 a week to invalid and old-age pensioners came into operation in 1925, and the amount of pension that will now be payable has a greater purchasing power than that of the pension payable in any year since it was increased to £1. If we can maintain the true relative value of the pension to the persons in receipt of it, despite great economic disturbances, the great loss of national income and the drop in production in Australia, it will be a matter for congratulation and not for the denunciation, criticism and distortion in which some honourable members have been indulging throughout the night.

This is all so much sophistry-on his part. Because we will not accept an alteration of the conditions for which we have fought for many years we are told that we are trying to make political capital. I am out to do what I think is right in the interests of those who to the promises made to them under his have sent me here to represent them, and I am fortified in my altitude by the decision of a meeting held in Adelaide last night that I should be asked to oppose the provisions of this bill. I do not rise on this occasion, however, to deal with that aspect of the question. It cannot be said that I am endeavouring to make political capital out of what I am now about to say. i reasons why the pensions of the blind should not be reduced. One of these letters is from an institution for the blind in my electorate which has been hit very hard by the depression. It sets out what is paid in bonuses to those who work for the institution. A man who is blind is suffering one of the greatest hardships that can be inflicted on mankind; yet he will be very materially affected by having his pension reduced by 2s. 6d. I should like to hear the Treasurer trying to convince the inmates of this institution, who have to work day after day and week after week under a tremendous handicap in competition with workers who are in the enjoyment of full sight. It would be a hard task for the honourable gentleman to convince them that under this "" nominal reduction "" they are better off than they were previously. As a matter of fact, they have asked me to try to safeguard their interests, and to see if it is not possible for them to retain able to convince the electors that if given their f u l l pensions.

We are should like him to go among proud of that fact. Have we not fought to bring it about?

A pensioner, who has a house worth £700, and a banking account of £50, will have his pension reduced by £26 10s.; and, in the event of his having no money in the bank, the reduction will be £21 10s. I contend that the value of a pensioner's house should not be considered in fixing the amount of his pension. Drastic cuts have already been made' with respect to this section of the community. It is not unusual for a block of land to be worth £200; consequently, very little they did not expect to pass the whole is left for the house itself. to be included ? value is to be taken into consideration. A man who is over 65 years of age may not be able to do work that will give him an income; but if he were a handy man he would quickly improve his home, and very little effort would be required to raise the value to £700. He is to be taxed to the extent of 50 per cent. Members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in the Tenth Parliament inspected in Adelaide a number of cottages that were erected under a housing scheme, each of which cost between £700 and £800. Admittedly, they were good types of workers' homes, but still they were only cottages. Many old age pensioners may to-day own, even in that locality, houses that are worth as much as £700. Honourable members know as well as I do that a decent block of land in a repectable suburb in any of our capital cities is worth not less than £200. Surely it will not be contended tliat old-age pensioners are living in a mansion when they live in a house valued at £700! There is probably not an honourable member of this House whose home is not worth three or four times as much. Many of these pensioners may have done more for this country than any honourable member. Why should they be penalized to a greater extent than any other section? The Treasurer ought not to penalize this small section of the community merely in order to fulfill a promise given at the Premiers Conference to save, a certain amount of expenditure. Only a small sum is involved. The Government has not given way on one point. ber is not right in that statement. yesterday by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) was agreed to by the Government. have given way on a small point. I can visualize the Prime Minister and the Treasurer at the Premiers Conference agreeing to make certain savings. Surely plan through this Parliament without alteration! I ask the Treasurer to allow this clause to be deleted so that old-age pensioners may be permitted the full enjoyment of their homes. They should not be specially taxed in the manner proposed under this clause.

Some compromise appears to be necessary.

If this is accepted it will involve conse-quential amendments to clauses 34 and 35.

A 12$ per cent, deduction of the hospital pension would amount to8$d.; the Government proposes to take Is. A 12$ per cent, deduction from the amount of 14s. 6d. paid to institutions for the maintenance of the pensioner, which is not covered by this bill but is an arrangement between the respective governments, would amount to Is. 9fd.; the Government proposes to take Is. 6d. The responsibility of maintaining those institutions is vested in the States, and a large number of the inmates are, to a degree, self supporting, in the sense that they grow vegetables, &c. To be equitable, the deduction should be worked out on a different basis. When the hospital pension was increased in 1928 from 10s. 6d. to 14s. 6d., the increase was 38 per cent., and the increased amount of Is. 6d. paid to hospital inmates represented an increase of 37$ per cent. A deduction of Is. from the pensions fund to hospital inmates amounts to 18 per cent., whereas a deduction of Is. 6d. from institutions amounts to 10 per cent. Since the whole scheme is allegedly based upon the principle of equality of sacrifice, there is no justification for taking those amounts off in that disproportionate way. I suggest to the Government, and I hope that the ; Treasurer will accept the suggestion, that instead of taking Is. off the hospital pensioner and Is. 6d. off the institutions, it would be better to take off 6d. and 2s. respectively. and the Government will accept the amendment. a.m.] -Sinc e the Government is prepared to give way on the 6d., why bother to touch the thing at all?

A liberal response to that appeal would prevent reductions in other directions, and would minimize the hardships imposed. I join with the honourable member for Brisbane( MrD . Cameron) in his request. representatives of the returned soldiers' organizations should have come to this the proposal is not perfect. No scheme could be evolved that would please everybody. ment by saying that single soldier pensioners w ill profit under it as they have not wives and children whose pensions will also be deducted. of the 75,000 war pensioners only 16,000 are single men. The average age of all returned soldier pensioner^ is 41 and among those who are siifgle are many disable ! or cot cases, and even these w ill have deductions made in respect of certain dependants. I see no reason for the criticism by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) who said that the soldiers had been let down by their leaders; the contrary is the case. If , in addition, committees are formed i u each State to inquire into pensions with a view to the elimination of anomalies, on the lines suggested by me during the second-reading debate, and an appeal made to those ex-service men who do not require their pensions to surrender them voluntarily, more than I make this the saving desired 'by the Government will be made. When the Prime Minister makes this appeal, I have no doubt that there w ill be a generous response. The result of the conference between the Government and the representatives of the soldier organizations is most satisfactory, and I am pleased that the leaders, at a period of economic crisis, have shown themselves just as ready to do what is patriotic as they were at the time of the late war. a.m.] I cannot let this clause pass without saying a word in reply to the very unfair and partisan attack made by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr. Beasley) against the body of men who, at a time of national emergency, have shown a. high spirit of responsibility and patriotism.

Although the economies w ill be of immense help to the finances, they are even more important from the point of view of soldier pensioners, because they w ill help to safeguard their pensions. There can be no doubt whatever that Tinder inflation, whether controlled or uncontrolled, no pensions in Australia would be worth anything.

While most of the bounties mentioned in the schedule are concerned entirely with products that are consumed locally, the wine bounty relates to a commodity that is exported. The exchange has been an immense help to the export of wine, this year, but it has mainly been used to reduce the price overseas to enable Australian wine to compete with the South African product. Notwithstanding these price reductions, 3,000 tons of grapes were not picked this year. It will be obvious, therefore, that there is no substantial margin of bounty above the urgent needs of the case. If the exchange returns to par, or nearly to par, which, of course, can only occur with a return to general prosperity, a similar arrangement should be brought into operation in relation to the wine bounty as is proposed in relation to the gold bounty. If the Government cannot see its way clear to accept an' amendment of this nature at this stage, I ask it to give consideration to. the possibility of doing so while the measure is before another place. ter) [9.33 a.m.] -Consideratio n will be given to the suggestion of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker); but I point out that there is an important distinction between the gold bounty and the wine bounty. The gold bounty has premium which the exchange gives to the export of gold. It is true that the exchange also gives a premium to the export of other commodities; but not to the same extent. In view of the heavy reduction in the gold bounty, the Government felt it was only fair to make this provision. A similar provision is not so necessary iu the case of a reduction of bounty of 20 per cent. However, consideration will be given to tlie representations of the honourable member. a.m.] I ask the Prime Minister to give an assurance that the reduction of the bounty on such articles as sulphur and wire netting will not be offset by the imposition of duties. If duties are imposed, it will mean that the sacrifice will fall upon the primary producers who use these commodities, and not upon the industries concerned. that extra duties will be imposed.

The Minister for Defence was kind enough to furnish me with a copy of the agreement, but I do not propose to read it to honourable members. In a covering letter which he wrote me the Minister said that the amount being paid annually was £39,520, which was at the rate of £380 per trip. It must be obvious to all honourable members that under the conditions which will prevail after the passage of this bill that subsidy will be worth 25 per cent, more than at present. Unfortunately, the payment of it enables tbe pete successfully with our trans-Australian railway. The result of this competition has been tliat the traffic on the railway has been reduced to two passenger trains a week, and an occasional freight train. If the subsidy could be reduced the trans-Australian which cost millions of pounds to construct, and is at present operating at a loss of thousands of pounds per annum, would be in a better position than it is to-day. Westralian unfairly with the railway, because the fares on one of its routes in Western Australia, which is comparable in distance with the route from Adelaide to Perth, is more than double the fare charged for the Adelaide-Perth journey. Many men have been dismissed from the Commonwealth railway service, and much of our rolling-stock is lying idle at Port Augusta, Kalgoorlie, and other stations, because of the unfair competition I ask the Prime Minister whether this subsidy could not be reduced in the same way as bounties are to be reduced. There is little difference between a subsidy and a bounty, and, if the Government is able to alter legislation, it should be able to alter an agreement. Because of the increased purchasing power of money consequent, upon the operation of the Government's plan, the value of the existing subsidy will be increased. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that the competition of Westralian Airways Limited with the Commonwealth Bailways will become more acute, because that company will be able to reduce its freights and fares, 3fr. Lacey. The and still make the profit that it has been making hitherto. I . commend for the consideration of the Government the suggestion of the honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey). Coming to another agreement that has recently been signed by the Government, to Westralian AirwaysI consider that it would be totally unfair to regard the sugar industry as sacrosanct, and not to compel it to suffer a sacrifice in common with other industries. Ordinary justice should lead those interested-in the sugar industry to join, of their own volition, in the general plan of economy. Westralian Airways to com I cannot allow a discussion on the sugar industry, because no bounty is paid on sugar. ber for Grey has referred to one agreement, and surely I may refer to another. bounty paid on sugar. honourable member for Forrest that, in discussing the sugar agreement, he is antiAirways is competing cipating an order of the day on the notice paper. A considerable item of expense in connection with Westralian Airways Limited is the cost of fuel. Since the mail contract was entered into with that company, the cost of fuel, owing to the operation of the tariff, has been increased by 3d. or 4d. per gallon, and that has meant to the company an added expenditure of some thousands of pounds. Surely, of Westralian Airways. there should be no interference with existing arrangements for the carriage of mails. There is no analogy between a bounty and a contract. A bounty is a gift, but the contract with the Westralian Airways Limited constitutes a payment in consideration of services to be rendered by the company for the benefit of the public. There is no excuse for breaking contracts entered into by the Government. It is true that, in the case of a bondholder, we are breaking our contract, but that is because of the extraordinary position of this country, which makes it impossible for us to carry out the terms of that contract.

This subsidy is wrapped up with the whole question of mail contracts on shipping and air services.

The route traversed by that company's aero-planes is not along the railway. any case, I do not believe that the air eervice between Melbourne and Western Australia has been responsible for the falling off of the revenue of the transcontinental railway. The aeroplane gives an efficient and fast service. The Qantas aeroplanes travel from Brisbane through the back country to CamooDaly Waters and on to Burketown, serving all the Gulf country, where in the wet season, were it not for the air service, mails would be delayed three or four months. Before any reduction is made in the subsidies to air services, I hope that I shall be consulted, and that the subsidy to Qantas will not be interfered with. a.m.] I suggest to the Prime Minister that he ask the Westralian Airways to agree to a conversion similar to that proposed to the bondholders.

If that were done, there would be no need to attempt to rectify anomalies under this scheme of general economy. I should like to know whether the Westralian Airways have rigidly adhered to the conditions of its contract. I understand that some little time ago, the company sold a machine to another company, and replaced it by a machine not in keeping with the conditions of the contract. If that is so, there has been a breach of contract, and the Government, if it sees fit, can terminate it, and come to whatever arrangements it desires with the company in keeping with the times. I hope that the Government will keep its hands off aviation, ancl not interfere with existing subsidies to airIn ways.

I referred only to Westralian Airways, which is causing considerable loss to the transcontinental railway. the amount of subsidies should be periodically reviewed. The company which has maintained a good air service between Brisbane and Sydney, and also between Sydney and Melbourne, and Melbourne and Hobart, has met with considerable loss, which, coupled with the loss of 'one of its air liners, has compelled it to close down. The Qantas Air Service in Queensland is one of the most efficient in the world, due largely to the fact that it is subsidized; in fact, the most successful commercial aviatipn companies in the world are those which are subsidized. I hope that the Government will bear in mind that aviation is only on the ing to the tests made in England, threshold of its usefulness in Australia. It should be encouraged because of the extensive areas to be covered, the bad means of communication, and lack of roads, and because an aerial service can so easily be changed from one terminus to another.

708,Mr Theodore (Dalley,"Treasurer )The position of our unfunded debt overseas has been the cause of much anxiety during the year. covered by Commonwealth securities which have been issued, with the approval of the Loan Council, in respect of the floating indebtedness of both Commonwealth and State Governments. Owing to the inability of the Loan Council to obtain long-dated loans overseas, the requirements of the Governments, up to 31st August, 1930, were financed by means of bank overdrafts and short-dated treasury-bills issued to the public. After that date the Government expenditures were met by remittances which were made possible by the pooling of London exchange by the Australian banks under an arrangement with the Loan Council. The Governments are given first call upon accumulated Australian resources in London by virtue of this arrangement. 31st August, 1930, which has since remained constant, totalled £38,075,000, and was held as follows:£ By the Australian banks By the Westminster Bank 7,900,000 By the public 38,075,000 At the present time the Australian banks £10,756,899. are carrying £33,075,000 of the unfunded debt, and the Westminster Bank the year 1930-31 is arrived at as fol£5,000,000. £38,075,000, £10,220,000 is on account of the Commonwealth. The cash position in Australia at 30th June reveals that treasury-bills discounted and overdrafts granted by the banks total £22,268,000. indebtedness certain of the States had cash balances on current account totalling £1,651,000. Of the total accommodation provided £6,264,000 was on behalf of the Commonwealth. THE YEAH 1930-31. The results of the first quarter of the year showed clearly that the budget estimates would not be realized. There were evidences of an alarming falling off in customs revenue, and it was obvious that, owing to the, increasing dullness in trade, raised in London, and from the 1st May the estimated receipts from the sales tax and the post ofiice would fall short of the The financial agreement between the Mr Theodore. estimate. The experieii '"" -f the first few months of the year in.iloa! --.] that This debt is unemployment was forcing ol.! nrojie to apply for pensions, and \hrincrease in the rate of London exchange involved a large increase in expenditure. t In November last, the Government brought down a supplementary budget which imposed increased taxation, and indicated certain savings and economies in expenditure. The combined result of these measures was estimated to yield an annual benefit to the budget of £8,000,000, and to yield £6,8S0,000 for the remaining portion of the year. Subsequently revenue from indirect taxation continued to decline and the increase in invalid and old-age pensions proved to be greater than was anticipated. The rate of London telegraphic transfers rose from £8 10s. per cent, in July last, The unfunded debt at to £30 10s. per cent, and resulted in an expenditure on London exchange of £1,783.000 for the year. Eor the purposes of the recent conference of Commonwealth and State 20,175,000 Ministers, the deficit was estimated al 10,000,000 £13,400,000.

The New South Wales Government has failed to provide from the 1st April last for the payment of interest on loans the interest on loans raised in New York. Oommonwealth and the States provided that the Commonwealth would take over the debts of the States existing at 30th June, 1927, and would, in respect of these debts; assume as between the Commonwealth and the States the liabilities of the States to bondholders. As the debt in respect of which New South Wales failed to meet the interest is included in the debt taken over by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Government had no option but to make good the default of New South Wales. In addition the New South Wales Government has failed to pay certain interest due to the Commonwealth in Australia. The following table sets out the position at 30th June, 1931 :Interest paid on behalf of New South Wales including exchange and other charges Less amounts due by the Commonwealth to New South Wales retained and set off against the above amount . .

During the period of rehabilitation of the finances it is not proposed to make any special provision to repay the loans raised to meet revenue deficits, but the statutory sinking fund contribution of 10s. per cent, per annum will be paid. demption of Oommonwealth debt in When we have returned to budgetary equilibrium it will be decided whether the loans covering deficits will be repaid from future surpluses, or whether the annual sinking fund contribution will be substantially increased so as to extinguish the debt within a period of, say, nine or ten years. Loan Expenditure 1930-31. It was announced last year that the policy of the Loan Council-was to confine its borrowing in the future almost wholly to the Australian market. During the year it was found that"" only a very limited amount was available for new works from local investors, whilst borrowing overseas was impossible. It became necessary, therefore, substantially to re£ duce the loan programme. The estimated loan expenditure for 4,941,014 the Commonwealth for 1930-31' was £4,127,000, whilst the actual expenditure was £1,988,820, a decrease of £2,138,180. 1,100,865 The following table gives short details of the actual loan expenditure for 1930-31, .. .. 3,834,149 compared with the estimate:Estimates Expendltnre 1930-31. 1830-31. £ £ Post office works and buildings . . 2,500,000 . . 1,288,115 £ War service homes . . 500,000 .. 154,906 Federal Capital Terri6,458,723 tory .. 300,000 .. 263,077 River Murray works 200,000 .. 122,000 10,750,899 Advances for purchase of wire and wire Commonnetting .. 173,000 . .. 17,215,622 Lighthouses including construction of steamer . . 139,500 89,500 .. 3,834,149 Defence works and buildings 129,800 .. 07,515 Grafton-South Brisbane railway .. 100,000 .. 08,000 Commonwealth railways 90,000 .. 61,657 Other works 159.700 41,256 4,292,000 2,150,026 105,000 167,206 4,127,00 0 1,9S8,820 DEBT REDEMPTION.

The increase of £53,313,669 in the gross debt is largely accounted for by an increase of £51,395,000 in the short-term debt, of which £29,814,000 represents short-dated securities issued in respect of overdrafts existing at 30th June, 1930. THE YEAB 1931-32. I have dealt exhaustively with the various phases of the rehabilitation plan in the debate upon legislative measures which are now under consideration in this Parliament; and, therefore, will now con1931. fine myself to a summary of those matters arising from the plan, which have a direct bearing on the budget. i Reductions of Expenditure under Rehabilitation Plan. .. 372,957,362 The salaries and wages of Commonwealth employees are to be reduced on .. .. 386,594,494 a graduated scale so designed that the total reductions will represent 20 per cent, on the whole salary bill. All adult male Budget 1931-32. officers will be subject to a reduction of £34 to cover the fall in the cost of living, of £1,018,213 in war pensions and repatinclusive of any reductions effected since 1st July, 1930. The residue of the salary or wages is subject to a percentage reduction on a sliding scale varying from 3 per cent, to 24 per cent. It is also provided that reductions will not bring the salary of any adult male officer below £182 per annum. The relief to the budget by the salary reductions is estimated at £1,800,000. Maternity allowances are to be reduced from £5 to £4 and will not be paid in those cases where the income of the claimant and her husband for the preceding twelve months exceeded £260. It is anticipated that the resultant saving in expenditure will amount to £230,000. All invalid and old-age pensions will be reduced by 2s. 6d. per week. The limit of income, including pension, is to be £78 per annum, instead of £84 10s. Pensions payable to inmates of benevolent asylums will be reduced from 5s. 6d. to 5s. per week, and the rate of payment to State institutions for maintenance of pensioner inmates will be reduced from 14s. 6d. to 12s. 6d. War pensions are to be treated as income for the purpose of calculating pension, and the standard of adequate maintenance in respect* of invalid pensions will be reduced. ' The whole of these provisions will result in an will be £2,800,000 per annum. It will estimated saving on the pensions bill of £1,825,000. It was originally intended to reduce war pensions by 20 per cent., providing that a refund would be made in certain cases having regard to the minimum income of the pensioner. In the cases of widows and widowed mothers who have no other income, it was proposed to reduce the pension by 10 per cent., but no reduction was contemplated in the case of orphans. Adjustments were also proposed in regard to the payment of living allowances which total £250,000 per annum. Representations were made by returned soldiers' organizations that they should be permitted to submit a scheme to the Government which would bring about the desired saving, but alter the proposed incidence of the reduction. The Governmeut met the organizations in this matter, and a scheme was sub[9 & 10 JULY, 1931.] Budget 1931-32. 3741 mitted which would result in a saving riation benefits. The proposals-submitted are acceptable to the Government, and they are being embodied in the Financial Emergency Bill in lieu of other provisions originally contained. A further saving of £281,787 has still to be made to bring the total saving to £1,300,000. The committee of the returned soldiers' organizations have been authorized to' continue to function for a further six weeks to enable them to make recommendations to obtain a further saving of £281,787. If the committee fails in this matter the Government reserves the right to impose further reductions so that a total saving of £1,300,000 will be secured in lieu of £1,417,000 as originally intended. In order that the sacrifice involved in giving effect to the conference plan may be shared by all, it has been decided to invite holders of Commonwealth and State securities to convert their holdings into new securities on the basis of a 22-J per cent, reduction in the rate of interest. In certain cases where securities are carrying low rates of interest the rate will not be reduced below 3 per cent. It is expected that if the conversion appeal is a complete success, the reduction in the Commonwealth interest bill be necessary, however, to reduce the interest rates on loans made to the States for Soldier Land Settlement and the interest on advances for War Service Somes. It has been decided, therefore, to reduce the rate of interest on Soldier Land Settlement Loans from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent., provided that the States pass on the reduction to the settlers, and it has been decided also to reduce the rate of interest on advances for War Service Homes from 5 per cent, to 4-J per cent. The reason for the discrimination between the two classes of loans is that the administration costs in connection with Soldier Land Settlement are borne by the settler, whilst similar expenses in connection with War Service Homes are borne by the Commonwealth. The cost of these concessions is £330,000, so that the net gain to the budget by the conversion scheme is £2,470,000. I u addition to the major savings indicated above, it was decided to still further reduce the adjustable expenditure by approximately £1,000,000."" Particulars of this further saving are set out in the following table Defence Bounties .. 230,000 Superannuation-Commonwealt h contributions Administration of ordinary Departments . . Tost Office. . Miscellaneous .. 170,000 1,000,000 Increased Taxation under Rehabilitation Flan, It is proposed to reduce the general exemption in respect of income from personal exertion from £300 to £250, and cause it to diminish by £1 for every £2 by which the net income exceeds £250, so that, when the net income reaches £750, the general exemption will have vanished. It is estimated that this alteration will yield £290,000 additional tax. The special super-tax of 7-J per cent, on property income will be increased to 10 per cent. It is estimated that this will yield additional tax of. £830,000. The normal rates of income tax payable by companies and individuals will be increased all round by 5 per cent. It is estimated that, this will yield additional tax of £380,000, making a total additional revenue of £1,500,000. It had been decided to increase the rate of sales tax from 2-£ per cent, to 5 per cont. to yield additional revenue totalling £4,000,000. The Government has since decided to grant exemption from sales tax in respect of purchases by State Governments and Government departments for the official use of those departments, and also in other ways to. increase the list of exemptions. In these circumstances, a 5 per cent, rate would not yield the desired revenue. It. has therefore been decided to increase the rate of sales tax from 2& per cent, to 6 per cent. The increased rate of sales tax will and sales tax will be payable in respect apply to all importations and sales of of all importations and sales in Ausgoods made on and after the llth July, tralia of semolina which take place on 1931. Mr Theodore. It must be remembered that a full period is not available for the collection of this tax during the current year. Collections in the month of July in respect of local sales in June will represent 2-J per cent, on those sales. Sales in July, prior to the commencing of the increased .. .. 250,000 rate, as well as collections at the Customs for the same period, will be at the .. 50,000 existing rate of 2£ per cent. .. 110,000 On and from l l t h July, 1931, the fol.. .. 100,000 lowing goods imported into or sold in Australia on or after that date will be exempt from the sales tax.

Works of art which are intended for continuous public exhibition free of charge. On and from l l t h July, 1931, the exemption, from tax hitherto allowed in respect of semolina will cease to apply, and after that date. The Government proposes to incorporate in the Sales Tax Assessment Acts a provision which will permit of any alteration in the rate of sales tax being adjusted as between a vendor and purchaser as may be required, so that the vendor may recover from the purchaser any increase in tax or the purchaser may obtainrelief on account of any reduction in the rate. vision will be one in which the amount of the sales tax payable by a vendor in respect of any goods shall be shown as a separate item on the invoice for the goods. It has been decided to alter the rates of primage duty, particulars of which, will be embodied in a resolution to be tabled later by the Minister for Trade and Customs.

Expenditure. The estimated expenditure on war, repatriation and defence is £27,960,000, being a decrease compared with the actual expenditure for 1930-31 of £5,252,969. The chief items of decrease are:Interest, sinking fund and exchange War pensions and repatriation of soldiers Defence The estimated expenditure under special appropriations (other than war and repatriation) is £14,892,900, being £562,512 less than the expenditure of the previous year. The decrease in the cost of invalid and old-age pensions is £860,953; in maternity allowances £230,652, and the decrease in other statutory payments, excluding interest and sinking fund on works is £140,067. These decreases are offset by an increase in interest and sinking fund of £669,160. Most of this interest is payable in London, and does not therefore come within Associated with the prothe scheme of interest reduction. Moreover, additional overdraft accommodation will be required to meet the lag in revenue and ultimately to cover the deficit on the year's transactions. The estimated expenditure on the ordinary votes of departments is £2,454,300, being £356,393 below the expenditure for 1930-31. Compared with the previous year, miscellaneous services have increased by £255,032, the total estimated expenditure being £996,250. The increase of £373,000 in the provision for overseas exchange more than accounts for the 46,420,292 total increase under this heading. .. 579,060 The estimated expenditure under additions, new . works and buildings is 707,036 £116,842, being an increase of £88,640 over the expenditure of the previous year. This increase is due to the change of the and policy of the Government in regard to 54,135,000 loan expenditure, which I will again refer to later. The loss of £579,060 on business undertakings is made up of a surplus of £174,800 in the transactions of the Post Office, and a deficit of £753,860 in connection with the Commonwealth railways. The net loss is £287,368 less than that of the previous financial year. The charge on the budget for administering the Territories of the Commonwealth is estimated to be £707,036, being an increase of £2,939 compared with last year. The payments to or for the States show a decrease of £1,507,703, compared with £ the actual expenditure of the previous 3,483,712 year. This decrease is partly due to the proposed amendment to the Eederal Aid 1,174,980 Roads Agreement to which I will later 496,756 make further referr uce. Revenue.

709,Mr Thompson,Does that take into,133,Public Debt At 30th June
710,""" Mr Theodore","No; it does notlast year. This increase is due to the higher rates for primage duty and sales tax. The anticipated revenue from direct taxation is £13,200,000, which is £5,452,179 below the revenue collected in 1930-31. The principal decrease is £3,784,374 in income tax, due to.the anticipated reduction in taxable incomes which must necessarily follow the financial depression which adversely affected commerce and trade throughout the whole of last financial year. It is anticipated that there will be a reduction of £958,598 in the revenue from land tax, mainly due to the reduced valuations of land. The revenue from estate duties is always diffidebt. cult to estimate, but it has been thought wise to budget for a decrease of £668,865, as compared with the actual receipts of the previous year. The other miscellaneous heads of revenue are expected to yield £3,835,000 as compared with £5,754,630 in last finanfor the receipt of reparation moneys. cial year, being a reduction of £1,919,630. Should, however, the plan be brought In the revenue of last year was included a non-recurring amount of £1,500,000, being accumulated income arising from liquidation of ex-enemy properties. On account of the concessions proposed in respect of interest on loans for soldier land settlement, the loss of revenue from this source will be £247,000. "" Estimated Deficit Submitted to Melbourne Conference. The deficit of the Commonwealth submitted to the Melbourne conference was estimated at £4,380,000, which is £796,300 less than the estimated deficit now arrived Add exchange at current at. The reasons for this departure from the conference estimate are as follow:Some of the reductions made will not operate for the full year. It was not possible, without hardship, to reduce war pensions by 20 per cent., as contemplated by the conference. The total reduction in war pensions and repatriation benefits is equal to 15.4 per cent, of the total pensions bill. From the experience of the year just closed, it is certain that the Post Office revenue will not reach the estimate submitted to the conference. The policy of the Government in regard to capital works involves charging to revenue, capital expenditure which, in previous years, was charged to loan. Mr Theodore. Hoover Plan. I desire to make some reference to the proposal made by the President of the United States that the payment of interest and principal on intergovernmental war debts as well as the payment of reparations should be postponed for one year. The British Government had previously agreed to suspend for two years the repayment of principal moneys' due under the funding arrangement of Australia's war debt, and it has now generously agreed to apply the principle enunciated by President Hoover to the interest on that As these proposals have not yet been finally accepted by all the governments concerned, it was thought wise to prepare the budget on the position as it stands at present, and provision is made-for paying the interest on our war debt as well as into operation, the relief to the Commonwealth budget during 1931-32 will be £4,028,000, so that the anticipated deficit of £5,176,300 ' will be reduced to £1,148,300. The benefit to the Commonwealth is arrived at as follows:£ £ Suspension of interest on war debt due to. the British Government . . 3,920,000 Add exchange at current rates ..' .. 1,190,000 5,110,000 Less suspension of reparations .. 830,000 rates 252,000 1,082,000 Net gain to the budget 4,028,00 0 Additions, New Works, and Buildings. Beference has been made to the difficulty, if not the impossibility, at the present time of obtaining loans to finance new works. In view of this position, the Government has considered it futile to bring down loan estimates, and has decided to charge the whole of the capital expenditure to revenue. Particulars of this proposed expenditure will be found in the estimates for additions, new works, and buildings. The expenditure on new works last fii.iaue.ial year wasf Provided from revenue Provided from loan .. 2,0(53,204 undertook to submit the matter to their The expenditure to be wholly' provided from revenue iu the current year is £829,077, a reduction of £1,234,187. Grants lo Slates. After carefully considering the relative collections on petrol refined in Australia. difficulties of the Commonwealth and the States, the Government has decided to provid.e for one year a special grant of £1,000,000 to South Australia, and to continue for 1931-32 the expired grant of £300,000 per annum to ""Western Australia. The grant to Tasmania will be continued at the existing rate of £250,000 per annum. Federal Aid Roads Agreement. The question of the amendment of the Federal Aid Roads Agreemeut has been the subject of considerable discussion at conferences between the Commonwealth and the States during the last eighteen mouths. Under the present agreement, which operated from the 1st July, 1926, the Commonwealth is obliged to provide £2,000,000 a year for ten years, and the States £1,500,000 a year for ten years. The States are also required to spend the money on the construction and reconstruction of approved roads. The obligations imposed on the States have proved so burdensome that they have requested relief from their contribution and greater freedom in the spending of the money. In view of the decline of approximately 50 per cent, in petrol imports, the Commonwealth has also found its obligation a much more serious burden than was contemplated in 1926. At a conference in February last it was resolved that the agreement be amended Agreement Bill, the Commonwealth Debt to provide that, as from 1st July, 1931, Conversion Bill, and 'the Financial the Commonwealth shall pay to the States Emergency Bill, which have already been a sum equal to 2-Jd. per gallon on all presented to Parliament, the following petrol cleared through the customs -for legislation will be necessary to give effect home consumption,; such sum to be apto the budget proposalsportioned among the States on the same basis as the £2,000,000 set out in the agreement.

The total amount available will be distributed to. the States in the same proportion as the £2,000,000 which was to have been provided under the original agreement. The States will be relieved of their contribution, and they will be free to spend the money ou any class of road work, including maintenance.

The task of bringing down the budget in the second week in July, particularly in times of momentous changes in financial policy, has prevented the presentation of the main Estimates, and the complete budget papers. I hope to be in a position to make these documents available within a fortnight, and, in the meantime, I am circulating such statements of accounts as will give a bird's eye view of the position of the finances of the Commonwealth. Australia and many other countries are passing through critical times. The outstanding causes of the trouble have been beyond the control of the Government. The effects of the external monetary system have been dogging our steps at every turn. All our attempts in the past twelve months to stimulate a recovery of trade, to maintain the stability and usefulness of our credit structure, to restore employment, and to secure to the workers and the primary producers their assured reward, have been frustrated by external events and influences. The Government recognizes that Australia cannot afford to let her finances drift into greater chaos while we helplessly await, during an indefinite period, for a change in world monetary policy, and an increase in commodity values. The Government has, therefore, undertaken a policy of internal financial rehabilitation which, though drastic in its incidence, is at any rate equitable in its effects upon the various sections of the community. The Government is convinced that, in the existing circumstances, it is adopting the most effective policy to restore the country to economic health, and confidently appeals to Parliament, and to the community in general, to assist patriotically the successful accomplishment of the complete plan. I move That the first item in the Estimates Additions, Now Works, Buildings, &c, under Air.

Tliis resolution, the purpose of which is to increase the primage duty with the object of obtaining additional customs revenue, is being submitted in accordance with the advice of the economic experts who were consulted in connection w i th the formulation of the plan for restoring the finances of the Oommonwealth. Hitherto primage duty has been imposed at 4 per cent, excepting on certain goods which were exempted from primage. The resolution provides for three classes of goods, v i z ( l ) goods exempt fro m primage; (2) goods subject to primage at 4 per cent.; and (3) goods subject to primage at 10 per cent.
