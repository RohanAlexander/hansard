Since King John affixed his seal to Magna Carta at Runnymede, would it be possible in your view for Australia's copy of the document to be restored to the Parliament if the new parliament house is erected at the lakeside? man has asked me a rather hypothetical question regarding the new parliament house. The matter he has raised is something that I would consider at the appropriate time. Mr J. R. FRASERI ask the Minister for the Interior: Was it the intention of the selling wheat at prices below the minimum Government when it made available a site for a restaurant within the Parliamentary triangle, and indeed constructed the building for this purpose, that the premises should be used for a business which would provide medium priced meals suitable for the needs of tourist families and others who visit this place and the precincts? Would the Minister care to make any statement about present developments on that site, and can he say whether any development is projected which will provide the type of facility that should be available to tourist families and others? ment provided for a kiosk-restaurant to be built in the vicinity of Parliament House, and this was in fact built by the National Capital Development Commission. The restaurant is now providing a full range of services. It provides morning and afternoon teas and light luncheons. By some chance I have a copy of the menu. Honourable members may be interested in the charges. The prices for light luncheons provided for tourists and others visiting the Parliament are comparable with prices charged elsewhere in establishments of this kind. For example, a sandwich containing ham or cheese is priced at 45c, a hamburger and chip potatoes at 50c, a frankfurter and bread roll at 45c, a meat pie and vegetables at 45c, and tea, coffee or soft drink at 20c. The kiosk-restaurant has been provided with a liquor licence so that it can give a full range of services to the residents of Canberra and to people visiting Canberra. One minor modification is being made so that people coming along in bus loads can pick up cups of tea, pies and sandwiches and take them away in the bus if they wish to do so. Minor modifications are being made to the building to permit easier access and so on. However, at this present time people can sit down and consume their pie and cup of tea in the surrounds of the kiosk if they so wish. directed to the Minister for Trade and Industry. Has he any knowledge of areport that United States. officials in Washington have claimed that France is fixed by the International Grains Agreement? If so, can the Minister say whether the report has any substance? allegation that the French have been selling wheat below the price fixed by the International Grains Arrangement. The truth of the matter is that wheat, before the institution of the Arrangement, was selling at prices below the minimum price provided in the Arrangement. Wheat is not traded on a day to day basis. It is quite common for parcels of wheat to be sold for forward delivery, and there was some consultation between the principal exporters to enable the trade to continue :n operation but to minimise what might be the outcome of sales for forward delivery at prices below the minimum of the Arrangement. A conference will take place in Canberra, I think next month, between the principal exporting countries to examine the operation of the Arrangement.

21,Mr Swartz,"The final decision regardsome operations are commencing in north Queensland. I had the pleasure yesterday of christening a new Twin Otter aircraft in my own city of Toowoomba in which region it will commence operations shortly. The thinking at the moment is that in high traffic density areas we may have a requirement for two pilots. The machine itself is designed to operate with one pilot but because of traffic complications we may require two pilots in certain localities. We are looking at this particular angle at the moment. I hope we will be in a position to give a decision in the next few weeks. for Air to reports that the Bloodhound surfuture at least equal to that which obtains face to air missile is to be withdrawn from in some other States? service within the next six months.

Whether to Australian companies requesting that they replace the Bloodhound, and the nature of surrender contracts which they have won the replacement, will be matters considered in open competition with other Australian in the context of the normal defence review. companies so that those contracts may be for Labour and National Service a question. I refer to his Department's latest monthly review of employment, with which the Minister is obviously very happy. Is he aware, however, that certain areas of unemployment remain, especially in Queensland where in real terms almost 2% of the work force is seeking employment and where nearly four people seek to obtain every vacancy available? As this situation is chronic and has not been relieved by the large amount of investment in certain regional projects, will the Minister undertake to investigate opportunities for employment in Queensland siderable variation in employment and migration of labour.

Is he aware that the last Australian National Line cargo the Northern Territory and, as the honourship bound from Brisbane to Darwin was unable to load about 900 tons of goods and left them on a Brisbane wharf? Will it be months before the next ANL ship proceeds from Brisbane to Darwin, to the great detriment of trade between Queensland and the Northern Territory? Have industrial unrest on the Darwin waterfront and resulting losses incurred by the ANL on voyages between Brisbane and Darwin been the main reasons for the inadequacy of this service?

The first is short term and the second is long term. In the long term perspective it is necessary, with increased volumes of goods being shipped out of and into Darwin, for the standard of port facilities to be continually improved. It is September? If so, could the Minister advise into this phase that an inquiry is being made amongst the relevant departments within the Commonwealth Government, each of which has some responsibility for the upgrading of the port. The second phase is relative to the short term implications not only as far as Queensland industry is concerned but also in terms tion is: No. of costs, as to which there have been repeated representations particularly from the honourable member for the Northern Territory who is naturally rather concerned at the impost on the people of the Northern Territory of the added freight charges resulting from the disruption to the service Graves Commission to remove from the provided by the Australian National Line. The normal turn-round time for B-class vessels operated by the ANL to Darwin is about 16 days. As a result of a series of Has this matter been satisfactorily negoindustrial disputes, many of which would appear to have been based on fairly insignificant issues, this time has been extended so that it now takes these vessels anything up to 36 days to turn round in port. This naturally has a direct effect on the frequency of the service available to the port of Darwin. It also has an effect on the cost of goods that are transported to and from Darwin. The effect is very pronounced not only on the people of Darwin but also on the other people of able member's question indicates, on the manufacturers and industrialists in Brisbane and in the other ports serviced by the Australian National Line. It is a matter of considerable concern to the Government. It is one which the people of the Northern Territory themselves can help to alleviate by directing the attention of those who are unnecessarily causing industrial unrest on the waterfront to the cost impost that they are producing for all the other people in the Darwin community.

Are the findings substantiated by the reports from the officers of HMAS 'Hobart'?

I also ask him for how long and for what countries the passport is valid and whether the Air Vice-Marshal has resigned his post in Rhodesia or has undertaken to do so. respond to the preamble that introduced the question. The essential part of the question is: Has there been a change in relation to Air Vice-Marshall Hawkins? He applied for an Australian passport. Whether he is entitled to an Australian passport depends on whether he is an Australian citizen. This had to be established. It was established that he was an Australian citizen and be was therefore given an Australian passport. The Leader of the Opposition asked in what countries the passport would be valid. I am unable to give him information with certainty but 1 can tell him that my expectation is that it was valid for all countries other than North Vietnam, as all passports issued at this stage are valid for all countries other than North Vietnam. for External Affairs a question relating to Australian aid to developing nations. In view of the necessity, which I think is well established, of providing assistance for developing nations and food for their rapidly growing populations, is the Minister convinced that our missions abroad have enough agricultural expertise? Is he convinced that our missions abroad are geared to provide expert advice and to persuade the government of any nation when necessary to take advantage of our own expertise in agricultural development and so improve the national growth in that important field? the honourable member for Angas seems to refer particularly to the section of our overseas economic assistance programme that is related to agricultural development. The procedure followed in a matter of this kind is that the receiving country, in discussion with our local embassy, makes known its needs and our local embassy reports to Canberra. In the appropriate branch of my Department the request for the particular form of aid is examined. If it is necessary to obtain expert advice of a technical kind we can expect cooperation from all Australian governmental agencies, both Commonwealth and State, and even private agencies. The normal action on receiving a proposal for some form of agricultural assistance is that the appropriate division of my Department would have recourse either to the Commonwealth agency, to the State governmental agency or to some other expert body, academic or otherwise, that might be able to advise on it. If the project were of a large kind quite often we would send an investigation team to examine the feasibility and the desirability of the project. Broadly speaking, I can assure the honourable member for Angas that 1 am satisfied we are in a position to investigate with reasonable technical and professional efficiency any request for agricultural aid. The projects of an agricultural kind that are now being followed have proved to be quite effective. his attention has been drawn to the efforts being made by Doulton Potteries (Aust.) Pty Ltd to take over the old, established Australian pottery company, R. Fowler Ltd. If so, is he aware that the source from which the finance is to be obtained is believed to contravene the principles laid down by the Treasurer for takeovers by overseas companies and, if successful, the takeover will give monopoly control of this important Australian manufacturing industry to overseas interests?

I think the principle of assistance to the States to alleviate the effects of drought is sound, but I suggest to tbe Prime Minister that he consider laying down some guide lines for the States in the disbursement of these funds.

57,Mr Chaney (Perth),"In accordanceNEW AND PERMANENT Debate resumed from IS August (vide page 289) on motion by Mr Gorton: That this House is of the opinion that the new and permanent Parliament House should be situated on the lakeside site. Upon which Mr Bryant had moved by way of amendment: That the words 'the lakeside site' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'Capital Hill'. subject being debated at the moment is the siting of the future permanent Parliament House. This is an important matter on which this House and the other place must make a decision. I have taken the opportunity not only to look at the sites now under consideration but also to study the documents presented to honourable members. One document is headed 'Special Report on the Site' and comes from the Joint Select Committee. It is not the report on alternative sites that we may have expected to have had before us. The document obviously favours the lake site, but I find some irregularities in it and I would like to mention them now. The argument has been advanced that if the new building is to be placed on Capital Hill, as I sincerely hope it will be, a certain amount of earthmoving work will be necessary. Within this one document we have two estimates. Within the document the estimate is made that it will cost between $2m and $4m to complete the earth works on the site on top of Capital Hill. In commenting on this particular aspect the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), I think it was, credited the Commission with saying that to level the hill would cost about $2 or $3m. It was suggested that this was the figure estimated by the commissioners themselves. The document that the Minister laid on the table last week quoted a sum of about $1.5m as the cost of levelling. It is obvious that there is some irregularity in these figures. IfI am any judge, all thosefiguresare wrong, as it would not be necessary to undertake so much earth moving work to establish a site for a new parliament house on Capital Hill. My second point relates to the actual lakeside site as shown in attachments to the document supplied to honourable members. The attachment concerned with traffic movements indicates the lake site as being a small area about SOO feet wide right beside the lake. It does not intrude into Parkes Place. However, on the next map, which relates to services, the lake site includes large areas of Parkes Place. This difference in size of the site is another irregularity in the document. If the house is to be constructed on the lake site an area 500 feet in width obviously would be insufficient for the purpose. I doubt whether there is a sufficiently large area by the lake for the new parliament house. Such a building would need to take in most of Parkes Place, if not all of it. There is no doubt about this. Let us consider the overall design of Canberra itself. Canberra was not intended to be a congested city but a spread out city a real Australian city. The lake has been developed, but it is of limited size in comparison with other Australian lakes, and every time a building is erected by its shores the lake appears to be smaller. It was never intended that there should be congestion of buildings in and around Parkes Place and in front of the present Parliament House. If the future parliament house is sited by the lake the area will become far too congested and the house will not be able to cater for what may be required of it in the future. Once a building is constructed close to a waterline we all know the results. Honourable members need think only of the situation in Sydney or Melbourne. When a building is placed near the waterline there is restricted traffic movement, no opportunity to expand, and recreation areas arc destroyed. This should not happen in an inland city like Canberra. I doubt whether many Australians would like to see the lakeside area occupied by masses of steel and concrete. Let us move away from the lake. This was the concept, in the original design of Canberra. It was intended that the parliament house should be away from the lake, although the proposed site originally was not Capital Hill but Camp Hill. I do not think any honourable member will dispute that. If the building is placed by the lake it will destroy the wonderful view that extends across the lake to Mount Ainslie where the magnificent Australian War Memorial building is located. I feel strongly about this matter. Once a decision is made and the building is constructed it will be there for all time; it",23,Waymouth Telephone Exchange Building Adelaide
58,Mr Hallett (Canning) [3.28],"Th ewill not be possible to alter it. So we must think this out and have regard to the overall position. If one examines the sites on Capital Hill and by the lake one realises that there are limitations to the lake site, including the limitation of area. It has been suggested that provision will be made 1 for car parking under the new and permanent parliament house. I understand that the building may have three basement floors. 1 am familiar with engineering problems connected with work below a water level, such as' would be involved if the house were to be placed by the lake. There would be difficulties in providing three basements. Of course, it can be done, because engineers can do almost anything these days; but extensive work would be involved in having a basement for car parking. The cars could not be dropped in; lifts would be necessary. Such provision could not be made in a limited area, but on Capital Hill there is ample space. The hill is virtually untouched, although a bulldozer seems to be doing a lot of work there at present. The hill: has an area of over 100 acres confined within State Circle. Surely this area can be reserved for the Parliament. After all, this national capital has been developed because of the existence of the Parliament here, and surely 100 acres can be retained on which to establish a parliament house and its necessary ancillary buildings. The hill is the site with suffici1 ent space to enable suitable development for a new and permanent parliament house. There is insufficient room by the lake. Surely we have had enough experience in other cities to cause us to move away from what will be a congested area, an area where a number of buildings still have to be constructed, including the High Court building. Yesterday it was suggested to me that if parliament house is located on the suggested site by the lake it will have to fit in with other buildings and must be of somewhat similar construction. This would not be necessary if it were built on Capital Hill. It could be a unique building. We could start with a clean slate and the design could be appropriate for an Australian parliament house. I first came to Canberra a few months after the present Parliament House was opened. I was a boy of 10 or 11 years of age. I remember sitting in the Speaker's chair and thinking Territory Committee might have been asked what a tremendous responsibility members for its views on this subject. When all is of Parliament had. Canberra was then an area of wide open spaces with few buildings and it obviously had tremendous potential for development without congestion. Today we are considering putting the permanent parliament house right beside the water, which will lead to congestion. It will be sandwiched between numerous other buildings and there will be no opportunity for expansion. If it is located on Capital Hill there will be room for expan1 sion and room in which to move. Frequently we see major development works undertaken and within a few years the developers looking for space to expand. We must learn a lesson from that, and we must do the right thing. We must leave ourselves room to develop a parliament house of which we will be proud and that can expand as required. This can be done only on Capital Hill. this debate with considerable pleasure because there is no more important aspect of the beautification of this great city than where the Federal parliamentary buildings are to be located. I cannot help but be somewhat critical of the haste with which the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House reached a decision on the site. 1 would have thought that before the report which we are now considering was brought before the Parliament we would have had the benefit of a report from those parliamentarians, including yourself, Mr Speaker, who travelled the world investigating parliamentary buildings. I agree that it may not have been the concern of those members of Parliament to say where the parUament house should be sited but I see 10 reason why this important matter of the siting of the parliament house should have been brought before the Parliament at such short notice. To say the least, the Government's action in this matter has been very discourteous to the members who travelled overseas to study this matter. The Government has acted with undue haste, having regard to the importance of the subject, the likely expenditure involved and the length of time for which the ultimate building will stand. I feel also that the Australian Capital",24,Parliament House Site
59,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [3.39],"I join insaid and done, that Committee has a responsibility to investigate matters referred to it by the Minister for the Interior. I understand that on one occasion, before I was a member of the Committee, it wanted to look into the matter of a new parliament house and was told that it could do so if it wished. But this was not possible because under its constitution the Committee may consider only matters referred to it by the Minister. I would think that in a matter as important to the national capital as a new parliament house the views of the Australian Capital Territory Committee might have been obtained. When the vote is taken on the motion now before the House the Government may regret that it did not refer this matter to the Australian Capital Territory Committee. Anybody concerned with the development body seeing it for the first time knows of Canberra and with the beauty of this immediately what it is. The Americans have great city must have more than a passing ensured that their Capitol building will stand interest in the siting of the building in out. It is on a hill for all to see. which the Parliament will function.

In my choice A parliament house erected in Canberra on of Capital HillI am in notable company, Capital Hill would be something of which because in 1923 the Right Honourable all Australians could be proud. As a site William Morris Hughes said: Tbe building on Capital Hill, whatever it be, will dominate the landscape and be the most prominent architectural feature in the layout of the city. Having regard to the architectural features hill are very good sites, but even a casual of Rome, Athens, Washington and all the other great capital cities of the world, the most imporglance will show that as the years pass the tant building in Canberra should be that where lakeside will become exceedingly congested. Parliament sits. Therefore the dominating site at I do not know what kind of building Canberra should be utilised for Parliament House. would be erected on the lakeside but I do Those words are as true today as they were not think it could possibly have the 45 years ago. Anybody who has surveyed splendour of a building on Capital Hill. As the two sites-the lakeside and the hillwill agree that both are good sites and do not want to spend very much and if you quite the best available in this capital city. intend to erect a building to serve the The views expressed by Mr Hughes were Parliament for only 40 or 50 years, by all endorsed in 1955 by the Senate Select Commeans erect it on the lakeside. But if you mittee on the Development of Canberra. want something splendid and majestic, build The same proposal was put forward by the on Capital Hill. Anybody who has examined architect of this great city. Walter Burley the lakeside will agree that it is a beautiful Griffin said that the parliament house should spot, but if we build the parliament house be on Camp Hill. At least he envisaged there we will also be encroaching on the erecting the parliament above the level of foreshores of the lake. The cry of people the lake. There is ample evidence that those who have been associated with Canberra and its development desire to have their parliament house on the most eminent site in the capital. Anybody who has visited Washington will agree that one of the outstanding features of that great city is its Capitol building. It is erected on a spot where it really stands out, as our parliament house should. The Capitol building is really American. It has splendour and majesty. It is undoubtedly the centre of government, available for all to see. There is no more spectacular sight in Washington than to see the many thousands of tourists streaming from cars and buses to enter the Capitol building. It is a wonderful building. AnyAnother remarkable building so far as for the parliament house, Capital Hill leaves little if anything to be desired. As1 have said, both the lakeside and the one honourable member has said, if you all over Australia is that the foreshores of the harbours and rivers on which our capital cities stand have been taken away from the people for building purposes. If you build the parliament house on the lakeside you will deny to the people of this city and to visitors the splendour of a section of the lake. The honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) has circulated amongst honourable members somenotes in which he deals with the problem of traffic as it affects the two sites. He points out that even cisco the parking areas are underground. I today there is traffic congestion on the lakeimagine that if the new parliament house side. There is a great amount of activity in the area. By 1980, when the population of Canberra reaches about 250,000, there will not be as much space on the lakeside as there is now. The lakeside will be very congested and probably not the site for a parliament house befitting a capital such as this. At the invitation of the Minister for the the National Capital Development CommisInterior( Mr Nixon) I and other honourable sion. I think those who prepared the submembers went ro Capital Hill recently, from missions have been reasonably objective.

I was ment that the ring road will have any effect very impressed by the remarks of some on the choice of Capital Hill as the site for honourable members, and particularly by Ihe new parliament house. Traffic is said to present a problem so far as Capital Hill is concerned, but, if the parliament house is not erected there, we have been told, an art gallery or some other structure will be erected on the hill. building is to go there. modern days, in cities such as San Franwere to be on Capital Hill and the designers decided to lop 50 feet off the hill and build upwards 50 feet, provision for parking associated with the Parliament could easily be made under the new building. I cannot see that there would be the same traffic congestion on the hill site, if the ring road is constructed, as there would be at the lakeside site. 1 do not criticise the submissions that have been made by Mr Clmrlcs Jones-If the new parliament house were situated on the hill, they those made by the honourable member for",25,Parliament House Site

No honourable member listening to this debate could have failed to be impressed by the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck), who said that he had ridden or walked over most of this Territory. I think he, the honourable member for Wills and others who have taken an interest in Canberra and have favoured the hill site have not done so for political reasons. Rather, they have adopted their view because the placing of a new parliament house on the hill site would give the real imprimatur of splendour to this city. They believe this splendour can be achieved by the placing of a magnificent building on a hill site where it will stand out. the site may be changed now may inconAll kinds of arguments will be advanced in relation to aspects such as area and space. I believe the document presented by the NCDC indicates that the hill site will be better than the lakeside site, and in every way will enable the necessary facilities to be provided. In addition, the hill site affords plenty of space for development. It is said that the new parliament house may have to last for 300 or 400 years. That is a pretty fair time to have to look ahead. I believe that the question of cost does not enter into a project which is to last for such a length of time. I am not very concerned about the amount to be spent on a building which is to serve for this time. We have spent $8m on the National Library building. I believe that we should not stint our expenditure on a building that will symbolise the very reason fpr the existence of Canberra. This is especially so having in mind what a building such as this will indicate to the people of this country and particularly of Canberra, for here we are building a city to which all Australians will look. I believe that the new parliament house might be dedicated to the soldiers of all wars. In this way it would be made a national memorial to them as well as a place symbolic of a national democratic institution. I do not wish to delay the House any further. As one who is interested in Canberra and all it implies, I come down on the hill site for the reasons I have mentioned. I believe that the placing of the new parliament house on Capital Hill would give 1 the final touch of splendour to the Territory. Undoubtedly in the next IS or 20 years Canberra will become one of the really great cities of the world and will attract thousands of visitors to this country. All Australians will look with pride at the new parliament house with all of its splendour an appointments. I am sorry if the view taken by many honourable members that the new parliament house should be placed on the hill site upsets the plans of the National Capital Development Commission. The Commission cannot really be blamed if things have gone wrong at this stage, because in 1958 the lake site was decided upon. I have always supported the hill site privately and publicly. The fact that venience those responsible for the planning of the parliamentary triangle. But I believe, looking ahead, that it is advisable to budd the new parliament house on Capital Hill. It is for this reason that I support those in Parliament who take this view. Never have I been amongst so many varied and mixed supporters. Friends are coming from far and near and friends are leaving for distant places. I think it is good that members of the Parliament have acted in this way. They have given a clear expression of views and all who have spoken, I believe, have done so with sincerity. ThoughI do not believe that this will be the most momentous decision that has ever been made and though I do not subscribe to the views of those who say that we do not want a parliament house at all and of others who do not care what sort of building it is, I take the view that the new parliament house ought to be the greatest building in the land. I believe it ought to be on the finest site in Canberra. It should be majestic and splendid, with panoramic views and all the necessary appointments. In every way it should be a building of which we all can be proud, ft is for these reasons that 1 support the amendment. cinated to hear the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) giving us the great benefit of his extensive travels overseas.

63,Mr Hughes (Parkes) [3.56],"I was fashonourable members who have listened to this debate have done so with some degree of fascination. All sorts of arguments have been used and the manner of their presentation has been almost infinitely varied. The puckish sprite of Capital Hill, the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), engaged the House in his humorous banter. His chief argument in favour of the bill as opposed to the lakeside site appeared to be some deep, lurking fear that he might be beset by a mob of 100,000 demonstrators. He said that if this happened he would take to the water. Some of us may have wondered why he has not done so before. I suppose he had in mind the possibility that one day the 100,000 members of the Australian Workers Union might vent their anger on him. That is a matter for speculation. I believe the new parliament house should be on the lakeside site, and I shall vote accordingly when we come to a division. My friend, the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Kilien), says that I surprise him. He never ceases to astonish me. 1 am a believer in the lakeside site for a number of reasons. A lot of these reasons, I suppose, are pretty subjective. Various speakers have properly emphasised the self evident fact that both sites are very good ones. On balance and maybe for subjective reasons, I come down firmly in favour of the lakeside site. I am not one of the hill tribe; 1 belong to the plain. I have heard it said in this debate that parliament house should be set apart, as it were, in some position of magnificent splendour. I think that if we are looking for symbolism that is an odd view. Parliament belongs to the people. The people dp not live in splendid places. that would be my luck. But I do not. Parliament belongs to the people and the people work and live mainly in the market place. I agree that parliament house should be in a central position. For my part-her e again one is being intensely subjective, I suppose-the eminently suitable central position is down on the shore of the lake, opposite the commercial centre of the city, near many residences. That position of prominence, if we can overcome our genius for permanent improvisation, will hit -the eye of the traveller on his arrival at the heart of Canberra. I think this is important. We have a symbolic juxtaposition of the centre for the Parliament and the Executive and the centre for the judiciary. The three arms of government are the Executive, the Parliament and the judiciary, and all these arms will be placed together in what I would describe as appropriate juxtaposition and proximity. in no time. for Mitchell says that it will' become a tangled mess in no time. I am not speaking about his arguments, to which I listened with interest. I think his interjection is an exaggeration which does not bear a great deal of objective examination. The present Parliament House occupies 6.5 acres and the gardens occupy 20 acres. There is an area of 47 acres available down on the lakeside, and to suggest that there will be overcrowding is, to my mind, a mere matter of exaggeration and forensic flourishing, and I do not think that we should have any more of it. I was fascinated by one of the arguments resorted to by my friend, the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfred Kent Hughes), to whose speech I listened with very considerable interest. He resorted to a biblical quotation to support his view that the hill was the appropriate site. He quoted the following words from the Bible: T will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help'. I should have thought, with all respect to him, that he was imputing much less cynicism to our peers who elect us than they in fact possess, if he thought that those would be the sentiments of the Australian electorate. Just imagine an elector saying: '1 will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help'. Let us be frank: I do not think that is what many hard-headed Australians tend to think about members of this Parliament. We all assert 1 that we try to do our best, but whether that is what the people think of us is, perhaps, open to question. I would have thought that the dangers of building the new parliament house on the hill are amply illustrated by a quotation which I shall give to the House",28,Parliament House Site

I know that the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Kilien) is not of a poetic disposition, but nevertheless, at the risk of wearying him, 1 shall read the quotation. blind? mentary remark from the honourable member for Maribyrnong. 1 thought he had much more charity in his heart. The quotation is as follows: Others apart sat on a hill retir'd.

To return for a moment to a note of seriousness, I do not think that looking into the future, and indeed looking at the present, we ought to regard Parliament as a place which should be set apart on a lofty eminence. I think it should be down on ground level. I think it is desirable that it be close to the High Court of Australia, which it will be if it is eventually sited on the lakeside, and close lo the Australian National Library, which is a very significant centre of learning. I think that inevitably one's views on this question are, at bottom, intensely subjective, but I would claim some pardon for the subjectivity of my views because, after all, one knows that if one votes for the hill one is ignoring the great mass and body of expert opinion. I do not believe that experts should be blindly followed by anyone, least of all by members of Parliament. Unquestionably, at times there are dangers in following expert opinion. I find myself in the position that we have two sites, each of which possesses undoubted virtues. I have symbolical concepts of my own that predispose me in favour of the lakeside site. I think that when a question of this kind is fairly evenly balanced one would not be acting safely if one were to overthrow the preponderant balance of expert opinion. For those reasons I propose to vote in favour of the lakeside site. Whilst it is not my desire to take up the time of the House unnecessarily, I feel that as a member of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, whose recommendation we are now debating, 1 am duty bound to express my views on the matter before us. I hasten to add that I assure honourable members that I will not take more than 5 or 6 minutes to do so. First, 1 desire to put the record straight regarding the hurried Committee meeting which was held on Tuesday evening, 13th August 1968. It has been suggested during this debate that at this meeting, from which some members were unavoidably absent, a report from the National Capital Development Commission on the site of the new parliament house was accepted for presentation to Parliament. The true fact of the matter is that the Committee made its decision on the site on 28th November 1967-ove r 8 months ago-and that the meeting on Tuesday, 13 th August, was for the sole purpose of considering the presentation to Parliament of the recommendation made by the Committee in November regarding the site for the new parliament house. Having, I hope, cleared that matter up, I hasten to confess that I am a complete layman in the fields of town planning, traffic engineering, surveying, etc., as I suspect are most, if not all, members of the Committee and in fact of this House. Accordingly, the opinions I formed on the site for the new parliament house were arrived at only after I had thoroughly inspected the three sites available, listened to the best available experts in their particular fields and noted their replies to a long session of cross-examination by all members of the Committee and finally to the views of the individual members of tlie Committee. Having reached that stage I felt better equipped to make a decision, and 1 did so in favour of the lakeside site. Now, after further study and consideration of the situation I can find no valid reason why I should change my mind. Briefly, I cannot support the Camp Hill site^-no r can any member of the Committee-o n the score that it appears that the present Parliament House would remain to be used as a meeting place for interstate and international conferences, and",29,Parliament House Site

72,Mr Birrell (Port Adelaide) [4.7],"as such it would be impracticable and undesirable to construct the new parliament house directly behind this building. In my view, the Capital Hill site has many disadvantages. It is in the centre of a major traffic island and the Forrest side of the site is surrounded by domestic buildings. After the levelling out of the site, it is my belief, the present House would almost completely obstruct the view from the War Memorial. But more importantly, any further expansion would have to be located lower down on the hill and the provision for parades, demonstrations, etc., would be very limited indeed. The lakeside site, to my mind, is a very fine area for a parliament house. It would be far more acceptable and less segregated than if the parliament house was situated on Capital Hill. It is close to the new National Library which ultimately will house some 10 million volumes, and a tunnel access from the Library to the permanent parliament house is to be provided on the lakeside if the lakeside site is preferable. Finally-and this is of the utmost importance-it has been estimated that over 100,000 people could assemble in front of a new lakeside parliament house on great occasions such as ANZAC Day, and a private area could be provided on the lakeside site of the building as at Westminster. I. desire to conclude on this note: Prior house. The fact that it may take up to 8 to the commencement of this debate, I years to complete the building and the was of the belief that among the members further fact that it is planned to stand as of this House there was not one who in the permanent parliament house for at least civilian life was a town planner, a traffic 4 centuries or 5 centuries are matters which, engineer or a surveyor. However, since this I think, cannot justify any haste in making discussion has been in progress, solicitors, a judgment on this matter. bank officials, doctors, school teachers, union officials and business managers apparently have become town planners overthat this matter would be brought before night. This is peculiar to me, coming from it. The report of the Select Committee on men who, in the past, have always held the New and Permanent Parliament House the view strongly that if one desires to on the siting of the new and permanent make a correct decision on any subject parliament house was received only last outside one's own particular field, one Wednesday afternoon-that is to say, the should consult with and, if in any doubt, afternoon prior to the commencement of be guided by the views of the best available this debate. There cannot be any reason experts on the issue confronting one. In an effort to clarify this point, let me programming and preparation for the say I am certain that the honourable memnational gallery complex is the reason and ber for Moreton would describe as an utter the only reason that we can see for this fool anyone who went to the local baker urgency. or butcher seeking legal advice. 1 ask the honourable member for Bowman (D' Gibbs) whether he would recommend * town planner to a person in need of medical advice. I shudder to think what would have happened to any young infantry officer under the command of the honourable member for Chisholm if that young officer had disagreed with and spoken out against any recomendations or decisions made by company officers in charge of other sections of the force under his command. I can well imagine what my old friend and colleague, the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), would have had to say when he was secretary of a great union if a section of his members came along with proposals on how to run the union which were prepared for them by people with no knowledge of the trad? union movement. This is in reality how those in favour of the Capital Hill site have made up their minds. For those few reasons, I wish to make my position clear. I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) and I hope lhat it will be carried. Deputy Speaker, my main reason for entering this debate is to raise my objection to the undue haste in which Parliament has been asked to express judgment on the site for the new and permanent parliament The Parliament has had little real notice for this haste. Tbe desire of the National Capital Development Commission to begin",30,Parliament House Site
73,Mr Stokes (Maribyrnong) [4.14],"M rTn retrospect, the history of the site of the permanent parliament house is well known, and has been well covered during this debate. But1 ask honourable members to look at some of the happenings since the decision was taken to erect the new building. There was no clear cut decision on where the site was to be. The then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, had indicated a preference for the lakeside site. The land was levelled and certain initial .preparatory work was undertaken. Then a decision was taken as to the siting of the new National Library. The erection of the National Library in reasonably close proximity to a new parliament house on the lakeside tended towards establishing a fait accompli regarding the selection of the lakeside site. The town planner-the expertwho was brought out to advise on this matter was Sir William, now Lord Holford. He was Westminster oriented. This was another indication of the trend towards accepting the movement to the lakeside site as a fait accompli. Over several years we have heard very little but a few minority rumblings from the preponderance of those who are in favour of the Capital Hill site. Now the National Capital Development Commission has an urge to get on with the national gallery complex. Whether it is that the Capital Hill site has been freed virtually from an option for its use as a site for a future parliament building or not, the NCDC is looking for some definite decision on this point. The Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) quite rightly look the view that some expression of opinion should be sought from the Parliament in this regard. So, the Prime Minister submitted the motion which we are debating now. Also, he was the man who advocated lhat we should have a free vote on this question and then secured the accord of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) to this proposal. What are the issues that are involved? If our expression of opinion does not favour the lakeside site-w e have been asked for expression of opinion on the lakeside sitedoes it mean that we will lose our option on this site? Will it become available to the NCDC? Does this area lend itself to the erection of a national gallery complex or does it not? Will the NCDC have to find another site? These are all questions that nobody has attempted to answer. I presume that our option over the Capital Hill site will still stand even if the motion moved by the Prime Minister is defeated and the amendment proposed to that motion by the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) is accepted. It is my opinion that insufficient evidence on which to base a judgment is before the Parliament. The information that we have received by way of a special report from the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House relative to the advantages of the lakeside site against the Capital Hill site is supported by a roneoed report from the National Capital Development Commission. The Joint Select Committee was not appointed to consider the question of the site and of the siting of the permanent parliament house. This matter was not within its terms of reference. The fact that it did so was based on an indication made to it by the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, who himself had indicated his preference quite openly. Even then, the decision of the Joint Select Committee on the site was not unanimous. I again make the point that we did not receive the reports of the National Capital Development Commission and the Joint Select Committee until last Wednesday afternoon immediately before this debate commenced. How do people outside this special committee, which has specialised knowledge, amplify their own knowledge in order to make a judgment? Do they simply view the ground area by going up to Capital Hill, standing there on their flat feet looking around at the panorama, or by going down to the lakeside and doing the same thing? A bus was made available for this purpose at lunch time on Thursday last, a lunch time already restricted due to the opening of the National Library. What real indication did this ground level view of the surrounding panorama give? How do we visualise what the building will be like when viewed from the outside if we have no knowledge of the type of building to be constructed, the number of storeys it will have and whether it will be circular or rectangular? This is something of which we should have some idea. Why can we not defer action until we get two or three alternative possible designs which can be illustrated by artists, models or photographic projection? This would occasion little expense and not very much delay and would be well justified if it helped us to obtain the right answer. The 1966 report of the National Art Gallery Committee of Inquiry reads: The Committee believes that the need for an approval to begin soon is urgent. The present building is erected there will be two buildcollection is inadequately housed and cannot be ings similar in size and both of neo-classical put on permanent display; its further development design, one on each side of the proposed is not practicable without an assured prospect on housing; and of course buildings of this size parliamentary building on the lake site. and quality cannot be made ready for use in much Surely this will restrict the design of -.ny under 4 years from the date of approval for new parliament house on this sjte, oecause planning.

I turn to the minutes of the Joint Select parliamentary Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House and to the reply made by just to obtain water reflection. I would like Sir John Overall to a question posed by to see two chambers provided with a third tbe President of the Senate. The President functional chamber in the centre where asked Sir John Overall whether the design joint meetings could be held and where for a building on Capital Hill would be the Parliament could be opened, as in New basically much the same as for a building Delhi.

77,Dr Patterson,"That is what I think that 1 do not know sufficient from a technical point of view to enable me to make a decision. I intend to vote purely from a subjective point of view. I support the hill site. The essential theme of this debate is the site of the new parliament house. Up to the present time two suggestions have been made-on e favouring the lakeside site and the other favouring the hill site. There is nothing to prevent some honourable member from suggesting a further site if he wishes to do so. 1 want to state here and now that I am in sympathy with the honourable members for Scullin( Mr Peters) and Watson( Mr Cope), because I have always argued in this place that there must be priorities for the expenditure of public moneys and to my mind a new parliament house is not different from any other project. The honourable member for Scullin spoke about slums in Melbourne. I know nothing about slums in that city, nor do I know anything about the slums in Sydney. But I can speak about the ravages of drought in many of our northern areas where money is needed to provide water resources. This does not mean that I am opposed to the construction of a new parliament house. It does not mean that I am opposed to the concept of a national capital. AllI say is that I believe in priorities and that as the construction of a new parliament house is another project involving public expenditure it should be closely scrutinised in relation to other priorities. We should be given some indication as healthy. However, I am very concerned at to when the new parliament house is to the inconsistencies of fact put forward not be built. When we vote on this matter, only by honourable members from both the result should not be regarded as being sides of the House but by the authorities the final decision if the new parliament who have provided us with information. I house is not to be constructed within, say, suggest that this decision is too important the next 10 years. Many things could for us to make at a time when there is a happen in that time. As I said before, I lack of clarity in the basic facts on which generally do not support the principle of we are asked to base an opinion. This a free vote. The only reason why the decision should not be made in haste. It Government should allow a free vote on could well be said that this project has been this matter is if the two sites are almost under consideration for ages. We have identical from the technical point of view known of decisions made by the Cabinet -that is, if the technical problems assoin the past. But now, when there is full ciated with the hill site are almost the interest in all the details, not sufficient same as those of the lake site. We are details are available to enable us to form being asked to express our opinions as to an opinion. where we, individually, would like the new parliament house to be built. This is what I am doing. I am expressing an opinion this debate as it develops. The first is the purely on subjective grounds. I appeal to the honourable members for Scullin and Watson, who said that they will not vote on this issue because they do not think a new parliament house should be constructed, to reconsider their attitude. I myself do not believe that a new parliament house should be constructed now and I would vote against such a proposal. I have always said in this place that very heavy expenditure of public funds should be based on priorities, and at the present time. I do not think that a new parliament house is a top priority project. This does not mean that I do not believe a new parliament house should never be constructed which, I believe, is what the honourable members for Scullin and Watson said. The decision before us-the only matter on which we can vote at the moment-is as to whether we believe that, if a new parliament is built at some time in the future, it should be built on the lakeside site or on the hill site. I ask the honourable members for Scullin and Watson to reconsider their attitude. I ask them to cast their votes. Frankly, I think they are hill men. I think they should cast a vote and should support those who intend to vote for the new parliament house to be built on the hill. outset, to avoid suspense, I support the motion for the future parliament house to be built on the lakeside site. I am not concerned about the divergence of opinion that has appeared in this debate. I think it is Two things seem to be emerging from concern about the haste in which we are",34,Parliament House Site
78,Mr England (Calare) [4.38],"A t thedealing with the matter. The second, which I am pleased to note, is an acknowledgment by so many that the private member who has not, and does not profess to have, the skills possessed by the gentlemen who made the decisions that have been put before us, must have a very good reason before he rejects the opinions of those people. Some of us in this House are very well acquainted with the situation and have been for some considerable time. Some have had ample opportunity to travel around the area and see these sites, and have been closely associated with development here. I have probably had more opportunity than most others to become acquainted with the situation. For one reason I travel to Canberra by road instead of by air. I have been doing this for the past 8 years and I have travelled around these sites and have come to know them. I have also been a member of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory for a number of years. I admit that that Committee has no executive authority in the matter before us, but at least it has studied traffic patterns and the general growth of tbe city. The members of that Committee know what is intended for the future. I would like to see this debate adjourned. do so. This is the way in which material is I do not want the House to procrastinate coming to us and if the debate goes on we and put the matter off indefinitely simply will receive more. because we cannot make a decision. IfI am forced to a decision now I will vote in information given to us by different favour of the motion. I am merely putting authorities.

What about the Executive? Will the Executive be housed in the building? I have not heard what is intended in this connection. What area of gardens will be provided? We have here now sporting facilities that some of us use. There are tennis courts, a bowling green and squash courts. What provision is to be made for such amenities as these? What public facilities will there be? I think we should have some more precise information on these matters before we cast our final vote. We should have time to consider the abundance of material on the subject that has been prepared. A good deal of material has been put out for a long time and if we had been doing our job we would have studied that material. But, as the honourable member Maribyrnong said, the report of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House came to us only on Wednesday and we were expected to debate this subject on the Thursday. Further information came from the Minister for the Interior( Mr Nixon) during the debate. TodayI received more material from the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant), who moved the amendment. I have not read it because I have not had time to There are discrepancies between items of It has been estimated that approximately 50 feet require to be taken from Capital Hill to of between 20 feet and 35 feet at the top the hill and fills of up to 40 feet in depth would or 40 feet. If we can carry out the Snowy Mountains scheme we are certainly capable of handling this job. But taking 50 feet off the top of a hill makes a quite substantial 1 difference to its appearance from other points and to the view that can be obtained from it. I mention the difference in the figures in the two documents not to show any engineering problem but merely to give an example of the inconsistencies in the information supplied and on which we are asked to make a decision. Are all honourable members well briefed on future traffic arrangements for this city? Are they acquainted with the ring road which has been approved by the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory? The arrangements that are being made are quite substantial and will be quite satisfactory for some time. But we can all see how narrow are some of the streets which were provided when this capital' city was first designed and built. It was thought then that they would handle the future traffic, but some of them ought to be either closed off or considerably widened. De we understand the tremendous traffic complications brought about, firstly, by the lake running right through the middle of the city and having only two bridges. Admittedly there may be more at a later time. Then the manner in which the suburbs are developing causes tremendous traffic problems, and these problems are quite considerable in the area around Capital Hill. Traffic going in the east-west direction and in the northby another honourable member. To my south direction moves through that area. 1 am not concerned about traffic noise causing any problem in the new parliament house. The suggestion that it will do so is so much poppycock. Modern facilities could overcome any problem of that nature. But1 do think we should consider the problems of access and of traffic development before we make a decision. What do we work on in making up our minds? Lord Holford was a professor of town and country planning at the University of London. He is planning consultant to the Corporation of London, which is no mean city. He is a man of some stature. He came here at the request of the Government. I would like to read a few remarks of his because they are wePl worth repeating. He pointed out that Camp Hill was now unsuitable for the new parliament house because of the present Parliament House being in this position. Then he made some further reference to the 'Houses of Parliament', which was the phrase he used, and the report of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House contains this information: Holford said that they would be 'Symbolically and actually out of place' on Capital Hill. He believed that Parliament was an active democratic institution which should be housed in the forum and not on the hill top and would be more satisfactory in the centre of the main land axis than at one end of it. This brings me fo a remark by the honourable member for Bowman (Dr Gibbs) who, I think, made an excellent speech. One does not necessarily have to agree with his conclusions when conceding that he made an excellent speech. He drew attention to three aspects-symbolism , practicability and aesthetics. He said, and 1 hope I quote him correctly, that the majority of the people of Australia put tbe concept of free parliamentary democracy on something of a pinnacle. I am naive enough to agree with him. I think this is good; but the fact that we put democracy on a pinnacle does not necessarily mean that we must put our parliament house on a pinnacle. Nor can I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) who said that the city of Canberra was made for the Parliament. That has been repealed mind the city of Canberra was not made for the Parliament. It was made as the national capital of the Australian people. The Commonwealth Parliament must play its important part, but it is not the be-all and the end-all of the Australian capital. I just cannot agree with the statement that it is. We could also say that history, tradition and the achievements of the past are part of the national capital and we should pay attention to them. This is the concept in the design of the city. The history of the people and their part in war is represented at one end of the axis and we have a blank space at the other end. It is intended that in this blank space we place something to represent our achievements in peace. We should pay a lot of attention to this and we should show a little respect for our forebears, who put us in our present position. A phrase used by Sir Robert Menzies has stuck with me. He said that the Parliament should be in the stream of the people, and I think it should be. Let me carry on from Lord Holford's report. The National Capital Development Commission was the next body to approve of the lakeside site. It is all very well to say Advice on hydrology came not only from that this is a concept of the Commission, but it was the submission of Lord Holford, approved by the National Capital Development Commission and the National Capital Planning Committee. Who are these people? Do they have a civil service outlook? The honourable member for Fremantle believes that they have such an outlook, because he said that officers of the Commission have absolutely a civil service concept of Parliament, so they want the new parliament house down on the lake. But the Commission was not involved in this decision alone. Lord Holford first made the recommendation, the Commission and the National Capital Planning Committee adopted it, Cabinet decided on the site and the Joint Select Committee of the Parliament adopted the recommendation for the lakeside site. I understand that the vote of the Committee was 11 to 3 in favour of the lake site. The honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) mentioned the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. That Committee has no say in the choice of a site, but it is interesting to note that 3 of the 4 members of the Committee in this chamber have expressed a preference for the lake site. The other member, the honourable member for Grayndler, favours the amendment. So here is another group whose members in this HouseI cannot answer for the Senate-favou r the lake site. Who are the people in the National Capital Development Commission and the National Capital Planning Committee? I wish 1 had time to go through the list of members, but I am afraid that T will be short of time. However, the list is worth considering. I have a list of the names and qualifications of the advisers on the central areas leading to or associated with the acceptance of the lakeside site for the Houses of Parliament. It starts with Lord Holford, who is Professor of Town and Country Planning at the University of London and Planning Consultant to the Corporation of London. I notice that Mr and Canberra. Walter Bunning is on this list. He was responsible for the design of the National Library. The list includes town planners, architects and specialists of that type who come from Australia, Great Britain and the United States of America. The advisers on traffic include consulting engineers practising in London, Melbourne, Canberra, Chicago Washington and Sydney. Surely there must be some competence there. the Commonwealth Department of Works but also from the University of New South Wales and the Snowy Mountains Authority. Advice was also given on geology and other matters. The Chairman of the National Capital Planning Committee is Sir John Overall. The New South Wales Government very quickly took him down to Sydney and asked him to produce an answer for the problem of the Rocks area. His recommendations have been accepted almost unanimously and are regarded as a nice balance between the preservation of history and the development of the modern concept of a new city. The list of advisers includes town planners, engineers and architects who are practising, teaching or acting in a consulting capacity. Sir Daryl Lindsay is included in the list. 1 hope nobody tries to tell him that he espouses some civil service concept. The list includes the National Capital Development Commission.

I hope that if this debate continues, honourable members will have an opportunity to look at the qualifications of the men who advised on this matter. They favoured the lakeside sit«. To disagree with the views of these town and country planners, engineers, traffic experts, architects, even economists and fellow parliamentarians, we must be very sure of our ground. To put our views ahead of the views of these specialists we must have very substantial evidence to show that they mulled the job that they were given. I do not have that evidence. I would have appreciated more time to go into this subject in detail, but if the question is put to the vote now I come down unhesitatingly on the side of the motion. I favour the lakeside site. me say at once that 1 am for the hill and not the lake. One should not over emphasise the importance of the site of the parliament house or of the parliament house itself. Some honourable members in the course of this debate have referred to Brasilia. This shows that much more than a good M.T.P.I., F.I.L.A., parliament house is needed in order to have a good Parliament. At the same time, the outward form of the parliament house is not unimportant, symbolically, because often the spirit is reflected in the outward M.I.M.E., form. As the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Hughes) said this afternoon, it is true that we approach this matter in a very subjective way. I do not deny that. I suppose that ever since, as a small boy at school, I read Horace Annesley VachelPs book 'The Hill' I have been rather for the hill than the plain. P.P. One honourable member in the debate last week quoted the psalmist David, who said: I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help. This is not unimportant. When the psalmist thought of the aid of God, he lifted his eyes up to the hill; he did not turn them down to the foggy bottom. This is perhaps symbolic. Again, tbe poet looking for the seat of freedom said: Of old sat Freedom on the heights, A.R.I.B.A., A.R.A.I.A., The thunders breaking at her feet. He put freedom on tbe height, again not at foggy bottom. We should remember that Jerusalem is built on a hill and that the cities of the plain were Sodom and Gomorrah. Again we should remember that the Eternal City, Rome, was built on seven hills. It was not built on the banks of the Tiber, a muddy river.",35,Parliament House Site
79,Mr Turner (Bradfield) [4.58],"LetToday1 received an interesting telegram from a friend who said: Am hoping that interesting geological feature known as the unconformity on Capital Hill can be preserved. I can imagine no better way of preserving unconformity in the Parliament than to insist on putting it on Capital Hill, and this is highly to be desired. I do not press this as a great argument, but admit that it is subjective to turn one's eyes to the hills rather than to the hollows. Capital Hill is high and therefore conspicuous. It is the most conspicuous point available to us for the parliament house. How important is Parliament House in the context of Canberra? It has been said by some other speakers that it is not the 'be all and end all of Canberra'. I think that phrase was used, but actually that is not quite true. If it were not for the Parliament being here there would be no Canberra. The plain fact is that uniquely Canberra was built to provide a place for the Parliament and Parliament is therefore the central feature of this place. If it is not the 'end all' it at least is the 'be all' the new parliament house in the middle. of Canberra, which, as I said, would not be here but for Parliament. Therefore the position that the parliament house occupies in Canberra is of paramount importance. Where we build a parliament house is a unique question, because tbe available sites in Canberra are different from the sites in Washington, London or elsewhere. The decision must be based upon a unique set of democratic community parliament should be circumstances that are not paralleled anyamong the people-in the market place. It where else. The Houses of Parliament at Westminster in Macquarie Street is in a sense in the are there through the accident that that is market place, if we regard Martin Place as where parliament first met; it was a royal being the market place, which in many ways palace and the king summoned the burgesses House is at the top of Collins Street, It of the towns and the knights of the shires again is, in a sense, in the market place. to that palace. This is an historical accident. But where would a parliament house be on At any rate, the only hills in London that the lakeside? It would be among the public I know of are Ludgate Hill, where there servants. Is this the market place? It cerhappened to be another eminent building tainly is not. I think it was the honourable before the modern Houses of Parliament member for Parkes( Mr Hughes) who were built, and of course Harrow, which earlier quoted from 'Paradise Lost' and is some distance from the centre of London. before I conclude I want to quote from So that situation is not parallel. There is no 'Paradise Lost' too on this particular point, precedent to be derived from London any but I shall leave that as a bonne bouche at more than there is from Washington. Howthe end. ever, it is worth noting that looking at the lay of the land and at the Potomac the member for Calare( Mr England) that we Americans chose an eminence for the should pay great regard to eminent author'""npitol as, indeed, long before the southern ities, that we should not trust ourselves. I planter Lee also chose an eminence for his home up on the hill that overlooks the lower lands of Washington. Indeed, most men in Australia, choosing a place for a homestead will choose some eminence rather than a hollow. There may be additionally practical reasons for this. When I left Canberra on Thursday last 1 was apt to be a lake dweller, but 1 have altered my mind. I went across to the other side of the lake and I looked back. I realised two things. First, I realised that Capital Hill is quite a lofty eminence. It is not as low as some people have been telling us. Secondly, if we look at the proposed location on the lake we see the National Library, a splendid building which reminds meI do not know why-of the architecture of the Pharaohs; the Treasury building which looks, of course, like a treasury-ver y practical; and the Administration Building, which looks like a castle among the trees. There is to be a High Court building on the lakeside. I have no idea what kind of building it will be. Then, if some have their way, we would have This would be simply a clutter of all kinds of buildings, and parliament house would not stand out among them. If it did stand out, it would look grossly overgrown; if it did not stand out it would be just another building and it would lose that conspicuousness that is characteristic of the hill site. It has been said that symbolically in a is true that in Sydney the Parliament House it is. In Melbourne the Victorian Parliament We have been told by the honourable hope he will abstain from voting; I think he is in favour of the lake site. But let us look at the persuasive and eminent authorities. First of all we had a parliamentary committee which met rather hurriedly and reported on something that was not in its terms of reference. Sir Robert Menzies asked it to do so, which of course made the position different. Who are the eminent gentlemen who comprised the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House? They are The President of the Senate, Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Country Party in the House of Representatives, the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, Senator Devitt, Senator DrakeBrockman, Senator McClelland, Senator Dame Ivy Wedgwood, Mr Barnard, Mr the National Library. Admittedly it would Birrell, Mr Bryant, Mr Duthie, Mr Drury, Mr Erwin, Mr Giles, Mr Luchetti and Mr to be able to pipe books through a tunnel Nixon. talented team, as my friend suggests. With the exception of the Leader of the Country PartyI do not think one of them has been in Parliament as long as I have been. I have been in parliaments, State and Federal, for 30 years and I do not bow to any of these gentlemen as being better able than myself to come to a judgment, except that they did hear evidence and I have not. Well, let us have a look at the evidence. This was an expert Committee and the Government Whip has in his room a list of the eminent witnesses, with many letters after their names. I shall not quote their names, let alone their letters; but included was Lord Holford, an English architect, who, of course, is familiar with Westminster. There were also authorities on traffic. I do not want to go over this matter again, because I thought the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) made it quite clear that when the ring road was proposed to be put around Capital Hill-thi s matter came before the parliamentary committee for the Australian Capital Territory-a n assurance was given that the putting of the road there would not in any way affect Capital Hill as a site for the permanent parliament house, should this be so decided later. Indeed, when we look at overpasses, underpasses and all the rest, these are technical problems of no great consequence. Then there were geologists. 1 suppose there were some doubts as to whether the foundations by the lake were right. The geologists said: 'Oh, yes, the lake will be all right'; but they did not say that the hill was better. They merely said that geologically speaking the lake would do, as indeed the hill would do. There were also hydrologists. I gather that there may be a flood once in a thousand years, but nobody is able to tell, according to one honourable member, when the end of the thousand years will come or when the thousand years will begin. The flood might be tomorrow or it might be in a thousand years time. However the hydrologists said that it was a fair risk, and it probably was. Then, of course, there were those who represented be an advantage for the National Library to parliament house, but after all the books of the National Library which have not been housed in the present Parliament House have been in igloos and other buildings around Canberra for some time and in my experience they have been brought here fairly readily. So this argument of itself is not sufficient, any more than are the opinions of traffic authorities, geologists, hydrologists or even an eminent English architect, to set aside the judgment which members of this place are perfectly capable of making-excep t that I hope the honourable member for Calare will abstain from voting, because he rightly distrusts his own judgment but is for the lake. In the past this matter was decided and some planning was done on the understanding that Sir Robert Menzies was in favour of the lake. He, too, was an Anglophile of similar background to Lord Holford. Well, the sword that he took from the lake has been returned to the lake: Sir Robert is not with us any more. We have had those who have said: 'We cannot make up our minds; we must listen to the experts'; and we have had those who have said: 'We must not make up our minds now: Let us deliberate further and hear some evidence.' I would like to see finality. I am sure that the National Capital Development Commission would like to see some finality in this matter. Surely we should have finality. If we are to dither let it be for at most a couple of weeks. I am sure that during this time the experts could",39,Names And Qualifications Of Advisers On The Central Areas Leading To Or Associated With The Acceptance Of The Lakeside Site

89,Mr Hansen (Wide Bay) [5.12],"Th etrying to get to my destination. I then obtained a guide, who took me past the Hotel Wellington again. It was 8 p.m., and hetels closed at 6 p.m. in those days, so I had no special reason for continually going past the Hotel Wellington. Since entering the Parliament I have lived in Canberra only at the Hotel Kurrajong and have had to find my way around Canberra with the aid of a map. Even so I have had great difficulty at times in finding the present Parliament House. Imagine how puzzling and frustrating it would be to a person to be able to see parliament house on the lakeside but not to be able to get to it. Capital Hill is at the apex of a triangle. All roads lead to it. Cross either bridge and you would be led to Capital Hill! 1 agree with those honourable members who have said that the placing of the Parliament here was the reason for establishing the city of Canberra. Canberra has grown around the Parliament, and the Parliament should be in a prominent position. People visiting the national capital experience considerable difficulty in finding their way around it. I take pride in the fact that I can read maps and can usually find my way around. However, this is not so when I am confronted with ring roads; 1 often find myself going the wrong way in a one-way street. I have never been lost in the bush. I have always known which way to go in order to get home. But it is a different story in Canberra. Getting lost in Canberra must be a daily experience for many visitors. Capital Hill is an ideal site for a parliathat site. I feel, with some misgivings, that ment house. I cannot agree with those who have said that it would be necessary to remove 25 feet from the top of the hill in order to erect a parliament house. No decision has yet been made as to the type of building to be erected for the Parliament. There have been suggestions that it should be circular, that it be hexagonal, that it he octagonal. As1 understand the situation, the Join! Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House was required to report on the type of building that should be erected. Some members of the Committee went overseas recently to sites deals also with parking. It points out inspect other parliamentary buildings and that the layout of the land on the hill site to report on their investigations. In my is not suitable for parking. It also indicates view the Committee's function was primarily to report on the type of buildings to be erected, not on the site on which it was to be erected. I appreciate the decision of the Government and the Opposition to allow a free vote on this issue. Some honourable members have said that the decision of the Select Committee was a unanimous one. 1 believe that the Committee did make a unanimous decision in favour of the hill 1 site. I also believe that there were three dissenters on this Committee, and that one other member, Senator McClelland, indicated that he would like to know a little more, but that, on the evidence submitted, he wa.s in favour of the lakeside site. I would like to comment on some of the prejudice that has been brought to bear against the hill site. Item4 of the table setting out the comparison of sites states that the hill site is exposed and subjected to unimpeded winds. I suggest that winds are a feature of Canberra, both inside and outside this House. Many of us who have been near the water's edge know that some of the coldest and most bitter winds come up from the lake. It has been said that one of the faults Of the hill site has been thai 20 feet to 35 feet will have to be cut off the top of the hill and that this work would cost about S2m to 84m. The vast excavations needed to provide for underground parking have been mentioned also. It is suggested that from this point of view the hill site is not ideal. I believe that if underground parking were to be provided on the lakeside site, a considerable amount of soil would have to be excavated on the problem of seepage would arise if provision were to be made for underground parking on a lakeside site. If excavation were carried out at a level below the level of the bottom of the lake, some seepage would be bound to take place. This would be apart from the prospect of occasional flooding. In my view, seepage would interfere with the foundations. 1 am not an expert on this but if I were to build 1 would favour the hill site. The table dealing with comparisons of that there is plenty of land available for parking between the present Parliament House and the lake. I cannot see this. I am one of those people who would like to see the area between the avenues left open with an unimpeded view. Certainly, if the new parliament bouse were built on the hill site overlooking the present structure, the view would be right over towards the Australian War Memorial. It has been suggested that if we do not use the site on the lake shore for a new parliament house or parliamentary buildings, some other building would be erected on the site. I do not agree with this point of view. I would prefer to see the space reserved and kept vacant. It is suggested by tbe Joint Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House that if the new parliament house were located on Capital Hill the type of building that would have to be designed would be different from that which wouid be planned for the lakeside site. I believe this would be quite true. There would be buildings of different type on each site. I believe that a decision should be made now, or as soon as possible, as to where the new parliamentary building should be erected. Those honourable members associated with this Committee should be able to make their decisions in regard to a particular area. I believe the experts whose names have been recorded in Hansard are quite capable of designing a building which would be suitable and of which all Australians could be proud. A building with these qualities could be erected on either site but I believe that a decision should be made at this time. I appreciate the fact that a free vote has been given to honourable members. Dr MACKAY (Evans) [5.25]-Listening through centuries and for which many to this debate I have been amazed to find nations still struggle in darkness. Only in that the serious question of the desirability these days are many beginning to discover of the new parliament house being in the parliament as the symbol of the freedoms centre of the Canberra vista and a perthey so much desire. So, in my view, there manent feature overlooking the city of Canshould be no apology made for planning berra has not been raised. My view is that a parliamentary building dominating and people come from all over Australia-and overlooking the skyline of Canberra. more recently from all over the worldto this city with one paramount and objective thought in their minds: They wish to be adduced to deny this symbolism is that see the centre of government for Australia. a parliament house built on Capital HillI make no apology whatsoever in stating would be beset by the traffic situation. It is that it is absolutely beyond any shadow of doubt that the first, the dominating feature that should greet the eyes of people travelling by air or road to Canberra, set as it is in a valley, should be the permanent home of the national Parliament. It has been suggested that this thinking is wrong. Lord Holford apparently based his arguments very greatly on symbolism. Others have followed him in this reasoning and have taken the view that parliament house ought to be down at the level of the people. I wonder whether this is a valid argument. I wonder whether, in the eyes of our people, and indeed the peoples around the world who have adopted the parliamentary form of government, parliament is not something that they want to look up to. This is an age in which all too many of the things to which people have looked up have been levelled to the dust-a n age in which there is a lack of those things to which people can direct their allegiance. Surely Australian people can direct their admiration at the symbol of the parliamentary institution. In this regard, I believe that Lord Holford has been incorrect in assessing that we ought to put parliamentary government down as just one more of a chain of many governmental and other activities within the life of the nation. I believe that the central feature of Canberra should be the parliamentary building. I say this not because members of Parliament, who come here as representatives of the people, feel that as individuals they stand above the average person. We are chosen because we are representative of the whole community. But the institution itself is surely something that we hold up to the world as being a symbol of a form of government for which men have struggled The only other argument that seems to argued that to place the building on Capital Hill would be to place it in jeopardy from an increasing flow of traffic. I believe this argument condemns the town planners whose arguments have been adduced so solidly in defence of another site. If it is not possible to plan from the outset the city whose whole purpose is to house the national Parliament and to be the nation's capital, and in doing so to direct the road system in such a way that the functions of parliament as the central feature of the city can be carried out without undue interference from traffic, this in itself is condemnasuch as proximity to water, but there is tion of those who are engaged in the planning process. The honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Birrell) warned that honourable members should not set themselves up in the guise of town planners, that we are amateurs in this field. It has been said that we should not indulge in any criticism of the very weighty list of witnesses that have appended their names to the recommendations favouring the lakeside site. But1 remind the House that we are not setting ourselves up in this capacity. We are simply people who have been to other places. We are men who have looked at ancient as well as modern cities throughout the world. We know the features of these cities and have them set out in our memories. What is it that people remember about Edinburgh? It is the historic feature of Edinburgh Castle which dominates the whole city. This castle stands as an historic fortress and is a symbol of strength to all who live there and who go there. The first thing that the name of a great city calls to mind for most people is a skyline dominated by a feature of one kind or another. Therefore, we are considering this matter not as amateur town planners but as people who are experienced in seeing and living in a large number of cities around the world. I believe that we need for Australia's national capital some kind of symbolic and outstanding edifice or feature that will be a demonstration to all who come here that this is a nation which is governed by a democratic parliamentary system, that this is the actual place from which the laws of the nation emanate. We have heard a number of erudite same freedom that has been bought so quotations. We have heard quoted everydearly. SoI come down unhesitatingly on thing from the scriptures to Milton. We the side of the Capital Hill site. have heard from the Psalms of David. We have yet to hear from the Sermon on the mount-no t the sermon on the lakeperhaps about the city which is set on a hill and which is not able to be hid. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Hughes) referred to Milton. Incidentally, the honourable member himself resides on a hill overlooking Sydney. Perhaps the irony of this argument is that I am from the lakeside, as it were, since I represent a constituency down along the shores of Sydney Harbour. My position has many delights, no question in my mind that the dominating position on the hilltop attracts public attention and quite often is sought by many people as tbe ideal place to live. The honourable member for Parkes quoted from Milton's 'Paradise Lost', and then Satan's speech was taken up again by the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner), though that was not the theme of his argument. He told us about the way in which the hosts should 'awake, arise, or be forever faU'n'. 1 believe it is a false argument to suggest that the new parliament house should be surrounded by great throngs of people. It is a false argument to suggest that the new parliament house should be placed on the lakeside site, so that as the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Birrell) suggested, on ANZAC Day 100,000 people would be able to gather in front of it or be in its precincts. Surely in the planning of Canberra we have provided in front of the Australian War Memorial an area in which the people can gather on ANZAC Day. There is adequate space there for hosts of people to gather. In my view, the Parliament itself should be set in a position in which it gives a balance to the skyline. At the one extreme there is the War Memorial which is in honour of those who have given their lives in war in fighting for the freedom of the country, and at the other extreme, standing on a hill overlooking the city, there should be a building which, if you like, would be a kind of memorial to those who have given their lives and their talents seeking to preserve and to carry forward into the legislation, laws and enactments of the nation that I want to conclude by adding my word of commendation to what has been said by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Stokes). Having said that 1 am in favour of the Capital Hill site 1 must pause to realise that there are many people who disagree with me. I think it would be most unfortunate if this Parliament were to come to a division, not on party lines but on personal predilection lines, and make a decision, by a narrow margin, in favour of one site or the other. 1 do not believe that this would be the best thing for the nation. What is wrong with our saying: 'Here are two magnificent sites which lend themselves to totally different interpretations by the architects; here are two sites, each of which could be made into a very fitting place on which the national Parliament could be situated.*? We could say to the world: 'Here is an opportunity for the architects and planners to enter into a competition and to use to its fullest advanis customary, for the passage of those Bills tage whichever site they believe to be most suited to their own imagination, to their own concept and to their own vision of what they consider they would like to see built on that site.' A depiction of the buildings that are submitted as a result of the world wide competition could be scrutinised by members of both Houses of the Parlament and by experts throughout Australia and then a decision could be made as to which of the two sites had attracted the best design and would give to this city the kind of building that was most desirable. In essence 1 support the pioposilion of the honourable member for Maribyrnong. who has foreshadowed that if the amendment to the motion is not carried an opportunity should be given for the exper'.s to put before us a depiction of what they consider to be the best possible use that can Executive, which is one of the other arms be made of each site. Having seen what could be done with the lakeside site and with the Capital Hill site the House would be in the best position to decide. Immigration) [5.36]-It is quite clear from the number of honourable members who want to take part in this debate that to end it this evening would be to deprive of the opportunity to do so a number of honourable members who want to express their 19511/68-K-112 ) views on this most important question. I would suggest that after I have finished speaking the next honourable member called might move the adjournment of the debate and the adjourned debate could be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting. 1 would then expect that at 8 o'clock tonight we would continue, as is traditional, with the Leader of the Opposition replying to the Budget Speech, and then we would proceed as is traditional with the Budget debate and the Estimates debate, which, of course, have major priority and importance in this Parliament in the Budget period. The resumption of the debate on the site of the new and permanent parliament house is a matter which as Leader of the House1 will have to take up and look at in terms of a complex programme. It is traditional that the Budget debate and the Estimates debate are not interrupted except for national matters of great urgency or. as which need to be passed in order to authorise payment of social service benefits. At the outset I pay an appropriate tribute to the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) for initiating the move towards a free vote and a free debate on this question. The move having been initiated, it bas come to pass that there will be a free vote, by reason of the executive of the Parliamentary Labour Party agreeing to the same course. What, of course, is also true and needs to be stated is that members of the Ministry are likewise to be freed from the whip and will be able to speak and vote as tbey choose. I think it is most important that this be done. All of us in this House have the common characteristic of being members of the legislature. Some of us in the House have a dual identity in that we are not merely members of the legislature but are also members of the of government. In this instance, when members of the Ministry speak or vote they exercise their right to do so in their identity as members of the Parliament. So here in this debate we have complete expression of opinion of parliamentarians in their capacity of members of the Parliament. It is a long while since we have had a free vote in this Parliament. I can remember on only one occasion since I have been here a free vote being given, and that was in relation to the Matrimonial Causes Bill.",42,Names And Qualifications Of Advisers On The Central Areas Leading To Or Associated With The Acceptance Of The Lakeside Site

91,Mr Sneddeni Think That The Pro,"Mr J. R. Fraser-I s the Minister referring to the honourable member for Adelaide? The honourable member for Adelaide has firm views in relation to this matter as he has concerning most things. He expresses them quite adequately, as the honourable gendeman will know. But those people to whom I have just referred will in the course of time come to recognise that a judgment made on the issues would be the best way for them to decide their voting course. I think that there are largely the balancing factors which will operate in the mind of everybody at the point of time when you, Mr Speaker, will put to the House the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) on which occasion those who favour the lakeside site will pass to the left of the Chair. In the final point that I make in this general statement. I think I am unconsciously adopting the words used by somebody else and I probably will not quote those words accurately. But it is certainly true that all generations inherit the achieveMinister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck), ments or the faults of their progenitors. What we must make sure of is that the determination of the site for the permanent parliament house which the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House is thinking of in terms of lasting 300 years or more must be right and the basis for making the decision must be broader and bigger than prejudice, personal taste or anything of that kind. At the beginning of tbe consideration of the selection of a site for a parliament house, there are a number of questions that I would ask. The first question T ask is: Is the site big enough? There is some disputation as to whether the site is big enough. 1 am quite certain that an area of 47 acres, which could become 75 acres, and/or an area of 85 acres, which could become 130 acres, are of such magnitude that they make the question of size quite unrelated to the reality. On the lakeside site, the area of 47 acres can be increased to 75 acres. That is a big enough site. The hill site is a big enough site. So far as parking and that sort of thing are concerned, f foresee a situation similar to the Union Square in San Francisco with underground parking. This takes care of a great deal of the site problems. The next question that I ask is: Is the site prominent enough? There is no doubt that both sites are prominent. But the context of the building in which we are now is likely to reduce the prominence of the hill site and render the lakeside site ev^n more prominent than the hill site would be. That is the reality of it. Let us put that aside. Both sites are prominent enough for the building. The next question of the site that I would ask is: Is it accessible enough? There is no doubt that accessibility is a matter of road design. Accessibility is there for both sites. The next question that I ask concerns cost reasonability. I have no doubt that the selection of the hill site would result in a higher cost, for I accept it as certain that the top of the hill would need to be shaved off. I accept that the lakeside site is a largely prepared site at this point in time. The next question that I ask is: Is the present environment compatible with the new and permanent parliament house? It is an interesting thing that my colleague, the in speaking of this matter said that the site should be on Capital Hill. In the course of describing some of the characteristics and the advantages of that site he said: It will put H in proximity to great institutions He was speaking there of the lakeside site, and then speaking of the hill site he said: . . . but not in the midst of a dwelling, living, active, working Australian community. That sounds pretty good, until we read what the honourable member for Wills said in the paper which he circulated. He pointed out that note 8 (i), referring to the Capital Hill site, says: The site is surrounded by large areas of domestic development. The honourable member denied that statement in these words: This is just not true. Of the 360 degrees of the full circle, the only readily visible domestic development is in Forrest between Adelaide Avenue and Canberra Avenue. It is all a long way off and is a very attractive housing area. The Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck) was going to have us in the middle of this thriving, busy, working community.",47,Names And Qualifications Of Advisers On The Central Areas Leading To Or Associated With The Acceptance Of The Lakeside Site
92,Mr Snedden,"No, I certainly am not.The next matter is the traffic flow. The Minister for External Affairs said that the best site is a central position. I contest this, not the honourable member for Wills. The worse place is a central position. A central position which becomes the meeting place of two major highways would be the worse position for a parliament house. What is needed, in the concept of Walter Burley Griffin, is a precinct. In fact a precinct, in terms that he used it, is an area free from flowing traffic. In the nature of the permanent parliament house in the national capital I certainly accept the precinct idea of freedom from intercrossing traffic. Then you come to the esoteric question of symbolism. In modern terms symbolism is not something which is real. It cannot be real in modern terms. Parliamentary democracy is now inculcated into our lives beyond the point where mysticism or symbolism or any other ism of that kind is a necessary element. on the table is for? the past, when parliamentary democracy was evolving and when the divine right of kings or the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Kilien) was being cut down; but there was a time when it was necessary to have the majesty of symbolism, and it was very frequently an impressive site upon a hill top. The honourable member for Moreton talks about the mace. The mace is a tradition which he and 1 would like to see prosper. It is a manifestation of the evolvement and development to this point of time of parliamentary democracy and the parliamentary institution, and it has no relation to whether you put parliament house on a hill or on a lake. It will stay, I hope, for my life and for many generations into the future on the table which stands in front of the Speaker. The output of the Parliament is far more important than the symbolism of parliament. I have no doubt that if a parliament house were built on the lakeside or on the hill it would be fitted in properly by the right persons -the architects, engineers and town planners. What comes out of it is more important. I personally think that the lakeside presents the more impressive site. Motion (by Mr Donald Cameron) put: Thai the question be now put. The House divided.

96,"Page 102), On Motion By Mr Mcmahon:","Opposition) [8.0]I move: Thai all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof. 'this House is of opinion that the Budget is inadethe same amount of $1 which was chosen quate in that it does not make provision(a) to lighten taxes and health costs for families and to increase benefits for them, (b) to plan defence procurement and expenditure, (c) to meet the problems of Australia's capital and provincial cities, and (d) to retain control and promote development of Australia's mineral, fuel, land and marine resources'. For nearly two decades, the development and defences of Australia and the standards of her people bave been determined within the constricting framework of yearly budgets and two-yearly elections. This approach has suited conservative governments very well. It has excused inertia under the guise of financial responsibility. It has excused the perpetuation of injustices and the extension of inequalities under the guise of occasional benevolence. It has denied Australians opportunities for education, employment and enterprise in the name of economy. It has denied Australians the opportunity to discover and develop their continent's resources in the name of the balance of payments. In a time of unparallelled world-wide growth, of revolutionary technological change, of immense growth in world trade and the discovery in Australia of vast new resources which the world wants, the end result of 18 years of conservative economics is summed up in the contrast between two sentences in the speech by the Treasurer The new resources so far proved are now adding pacity pension. That partially redresses a more and more to the ever increasing output of situation in which repatriation benefits had national wealth; But on an earlier page he had announced: The maximum weekly rate of pension for single rate repatriation pension remains unage and invalid pensioners and widows with changed; it is still worth less than it has children will rise by $1. It is revealing to examine this Budget in which such inflated claims have been made the light of the Treasurer's own boasts about on behalf of this Budget, it fails and it. This has been labelled a 'social welfare deceives. Budget'. The Treasurer's preamble and his peroration proclaim it. The Treasurer's own modest word is 'compassionate'. There had welfare Budget. It is not a defence Budget. been a great build-up for this Budget. It was The burdens imposed by defence spending to show, in particular, the professed concern remain huge and crippling as the bills for by the new Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) has'.y decisions made 5 years ago come in. for the deserving poor, for assisting, in the But Australia is not better defended merely words of the Governor General's Speech, because the cost of the Fl 11 has tripled. 'those in most need while at the same time not discouraging thrift, self help and self reliance'. But after all the public relations promotion came the facts. The basic fact is that the pension has been increased by in 1966 and 1963. That dollar increase is worth considerably less in proportionate or purchasing terms than it was in either of those years. The much vaunted concern of the new Prime Minister has achieved less in his first year of office than either of his predecessors did in theirs. But at least the late Prime Minister and Sir Robert Menzies refrained from insulting the pensioners of Australia with humbug about compassion. No wonder the kissing had to stop! Compassion! The Treasurer is the first who has dared to put a price tag on the worda dollar a week-and call it compassion. Is it accurate to suggest that this Budget places a new or special emphasis on social welfare? Docs it, in fact, make any attempt at all to redress the distribution of our wealth in favour of those whose sole, principal or temporary income depends upon what governments can provide? National receipts will go up by an estimated 1 10i%; the National Welfare Fund expenditure will go up an estimated 8%. So much for the new approach! It is true that the increase in the Welfare Fund will be greater proportionately than last year. That is merely ao indictment of last year's Budget, not a compliment to this. It is also true that the Budget provides increases in the total and permanent incafallen to their lowest value in 50 yearsthe lowest since their inception. The general ever been.

97,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa,Leade r of the,50,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69
98,( Mr Mcmahon). He Said:,"lt is not a development Budget. There is no mention at all of new spending for development projects. Is the Government to repeat the performance of last year when development spending, declared impossible in the Budget, was announced on the eve of the Senate election? Or is development to wait another year? The great majority of Australians are ignored in this Budget except as they provide a source of increased taxation. Most Australians live as families and in cities. Families are ignored and cities are ignored. No Budget in any other modern major nation today would remain silent about the national government's role in dealing with the problems of cities. Few modern nations are so centralised. Few modern cities are growing as fast as ours. Few modern cities are growing so haphazardly and expensively as ours. No modern cities are as largely unsewered as ours. In none does it take so long to travel from one point to another. Yet the Treasurer makes no acknowledgement whatsoever that these problems are the concern of the Commonwealth. Indeed, as this Budget continues the squeeze on the States and through them on local and semi-government authorities, these problems are aggravated. Further, this Budget is regressive in a threefold way. By leaving the tax schedules unchanged for yet another year, the burden of income tax increasingly falls on the lower and middle income groups. It is now 14 years since the tax schedules were reviewed. The lower and middle income groups have been inflated into the higher tax brackets. Secondly, the Budget is regressive because of the increase in indirect taxation. The Treasurer carefully masked the full extent and impact of his increased sales taxes. In fact, the extra 24% will affect a whole range tion in any one year. It is part of the whole of articles from toys to tyres. Thirdly, by increasing the squeeze on the States, the Budget is forcing them to increase their charges. By their nature most State taxes are regressive and fall most heavily on low and middle income earners. Charges, such as hospital and transport charges, are inevitably regressive and most acutely affect people with families or modest incomes. The average man, woman and child will now pay a greater proportion of his or her salary, pension or allowance in indirect taxes and in fares than ever before. The average taxpayer will pay a greater proportion of his income in income tax than ever before. The average ratepayer will pay a greater proportion of his income in rates and charges than ever before. So, upon examination, we can see something of the true nature of this Budgetmiserable and misleading in respect of provisions for social welfare, regressive and unfair in its impact on wage earners and their families, and negative and timid about the development of this nation and its resources. Most of these failures are due to the straitjacket of doctrinaire conservatism which the Treasurer accepts and which the Libera] Government imposes on itself. The Treasurer's real approach to his task is made clear in a statement he made on an Australian Broadcasting Commission programme on Budget night. In justifying the smallness of the pension and welfare benefits and the increase in sales tax, he said: Tf they are critical of this, let them answer one question-wher e else do we go?' This, of course, has been the classic self justification of all conservative governments in Australia and, in particular, the conservative Government of the past 18 years. The assumption is that every item in every Budget has a quality of immutable wisdom and that every aspect of the economy must be debated solely within the framework of each successive Budget. It assumes that all criticism and analysis must take place on a mere accounting basis of receipts and expenditure. In fact, the Treasurer well knows that no modern economy, not even Australia's under a conservative government, any longer operates on this narrow basis. The question of adequate pensions does not hinge simply on the level of taxaquestion of economic and social management in a modern, wealthy society. In its proposals for expenditure, the Budget is a conventional comptroller's Budget. The form in which proposed expenditures are presented owes more to the clash between King and Parliament at the time of the English Civil War than to the contemporary need to control government spending by cost-benefit analysis of specific proposals for public activity. The budgetary techniques are ill suited to the facilitation of analysis or tbe making of informed decisions. Through budgeting on an annual basis, governments acknowledge their accountability to Parliament for overall public expenditure and for the expenditure incurred by particular departments of state. At a time when members of Parliament were familiar with all or most of the activities undertaken within departments, annual budgeting effectively discharged the Government's obligation to render account. It discharges that obligation no longer. Members of Parliament now must learn to scrutinise specinc government projects or programmes as closely as formerly they scrutinised the affairs of government departments. Budgets and Budget papers must enable and encourage them to do so. A Labor government would no longer think it adequate or appropriate to account to the Parliament in terms of the ceilings it proposed to set upon departmental expenditures or the amounts spent by departments on salaries and stamps. Those things which, under the present Government, pass for planning and priorities amount in fact to a Budget in search of a programme. A Labor government would reverse this pattern by imposing programmes upon the traditional departmental divisions of the Budget. In short, it would adopt the system of programme budgeting. The two great American federal systems of Canada and the United States of America have done it. Great Britain is about to do it. Announcing the system for the United States on 25th August 1965, President Johnson said: This programme is designed to achieve three major objectives: It will help us to find new ways to do jobs faster, to do jobs better and to do jobs less expensively. It will ensure a much sounder judgment through more accurate information, pinpointing those things we ought to do more, spotlighting tbose things we ought to do less. The essence of the programme budgeting concept is precise identification and definition of national goals, coupled with meticulous forward planning of the programmes through which these goals can most advantageously be pursued and realised. It is a concept designed to ensure that the needs of a people are met with a minimum of waste or delay. Under such a system, we in the Parliament and, more importantly, the pensioners, would not be fobbed off on every question about social services between February and August with the standard reply: The Government constantly reviews all social service benefits and its decisions will be contained in the Budget to be presented in August'. It is true that in recent years the level of economic sophistication of the Budget speech has improved. There has not been the same modernisation of the documents which accompany the speech and on which this year the Treasurer has relied heavily for support for his explanations and predictions. Throughout the speech runs a theme of acceleration of the pace of the economy. But where is the evidence to support this belief in a quickening of the pace of the economy? It is true that the Treasurer gave the House estimates of the growth of national income and expenditure over the course of 1967-68, but this information refers to the last fiscal year as a whole. The Treasurer presents next to no information, either in the Budget speech or in the accompanying documents, to support his argument on what has been happening over the past six months. A search for information on recent trends in the economy takes in first Statement No. 1 attached to the Budget speech. Here, in a section on The Economic Context', it is confidently predicted that a detailed analysis of the behaviour of the main gross national product components can be found in 'National Income and Expenditure, 1967-68' presented with the Budget papers. But a search of this document is to no avail, for all the amounts presented here relate to annual changes in the levels of incomes and expenditures. What has been happening to the economy in recent quarters? The Treasurer is silent. AU he can do to reassure the House that his diagnosis is the correct one is to inform us in the foreword to 'National Income and Expenditure, 1967-1968' that 'estimates for each quarter of 1967-68 will be published shortly by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics'. Really, this is just not good enough! The House is expected to debate the control of the economy in ignorance of recent trends, pending release of the relevant information at a more convenient later date. Instead of publishing a lacklustre White Paper, 'The Australian Economy 1968', which is documented with platitudes and which he himself does not take seriously, the Treasurer would do well to instruct the Treasury to discharge its responsibility to the nation by providing an up to date record of the progress of the main statistical indicators of the economy. It is typical of the chaotic mismanagement of the nation's economic affairs by this Government that such a compilation of statistical indicators is published annually, but not at the time when it is most needed. I refer to the Commonwealth Statistician's publication, 'Seasonally Adjusted Indicators 1968'. This year it was distributed in May and it contains monthly information to March 1968. By the time of the Budget, this information is five months out of date. Why cannot the Treasurer produce this material at Budget time? Instead we are offered a White Paper in which the Treasury tells us 'Over the past year investment expenditure has been on the rise and, so far as the signs can now be read, ought to go on rising strongly'. Why cannot these signs the Treasurer considers so significant be set down in print for all to see? The reason for the Treasurer's reticence in providing recent information becomes quite clear when the available statistics are dug out from the morass of newsletters, Press releases and periodicals put out by the Government. He would not be able to establish that the economy has been racing away in recent months. He claims, for example, that 'investment in plant and equipment is now rising'. The fact is that, even in terms of inflated prices, expenditures on new capital equipment have been falling this year according to the Statistician. .Seasonally adjusted quarterly expenditures on new capital equipment rose in the second half of last year, but have since fallen. The same is true of the other main component of private fixed capital expenditure, that expended on 'new buildings and structures'. Total private fixed capital expenditures in the first quarter of this year were running at a seasonally adjusted rate of more than V/o below that of the last quarter of 1967. Again, the Treasurer tells us that the construction industry is gaining momentum. But the facts are that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, building approvals, both in total and for new houses and flats, were running in May of this year at a lower rate than they were last December. Once again the available facts contradict the Treasurer's statements. If he has more recent information on these matters, why is he so signally unwilling to reveal it to the House? I do not wish to deny that the economy is operating at a higher rate than it was 12 months ago, but the suggestion that the economy is racing away underneath us is utter nonsense. We can only draw the conclusion that the Treasurer wishes to create an illusion to overawe the Arbitration Commission into not granting adequate wage increases in the case which opened today. The Treasurer seems obsessed with future inflation but unperturbed about the past. I draw his attention to the statement in the National Income White Paper concerning farm income which shows that farm production costs other than wages and depreciation have risen by S374m or 30% al the same time as gross value of farm production has fallen! So this is a Budget marked by a lack of adequate and accurate information; but above all, it is a Budget marked by a lack of proper priorities and a lack of well defined, clearly stated national goals. This is partly because of the nature of the present budgeting system. It is mainly because of the use conservative Treasurers, not least the present Treasurer, make of that system. The character and the quality of the information which departments would be required to produce under a system of programme budgeting would themselves impose formidable discipline on the way in which decisions are reached within departments. The casual and indiscriminate quality of the decisions which constitute the current Budget is apparent in many of the proposals in which the Treasurer is pleased to take most pridethose in social services, health and education. But departments do not establish national priorities or fix national goals. This is what governments should do. This is what this Budget has failed to do, as its eighteen predecessors failed to do; this is what the Gorton Government fails to do, as the Menzies and Holt governments failed to do. The excuses of the Treasurer for his failures are that economic problems facing the country do not allow it. There are always economic problems; they are with us always. There is no reason why in this age the poor should be with us always also. This is the nineteenth Budget of three successive conservative governments. They span nearly a third of the time since Federation. They cover nearly half the period since Financial Agreement. They cover more than two-thirds of the period since the establishment of uniform tax. Yet in the great areas of national policy there have been few great innovations, few radical departures, many retreats. The crucial question of the Commonwealth's financial relations with other authorities, not merely with the State but with local and semi-government authorities, is the clearest illustration of the chaos which the core of the whole issue of economic results from a hesitant and half-hearted acceptance of Commonwealth responsibilities combined with crude insistence on Commonwealth financial hegemony. In the past year, the Government has emphasised its responsibility for finance. It refuses to recognise that this imposes a responsibility for functions. In arguing general principles, it is often upon whether or not their cities are pleasant, wise to begin with particular cases. I start efficient, well-planned, healthy and civilised with the most basic question in the world -sewerage . Between 1946 and 1966, the places in which to live. number of homes served by sewerage authorities fell in Melbourne from 95.3% assisted migration. The lower the standards to 76.8% and in Perth from 76.4% to of our cities, the lower the likely standards 43.4%. Over the same period, Sydney was of our migrants. The lower the standards of able to lift its proportion of sewered homes our cities, the fewer migrants will come and by only 1.4% and Brisbane by only 0.3%. the fewer will stay. The problem of attractThere are still 700,000 people living in ing and holding migrants does not approach unsewered homes in Sydney.

As a result, the cost of this Budget maintains the long silence of a sewered building block will rise by at 19 years of conservative government. least $400. The Chairman of the Board coyly comments: The general trend is that basic services be provided by the tralians, the largest section with common developers'. He means, of course, that interests and common problems, is that great young people seeking to establish a home section which lives in our cities. We have will find $400 more than they anticipated every problem in our cities that American or they will do without sewerage.

Yet no national to be singled out as the victims of a new government in Europe or North America, in and indefensibly regressive form of public federal or unitary systems, would, in 1968, finance. This simple basic example illustrates and impinges on a whole range of problems facing this nation today. It is a range of the first Commonwealth-State problems about which this Budget is wholly silent-the problems of our cities and the great majority of our people who choose or are obliged to live and work in them. The problem of the cities is at the core of the problem of Commonwealth-State financial relations, lt is at the core of the problems of housing, public transport and urban roads. It is at the core of the problem of population growth, of migration, and therefore at growth. The mental and physical well-being of our people is basic to the quality of education they can receive and consequently crucial to our technological and economic progress. Standards of mental and physical health depend overwhelmingly upon the environment in which people live and bring up their children. And consequently, for the great majority of Australians, it will depend The Budget provides this year S34m for The largest identifiable section of Ausignore the cities in its annual budget. At this moment our largest city is deeply involved in a controversy about the siting of a major hospital. Our third city, Brisbane, and all of their funds for public works. is running to a standstill because of a strike It has the dominant role in deciding the size over its future public transport system. These two great matters, superficially so different in origin and superficially irrelegovernments are able to charge fees for vant to a federal budget, have one great thing in common: Tbey both reflect the failure of the national government, this Government, to involve itself in the problem of the cities and to accept that these problems are at the base of the crisis in Commonwealth-State relations. The question is not whether tbe present Sydney and Parramatta hospitals should be retained or replaced. It is how Sydney shall have hospital services for its commercial heart and a teaching hospital for fhe western half of its population. The problem is not whether Brisbane will have buses or trams, but how and whether our largest local government authority, squeezed by both Commonwealth and State governments, shall provide an efficient public transport system. The important issue is not whether the Commonwealth or a State should discharge a particular governmental function, but that the governmental function should be well discharged. Australians will continue to suffer in the quality, availability and equity through beef road grants and through grants of government services so long as they allow themselves to be fobbed off with the contention that such basic functions as education, health, housing and transport are solely the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act on or primarily matters for the States; they are no longer regarded as solely or primarily State or local matters in any country with which Australia compares herself. Local government has consistently been denied an adequate means of raising the revenue with which to finance its extensive and expensive obligations. While State governments complain that the Commonwealth is indifferent to their problems, the States themselves are no less indifferent to the problems of local government. The Premiers who upbraid the Commonwealth for its parsimony extol parsimony as a virtue of Australia's motor vehicles are located in their dealings with local government. The Commonwealth has a monopoly of direct taxation and most forms of indirect taxation, including customs and excise duties and sales tax. It provides the States with most of their funds for current expenses and nature of the borrowings of local councils and semi-government authorities. State licensing a variety of activities presciently prohibited by State laws. Local government however, is almost entirely dependent for its revenue upon rates based on property values. Increasingly, health, education, welfare, transport and urban services are recognised as areas of Commonwealth concern which must be supported with Commonwealth money. It is appropriate that local government and State governments should receive a share of that money proportionate to the responsibilities they are undertaking in these areas. It is remarkable and reprehensible that the Commonwealth, unlike the United States Administration, should so far have refused to acknowledge or subsidise the responsibilities of local government. In no matter is the failure of the system more apparent than in the case of roads. The Commonwealth provides the States with funds for roads through its general grants, under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act. The Commonwealth requires the States to spend not less than 40% of the grants under roads other than main roads situated in rural areas. The States in fact allocate more than 80% of their Commonwealth Aid Roads Act grants and more than 80% of their general road expenditure to roads in rural areas. Roads in capital cities carrying between 70% and 80% of Australia's traffic burden are allowed to remain the responsibility of local government authorities which receive little financial support from State governments or from the Commonwealth government. The Commonwealth and the States devote only 10% of their road expenditure to urban areas in which 65% and used, and in which our greatest traffic problems occur. Householders, other property holders and private vendors of land provide most of the finance for Australia's most pressing road needs. Similarly, the Commonwealth has provided 36% of the cost of rail standardisation between Brisbane and Grafton, $10m towards the cost of upgrading the standard gauge line between Broken Hill and Parkes, 70% of the cost of the line from Broken Hill to Port Pirie, the whole cost from Port Pirie to Kalgoorlie, and 70% again from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. It has failed, however, to match its involvement in the trans-continental link with a concern for Australia's neglected and necessitous urban rail systems. Such rail systems are a key factor in urban transport problems, but it is beyond the means of State governments to modernise and develop them along lines dictated by technological change and urban growth. The economic and social liabilities imposed by inadequate urban roads and railways are a burden which Australians can ill afford to carry, inadequate roads alone are estimated to cost Australians $2m every day-hal f this year's defence bill. The Commonwealth should not revoke its requirement that 40% of Commonwealth Aid Roads Act grants be expended on roads other than main roads situated in rural areas, but should match it with a comparable requirement for expenditure on urban roads. The Commonwealth should not decrease its involvement in stadardisation, but should undertake a complementary share of the financial responsibility for urban railways as the Government of the United States now undertakes a share of the financial responsibility for urban railways operated by the governments of American States and cities. Australia cannot properly be developed while the present imbalance between the Commonwealth's rural and urban transport investment priorities is allowed to persist. These matters affect the great majority of people who live in cities. Because our cities and rural areas are inter1 dependent, they indirectly affect the well-being of all Australians. Similarly, all Australians are affected of the age pension. They will now be worth directly or indirectly by the decisions we 57% of the pension in the oase of a married make on investment in our human couple and 59% of the pension-20 % less resources. It is in the field of social welfare -in the case of a single person. Yet, at that the failure to define goals and establish any one time, some 10,000 persons receive priorities is most apparent, and most detrisickness benefits and twice that number mental to the welfare of the most needy receive unemployment benefits. In the sections of the community. It is laughable United States, unemployment or sickness to claim that his Budget gives an 'honoured benefits are worth 106% of the old age place' to welfare. The Secretary of ihe Commonwealth Pensioners Association, Mrs Irene Ellis, said of the Budget: It was a testing time for both the Prime Minister, Mr Gorton, and the Minister for Social Services, Mr Wentworth. They failed miserably, and did not live up to their promises. In the case of persons raising families, Liberal governments have never increased maternity allowances; they have never increased endowment for the second child; they have not increased endowment for the first child for 17 years. In the case of persons in retirement, the means test has become more stringent. The Liberal Party will not allow younger pensioners to augment their income sufficiently; it will not exempt older pensioners from tbe means test. Fourteen years ago, a single age pensioner could receive the full pension while earning in addition an amount equal to the pension; married couples could receive their full pensions if between them they earned an amount equal to the combined pension. Now a pensioner will not be able to receive the full pension if he earns an additional amount of more than 71% of the pension. A married couple will not be able to receive their full pensions if between them they earn more than 68% of the combined pension. The Liberal Party now disowns its promise to abolish the means test by proclaiming that it would cost $340m. It would not be ruinous, however, to take deliberate steps to abolish the means test. It would cost $65m to pay a full pension to all persons of 75 years and over irrespective of their means; it would cost another $l2m to pay it to all persons of 74. These are practical steps which a Commonwealth government could take to bring Australia progressively into line with other English-speaking countries. In the case of persons who become sick or unemployed, benefits were last increased 6 years ago. They were then worth 79% pension and in Britain 90%. The sick and the unemployed in Australia presumably do not require less food, less warmth or less shelter than their older compatriots. Countries comparable with our own do not deny disadvantaged persons equal access to these commodities. The attitude of the Government and of the Department of Social Services reeks of the work house and the poor law. Children under 16 are not eligible for unemployment benefits, sickness benefits or rehabilitation training allowances. The rate for unmarried persons 16 and 17 years of age is $3.50; tor unmarried persons 18, 19 and 20 years of age $4.75. These benefits are based on the assumption that families can support their children until the age of 16 and subsidise them until the age of 21. Welfare agencies throughout Australia are constantly in touch with young people who do not receive support from their families. Young people who are normally self sufficient become exposed to avoidable hardship if they fall ill or become unemployed. A Labor government would gear minimum levels of income in each budget to the cost of living index for persons unable through age, incapacity or unemployment to support themselves. The Aged Persons Homes Act has been amended to permit grants to local government; only one application has been received. Whilst councils are theoretically eligible to receive funds, they arc disquali17% of Australians have no medical cover fied in practice by the provision of the Act which precludes a grant being made in respect of funds raised by loan. Almost all the capital works undertaken by local government arefinancedwith loan funds. The Aged Persons Homes Act must be amended to make finance available to local government in fact as well as in theory. I come to health matters. The Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) repeatedly claims that Australians enjoy a health scheme which is among the best in the world. Independent inquiries by economists and the accumulated experience of medical workers, paramedical workers and patients establish beyond doubt that the Australian health scheme is uneconomic, inefficient and inequitable. The Government has belatedly and unwillingly established a committee to inquire into the health scheme. The Minister has prejudged and prejudiced the deliberations of that committee by requiring it to submit recommendations 'in the context of a voluntary health insurance scheme'. A third of Australia's expenditure on health passes through the hands of voluntary insurance funds characterised by economists as 'intrinsically expensive'. Hospital insurance funds spend 5% of the subscriptions they receive in processing claims; medical insurance funds spend 8%. The Department of Social Services each year dispenses the National Welfare Fund at a cost of 1.6%. Again, it costs the funds 5% of their revenue to collect subscriptions. The operating expenses of the Commonwealth Taxation Branch amount to 1 % of its collections. In all, Australian medical insurance funds retain 24.9% of the subscriptions they receive whereas Canadian medical funds retain 15.1%. In other words, Australians are able to recover in health benefits only $3 for every $4 they pay the funds in subscriptions. Canadians recover $3.40. The Canadian Royal Commission on Health Services in 1964 concluded that: . . . the decisions which Canadians have to make . . . are whether they wish to pay $Canl,020m for physicians' services in 1971 for a programme administered by the insurance industry or $Can837m for a programme administered by government agencies. Australians face a similar choice. Again, under voluntary health insurance whatsoever; 15% have no hospital cover. The uninsured include many of those least able to afford to pay for medical or hospital services. Other low income earners insure themselves and their families at the lowest available rates for a level of cover irrelevant to the real cost of medical and hospital care. The Editor of the 'Lancet', Sir Theodore Fox, wrote of Australia in 1963: The grim ihing about voluntary insurance is the penalty so often exacted from people who chance their luck or who never had any. Australians want a health scheme which will provide proper services at a cost the community can afford to pay. They want a scheme which meets the needs of the entire community, regardless of age or income. They want a scheme which can cope with the demands of all forms of illness, injury or incapacity, regardless of their type, origin or duration. What is required is a Commonwealth health insurance commission, which I have suggested could be financed by a l i % surcharge on income tax, a matching Commonwealth contribution and contributions from compulsory insurers. Such a commission would provide free public treatment without a means test in public hospitals and an equivalent contribution towards the cost of interschool science. Without the inquiry and mediate and private care in public or private hospitals. It would in addition refund to patients or physicians 85% of amounts payable under a schedule of standard medical fees negotiated by representatives of the Commonwealth Government, the health insurance commission and the Australian Medical Association. These proposals could be implemented at a saving of $4.6m in hospital expenditure and $10m in private medical expenditure. Average income earners would secure comprehensive medical and hospital cover at 45% of their present after-tax contribution to benefit funds. Those on an income 50% above average would pay 97% of their present contribution. The main features of this system of universal health insurance are strikingly different from those of our existing system of voluntary health insurance. Subsidies and benefits are distributed in strict accordance with need. The role of fees has been reduced to nominal payments for patientinitiated consultations and optional expenditure for intermediate and private hospital care. Contributions are proportionate to income, and the worth of the scheme is proportionately greatest for those whose income is lowest, those whose number of dependants is largest and those whose need for medical and hospital care is greatest. The principle embodied in the Minister's words of 'the right of a citizen to choose from whom and where he will receive his medical care and how he will pay for it' is in fact given more practical expression and more genuine respect under this form of universal health insurance than under the system of voluntary insurance which the Minister so intemperately justifies and so ineffectually administers. Nowhere is the Government's lack of aid. As to State rights, it must be frankly objective and lack of planning shown more acknowledged that the number of students clearly than in education. The number of completing a secondary education and tertiary scholarships is to be increased in undertaking a tertiary education is now this Budget but the number of students who many times as great as in the days when enter our universities on scholarships will still be 10% smaller than when the peacetime scholarship scheme was introduced 17 years ago. After4 years of grants to the States for school science blocks the Commonwealth will collaborate with three States to develop curricula and related teaching materials in the first 4 years of secondary report which the Commonwealth has undertaken before new university projects, the Budget makes the first instalment of grants of $9m for each of the next 3 calendar years for school libraries as promised by the late Prime Minister in November last year a 14 months interval. University scholarships do no more than provide a student with a free place. Between the two world wars it became possible for Australians to secure free secondary education. We are still no nearer providing them with free tertiary education. Able students should no longer be priced out of a university education. For an additional expenditure of $9m a year all students would be relieved of fees. For this investment the places for which fees are now charged would be filled by students on the basis of academic capacity instead offinancialcapacity. There will never be enough trained teachers and adequate facilities and equipment in government or non-government schools in this country until the Commonwealth sets out to do the same and as much for teacher training and for technical, secondary, primary and pre-school education as it does for universities. Australia will not keep pace with comparable countries in schools, and teachers, government and non-government, until our national Government accepts the same responsibilities as other national governments have already accepted in both federal and unitary systems. going over to Canada. federal government assists. The Commonwealth sdll hesitates to become wholeheartedly involved in schools. It is inhibited by the two issues of State rights and State",50,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69

100,Mr Whtrlamand In Canada The,"only State governments provided funds for education. Commonwealth financial help is already as necessary in secondary schools as it has proved in universities. As to State aid, it must be frankly acknowledged that the Commonwealth must help both the government and the non-government schools and cannot help one sector alone of the dual system. The Commonwealth appointed the Murray Committee on Australian Universities to inquire into and report upon the role and needs of our universities. It established the Australian Universities Commission and has asked industrial judges tb advise on salaries. A similar pattern should be followed as regards schools. In every year since the Murray Committee reported in 1957 my Party has urged in this Parliament that a national inquiry into the needs of pre-school, primary, secondary and technical education be held. A few nongovernment schools have more highly qualified staffs and more ample grounds and facilities than non-government schools. Many non-government schools have larger classes, sparser facilities and more crowded accommodation than government schools. In respect of most non-government schools --the Catholic schools-the parents are no more privileged or affluent than in respect of any government school. A national inquiry into schools would convince the Parliament and the public of the need for Commonwealth assistance for schools as the Murray Committee proved it for the universities 11 years ago. Only the Commonwealth can now ensure that an equal opportunity is given to every student to develop his natural talents irrespective of his parents' locality, religion, to university salaries. It would, of course, means or occupation. On the places, modes and priority of its school grants the Commonwealth should seek advice from a standing council composed of representatives of Commonwealth and State departments, the non-government schools and other educational faculties and institutions. The council should have the staff and functions which the Commonwealth Office of Education was given in the Education Act 1945 and which that Office was denied by Sir Robert Menzies in 1951. It takes many more years to train and these questions. We develop our resources recruit teachers than to erect and equip by overseas investment; we pay our way schools. Teachers are the basis and the by overseas investment. In the words of nucleus of any educational system. Most Australian schools, government or nongovernment, do not have teachers in sufficient numbers or with sufficient qualifications. The Commonwealth should have adopted the proposals for teacher training made by the Martin Committee on the Future of Tertiary Education in Australia; which was appointed in August 1961 and which reported in August 1964. The Commonwealth should now proceed much further in this basic form of tertiary education. Teacher trainees for both government and non-government schools should receive their education with allowances and without fees. They should be free to serve in any State or Territory or with any institution. Because the High Court held 40 years ago that teachers did not work in an industry, teachers have not been able to secure a Commonwealth industrial award and to make the great gains in professional status which have been achieved through the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in recent years by, for : example, engineers. The Commonwealth has circumvented this constitutional shortcoming by asking Mr Justice Eggleston to recommend the level of university salaries which it should support and has now asked Mr Justice Sweeney to do the same for salaries at colleges of advanced education. Sooner or later the Commonwealth will have to seek a report on the salaries which are required to recruit and retain qualified teachers in sufficient numbers in government and non-governmental schools. It could then make grants to meet the difference between fhe present and the recommended school salaries, as it has in relation still be open to teachers to approach their tribunals and employers for higher salaries than those recommended. It is true that in the long term our ability to grapple effectively with any of these problems, from the provision of just and equitable social welfare to the building of adequate roads, depends upon our ability to develop our resources and to pay our way in the world. The Government is content to provide the same answer for both the Leader of the Australian Country Party 'We sell a bit of the farm each year to pay our way'. Estimates of the current account deficit in the Government either expects or wishes 1968-69 range from less than $ 1,000mto be prepared for a moderate worsening the Treasury's implicit estimate-to SI,600m of the balance of payments position. according to the estimate made by the Institute of Applied Economic Research at the University of Melbourne.

It is true that the capital inflow increased the supply of resources. That is the credit side of the ledger. On the other side we need to consider the price that we pay in terms of a rising flow of interest and dividends, and also the danger that a reduction in the rate of inflow may confront the economy with a need for severe and sudden readjustment. The Treasurer apparently does not even consider what we pay for imported capital; it is evidently an article of faith that capital at any price is worth having. But he does recognise the possible instability of the capital inflow. Addressing members of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce on 3rd July, he said: I am not trying to deny that we could have difficulties if capital investment from abroad were a Russian ship captures some of our to fall heavily. As to whether this is likely is a matter on which one could argue interminably. 1 am certainly not going to become involved hi any long term forecasts on the subject. It is not merely long term forecasts that are needed. There is a more urgent question of what is going to happen in this financial year. The Government owes the Parliament a frank statement of its assessment of the prospects for the current year. The only construction which can be placed on the Budget's slightly deflationary tone is that But far more important to this nation's Since Australian companies have been slow to the recent mineral discoveries, there would seem to be a case for direct participation by the public sector. Such activity may be justified on the basis of cost, capability and the control of resources in the national interest. Australian governments are already heavily engaged in undertaking research activities and subsidising exploration and development activities, and their costs and risks would not be significantly increased if they were to become entrepreneurs in their own right. It is many years now since the Deputy Prime Minister began echoing the warnings of the Australian Labor Party about the loss of our national inheritance to overseas companies. The late Prime Minister's approach and that of the present Treasurer was to make occasional speeches to the Australian-American Chamber of Commerce pleading for some Australian equity in overseas companies. The present Prime Minister assumes an air of outrage when marine resources, but is content that half our continent and our most valuable offshore resource, our oil, is up for sale. The Treasurer stands aside and does nothing because his balance of payments problem is helped. Australia's assets can be saved for",58,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69

He went on to attack sluggishness in employment, and he said that private capital expenditure on new buildings was down and that motor vehicle registrations were down. He then referred to the year before when he said that the Treasurer took a similar gamble on an upswing, in other words, he predicted that the Government was being unduly cautious, that a far greater degree of government expenditure was required to stimulate the economy and that we were all facing ruin and disaster. In the light of the forecast by the Leader of (he Opposition what is the position as we come to this year's Budget? Over the year, domestic spending outran domestic production by $618m and, to close the gap, imports exceeded exports by that amount.

The Leader of the Opposition was asking a few minutes ago for figures for the situation over the last few months.

Current levels of approvals and commencements over the last quarter are running at record levels. The commencements, for example, of houses and flats are standing at the rate of III ,000 a year. Approvals for buildings are at the rate of 125,000 a year. The Leader of the Opposition cannot run away from figures. He professes a scorn for an accounting approach. But surely this is do the things that he sets out to do unless he has some regard for the figures? It is no use running away from arithmetic in a subject which affects the lives of all of us as much as a national Budget does. I could go on to give a great number of Leader of the Opposition made out last year as to the state of the economy in the year ahead, which we are now looking back on. I could give to the House similar figures which show that during the year ahead the economy will be buoyant and that therefore the Government, which has a proper sense of national responsibility, could not possibly undertake even a percentage of the expenditures which the Leader of the Opposition advocates in such a wide range of fields. Let me just remind the House of some of the problems that this Government faces. The Leader of the Opposition talked in terms of the squeeze on the States. Now, as it happens, there are three main items of government expenditure in a Budget such as the Government has produced. These items are grants to the Stales, expenditure relating to defence and expenditure respecting national welfare. Those three items together take up approximately two-thirds of the whole Budget. But the item respecting grants to the States is the largest single item in the Commonwealth Budget. And the honourable gentleman refers to the Commonwealth squeeze on the States! This year grants to the States amount to $1.466m. This is just a figure, I suppose, to most people. What we have to look at is how it is arrived at, what it does in terms of its impact on our Budget and how well off in real terms the States are because the formula by which this figure was arrived at was greeted with some acclaim by the State Premiers in 1965. This was a new deal for them and they accepted it gladly, willingly and happily as well they might. It started off from a base figure and it increased on three levels. The first was in proportion to their populations, which is just. The second level was in proportion to the increase in average wage levels. When honourable members look at the increase in wages in the last 12 months they will see that it was about 6%. So, here are two elements of increase automatically built into State budgets. Thirdly, there is a betterment factor that, I think, is 1.2%. The net result of this is that State governments are getting from the Commonwealth, besides the tax reimbursement figure which has its inbuilt betterment element and this inbuilt proportionate increase each year, money which is increasing each year at a faster rate than Government must have regard to one of the gross national product. This poses a problem for the CommonGovernment has approached this problem wealth because, if expenditure for the States with a respect for the rights of the private is increasing at a faster rate than the sector and with an element of caution increase in the gross national product, quite because, in the private sector of the plainly there must be some limitation of the economy, there are signs that the private expenditure by the Commonwealth in other sector to some extent is going ahead rather directions or else increases in taxation, if faster than can be encompassed within the we are to have over the long term an normal containment of necessary governeconomy which will not be subject to quite ment expenditure. great inflationary pressures. Here we have an example of shallow and loose thinking think the Australian community will respect by the Leader of the Opposition when he over the years ahead and has come to refers to the squeeze on the States.

To the economy and indeed for the other provide for the needy people in our comelements of government in the economy. munity is a tremendous problem. At a time Although the Leader of the Opposition spoke of the squeeze on the States, he was highly critical of the performances of State governments and local governments. One is inclined to think that he found so little to attack the Commonwealth for that he had to attack State governments. Honourable members saw it in his reference to the expenditures of State governments on rural roads in relation to urban roads and the expenditures of State governments on country railways in relation to urban railways. The honourable gentleman seemed to indicate that he could perform very well either as a member of a State parliament or as a member of a local council. 1 thought at one stage he almost sounded as if he was standing for a position on a local council in a shire or municipality.

This was probably the listening to you. greatest betrayal of Labor principles, as they used to be understood, that I have ever heard.

105,Mr Griffiths,"What about the Scanber for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths) would have a good look at what has happened in Sweden he would find that the situation there is similar to what could happen here under a Labor Government. The younger people of Sweden are having such a burden placed on them because of increases in taxawhereas an increase in income tax gives tioo to support the older elements in the community that they are tending to leave the country. They are finding that the taxanot attack the basic necessities of life, tion burden is not making it worthwhile to live in that country and they are seeking to go to other parts of the world where the burdens are not so great. The Leader of the Opposition ranged over a very wide field in his attack on the Budget and I do not want to go through his speech detail by detail. He spoke about the items of government expenditure that he proposed in almost visionary language, but when one gets down to plain arithmetic on the figures he presented, as I am sure a lot of honourable members will, one finds that the expenditure for this year would increase tremendously and that the deficit for the year would correspondingly increase. He did not propose, as one might imagine, any increases in taxation. Indeed, he proposed rather less taxation. I suppose that this form of Labor attack on the Budget is traditional because it appears to be popular. According to Labor, every item of taxation is unpopular and every form of cash benefit or other hand-out should be increased. Labor Opposition traditionally puts forward these ideas year after year. I suggest that the economy as a whole, as it has developed over the last few years, gives the lie completely to the picture of the economy painted by the Leader of the Opposition. For example, the honourable gentleman attacked sales tax, although not very vigorously, I must admit. I know that Labor speakers quite frequently attack sales tax. It might interest honourable members to know that Australia has a lower level of indirect taxation than most other countries. In France indirect taxes are equal to 20.8% of the gross national product, less indirect taxes and plus subsidies. In West Germany the figure is 16.4%; in the United Kingdom it is 16.2%; in Australia last year it was 12.9%; and in the United States of America it was 10.3%. So far as I could discover America was the only country with a figure lower than that for Australia. Even by comparison with other western European countries and capitalist countries, indirect taxes are at a fairly reasonable level in Australia. To my mind, indirect taxes offer some relief to a person by giving him a choice whether to save or to spend, him no opportunity to choose whether he will save or spend. Taxation which does which by and large are free of sales tax, has in it an element of equity. To increase sales tax moderately, as the Government has done on this occasion, does help to solve a real budgetary problem. The Leader of the Opposition dismissed the Government's action scornfully as being a mere accounting procedure, as though mere accounting was something which a Labor government would not have to worry about. Indirect taxes do make a very real contribution to the economy without increasing the burden on income tax earners. This is a problem which the Government, as the Treasurer said, does hope can be alleviated in some way in the years ahead. The Leader of the Opposition said nothing of any great consequence about the other great item of Commonwealth expenditure-defenc e expenditure. This is a burden. In this year's Budget it arises very largely because of expenditure undertaken in previous years for goods which are in the process of delivery. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that the Treasurer was only guessing when he gave an estimate of overseas earnings. He tried to indicate that the Treasurer was well out in his estimate. I remind the House that in relation to our balance of payments, there are factors which are indicative of an improvement over the figures for last year. Firstly, outgoings will be less because our defence expenditure, although slightly heavier this year, will not mean substantially increased payments overseas. Total payments overseas will be slightly less. Secondly, our earnings from primary production should be slightly greater because to some extent we have recovered from the disastrous drought which last year upset our primary production. So there is rather more justification for the Treasurer's estimate of our overseas earnings than there is for the",64,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69

107,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) R9.381,"That is one social factor that should be noted when we are considering this question of the distribution of income. If we look again at the total we find that one of the items drawing on the amounts available to people to spend is income tax. In the year 1963-64 income tax payable by individuals amounted to $ 1,272m, which represented 9.1% of the personal income available to the people. By 1967-68 the amount had risen to $2,08lm, or 11.4% of the personal income available, which totalled $ 18,252m. I ask honourable members to note that as a significant factor. In other words a higher proportion of the total spending money available to individuals is now being absorbed by income tax. This is a matter of significance when people are talking about what taxes should be increased and what taxes should be altered. In my view, because of inflation and because of the failure to alter the progressive scale on which income tax is levied, our income tax structure has now become one of the most regressive in the world, at least among those countries that claim that an equitable income tax is an efficient engine of social redistribution. But at least it is clear that there is now a higher proportion of the people's disposable income going in the form of income tax. TheI come to indirect taxes. It is pretty hard to know where the incidence of indirect taxes falls, but at least, expressed again as a proportion of personal incomes, indirect taxes in 1963-64 came to 13.9%, while the figure had risen to 15.3% by 1967-68. AgainI suggest that these are matters that ought to give rise to cogitation by a governlook at the amount of income tax that is ment which claims to believe that the distribution of the total cake is of some significance. That is why I say to the Treasurer, when he talks about raising $44m by certain increases in indirect taxes and asks where else he could go to raise the money, that he should have had the courage to do in the Budget what he says his Government has been considering for a considerable number of years; that is, an alteration of the whole structure of taxagrossly inequitable in the circumstances of tion as it operates in Australia today. Due to the irresponsible social attitude that has been brought to bear on this problem we now have distortions which operate in such a way that the sort of tax we claim to be the most equitable one-incom e tax-bear s most harshly on the family groups in this country whose gross incomes vary from about $1,800 to as high as $4,000 per annum. Neither of those figures is high. than $4,000. in my own way if the honourable member does not mind. If we take the range of taxpayers whose incomes are between $1,800 a year, or about $35 a week, and $4,000 a year, or slightly less than $80 a week, and consider the married taxpayers with dependants to support, we find the kind of taxation situation that I am about to describe. I point out for the honourable member's benefit that the statistics for the year ended June 1965-no t the ones that are before us here-sho w that there were 71,000 taxpayers with incomes of less than $1,800 a year supporting a wife and approximately two children. In the group having incomes from $1,800 a year to $3,000 there were 60,000 married taxpayers, and in the group with incomes between $3,000 and $4,000 there were 397,000 married taxpayers. In those income groups we find a total of nearly 1,100,000 married taxpayers out of a total of 1,365,000 who claimed support of a spouse. More than three-quarters of the total number of married taxpayers were receiving less than $4,000 a year. There are nearly 700,000 married taxpayers with 700,000 dependent wives and nearly 1,400,000 dependent children-thi s is more than one-quarter of the total population of Australia-wh o have actual incomes of less than $58 a week. Let us at present borne by these people. The married taxpayer is now allowed $312 for a wife, $208 for the first child and $156 for the second child. He may have other concessional deductions, such as medical expenses, amounting to $74. If his actual income is $3,000 and his deductions are $750, his taxable income will be $2,250 and he will be liable to pay income tax of $273 a year or $5.15 a week. In my view it is today for a man with a wife and two children earning $3,000 a year to be called on to pay $5 a week in income tax, apart from the amounts he pays in indirect taxation. That is only one example; I could give quite a number of others.",66,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69
108,Dr Mackay,Incomes go much higher,67,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69
109,Mr Creani Will Put This Argument,"I ask honourable members on the Government side to look also at the income tax statistics that are published each year with the Budget papers. They give by grade of income, category of deduction and so on the sorts of concessions that are currently available in the tax structure. This is the sort of tax picture we get: We start with some 4,800,000 taxpayers in the year ended 30th June 1966. Between them they had taxable incomes of nearly SI3,000m. That is the total of the actual incomes. By the time they came to be taxed, the actual incomes of $13,000m had been whittled down to SI0,400m. In other words, there had been a reduction of one-fifth of the original tax base. The deductions that were allowed to various taxpayers aggregated $2,400m. The sum can be worked out. These deductions resulted in the amount of tax collected being reduced by $700m, which is getting reasonably close to one-half of the amount that was collected in income tax. Various dissections can be made. One of the exotic items allowed as a deduction for income tax is life assurance premiums. The aggregate of life assurance premiums deducted in that year was $450m and this resulted in $130m to SI50m less being collected in income tax. At present a maximum deduction of $1,200 per annum can be claimed for life assurance and that is $24 a week. How many people in the community can afford to save $24 a week and why should they be allowed a taxation concession if tbey do so? When we examine the structure, we find that this passes all the way back into the channels of investment. Because life assurance premiums are allowable tax deductions, huge investments in insurance offices are encouraged and these companies in turn place the money in government bonds. Government bonds are allowed a certain concession and some cunning investors say: 'It is better for me to have a bond paying 5% interest because that is as good as 7% on some other sort of investment when the amount of taxation is taken into account'. This is the sort of thing that is happening. I have not the time to go into this in detail tonight, but we can do it when we are debating taxation legislation. If a comprehensive examination were made we would find that most of the concessions that are available do not go to the family man at ail. They go to the people on higher incomes and the value of them or the resulting loss of revenue is greater on the higher incomes. In other words, we have a reverse system of social redistribution. That is one matter I wanted to mention. I also want to examine the rather glib suggestion that the Commonwealth is treating the States fairly. Again the evidence is found within the small compass of some twenty pages in this booklet, 'National Income and Expenditure, 1967-68'. Tables 10, 11 and 12 give details of the amounts spent by the Commonwealth Government on the one hand and by the State governments and local governing authorities on the other. In 1953-54 total Commonwealth taxation was $l,802m. This rose to $4,913m in 1967-68, the last complete year, or an increase from an index of 100 to 273. On the other hand in 1953-54 taxation collections by the State governments and local governing authorities was $282m and this increased to $l,087m in 1967-68. An initial index of 100 becomes an index of 387. In other words, the State governments and local governing authorities have imposed relatively harder taxes over the years than has the Commonwealth, and of course most of the taxes that they levy are indirect and regressive. If we take the Commonwealth grants that were made to the State governments and local governing authorities, we find that they were $342m in 1953-54 or 47% of the total moneys available to those bodies. This increased to $ 1,057m in 1967-68 or only 39.6% of the revenues available to those bodies. The stark picture is shown when we come to capital expenditure. This in in table 16. In 1963-64 Commonwealth capital expenditure on the Post Office and civil aviation was $154m. Expenditure by the States on education and public health was $164m-almos t the same. But in 1967-68 Commonwealth expenditure on civil aviation and the Post Office had risen to $338m whereas expenditure on education and public health capital works totalled $240m. In other words, the Commonwealth was able to spend $100m more on the Post Office and civil aviation than was available to the States for education and public health. It was therefore easier to build a Post Office than a school; it was easier to build an aerodrome than a hospital. tions? basically the allocation is decided by the decline can be seen in the electorate I Commonwealth.

Thising the Budget speech of the Treasurer ( Mr never forget that the work force of this McMahon) and the associated documents and statistics, I am sure that one gains an appreciation of the complexity of a Commonwealth Budget these days. It is very easy for an Opposition to take particular aspects of the Budget and to say that the Government should give more to one activity or to another activity and that the Governmnt should do this or that. A certain amount of criticism can be expected and it will always be suggested that perhaps it would have been better to use money in one direction rather than in another. However1 think everyone will agree, after appreciating the complexity of the Budget and considering what it is supposed to achieve, that the Treasurer is to be congratulated generally on his presentation ol this Budget.

I have been privileged to be a member of this Parliament for 16i years and always it is said that increases in pensions have not been sufficiently large. I suppose those of us who have an appreciation of the problems confronting pensioners might say that increases in pensions never could be sufficiently large. But we must :elate increases in the pension to the overall expenditure of public money. We must country has to provide the money that aoos to pay social service benefits.

In Raymond Terrace in my electorate there are two major industries contributing to the progress and development of the town. 1 refer to Courtaulds (Aust.) Ltd and the Masonite organisation.

I have visited the Courtaulds factory on a",69,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69

I pay a tribute to the executive and staff of Courtaulds for their achievements over a number of years. In many instances they have been battling against great difficulties. I have in mind particularly the production of rayon cord for motor tyres. Efficiency in this industry is second to none. The industry has been able to hold its own with similar industries in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries. I hope that the Tariff Board will give serious consideration to the application which the industry now bas before the Board. I hope also that the Government will consider sympathetically the Board's report on this matter. A great deal has been spoken and expenditure by the Federal Government in written about comments made by Rearcertain spheres of activity, I would prefer to Admiral Crabb about the Royal Australian see additional money given to the States so Navy.

The committee that was established generally. SoI say quite frankly that I to bring about co-operation between State think the remarks made by the rear-admiral and Federal governments has to get moving. should be considered in the light of that background. At the beginning of my speech I made some comment about the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition. If we study his remarks we find two basic features. One, of course, is that it was the normal Socialist, doctrinaire speech that would be made by a leader of Her Majesty's Opposition when that Opposition is formed by the Australian Labor Party. Secondly, we see through this speech the theme of centralisation and centralised control. I may say in this regard that I believe that this Government must be extremely careful to ensure that when 1 a Labor government again occupies the treasury beach, whenever this may happen -it would be only at some time in the far distant future-suc h a government will not find it easy to scramble the egg. Rather than see additional control and additional The Commonwealth has gradually prothere will be an opportunity for a Socialist This brings me to the subject of decentraenterprise move?",70,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69
113,Mr Duthie,"Ho w can we make privateber thinks that Socialism necessarily will achieve more progress, he bas only to look at the record of Labor governments to learn otherwise. What we have to do is give assis'anee to private enterprise. I have seen this done in my electorate where private enterprise has established new industries with assistance from the present Liberal Australian Country Party Government of New South Waits. 1 believe the Federal Government must do more in the field of decentralisation, and I hope that we will see own production and sell it. a great deal more done in the very near future. 1 now wish to touch on the subject of the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia. I have been critical of the Bank in the past and I am still critical of it. I believe that we can say it is not serving the purpose for which it was created. I say frankly that in some instances the Rural Bank of New South Wales is doing more than the Development Bank is doing. Furthermore, the Liberal-Country Party Government in New South Wales has done a great deal more for education and has spent more money in that field since it has been in office than the State Labor Government ever did or spent. A great deal has been said about assistance to primary industry. Along with all my other Country Party colleagues, I appreciate that assistance must be given to secondary industry in certain instances. But I would like to reiterate something that I have said on a number of occasions: While we accent that assistance has lo be given to secondary industry for the sake of the progress and development of this country, we say emphatically that such aid must not be given at the expense of primary industry. If the Government is to assist secondary industry, primary industry also must be given assistance. A great deal of talk about the inefficiency of primary industry has taken place. Honourable members should have a look at what primary industries in Australia have achieved in recent years with fewer persons employed. Honourable members should see what primary industry has achieved in our overseas trade. Our primary producers are at present battling against competition from European countries which, I believe, do not fully appreciate the problems and responsibilities of international trade. 1 believe that it might be just as well for some matters relating to the European Common Market countries to be brought before international trade conferences to see whether charges of dumping can be brought against those countries. As I have said on a number of occasions in this House, the newly developed countries must be given an opportunity to develop. They can develop only if we can help them to expand their With the world situation as it is and with the constant cry that we have to produce more food, 1 cannot understand, for the life of me, why some people knock primary industry in Australia. We should never forget that even though we are making tremendous advances in our mineral fields and are making new discoveries almost daily throughout the Commonwealth, ihe basic strength of our economy is in the agricultural and pastoral primary production of this land. Look at the balance of payments situation. As1 said before, it is all very well for people to say that primary industry is uneconomic and that we ought to do something about it. I have said that it is uneconomic in this way and that in some instances primary industry is more efficient than olher industries. Where uneconomic units exist, the owners have to be bought out and the properties combined with others in order to make economic units. Let us also remember that the prosperity of many country areas depends directly on the local primary industries. I believe that in the field of decent; alisation we should be looking towards establishing in country districts more and more secondary industries that can be linked with the local primary industries. I have covered the preceding matters briefly because of the time available to me. I now want, to say something about the international scene and our responsibilities in this regard. We are facing heavy international responsibilities. There is no doubt about this. If one looks at the international situation and studies events throughout the world, the various conferences and the problems of the newly independent countries and also of the older countries, one becomes more and more aware of the complexity and the difficulty",71,Appropriation Bill No 1 1968 69
114,Mr Lucock,"If the honourable memof the international scene. We in Australia have great opportunities, but with those opportunities go responsibilities. Wc have a great responsibility in the Asian area. 1 have said before that I believe the Asian countries are looking to us for guidance and help. I think that in many instances we can give guidance and help in overcoming the difficulties that are confronting these countries. A great deal of criticism has been voiced against the United States of America. I do not agree with everything that the United States does and says, but I ask people who have faced problems and difficulties to consider what would happen to Australia if the United States withdrew completely and absolutely from South East Asia and if isolationism again reared its head in the United States and that country retired behind a sea barrier. I say with all my strength: God help Australia and the people of Asia il that circumstance ever eventuated. The United States has made mistakes-n o person or nation can live without making mistakesbut with all the mistakes that the United Slates has made, the world, and the western countries in particular, owe a tremendous debt to it for the responsibilities which the American people have accepted in recent years. I turn to the situation in Rhodesia and in South Africa. No one agrees with everything that is done in these countries. The most ridiculous thing that happened recently was when a cricketer named Bland went to the United Kingdom to participate in a cricket match but was not allowed to stay in the country or to play cricket. How ridiculous can a situation get? I have said before that unfortunately it appears that the United Kingdom has not learned its lesson from history. The American War of Independence was caused by a muddle headed king. The situation in Africa and in Rhodesia is being created by a muddle headed Prime Minister and a weak government in the United Kingdom. The sooner we face up to this fact the better. Can anyone look at tbe situation in the Congo and in Nigeria and say that everything that the coloured man does is right and everything the white man does is wrong. I repeat that I do not agree with everything that is being done in Rhodesia and in South Africa, but let us have a look at the situation, with all the complexities of tribal life and with the many different languages that are spoken in these countries. I was in Rhodesia in war time and I have spoken to the people there. Many of the native people in Rhodesia are fearful that the terrorists might get control of that country. At the present time great emphasis is being placed on the quesdon of rights and privileges. Liberal critics everywhere are raising it. People are speaking about the establishment of a Bill of Rights. No one would deny rights and freedoms because they have been won by blood and sacrifice. If ever we accept rights and privileges and forget the responsibilities that go with them, this country will go into eternal darkness. I remind people who are constantly stressing the question of the rights of the individual that they may be creating something the results of which they do not appreciate. I quote some words of the Rev. Dr Norman Vincent Peale, who said: And now Spock is out in the mobs, leading the permissive babies raised on his undisciplined teaching of 'feed 'em whatever they want, don't let them cry, instant gratification of needs'. Two generations of parents who abandoned tbe old American home quality of discipline have caused our universities to inherit neuroses, neglect, permissiveness, creating a student generation that thinks it can get what it yells for. I think we should take note of those words. Let us always be aware and thankful that only a very small' percentage of people in this country are causing disturbances and making demonstrations. The majority of the people realise that with rights and privileges go responsibilities. People who are in positions of responsibility should realise that they must pass this responsibility on to those who follow after them.

116,Mr Turnbull,"Yes. I refer to the debateknow that this statement is out of character with me. I have not spoken in that debate, and I did not make any such statement by interjection. Magna Carta Motion (by Mr Snedden) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. [10.37]I want to raise what is possibly one of the most serious charges that 1 have had the misfortune to have to level against 1 any public servant. I refer to the action of the Librarian of the Australian National Library in removing from this building the almost priceless, terribly important document known as the Magna Carta. This almost priceless document which the Parliament found the money to purchase in 1952 has graced Kings Hall ever since its arrival in Australia. It has been an object of pride and tremendous interest to the 400,000 people who each year visit this building. Recently when I took some high school children from my State to have a look at the Magna Carta, which I believed was in the place which it had occupied for all these of the then Speaker of this Parliament in years, I discovered to my embarrassment in its place a document authorising somebody to open Parliament House in 1927. You can imagine my embarrassment and the disappointment of the children who, havhad to say: ing come all this way, found that they were not able to see the Magna Carta which their teacher had told them could be seen at Parliament House. They did not know, and I did not know, that it had been transferred by Mr White of the National Library without the authority of this Parliament. This is not a party political matter. If one is entitled to draw conclusions from the book which Mr White's daughter wrote about the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr White could be a supporter of the Australian Labor Party. Therefore, I am not assuming that there is anything political about the matter. But I have discovered the culprit. TonightI spoke to the President of the Senate and I discovered from him that he had, to use his own words, 'authorised the removal'. I believe that the President had no right to authorise the removal of this document, much less to base the authorisation upon the flimsy excuse that he gave to me, that is, that the National Library purchased this document and that because it did so-wit h money which Parliament had made available for that purpose-the document now belongs to the National Library. What utter rubbish, Sir. To think that a public servant can successfully con an officer of this Parliament into believing that because Parliament makes money available to buy a priceless thing like the Magna Carta it should now become the property of the National Library! This Parliament made available for the purchase of that document something like £Slgl2,500 in 1952. I want you, Sh. to take notice of the dates because these are terribly relevant to the argument that the Magna Carta is now the property of the National Library. Mr Speaker, can you imagine anything more ridiculous than to say that Magna Carta, of all documents, ought to be removed from the Parliament of the Commonwealth and be taken across to the National Library? Where better else than in Parliament House should Magna Carta be located? Let me quote to the Parliament the words 1952 when it was announced that Magna Carta had been purchased by the government of the day and was to be brought to Australia. This is what the then Speaker The Commonwealth National Library, which is governed by a joint committee of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, has recently acquired in England one of the fourteen known copies of Magna Carta. He went on to say: . . . it will be given a place in this building where it will be open to inspection by honourable members and the general public. The then Prime Minister, Sir Robert, then Mr Menzies said on the same day: It meaning Magna Carta: . . . will be a source of great pride to us to feel that we bave in this place not in the National Library, but in this place: . . . one of the ancient copies of this document. The then Leader of tbe Opposition, Dr Evatt, said: In my view, it is important that the people of Australia should see the document and understand what it means.",73,Personal Explanation
117,Mr Clyde Cameron (Hindmarsh),"Mr Speaker, 400,000 people have been seeing it every year until now. How many of them will see it now that Mr White has it safely ensconced over in the National Library? Senator O'Sullivan, as he then was, speaking on behalf of the Government in the Senate on the same occasion had this to say: It is tit and proper lhat this historic document, right to be taking the property that belongs which is so closely associated with the development and establishment of the rule of law, should find an honoured and an abiding place in the National Parliament of this young country. Were they not fit and proper words to be uttered? Was it not proper that this document of such tremendous historic value and significance to all parliaments should remain forever in the building of the National Parliament of the Commonwealth? And this public servant, this man White, should come across here and talk people into allowing it to be removed! Let me examine the validity of his argument that Magna Carta belongs to the National Library, because the National Library purchased it. Mr Speaker, Magna Carta was purchased in 1952. The National Library was not created until 1960. So, how can a body that did not exist in 1952 -that had no existence until 8 years later -no w claim to be the rightful owner of it? I often wonder whether there are not some valuable paintings in Mr White's pri-ate home because if we extend this principle one step further about shame. If we extend this principle 1 have been able to take it up. I know some one step further there would be every justiof the circumstances about this case. I fication for Mr White to say: 'Well, look, know, Mr Speaker, from what I have heard I was the one who purchased it. I was the from the grapevine, that it was first mooted one who went overseas and got it for the when you were overseas. I know that at National Library. I will hang it up in the the time when you were consulted it was kitchen and have a look at it there each virtually a fait accompli and that a place day.' This is what the National Library had already been prepared for Magna says about itself on page 1 of its publication Carta in the National Library before you the 'National Library of Australia': The National Library has grown out of the your head as well. I know that you did Library of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia founded in 1901. The Library moved, that reluctantly. I know that other officers with Parliament, from Melbourne to Canberra in of this Parliament were not happy-and 1927. In 1923 the Parliamentary Library Committee happy-to see this priceless relic of civil first used the term 'Commonwealth National Library' for those collections acquired for the liberties and the foundation of the rule of purposes beyond tbose of the Parliament and for law taken from where it rightly belongs the ultimate benefit of research and inquiry to and sent across to the National Library for scholars of Australian and overseas affairs. This Mr White to look at. term was in general use until I960. The National Library of Australia was separated from the Library of Parliament by the National Library Act of 1960 and placed under the control of a National Library Council and a National Librarian. The position of National Librarian did not come into existence until 1960. Neither did the National Library come into existence until 1960. The National Library has no to this Parliament-the most important thing that we can lay claim to-Magn a Cartathe very thing that commenced and formed the foundation of the rule of law and all of the things that we stand for. Let me read to the House a quotation from the famous Benjamin Rudyerd who said this: 1 shall be glad I say to see it walk abroad again, with new Vigour and Lustre, attended by the other Six Statutes: For questionless, it will be a general heartening to all. I do not want to see Magna Carta walk again except to walk back into Parliament House where it rightly belongs. This man White ought to be grabbed by Ihe scruff of the neck with one hand and with Magna Carta in the other hand, brought here to give a please explain as to why he should come along and, in the still of the night, snatch from this Parliament without the authority of the Parliament the document known as Magna Carta which cost us £Stgl2,500 to purchase and which 400.000 Australian citizens have gazed upon proudly every year that Parliament is open.

All aspects of overseas investment are kept under continuing study by the Government. The question of whether there would be a need at any time for a committee of inquiry is a policy matter which is not appropriate to be dealt with in an answer to a parliamentary question.

Plans for construction of further fleet units are being consideied but no definite projects c: -n be stated ai this imc. Drought (Question No. 326) . Mr lau Allan asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: Will he give consideration to the preparation of a White Paper giving details of (a; stock and crop losses in eastern Australia since the onset of drought conditions in 1964, (b) the effects and costs of drought relief measures, both Commonwealth and Stale and (c) policies now operating, or contemplated, which may reduce the scale of future disasters of this kind? able member's question is as follows: (a) Statistics of annual production of crops and numbers of stock, and of deaths from all causes of stock on farms, are published by the Commonwealth Statistician. Changes in levels of production and stock numbers are of course the product ol a great many factors and it would not be practicable to quantify precisely the extent to which they reflect the effects of drought. However, a general indication, although very imprecise, of the effects of drought on rural production can be obtained by examining trends over recent years and estimating what the volume of production might have been in the absence of drought. Over the past year or so several statements giving estimates along these lines have been made by Commonwealth Ministers. In this regard reference is made in particular to a statement made by the Treasurer in the House of Representatives on 27th March on the question of Commonwealth Drought Assistance, a press statement of 26th June 1968 by the Treasurer on 'The Economic Situation' and the Minister for Primary Industry's opening address to the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council on Sth and 9th July. (b) Statistics are also readily available oi Commonwealth expenditure on drought relief assistance to the Slates. In this regard reference is made to the 1968-69 White Paper on 'Commonwealth Payments to or fbr the States' and to statements such as that made by the Treasurer in the House of Representatives on 27th March 1968. As the Commonwealth has been reimbursing the Slates for almost the whole cost of their expenditures the figures for Commonwealth drought relief assistance are virtually equivalent to total governmental expenditure on drought relief measures. (c) As regards policies now operating, or contemplated, which may reduce the scale of future droughts, reference is again made to the Treasurer's statement of 27th March, and to the White Paper on 'Commonwealth PaymentsW or for the States,' both referred to above. It will be apparent from these documents that there are a number of Commonwealth measures in operations which, although not solely directed 19511/68-R-[13 ] towards mi;ig.iting t^c effects of future drought*, would clearly help :owards that end. in this context I would make particular mention of the Commonwealth assistance being given to the Stales for the development and control of water resources, including the $50 million scheme to assist the States with suitable water conservation projects, assistance for the development of rural industries, and assistance for the development of roads and railway-, in rural areas. The whole question of drought mitigation is at present under examination by the Commonwealth Government and I do not consider this would be an opportune time for the preparation of a White Paper along the lines suggested. In any event, in view of the material which has been made available publicly and of the practical difficulties involved in assessing the effects of drought, it is doubtful whether any useful purpose would be served by the preparation of such a paper.

However, the official language of The 'revenue' for the Northern Territory theany analogous to the State revenues covered in my of answer of 8th November 1967 to question 651 to, (Hansard page 2854) is the amount provided by Congresstheofnext the Commonwealth to finance running costs and Union, capital works and services in the Territory (other proposition than business undertakings) of a 'State', as distinct quarters he to from a national and municipal, character.

Yes. I said that language differences were a problem in the instantaneous use of television programmes relayed by satellite in that programmes employing language other than English would be comprehensible only to those in Australia who arc able to speak that language. 2. So far as film programmes are concerned, I know that al present the practice of sub-titling or 'dubbing' films in the language of the importing country is adopted to some extent. Presumably, such an idea as the honourable member mentions but this would depend on its being generally accepted throughout the world. This aspect of 3.
