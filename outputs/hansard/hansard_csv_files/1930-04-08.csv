If so, will this delay interfere with the re-arrangement of federal electoral boundaries? cial position the Government has decided to postpone the taking of the census till 1933, and a small measure to-obtain parliamentary sanction of that oourse will be introduced. The postponement of the census will not prevent the periodical redistribution of seats. ment of electoral boundaries take place during the life of this Parliament ? will. The Representation Act provides that the seats Bhall be redistributed in accordance with the population of the Commonwealth ' and the States on enumeration day, which is the day on which the decennial census is taken or any other day appointed by the Chief Electoral Offier at the expiration of five years from the last preceding enumeration day. Aocording to the population statistics thus ascertained a redistribution of seats will take place. DUTY ON POSTUVINO SPHMT-PBIC E o» from a constituent who statesOne man in charge told me the growers will get the Government price for their grapes, but the makers are only going to take from them this year 60 per cent, .of the amount which the growers delivered last year.. So that makes the position very bad for the growers after all the Prime Minister has done on their behalf. Will the Prime Minister, before allowing fortified wine to be. taken out-of bond at the old rate of excise, demand from the wine-makers a bond or written guarantee that they will pay the fixed price for grapes, and take the same quantity as they bought last year ? who will enjoy the bounty on the exported wine will be required to pay the fixed prices for grapes. The larger winemakers are not exporters and, therefore, are not bound to pay the fixed price; but at the conference held in Canberra last week they agreed that, if they were allowed to take their fortified wine from bond at the old rate of duty, they would pay to the growers the fixed price for grapes and take delivery of the normal quantity bought by them last year. To-day the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde) received an assurance from one of the largest winemanufacturers in South Australia that the whole of the grapes grown in South",11,Setup

The Auditor General's report reads as if the practice could have application to all goods placed in bond. As a matter of fact, it applies only to a relatively small quantity of goods, as to which full particulars necessary to assess duty are not to hand, and which are bonded pending the arrival of complete invoices or other documents. DUTY ON CABLES AND WIRE. ; ister for Trade and Customs, upon noticeI . Whether his attention has been drawn to the suggestion made to the Tariff Board by Mr D. J.

With a view to giving local manufacturers an opportunity of getting a share of the trade immediately the new tariff comes into operation, will the Minister give favorable consideration to the suggestion, and consider the advisability of fixing the quota in proportion to the fair monthly average of imports for the corresponding months of the previous year. honourable member's questions are as follow:1. My attention has not hitherto been drawn to the suggestion, as the report of the Tariff Board has not yet beeu received. 2. Wihen tlie report is received, consideration Aircraft Supply Company, will be given to the suggestion. RE-ENGAGEMENT OF RETIRED OFFICER. upon notice1.

Is this officer still in the employ of the Taxation Department ? 3. If so, is it proposed to continue his services? 4. If he is still employed, will the Prime Minister, in view of prevailing unemployment, consider the advisability of terminating the appointment, seeing that the pension accruing is sufficient for the maintenance of the officer concerned, and the vacancy would provide an opportunity for some unfortunate to obtain employment instead of giving a man already well provided for a salary on top of his already liberal retiring allowance? honourable member's questions are as follow:1.

55,Mr Parker Moloney ( H U M E,"Commonwealth. I , therefore, ask for the earnest co-operation of all honourable members in the passing of this legislation, which has been designed to encourage and stimulate this great primary industry. I believe also that I shall not make this appeal in vain, for I am sure that all honourable members, irrespective of party objectives, will discuss this bill in the spirit which has led to its introduction. The Canberra conference was, so far as it was possible to make it, representative of all the organizations in Australia that are associated with the wheat industry. I was totally ignorant of the political views of those who attended that gathering, and I can say, without fear of contradiction, that the schemes which I submitted to them were considered iu an atmosphere from which party feeling was -absent. The object of the bill is to regulate the export and interstate trade in wheat and flour through a board, to be known as the Australian ""Wheat Board, controlled by wheat producers iu order to give effect to the Government policy for an Australian compulsory wheat pool. The Government will guarantee to the growers payment of 4s. a bushel for f.a.q. wheat delivered at country railway stations, plus 8d. a bushel for rail freight, ancl other expenses. The Australian Wheat Board will consist of one representative from each State wheat board, vested under a State law with power to acquire, on behalf of the growers, all wheat grown within the State, to hold such wheat as security against advances, and to sell it to the best advantage. There will also be a representative of the Commonwealth on the Australian Wheat Board. State boards be a government nominee? State boards will consist of nominees of interests of the several States been taken the producers with, I presume, one repreinto consideration? sentative of each State Government; but the producers' representatives will be in State Avas represented at the Canberra a majority on them.

Eveni f a great majority of the wheat-growers of Australia approved of a compulsory wheat pool, the CommonAvealth Government would, be poAverless to give effect to their wishes, Avithout fir3t calling together representatives of State Governments and securing their approval. This approval having been obtained at the conference in Canberra, the next step is to secure the passage of legislation through the Commonwealth and State Parliaments.

The scheme was put before the conference at Canberra only after the Government had exhaustively considered it, and on consultation with the financial authorities, had decided upon the maximum guarantee that it could afford. One of the first points that I put before the conference was that it was uot to be a government pool, but one controlled by the growers themselves; that it was a proposal to assist the wheat-growers to control thoir own business, by making available the necessary legislative machinery to establish a compulsory wheat pool. After a debate that lasted two clays those practical men, representing the wheat-growers of Australia, unanimously carried a motion approving of the Governmeut's proposal, and expressing the belief that it would be an inducement to growers to produce a considerably greater wheat crop during the coming season. After the scheme becomes fully opera^ prices during recent years it would be live the different boards, which will be inadvisable to fix the guarantee for more composed largely of the growers' repre^ than one year. seiitativesj will be in a position to make their own arrangements each year for charters^ handling, shilling put on for election year. transport, selling, and finance.

The matter of any future advance will depend largely upon the recommendations of the boards. They will be fully conversant with the situation, ancl will be in a position to ad,vise the Government if it is considered necessary to come to it for assistance. The Government believes that a great step has been taken towards the stabilization of this important industrv. The Prime Minister stated very definitely at the Canberra conference, and the assurance has since been repeated several times, that this Government will not see the wheat growers of Australia let down in future years. for the first year, but the proposal is to operate for a number of years. and I can tell the honourable member why. This aspect of the matter was discussed by the representatives who attended the conference in Canberra, and notwithstanding the fact that the guarantee was to be for only one year, they unanimously agreed to the proposal. At first glance it may seem strange that a pool should be established for three years .at least, while a price guarantee should be given only for the first year, but we must remember that after the board has made itself familiar with conditions it may consider that a guarantee of something other than 4s. a bushel at railway sidings is necessary.

74,Mr Parker Moloney,"I amindustry in Australia is in dire need of the application of up-to-date methods nf marketing. This view was expressed by all the delegates who attended the Canberra conference, and they were practical wheat-growers who had been associated with the industry for years. Other wheat producing countries have already taken steps to organize the industry, and Australia is lagging far behind. The representatives at the Canberra conference, men of all shades of political opinion, were unanimous that something should be done here to stabilize the industry. A few weeks after the Canberra conference a big convention of representatives of agricultural bureaux was held at Albury, and a resolution was unanimously carried favouring the Government's proposal. Since then, as the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Canadian wheat, and it is obvious that McNeill) reminds me, a conference of wheat-growers, held at Horsham, also endorsed the Government's proposal. That, conference was representative of actual wheat-growers, and in that respect was unlike the conference at St. Arnaud, which was composed to a considerable extent of the friends of merchants and their representatives. informed that the annual conference of fhe Victorian Country party, held at Bennlla unanimously carried a resolution in support of the Government's proposals. Just before the recent, election in South Australia a delegation representing 6,000 wheat-growers in that State waited upon the Premier and told him in unmistakeable language that the wheat-growers of South Austnalia were in favour of a Commonwealth compulsory wheat pool. The Premier did not listen to them, and he is perhaps sorry now that he did not. When we compare our inactivity with a sufficient measure of control to what is being done in other countries in enable it to save itself from the onslaughts the methods becomes even more apparent. is evident -that if Australia decides to remain where she is in regard to this uot only itself but also Australian wheatgreat primary industry, wheat-growers growers. here may be squeezed out of the industry altogether. of and those who 'are opposed to the and the Farm Loan Board of the United principle of wheat pools here have States of America to indicate the great Mr Parker Moloney. pointed to the temporary difficulties being experienced by that pool as a reason why we should steer clear of a. pool altogether. Such persons omit to point out, however, that the Canadian wheat pool controls only 60 per cent, of the wheat produced in Canada. The issue of a compulsory versus a voluntary wheat pool in Canada is becoming a national question there. After being in operation for a number of years, the Canadian pool is now experiencing what I believe to be temporary difficulty. It is receiving powerful support, however, and three provincial governments in Canada have placed their guarantee behind the pool in an endeavour to maintain prices. The Canadian pool has to contend with two difficulties: the first is that it controls, as I have said, only 60 per cent, of such an organization, faced with the fact that 40 per cent, of the country's wheat production is free to be thrown on to the market in any way and at any time, must bo seriously handicapped in its attempt to stabilize the market. That, is one of the difficulties besetting the Canadian pool. On the other hand we I am also have ample evidence of the machinations of great financial combinations in their endeavour to bring about its deabout a fortnight ago, struction. An extract from a recent cablegram received from the Canadian pool reads as follows:""Determined efforts have been made uii several occasions recently to force the pool to liquidate, and in Chicago, to test the Farm Board position."" , Tho Farm Loan Board of the United States of America has been set up to stabilize the primary industries of the States.

76,Mr Parker Moloney,"To achange that has taken place all over the world in the matter of governmental effort to stabilize primary industries. The governments of the progressive countries of the world to-day recognize that it is necessary for them to assist the primary producers to organize their industries. The functions of the Farm Loan Board of rhe United States of America were outlined the other day in a very interesting statement by the chairman of the board. Eo saidTlie Fin-in Loan Board has extensively financed large holdings of wheat, nnd has itself bought surpluses off the market. Generally speaking, the policy of the board has been to enable growers to get a stable price internally. And one of the methods adopted by the Farm Loan Board to secure a stable price internally is apparently to dump the surplus product at any price on the world's markets. The chairman of the board also indicated that the objective of his board was to limit, the production of wheat in the United States of America to domestic needs, with an artificial price, for internal needs independently of world fluctuations. Normally the major portion of the production of wheat in the United States of America is marketed internally. Australia's wheat values have hitherto been governed by world values, and it can easily be seen that if America dumps its surplus, small though it may be when compared with the amount used internally, that must have a considerable influence on the price of wheat in Australia. As honourable members are aware, highly speculative grain markets York and Chicago.. The speculative grain transactions on the Chicago wheat market are estimated to be 40 times larger than tbe actual sales of wheat. recent ""Wall-street crash has shown us the dire results that follow over-speculation in stocks and shares, and if a similar crash takes place on the speculative wheat markets we can imagine the effect they are likely to have on Australia, particularly in regard to the price of wheat. trol in Australia will enable us to control the world's wheat market, or that it will have any great effect on the price of wheat all over the world. But organization in Australia will greatly assist our wheat-growers to withstand any shock brought about by speculative grain transactions overseas, and above all will enable the Australian control to join hands, if necessary, with similar controls overseas in order to withstand the machinations of speculative interests which to-day are trying to stem the evergrowing tide of better organization and stabilization of primary industries apparent in every progressive country in the world. I pass from Canada and the United States of America to the Argentine. No pool operates in the latter country: three national grain firms control over SO per cent, of the wheat crop. These firms have understandings regarding: prices and policies that, are almost as effective as though a pool were in operation; but the benefit of that control is not enjoyed by the growers to any great extent. We had an opportunity recently of noting the great effect of even the present measure of control in the Argentine, when put into operation at a favorable timeWhen the Canadian pool decided to hold its wheat, these three firms rapidly depleted their stocks by rushing theirwheat upon the world's market. business, when it, is carried out by themerchants, is regarded as beneficial. so. There is much objection shown; by merchants to farmers' pools; but "" honourable understandings"" and mergers among merchants themselves must not be criticized. Why should not thehave developed in New growers, who have to bear the 'heat and! burden of the day, come together in a pool, and enjoy the benefitsof organization among themselves? Last weekThe w'e read in . the press that the BritishGovernment is contemplating a purchasescheme for British home-grown wheat, under which it is proposed that, prior toeach planting season, the Government shall state the price that it will pay thefarmers for the crop of a given year'sseeding.

I u practically every progressive country there is a movegrowers cannot afford to shut their eyes ment to bring assistance to this primary industry. There is another aspect of the matter. World importation conditions have undergone a great change since the late war. Formerly it was the custom for importing countries to hold large stocks; now we find, all over the world, that these stocks are very much smaller than they were, and that concentration in buying is practised to a large degree. About 60 per cent, of the wheat consumed in Groat Britain is bought by three great combines. This shows that, from all points of view, the conditions in the trade have changed. If Australia does not adopt some method of organization, its wheat farmers will be at the mercy of the overseas combines and market manipulators. world's parity, too. must be disquieting to everybody who takes aii interest in the wheat position in is in a much stronger position than are Australia to realize that, while such conseveral sellers competing with each other ditions obtain overseas, the growers in Australia are disunited. I remarked upon this fact at the wheat conference recently held at Canberra, and all the representatives of the industry assembled here agreed with me. Everybody connected with the growing of wheat in Australia recognizes that up to the present time the producers have not had an opportunity"" to organize themselves. Owing to the limitations imposed by thp Constitution, effective organization can be brought about only with the aid Of thp Government. Australia are well organized. I realize that good work has been done by the pool in that State, I think that it would have been far more effective if the wholeof the wheat produced in Western Australia had gone into the pool. It is' not too' much to say that we in Australia have heen paying toomuch attention to State boundaries, and acting in a somewhat parochial spirit. The wheat growers have been too individualistic, and have been ignoring the great collective movement that has spread throughout the world. I say definitely that our to that world movement. Tremendous overlapping obtains to-day in the chartering, insuring, and selling of Australian wheat; it is observed at every stage of the marketing process.

89,Mr Lacet;,"Those"" who say that areare not much concerned about it now. MJ . LACEY -We are more concerned than the honourable member has ever been. one-third to one-fourth of the Australian wheat crop is milled locally; in other words, of the 52,000,000 bushels of wheat gristed by Australian millers, Australia consumes about 32,000,000 bushels in the form of flour, and the balance is exported. Obviously, the price of wheat affects the price of flour, but the price of wheat is not reflected in the price of bread. 'fluctuate as muGh as 25 per cent., but we do not see similar variations in bread prices. mation of a federal pool will afford an opportunity to examine it. I have known wheat to be 4s. a bushel, and bread to be no cheaper than when wheat .was 7s. a bushel. The prices of flour, bran and pollard are fixed by the flour millers' associations, but some of the millers are very bad unionists aud break away from organized control. MrM . CAMEROK -Not very often. do, and that is the subject of serious complaint by the associations. I have met representatives of the millers lately, and they have told me that if the pool is formed great advantages will accrue, not -only to the wheat-grower and the consumer, but also to the millers, by enabling the price of flour to be istabilized. At present some millers undercut the assoiciation rates. The price of bread is supposed to be based upon the flour prices fixed by the associations, but to my knowledge the consumer does not get t ie benefit of the cut prices in the form of a cheaper loaf. It is obvious, therefore, that cut prices for flour mean either that the miller pays the farmer a lower price than need be for wheat, or that he allows for such price cutting by charging too much for some of his flour output, or that he is working for practically no profit. -Certainly, the miller does not forgo his profit, and it is safe to assume that neither heen made for the devolution of certain theoonsumer nor the gro wer gets ""the benemembers fit. Another interesting phase of the miller's operations is that .flour is sold to bakers iunder contracts which include what are known as "" f a l l "" clauses. Under these clauses the baker contracts for a given quantity of flour to be delivered over a certain, period, with a proviso that he shall get the advantage of any fall iu flour values, but shall not have to pay any increase of price if the market rises. Here again it is doubtful whether a consumer gets the benefit of these "" f a l l "" clauses. There is no indication that when the price of flour falls below the figure at which the baker has contracted to buy, he In some seasons wheat prices passes the benefit on to the consumer in the form of cheaper bread. the Minister propose to do about that? discussed this matter with groups of millers in various States, and they consider that the benefits to be conferred by the pool, and the agreement for which this bill provides, will be such that better relations between the bakers, millers and -consumers will be possible. It is dear that at present abuses exist in the middleman trade which are prejudicial to both producer and consumer, and we are hopef u l that the agreements set forth in the schedule of the bill will overcome those evils, and remove many conditions that operate to the disadvantage of the wheat grower and the general community. Both will be better protected against speculation than at present. In drafting this measure the aim has been to provide for the wheat-growers' representatives being constituted in the Australian Wheat Board as. a corporate body, :and to enable the pool so constituted to function effectively and to do everything necessary to be done. The Australian Wheat Board will be composed of representatives of the State boards* and we are providing for very great elasticity in the agreements -that will be drawn up between the Central Board and the State boards.

(No. 2) . Debate resumed f r om 4th A p r i l {vide That tlie bill be now read a second time. This is the second attempt of the Government to deal w i th one aspect of our land tax legislation. When a Land Tax Assessment B ill was introduced about a fortnight ago, the members of the Opposition contended that its effect was to make a radical and important alteration of the basis on which land taxation is assessed. That contention was disputed hy the Ministeri n charge of the bill. A further amending measure has now been introduced which Ave are informed has been framed to give effect to the representations of honourable members on this side of the chamber, and to remove the uncertainty which existed as to whether the amending legislation allowed the clearing of land and similar operations to be included in the definition of "" improvements."" In order to bring about that result, a new definition of "" improvements "" is embodied in this bill, and so far as I can see, it successfully attains the objects which it is designed to achieve. In these circumstances, I shall have nothing further to say on that point. I direct the attention of honourable members, however, to the fact that provisions have been left in the bill which though suitable to the measure in its original form , are not suitable to it in its present form . ample,, the definition of ""unimproved value"" applies to unimproved value in relation to improved land; but in the final clause the words ""Assuming that at the time . . . the improvements did not exist"" are used. In the act as it stands at present, the words "" assuming that the improvements had not been made "" are used. The words "" had not been made "" are apt to cover all cases in connection with the clearing of land; the words "" did not exist"" cannot cover such an improvement as may be effected by the clearing of land. It is very difficult to say that the improvements as defined in paragraph a of clause 2, which, for example, include suckering can be regarded as not existing.. It could be regarded as never having been accom plished-as never having been done; but it is a misuse of language to say that it "" did not exist"". Unless the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) has some very good reason for the alteration, he should give consideration to this matter, as it is not desired, I assume, to retain these words to effect an alteration of the law. I come now to a much more importaut matter, and that is the effect of the proviso upon the definition of "" unimproved value "". The proviso readsProvided that the unimproved value shall in no case be less than the sum that would be obtained by deducting the value of improvements from the improved value at tlie time as at which the value is required to be ascertained for the purposes of this act. That proviso' is in the same terms as the definition in the amending measure recently introduced, but it differs fro m the proviso in the existing act, which readsProvided that the added value shall in no case exceed the amount that should reasonably be involved in bringing the unimproved value of the land to its improved value as at the date of assessment. No reason has been given why the existing wording should be altered. A very important issue has arisen through the insertion of this proviso, and the further proviso to the definition of "" value of improvements "" in paragraph c of the same clause. It is laid down that the"" ' Value of improvements,' in relation to land means the added value which the improvements give to the land at the time as at which the value is required to be ascertained For exfor the purposes of this act irrespective of the cost of the improvements: Provided that the added value shall in no case exceed the amount that should reasonably be involved in effecting, at the time ns at which the value is required to be ascertained for the purposes of this act, improvements of equal utility to the existing improvements."".

111,Mr Latham (Kooyong) [4.55],"it directs that the unimproved value may be ascertained by deducting the value of improvements.' That makes a radical and fundamental change in the law. I direct the attention of honourable members to the case of Toohey Limited v. The Valuer General, 1925 A.C. 439, in which' certain words in the New South Wales Valuation of Land Aet, were involved. There was a definition of ""unimproved value"" in that act, which was in these termsTlie unimproved value of land is the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller would require, assuming that the improvements, if any, thereon, or appertaining thereto, and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title, had not been made. That is, practically, the definition in our own act. In that case the facts were that there was a hotel the value of which, with the land upon which it stood, was agreed to be £24,100.

What the act requires is really That would have very far-reaching quite simple. Here is a plot of land; assume that there is nothing on it in the way of results. improvements, what would it fetch in the vision in the present act has not, market ? Mr Latham. Later, they observedThe valuer has not applied himself to the only questions presented to him by the act and it is his business to do so. But, as already said, the result obtained is not only contrary to the method permitted by the act, but is demonstrably fallacious. Proceedings are begun by the taking of a figure for the subject as it stands as licensed premises. It is obvious that this figure is composed of three ingredients; first, the bare land itself; second, the buildings themselves constructed for, and appropriate for, licensed premises; third, tlie enhanced value due to the fact that the land and buildings in question are not only suitable for licensed premises but are in fact licensed premises. When, however, the subtraction sum is entered upon, it is only item 2 that is subtracted from the total figure; the result being that item 3 is all included in the unimproved value. From this follows the extraordinary result that the land is enhanced by the value of a licence which oould only be granted in connection with buildings-for ' a licence such as this cannot be granted to sell liquor without premises-in a calculation in which you are told to assume that no building is there. from the total value of the business and counsel, saidI agree with what Mr Owen Dixon said improved land as it would be improved under Their Lordships went on to proper conditions, is worth and deducting the cost of improving it, you cannot find what the The somewhat similar proup to the present, produced the results that I have indicated; but having regard to the definition of "" value of improvements "" which appears in this measure, those results must follow. I now ask the attention of honourable members to another point which arises in *to of improvements""; I refer particularly to the words "" improvements of equal utility to the existing improvements."" Apparently a limit is to be imposed on the value of improvements by requiring a calculation to be made of the value of improvements of "" equal utility "" or usefulness to the existing improvements. Let us take a simple case to see what might happen under a provision of this kind. A house which cost a certain sum may be standing on a piece of land, but a house of equal usefulness might be built for half the money. I should like the Treasurer to explain why this idea of "" equal u t i l it y"" is brought into this definition, unless it is intended to ""draw a distinction between the value of the actual improvements on the land and the value of improvements which could he described as of "" equal utility."" A man may have on his farm a six-wire fence and the valuer may come along and say that a three-wire fence on that farm would be of ""equal utility."" The proviso really says that the added value is to be limited by a consideration of the cost of effecting improvements of equal utility to those existing on the land. Apparently "" equal utility "" is the only thing to be consideredA man who might have on his property a dam well finished with stone, cement, and the like might be debarred from claiming deductions in respect of it because it might be possible to obtain an equally serviceable water supply by merely making a hole in the ground. If the words do not mean that consideration is to be given to "" i m provements of equal utility to the existing improvements"" they do not mean anything. The words "" equal utility "" mean something or they mean nothing, and I assume that they are significant. It is of no use to tell me that they do not mean anything. Either in applying this proviso the valuer is to consider the cost of effectnew ing improvements of equal utility to the existing improvements, or he is not to do so. If he is not to do so, the words should be eliminated. It appears to me that the words can be there only for the purpose of setting up a standard of cost. I do not think that they are put there for the purpose of assisting the taxpayer. They are connection with the proviso there, it seems to me, solely for the purthe definition of ""value pose of determining the measurement in money, or the maximum value, to be allowed for existing improvements. That, maximum is to be determined not by what it cost to effect the improvements in particular cases, but by the cost of effecting improvements of equal usefulness. In other words, the measure of value is to be a measure of usefulness. A telegram which I have received from a constituent in Melbourne puts the matter clearly. It readsThere are grave fears that equal utility will lead to increased assessments. No allowance is possible for other than strictly utilitarian improvements of plainest design and cheapest material. It seems to me that the words "" equal utility "" are to be read in relation to ithe profit-making capacity of the land. They must mean something, and that appears to be their obvious meaning. If they do not mean that, I should like to hear what it is supposed that they do mean and why, indeed, there is any reference in the definition to "" equal utility."" I congratulate the Treasurer upon having accepted the view which honourable members expressed in the debate on the previous Land Tax Assessment Bill. As the honourable gentleman said in his second-reading speech, the altered definitions meet the views that were put forward in the previous debate. It was the desire of honourable members that, in cases where the land had been allowed to depreciate in value, the money actually expended hy a new owner in improvements should be taken into account in determining the unimproved value. I take it that the words now used in the bill mean what the Prime Minister and Treasurer said the words in the previous bill meant, namely, that if such land had no unimproved value in the first place, it would have no unimproved value through the expenditure of money by the owner in improving it. ""While congratulating the Minister on being able to satisfy honourable members",26,Second Reading
112,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper) [5.14],"on this side on that particular point, I wish to express my sympathy with him. As one who has had much to do with taxation legislation, I am well aware that when an attempt is made to deal with a certain aspect of taxation prohlems, not infrequently other problems, not then foreseen, present themselves. I hope that the Minister will give careful thought to the representations made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) in connection first of all with ascertaining the unimproved value under the proviso. I do not wish to add anything to what the Leader of the Opposition has said on that point, but I purpose devoting attention, for a few minutes, to the subject of "" equal utility."" It seems to me that something should be done to put beyond doubt the use which will be made of this provision. Tlie proviso to paragraph c reads:Provided that the added value shall in no eiise exceed the amount that should reasonably be involved in effecting, at the time as at which the value is required to be ascertained for the purposes of this act, improvements of equal u t i l it y to the existing improvements. Consider first of all the cost of fencing. The owner of a property may take the view that 6-inch posts are necessary to properly fence his land, but the valuer may he of the opinion that if 4-inch posts had been used improvements of equal utility would have been effected. In such a case as that it would be an injustice if , in determining the unimproved value, the actual cost of improvements were not allowed. The same argument may be applied to the construction of a dam. The owner may consider that a permanent dam is necessary and may carry out the construction in concrete. Surely an improvement of a permanent nature should be regarded as a valuable asset as compared with a dam of inferior construction which might call for expenditure year after year to maintain it in an efficient condition. Our aim should be to encourage owners of land to carry out permanent rather than temporary To deal justly with all taxpayers the department should allow the actual cost of improvements to be deducted from the improved value in ascertaining the unimproved value of property. If value is added to land over and above what the taxation, authority considers necessary, it Dr. Earle Page. gets an advantage in connection with its improved value. The Government surely cannot expect to have it both ways. If deduction is not allowed in respect of actual value -improvements, even if the valuer considers that improvements of equal utility could have been effected at a lower cost, the Government will not be meting out fair even-handed justice to the taxpayers, which I am sure the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) wishes to do, by his wording of the section. When considering legislation of this nature the definition clauses should be examined with extreme care so as to avoid injustice being done to a section of taxpayers. The Government, I am sure, is just as auxious as are honourable members on this side of the House to deal fairly with landowners. In the discussion on the previous measure the Treasurer showed a conciliatory spirit, ancl by submitting certain amendments, met objections that had been raised by honourable members on this side. I hope he will be prepared to meet us in regard to these points as well. It is not for me to argue as to what these words mean. That is a matter for members of the legal fraternity and the draftsman of the bill. WhatI am concerned with is to make certain that in determinr ing the final form of this particular proviso, the principles of equity ancl justice will be established. If the Treasurer can assure us that, in its present form, the bill will operate equitably, I am prepared to accept it, but there appears to be a great element of doubt, about it. Honourable members are indebted to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) for having raised these points. It is a pity that the provisions of this amending bill are .of such a complex nature. I should like to impress upon the Minister the fact that considerable areas of land could not be sold for the cost of the improvements put upon them. Our object should be to encourage owners to improvements. make substantial improvements. If , through ignorance of the view taken by the taxation authorities, a man spends a considerable sum in improving his property, iu ascertaining its unimproved value he should be allowed to deduct the cost of such improvements. The taxation authorities should not have the right to",28,Second Reading
113,Mr Prowse (Porrest) [5.22],"determine the nature of the improvements which an owner should put upon his land. To guard against the fire risk, he may decide to use stone for the building of his woolshed, and he may consider that a five-stand shed is required, whereas a departmental valuer may hold the view that a woolshed of four stands nnd built of timber would meet his needs; regardless of the fact that a wooden building might be burned down during the following summer. When people decide to go upon the land they should be unrestricted in their choice of improvements which they consider desirable. For instance, a man may resolve to build a modern home with all modern conveniences. Because he lives in the country he should not be denied the comforts enjoyed by dwellers in our cities, if he is in a position to provide them. YetI know of cases in which the Taxation Department has declined to allow deductions of more than one-half the value of such improvements. Treatment such us this discourages people living in the country from carrying out improvements ""which otherwise they might decide to have on their properties. I hope that the Treasurer will give careful consideration to the amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), so that this measure may become a permanent part of our statutes, and not require amendment from time to time. -Whil e we all desire to deal justly by land-owners in the country, we should see that the revenue is adequately protected. It is no secret that if a man wishes to evade taxation sometimes he spends an undue amount upon improvements. Proprietors of picture theatres in our capital cities have expended huge sums on the erection of palatial buildings with a view to hiding their profits and escaping taxation. This is not fair to other sections of taxpayers. I agree that some injustice might result from the interpretation of this amending bill, but the Government's purpose, I take it, is to protect the revenue. I do not say that farmers deliberately spend more than is necessary on improvements, but I am sure all honourable members will agree that the taxation authorities should be able to exercise discretion in ascertaining the unimproved value of a property. I wish to stress the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) as to the desirability of reverting to the phraseology of the aet. Paragraph, b of clause 2, referring to "" unimproved value"" in relation to improved land, mentions the value which it would have "" assuming . . . the improvements did not exist"". The Leader of the Opposition has argued that the words "" assuming . . the improvements had not been made"" are preferable. It seems to me that ' the word "" exist"" might be so construed as to exclude altogether consideration of improvements which were not visible. Por example, trees may have been cleared off land, and there may be uo tangible evidence that they had ever been on the land. I also direct attention to paragraph c of clause 2, dealing with the value of improvements. This reads:"" ' V a l u e of improvements,' in relation to land, means the added value which the improvements give to the land at the time as at which the value is required to he ascertained for the purposes of this act irrespective of the cost of the improvements: Provided that the added value shall in no ease exceed the amount that should reasonably be involved in effecting, at the time as at which the value is required to he ascertained for the purposes of this act, improvements of equal utilit y to the existing improvements."" The Leader of the Opposition has already dealt with the phrase "" improvements of equal utility"", and I do not wish to merely repeat his observations on that particular point. In the paragraph' quoted it seems to me that the taxation authorities are really playing with a double-headed penny. Let me give a concrere illustration. A man might spend £4 an acre in improving his property and yet increase its value by only £2 an acre. Another man might spend £2 an acre in effecting improvements by which the value of the property would be increased by £4 an acre. The practice of the department is to allow the owner, in the former case, to deduct only the actual value of the improvements irrespective of their cost. There is no objection, to that; but the same principle of sticking to actual value of improvements and disregarding cost should be maintained right through. This is not",29,Second Reading

115,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [5.27],"clone, because in the case of a man who by a wise expenditure of £2 per acre increases the value of his property by £4, the department values the improvements at only £2 an acre. If the man who has spent more on his property than the amount by which its value is increased is allowed to deduct only the actual value of the improvements, then the-other man should also be allowed to deduct the actual value of the improvements irrespective of their cost he has effected, notwithstanding that the amount spent by him was less. The deparment should not be able to have it both ways; it should not, as at present, play with a doublebeaded penny. ringah) [5.23] -When the previous bill dealing with this matter was before the House we were told that it could not be altered because the best legal opinion in the community had been invited in order to ensure that the definitions should state exactly what the department meant. Apparently, that view was incorrect, for in another place that bill was amended. Now we have before us a bill which, while free from the objection referred to, contains other attempts by the department to increase its revenue at the expense of the taxpayers. nothing that was not originally intended, or was not in the earlier bill. Were the words "" did not exist"" in the previous bill? utility"" were not in the earlier bill; it contained the words "" of a nature and efficiency equal to."" have always protested-and I protest now -agains t the department being the adjudicator in these matters, forcing taxpayers to be for ever engaged in argument with the departmental officers. The ordinary taxpayer has no chance whatever against the department, for, in order to establish his claim, he must take extraordinary measures and incur heavy costs. The law should be clear; this discretionary power should not bevested in any departmental officer. Should a taxpayer dispute the ruling of the department, the commissioner may take the case -,to the court. In that case, while the taxpayer has to defend himself at his own expense, the commissioner fights the case with money provided by the taxpayers generally. In some instances, cases have been taken from court to court. That should, not be so; it is unfair. It would appear either that Toohey's case has not been considered, or that the department is deliberately seeking to include this provision in the bill in order to override the decision in that case, as has been done on numberless occasions before. It is unfair to include the value of a licence in the unimproved value of any land. the honourable member. Then the position ought to be made perfectly clear. There are not many cases of , taxpayers endeavouring to evade payment of taxation by effecting unnecessarily extravagant improvements; and, therefore, it is unfair to add the words "" of equal utility to the existing improvements."" The inclusion of those words places too much power in the hands of the department. Let us take the case of David Jones& Company of Sydney. That firm pays in land taxation about £24,000 per annum. The tax is, naturally, passed on to the consumers in the shape of increased prices for their goods. The firm has built a new store replete with all the latest hygienic inventions and conveniences for the benefit of its employees. Should the firm say to the Commissioner that it had expended its money in erecting a building -which would provide proper accommodation for its employees, the Commissioner could say that while that may be so, a store of equal utility could have been built at much less cost. In that event' the I firm would be penalized for having given consideration to the comfort of its many hundreds of employees. I stress the advisability of omitting the words "" of equal utility to the existing improvements "" in order to permit of the actual cost of improvements being deducted when ascertaining the unimproved value of any land. urge the Treasurer to revert to the wording of the original billProvided that the added value shall in no case exceed the amount that would reasonably be involved in effecting, at the time as at which the value is required to be ascertained",30,Second Reading

I realize that the Treasurer must receive revenue by way of taxation; but it is more important that no obstacle shall be placed in the way of improving our rural lands. It is conceivable that, should valuers challenge improvements on the ground that they are unnecessarily extravagant, land-owners might be diffident about effecting the improvements which otherwise they would make. Eor instance, a valuer might not agree with an owner as to the extent to which subdivision should be carried out. He might say that it would have been sufficient to divide a holding into five paddocks instead of ten. Or a valuer might say that, considering the rainfall of a district, a dam of 6,000 cubic yards capacity would be sufficient when the owner had constructed a dam with a capacity of 8,000 cubic yards. might spend money in providing plantations, either as shelters for his stock or for the decoration of ths countryside, and the valuer contend that, in the latter case, the money was not spent on improvements. I submit that the collection of land tax was never intended to militate against the making of legitimate improvements, or even against effecting improvements which enhance the attractiveness of a property. that the department must protect itself against the making of improvements in order to conceal profits, or improvements which might properly be regarded as extravagant or fanciful. view should be taken of improvements when deductions are being considered, and I strongly urge the Treasurer to modify the new phrasing, if he possibly can. [5.46] A great deal of attention has been given to the drafting of this bill, which supplements another measure that recently was the subject of contention here, the main desire being to put its provisions into a form which will re-establish the law as it has been administered for many years, and to meet some of the bona fide objections that have been raised in this chamber and in another place, to the wording proposed to that end. There was no wish, as may be suggested by some critics, to . work in new principles of definition that might enable the department to raise taxation that was never originally intended to be imposed. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) called attention to the words "" of equal utility"" which appear in the proviso defining "" value of improvements,"" and said that they did not appear in the previous bill. They were put into this measure at the suggestion of the Solicitor-General, in order to bring the proviso into conformity with other definitions in which the term "" u t i l it y"" is used-of course for a more restricted purpose. This term is used there to define more clearly what was intended in regard to that class of improvement, such as clearing or suckering of land, which is. to. be taken into account in determining the unimproved value of the land. Again, a landowner The Solicitor-General has used the words "" of equal utility "" in the proviso instead of the term originally employed; but I am quite willing to reinstate the original words if , as has been suggested, they will be more satisfactory to honourable members generally. I quite agree with the Leader of the Opposition that fortuitous circumstances, such as the value of a hotel licence, should I recognize not be taxed as part of the unimproved value of the land on which the hotel is situated, which was the issue in the Toohey case.

Frequently the unimproved value of land can only be guessed at, because there have been few or no recent sales of land in an unimproved state in the area under review, and it is essential, therefore, to have some formula by which the department can arrive at a reasonable and bona fide unimproved value for taxation purposes. The desire of the authorities is to establish such a formula, and I can do no less than accept the assurance of the legal advisors of the Government that this bill does not provide that, in arriving at such a formula, the value of a licence or goodwill shall inflate the unimproved value of a property. I am not speaking on my own authority as to what is the legal meaning of these words; the matter must necessarily rest with highly trained technical men. a man puts a £3,000 house on his property and the department thinks that it should only have cost £1,500. will not act in a way contrary to the requirements of the law. A man might spend a large sum of money iipon something which, in his view, improved the land, hut which was really of little use, and, therefore, did not greatly increase the capital value of the property. If a man has spent £10,000 on such a work, he would not be entitled to deduct £10,000 for improvements, if its sale value to a willing purchaser was less than £10,000.

That is the very difficulty we are endeavoring to overcome.

The proviso to proposed paraI have already quoted these marked graph b is entirely new-. A method of passages. One of the alterations made arriving at unimproved value which has in this bill is of a nature not generally been condemned as wrong by the Privy realized. In the act as it stands at Council and by the High Court is being present, there is a definition of unimintroduced. I shall read from an opinion proved value; there is also a definition given by Mr Ham, KC., and Mr of value of improvements, but not of Fullagar. of the Victorian Bar, in referimprovements. There is nothing in the ence to the proviso to the definition of present act to justify any one in saying "" unimproved value ""The mere deduction of the value of improveby deducting the value of improvementsments from improved value results, of course, from the improved value. frequently in imputing to the value of the land as part of its unimproved value, the ""value of improvements"" in the act, result of the exercise of human judgment and occurs only in section 4S, and is used for effort in the creation of a land-holding which one specific purpose only. Section 4S is suitable for a commercial use, i.e., as a provides that if a taxpayer makes a return money-making machine. For example, take the case of a station property on which buildfor his 'land which is 25 per cent, below ings, fences, dams, and so on have been conthe proper value, the Commonwealth may structed, all with a view to putting the property to commercial use as a station, but which may have depreciated in value themselves. The mere deduction of value of improvements from improved value will clearly result in imputing a fictitious unimproved value to the. land. The methods of calculation referred to in the proviso may be useful in many cases as setting an outside l i m it beyond which a buyer would not go for the land, but it generally includes something more than the unimproved value of the land. It has hitherto been recognized that this mere deduction of value of improvements from the improved value is not itself a proper method of arriving at unimproved value. It is directly contrary to what was laid down in Toohey's case (supra) which both Mr Justice Isaacs in his dissenting judgment and the Commissioner profess to follow. See Jowett v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation 38, C.L.R., 325. This method would clearly result in many cases where the cost of clearing and improving land has been greater than the value of the improved land in imputing a fictitious unimproved value to land which in fact had none.

The result is that what may be generally a perfectly good rule-of-thumb method of ascertaining unimproved value is erected into a standard for the purpose of fixing the minimum unimproved value. In the case of a licensed house, such a standard would operate unjustly. Por a suburban house situated on a block of land, a practical method of arriving at the unimproved value would be to take the improved value and deduct the value of the house, having regard to depreciation, and what it would cost to build a similar house. That is probably a good practical method; but to make that a universal rule for the purpose of fixing the limit of unimproved value is a different thing. I am concerned with the effect of applying such a rule generally. WhatI have said about a licensed house applies in the case of any business being carried on upon premises. I therefore suggest that the safest thing to sence of a detriment. do in order to avoid upsetting our system of land taxation is to omit these two provisos, and put in one proviso to the definition of ""value of improvements "" in the same terms as in the existing act. The alteration of these defithe meaning, certainly, but "" made "" is a nitions has nothing to do, so far as I can see, with the object of the bill, which is to make a just allowance in respect of improvements of a capital nature, such as the clearing of land, including clearing land of prickly pear, but to exclude consideration, for land tax purposes, of operations on the land in the nature of maintenance. Allowance for that is made in assessing income tax, but not in assessby assuming that the improvements were ing land tax. With that I agree. The first of these alterations will result in altering the whole basis of our present system as declared by the High Court and the Privy Council, and that result is produced by the new definition of value of I am inclined to improvements as incorporated into the definition of unimproved value. I ask the Treasurer to reconsider the point I raised about the words "" d i d not exist."" If the words ""had not been made,"" are inserted in lieu of them, there In this bill, somecannot be any contention that maintenance expenditure is to be regarded as an improvement, because the definition of improvements itself excludes that. Improvements include destruction of vegetable growths, subject to the conditions set out. From the point of view of good English only, it is not right to say "" assuming that . . . the improvements did not exist"", because that really means, as the definition is worded, "" assuming that the destruction of vegetable growths did not exist."" "" assuming that the destruction of' vegetable growths had not been carried out."" meant, but as the sentence is constructed, that is not what it says. To leave the wording unchanged is simply to invite trouble. Personally, I am inclined to think that the definition of improvements is so clear on this point that such a difficulty might not arise. It is better, however, to employ the words "" had not been made "" because it is a phrase able to cover not only the presence of what is ordinarily called an improvement, but also the abphrase ""had not been effected"" imply what is meant, better even than ""had not been made""? good old Anglo-Saxon word, which includes to do things, to achieve them or to accomplish them, and has. many other synonyms. Therefore, I move That the proviso in paragraph b be omitted. That would leave matters substantially as they are. The act would then provide that unimproved value is to be arrived at not there.

It was my intention to mention them on the second reading but anticipating that the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) would be open to suggestions in committee, I refrained from doing so. According to legal advice secured by graziers in South Australia, this bill will deprive some people of allowances they have previously been able to claim in making their land tax returns. The land tax assessment legislation which the Treasurer has introduced, is designed to overcome two recent decisions of the court. In one case, the court has decided that there is no improved value if a lease is subject to reappraisement or resumption either in whole or in part. Provision was made in the bill passed a fortnight ago to overcome that decision. The second decision of the court, in regard to land taken possession of by noxious weeds adjoining hind on which the owners, by the expenditure of money, have been able to keep their property clean, has been covered by paragraph a of the clause now before the committee. In the past improvements unwisely effected have been used as a means of reducing assessments because they happen to be on the land assessed; but paragraphs b and c of the clause ensure that extravagant improvements may not be so used. According to the bill the portion of the price of the land attributable to improvements must not exceed either the cost of effecting those improvements, or the added value which they give to the land, but I propose by quoting one or two examples of how the act operates, to show how thoroughly the rights of the Commissioner of Taxation are already safeguarded without the two phrases which the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr volved in finding water, because the bore Latham) regards as objectionable features of the present bill. less country, by the discovery at a low cost of au Underground supply of water, the value of land is raised ment will exist. There is no doubt that from almost nothing to possibly thousands in the case mentioned allowance will be of pounds, the revenue is already amply made for the cost of the bore. safeguarded, as it would be under the bill, even without one of the objectionable made for putting down two or three prosphrases referred to, because the value pecting bores? of the improvement effected is greater than the actual cost of effecting the improvement. If , on the other hand, a bore put down at a heavy cost succeeds in finding only a small supply of fresh water which slightly increases the value of the land, the cost of putting down a well aud equipping it is greater than the improvement effected to the land, and the revenue is also amply protected, because the allowance made must not exceed the added value given by the improvement to the land. ways. legal advice I have, which has been reinforced by that of the Leader of the Opposition, the clause now under consideration goes further than the mere securing of revenue in both ways; it cuts out certain allowances which could previously be deducted. The most striking example brought forward this afternoon was the Toohey case, in which the goodwill or value of a hotel licence was affected, and the Treasurer said that the opinion of the Taxation Department was that anything intangible of that description would not be taxed as unimproved value. I accept that assurance; but, reverting to the subject of water, I wish to point, out that in the leasehold areas of Australia there are millions of acres which can be provided with water at a cost; and the principal cost is incurred in prospecting for that water. In some cases it is necessary to put down a bore and then sink a well on the site of the bore, but according to the opinion given to the graziers of South Australia, the words "" did not exist"", which this bill proposes to substitute for the words "" had not been made "" deprive the leaseholder of the right to claim an allowance for the f u l l expenditure inwill not exist once a well is sunk o.n top of If in waterit.",35,Second Reading

At one time no allowance could be claimed on the land tax return for the cost of that prospecting work, but recently, under the phrase "" had not been made "", allowance bas been made for it. in the bill will not have the effect of disallowing what has already been allowed in practice in respect of that particular class of work in improving property. surer for his assurance on that point. There is another case in which there is something intangible which sometimes is not very easy to assess as an actual concrete visible and material existence on the land. In many farming districts there are fully improved farms with patches of scrub country. In most of these cases the value of the unimproved scrub country is much below that of the improved farm land less the value of its improvements. The Treasurer mentioned this afternoon cases iu which it was necessary to take the value of the improved farm less the cost of the improvements to arrive at the unimproved value in cases where there were no sales of unimproved land. I am not contesting that point at present, but there are cases where there are sales of unimproved land alongside improved land, and the price it brings is much below the conventional unimproved value at which the Commissioner of Taxation assesses the improved farm land adjoining. The difference in that case is probably due to various intangible causes, because of the risk of getting a poor crop when the land is half cleared, because it is necessary to get a good stubble burn to check the shoots, or possibly because of the wear and tear of pioneering work. Another factor to be taken into consideration is the additional cost incurred in clearing the first block in the district. The first settlers who go into a. district have to pay decidedly more for their cartage and for most of their laboiir. Possibly, they may have to pay for carting water and horse feed. Everything is more expensive to the pioneer. He has to put up with infinitely more discomfort than the people who come later. In the course of time the actual record of all that additional expenditure is lost. There is, however, alongside the improved land of the pioneer, unimproved land which sells in certain cases for very much less than the conventional unimproved value which the Commissioner of Taxation by this bill, and until quite recently under the existing law, is compelled to place upon the improved farm. I take it that this case would be covered as it has recently been covered by the omission of the words "" equal utility "" and by the substitution of "" had been made "" for "" did not exist "". Tbe phrase ""equal utility"" is dangerous in assessing the value of improverneuts. There may be cases where land is used for a specific purpose. I u order to use it for that purpose, the holder may have overimproved it for the average use to which laud iu that particular district is put. I have made it clear that the revenue is amply protected in the definition and that under the bill as it stands there would be a decided risk of some of the improvements being taxed. [8.16] -Tw o or three points have been raised, first by the Leader of the Opposition. ( Mr Latham), and supported by other honourable members, to which I desire to reply. The most important mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition is that in which he infers that a complete change in the principle of the law is made by giving a new significance to the definition of ""value of improvements "" by importing this phrase into the definition of "" unimproved value."" 1 carefully followed the honourable member when he was speaking on that point, and I shall endeavour to answer his argument.

159,Mr Theodore (Dalley,"Treasurer )department. certain cases before the High Court, and, if judgment were not given upon the point, at airy rate legal comment was made upon it. I find that in the case of Kiddle v. The Deputy Federal Commiss-ioner of Taxation, heard before the High Court on the 25th November, 1919the judgment is recorded in one of the appendices to the report of the Commissioner of Taxation-Chief Justice Ivuox saidl propose, therefore, to deal with these appeals by finding the "" improved value,"" as defined by the act, of the whole area, and deducting froni that amount the sum which represents the "" value of improvements"" as defined by the act. Elis Honor then proceeded to arrive at the unimproved value in the very way which it is proposed in the bill now under consideration shall be the statutory practice. This point was not overlooked by counsel, who specially advised the department with respect to the proposed bili, when it, was under consideration subsequent to the decision in the McGeoch ease. Mr Jordan, in submitting his advice, made this referenceUntil Toohcy's case, 1925, A.C., 439, it had been universally assumed that a legitimate method of ascertaining the unimproved value of improved land was to ascertain the improved value and deduct therefrom the value of the existing improvements. There, counsel laid it down that it had beeu the universal practice, until the Toohey case in. 1925, to proceed upon those assumptions and to arrive at the unimproved value by that process, which, to any reasonable man would seem to be the only practical way to ascertain it, so long as provision is made to exclude from consideration, those extraneous influences that might otherwise inflate the unimproved value, such as the intangible values member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) has been speaking. These intangible values certainly are of great importance, because we do not want the department to follow a practice that would establish a fictitious value for unimproved landa kind of legal fiction that assumes for taxation purposes a value that does not exist. We do not want to do that. Speaking as Treasurer and for the Taxation Department-and I presume, also, for this committeeI say that what we either [371 The question arose in want to arrive at as the basis of taxation, is the real unimproved value of land, as nearly as we can ascertain it. To dq that we have to provide a measure that authorizes the department to proceed in a certain way. I frankly admit that we want to avoid the possibility of interpretations that would lead to fictitious unimproved values, ""and, therefore, in view of the points that have been raised, it may be desirable -to make an amendment to prevent this class of intangible values being taken into account. Mr Bonniwell, of the Crown Law Department, has prepared the following memorandum dealing with hotel licences:It has been the practice to treat the licence as being attached, not to the land, but to the person of the licensee. This view has, from time to time, had the support of lawyers, so apparently no amendment is really necessary. To resolve the doubts raised by the Leader of the Opposition, I suggest that the present practice be recognized by a declaratory statement in the bill. After the word "" improvements,"" page 3 of the bill, end of line 3, he proposes the addition of these words"" including in such added value the value of any hotel licence or other similar interest the value of which has been included in the improved value."" Of course, where the value has not been included it is immaterial for the purpose, but where it has been then that must be taken into account. That amendment would seem to meet the point raised. hotel licences. tangible values of which the honourable member has spoken are covered by the practice to date. In the case where a well has been sunk at great cost and has failed to produce any considerable volume of of which the honourable water, the f u l l cost will be allowed before the unimproved value is arrived at for taxation purposes. I assure the honourable member that that practice has been followed by the department ancl will be continued. As to whether the value of an hotel licence would be taken into account without an amendment of the act the following advice was tendered by the late Mr Castles, Crown Solicitor, subsequent to the Toohey case in 1925:It is difficult for me to see how a licence can increase or decrease the value of land, except, possibly, to the extent to which it",37,Second Reading

I am not convinced that the amendment foreshadowed by the Trea-"" surer meets the case I stated. For purposes of illustration, I cited a hotel licencea plain example which every honourable member will understand-and the Treasurer has promised an amendment that will deal with such licences and "" other similar interests"". As a selfregarding lawyer, I welcome that phrase "" other similar interests "". If I should be sufficiently well advised to abandon the political arena and return to the practice of my profession, I would regard the phrase as a gift. I can imagine myself arguing its meaning before another tribunal with more success than is attending me here, and with results much more satisfactory to my personal fortunes. I look forward to reading the reprint of the bill after it has been amended, when possibly further opportunities for reconsideration will be afforded. The taxation of unimproved land values was introduced about 40 years ago to penalize those people who held in idleness land, that could be put to productive use. Et was not the intention of the legislators to unduly tax the man on the land. I realize that the pioneers of virgin, land have to expend upon it much labour that is not immediately productive and does not add to its value. There bas always been, however, opposition to the taxation of leasehold, although in certain circumstances leasehold is of greater value than freehold. I understand the difficulties with which the Commissioner of Taxation has to contend. Everybody tries to evade taxation and the Commissioner is always running counter to one of the ingrained prejudices of human nature. I have introduced many deputations to him, and I have always found him ready to give good reasons for the actions of his department. As I understand the practice of the department, it taxes not the improvements but only the increased value that land attains through being put to use and the increased value added by the expenditure of public money. Improvements may make the land productive, and it is the increased value that results from greater productive capacity that is taxed. Full allowance is made for the expenditure on such improvements as bores, wells, fencing, clearing, and pest eradication. That applies equally to leasehold and freehold. It is all very well for the Leader' of the Opposition to say that bills should be so framed that even the man in the street will understand them. Acts of Parliament merely lay down general principles to which effect is given by regulations. I do not think it is possible to frame a taxation law that will satisfy everybody and obviate disputes. Amendment negatived.

""We are dealing now with a sub-section that has been in operation for about twenty years without any litigation arising from it. I suggest that if the proviso is to be retained it should be in its original form, though I would delete it if it were possible. cause of the original definition of "" unimof the honourable member for Gippsland proved value "". If it is deleted the administration of the act will be. suspended in mid-air. deleted I shall support the retention of the original wording, though I still feel, with the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr That tlie proviso Paterson), that it can be eliminated without any serious results. not see any reason for the retention of the proviso. The definition makes it quite clear that the value of improvements is to be considered, irrespective of the cost of them. Surely that gives the Commissioner of Taxation a wide enough scope. It is true that the cost of some improvements may be unnecessarily high, but in such cases the Commissioner could deal with the matter on an equitable basis. A man may improve his land by degrees over a long period of years, and it might be impossible for him to indicate definitely the cost of the improvements. An owner with little capital may, by periodicby the Treasurer that these words, or ally running fires through his property, effect improvements of considerable value. The provision in the definition would cut both ways. A man may not be able to say in pounds, shillings and pence what his improvements have cost, [f a settler spent money unwisely he could hardly expect it to be taken into consideration to the full extent. The definition without the proviso would give the Commissioner of Taxation ample scope to deal equitably with the taxpayers. If the Treasurer's amendment is put first the committee will be placed at a disadvantage. If we vote first on the foreshadowed amendment of the honourable member for Gippsland, and it is defeated, as will certainly happen if the voting is on party lines, we shall then be able to vote for the Treasurer's amendment, which is an improvement on the wording of the bill. ber can vote for.my amendment and still vote for the deletion of the proviso if he desires to do so. If the course suggested by the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Bell) were adopted and the foreshadowed amendment carried the committee would have no opportunity to vote upon the amendment of the Treasurer. Amendment agreed to. moveto paragraph c. as amended, be omitted. I consider that the proviso is inconsistent with the clause to which it is attached, and a violation of the principle of the definition, which states that the "" value of improvements "" meansThe added value which the improvements give to tlie land at the time as at which the value is required to be ascertained for the purposes of this act irrespective of the cost of the improvements. I submit that the definition is perfectly sound, but that the proviso cuts directly across it. The only way to make the procedure in arriving at the value of improvements consistent is to debate the proviso. The committee has been reminded words very similar to them, have been in the Laud Tax Assessment Act for many years; but that is not necessarily a sound argument for the retention of them. That is no reason why they should remain in the measure any longer if the committee considers that they are unsound.",42,Second Reading

187,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [9.6],"11 shall suite a simple sum to the committee to show how ridiculous the proviso is. If a mau buys a piece of land, the unimproved value of which is £4 per acre, and spends £2 per acre upon it so wisely that he increases the value of it by £4 an acre, the land is then worth £8 an acre improved value. If this proviso is allowed to remain, the Commissioner of Taxation would allow a deduction of only £2 per acre in respect of the i m provements, and the man would be robbed to a large extent of the value which had resulted from the wise expenditure of his money. By what process of reasoning can it be shown that the unimproved value is increased from £ 4 to £6 an acre? The difference between the value of the improvement and the actual cost of the improvement has not come about as the result of increased population near at hand or the building of a railway or anything of that kind. In the case quoted the increased value has been given to the land as the result of the efforts of a particular individual. That individual should enjoy to the fullest extent the value of improvements for which he is responsible. If we strike out the proviso it will simply mean that improvements will be valued at the "" added value "" they give to the land irrespective of the cost of them. There is one other argument that I will advance in support of the amendment, though it may be regarded as a rather flippant one. The Leader of the Opposition has said that the more words that are put into a bill of this kind the greater w ill be the opportunities for legal battles. I suggest that that constitutes a sound argument for the removal of any provision that is unnecessary. make another appeal to the Treasurer to agree to the elimination of the proviso. We should look at this as practical men who understand the cost and value of improvements. Surely we are able, without the aid of experts in the phrasing of legal provisions, to say what we mean. W ill the Treasurer say definitely whether he considers that this provision is necessary, and if so, why? [9.11] I certainly think that it is necessary to retain the provision. similar provision has been in the statute for very many years. now proposed to alter it somewhat. w ill remain.

The same reasofc that existed for retaining them then existf now. Very heavy expense may have beep incurred in effecting improvements to land which cannot possibly be taken into account in arriving at the unimproved value of the property, because the cost of the improvements is not f u l l y represented in the value that remains from it . If the commissioner were compelled to take into account the f u l l cost of all improvements there would, in many cases, be no taxable value left, although the land might have a real unimproved value.

The honourable member referred to the cost of clearing a piece of land, and additional expenditure in successive years for suckering ancl oilier things which must be allowed for in arriving at the value of improvements for the purpose of striking the unimproved value. That is permissible under this definition and will be the practice. But it is not difficult to envisage bills for the alteration of the Constitua case in which the value given to land by expenditure upon it has not been commensurate with the amount of the expenditure. In such a case no prospective purchaser would think of paying the full cost of the' improvements. Honourable members must know that foolish expenditure is often made upon land, the full amount of which cannot be recovered in the event of the land being sold. A willing purchaser gives for land an amount equivalent to its unimproved value plus what he regards as the then value of the improvements upon it. all agreed upon. would have to be taken into account would be the price which a willing purchaser would give as the present-day value of the improvements. That is the value which the Commissioner must allow. proviso does that. able member for Oxley( Mr Bayley) asks the reason for the changed phraseology.

(POWER OP AMENDMENT) BILL. Debate resumed from 4th April (ridr. Tbat the bill be now read a second time. In the discord of opinion which these tion-particularl y the first-have caused to break upon this House, there was one tuneful note discernible which has relieved the stridency of the debate. That tuneful note was the recognition by honourable members that some substantial measure of constitutional reform is urgently necessary. In reviewing the fate of previous attempts to reform the Constitution, honourable members displayed a feeling of pessimism. It was apparent that they regarded the existing methods of amending the Constitution as being unable to achieve any satisfactory measure of reform. The Government has, therefore, introduced the first bill, the object of which is, in effect, to install in the Australian Constitutional workshop, a uew, effective, and economical machine for improving the Constitution. The bill does not propose to jettison the existing machinery, although it has proved both cumbersome and expensive, and has, indeed, been an obstacle to the progress of Australian legal development. The principles which will control the operations of this new machine are the conventions 7 aud usages of responsible representative government. The Treasurer (Mi. Theo1 dore) made a forceful point of that in his argument. Honourable gentlemen opposite have speculated more upon the abuse to which this new' machinery might be put than upon the beneficial uses which might be made of it. The right honourable the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) described the bill as an attempt to hand an open cheque to the government, of the day. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) said that the result of the passage of this bill would be to bring popular issues into this House.

205,Mr Mctiernan (Parkes) [9.18],"abuse parliamentary power. The British Constitution, although it contains no rigid fundamental laws, has been well described as the very mirror of political liberty. Those principles of responsible parliamentary government-thos e conventions and usages to which I have already referred-althoug h unwritten, have proved to be powerful safeguards not only against revolution, but also against provocative reaction. The new machine by which the Constitution will be reformed from time to time will be under the control of the elected representatives of the people, and they, by force of the rules of parliamentary government, will be ultimately responsible to the electors for the manner in which this trust is administered. Rights ancl interests, more precious and vital than even the written form of many sections of our Constitution, have been well safeguarded by those principles of responsible representative government to which I have referred. At the present, time, the States, and even the Commonwealth within its limited sphere, hove shown no disposition to abuse the very great powers which are exercisable by them under our existing constitutional system. The existing methods of amending the Constitution have proved to be totally inadequate for the needs of the Commonwealth. .Considering that the electors of the Commonwealth are identir>:il with the electors of the States, that 97 per cent, of the people of Australia are of the same stock, that there are no serious historical antipathies between the people of the States, that it was the recognition of an identity of destiny and of common interests that drew the people of Australia into a Commonwealth, I am disposed, in the present state of Australia's development, to regard State rights, which have been so much referred to in this debate, as mere abstractions, denarted legal spirits, which now have no actual bodies to inhabit, to which they can impart any definite or distinctive personalities. Having regard to the history of Australia prior to federation. I regard federation as having been a bridge between union and unity; and it is my view that that bridge has long since been crossed. should endeavour to make constitutional reform correspond with the accomplished fact of our national unity. It is important to appreciate that the Commonwealth, whose Parliament needs more power, is not a mere piece of constitutional machinery,established for the convenience of the States for united action on certain enumerated matters. The Commonwealth is a political community comprising all the people residing in the Australian continent and Tasmania. That was declared as early as 1903 in ;.i despatch by the British Secretary of State for the Dominions. It is quoted by Professor Harrison Moore in his work. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of AustraliaBy the act a new State, or nation was created, armed with paraniount power, noi only to settle the more important internal affairs relating to the common interests of the united people, but also to deal with all political matters arising between them and any other part of the Km pi re or (through His Majesty's Government) with any foreign power. That appears to me the obvious meaning of section i i i of the act, which declares that on and after a day appointed by proclamation the people . . . shall be united in a federal commonwealth under the name of the Coinmonwealth of Australia. On that day. Australia became a. single entity and uo lunger six separate States in the family of nations under the British Crown, and the external responsibility of Australia vested immediately in the Commonwealth, which was armed with the paramount power necessary to discharge it. Thus it will appear that the Commonwealth is not a mere governmental arrangement. During the last 30 years the Commonwealth has grown in stature, in prestige, and in power, but I think that it will be admitted by all Australian citizens that it is at present within a legal straight-jacket that is unnaturally restricting its growth ancl development. This bill proposes to set the Commonwealth free. The Commonwealth, to which we seek to give this power is the as incorporeal things, national unit, which in its own right, and not as a delegate of the States, participates as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the councils of the nations. It does not appear to me that there is any reason peculiar to Australia why the present distribution of. political power in this country should continue in such a condition that the In these circumstances, we Commonwealth has less political power than its sister dominions, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand. The Commonwealth goes into conference with Great Britain and the dominions in imperial and economic conferences. Isi t not a most anomalous and unsatisfactory condition of affairs that the representative of the Commonwealth should be discussing at those conferences, land settlement, marketing, and other subjects over which the Commonwealth has no power, or only limited power. It is true, as was stated by the Leader of the Opposition, that the purpose of federation was to give to the Commonwealth power with respect to national problems, and to leave matters of local concern to the States. plainly the Commonwealth has not power in respect of all Australian national questions. the fulfilment of those purposes of federation which were referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. It is not my intention to embark upon a long discussion on the evil of the multiplicity of political institutions which today prevail in Australia. The question is, what course should be taken to give effect to the present need for constitutional reform. It is useless to take the old courses, which have been tried and have ended in a stalemate. vious that the present condition of affairs cannot be permitted to continue. Professor Burgess, in his book Political Science and Constitutional Law. volume 1. at page 151, has writtenDevelopment is as much a law of State life as existence. Prohibit the former and the latter is the existence of the body after the spirit has departed. The difficulties in the way of altering the Federal Constitution so real that the position is almost the same as though amendment prohibited. mit that it becomes the duty of this Federal Parliament, institution in the land, and the most important instrumentality wealth, to give a lead to the people and to direct the Commonwealth morass of legalism in which it appears jr.o have foundered. position in other countries is discussed by Professor Harrison Moore, in his book, The Constitution of Australia. He wrote at page 621 of the 2nd edition of that workI t is the experience of federal government iu the United States, in Germany, and in Switzerland, that the national government tends to grow in power as compared with the State governments. In the United States the development has been by way of judicial construction, rather than by formal amendment, a construction given under a deep responsibility which came from the knowledge that the decisions of the court were in face of the difficulty of amending the Constitution, for all practical purposes final. Combining, in Marshall's phrase, the lawyer's rigour with the stateman's breadths of view, the Supreme Court for more than a century has had to reconcile the needs of national strength with the claims of provincial autonomy But and of individual right. For long the steady course of judicial interpretation not only satisfied the American spirit, but shared tlie veneration which belonged to the Constitution Bftre is an opportunity for itself. There are indications that this satisfaction is passing away before the needs created by the expansion of the scale of business operations, which have no regard to artificial State boundaries, and yet may not be "" commerce among the States."" In America, too, as elsewhere, the citadel of national right has been stormed, and the securities demanded by the citizen of the 18th century against the impairment of his liberties are likely to be more and more regarded in the 20th century as hindrances to social welfare. In these circumstances, the difficulty of altering the Constitution gives cause for anxiety, and not least to those who fear that the demand for a new interpretation may lead the courts to It is obinterpret opinion rather than law. In Australia we cannot ask the H i g h Court to articulate the political wishes of the people. It is a fundamental principle among our people that a court shall interpret law and not public opinion. It is true that in 1920 the H i gh Court, in the Engineers' case, eliminated an exotic doctrine f r om the constitutional system of Australia.

During tbe discuision on the bill to regulate the transfer of gold overseas the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) pointed out in quite a helpful way that there might be some doubt as to the validity of the bill. If this power which we seek existed, it would have been possible for this Parliament io have removed that doubt and difficulty altogether. There could be given a security and certainty to legislation which, perhaps, it does not possess to-day. Numerous instances could be quoted of some of the evils which flow from this attacks upon the legislation of the Comrigid formalism. Professor Berriedale monwealth and the State Parliaments, and Keith has shown the danger of precise those attacks have been launched, not constitutional formalism.

There is no need to refer at length to the mischief which arises from the uncertainty of the power of the Federal Parliament or of the State Parliaments law. Even to enact any particular section of a bill. The liability to this attack harasses Federal and State legislators alike. It causes them to spend much time over merely technical difficulties which have no relation to the actual merits of the legislation. We know that round about the line where State and Federal powers appear lo meet, there is a twilight zone. The dim area of power cannot be exactly marked out. While this condition of affairs exists, these legislatures will not feel powerful enough resolutely to go forward with legislation on things which appear obviously to be entrusted to their jurisdiction. I submit that the rigid, formal definition of constitutional limitations is foreign to the legislatures of British communities. If this constitutional amendment is passed it will do much to mitigate at page 3Tt is the distinctive feature of the British to its fundamental elasticity, which permits change by peaceful evolution and laws have been attacked ever, for special reasons, a departure has been made from this sound principle, confusion been the result.

Most fortunately for imperial relaThere is a third instance of the use to which this power which we seek might In put. auoimilies from the Constitution, and to cure minor defects in draftsmanship and substance. Upon such matters it would be entirely absurd to bold a referendum, because the questions are such that the people would not take any interest in them, nor would they endeavour to understand them. I refer honourable members to the report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution in which special reference is made to anomalies, particularly in connection with the judicial system of the Commonwealth. I also invite honourable members who so stoutly defend the rigidity of the present Constitution to note the provisions of section 92 of tbe Constitution, and to read the opinions of the Commission on the Comstitution upon that section. The commission pointed out that it is incredible that the members of the Federal Convention ever intended that section 92 should be cast in the form in which it now is. It has been the cause of much litigation, and the High Court has been puzzled over the manner in which it has been drafted. If this Parliament had the power which the Government is seeking it could hold a consultation with the States, and, without the' expense of a referendum, it could, by an act of this legislature, put reason and simplicity into section 92, and draft it in the manner which must have been intended by the Constitution Convention itself. Fourthly, I invite the attention of honourable members to a further very important and beneficial use which might be made of this power. I submit that it is necessary, iu the interests of the Commonwealth, that there should be in reserve a power which can be exercised in time of emergency for the safety of the people of Australia. In war-time, the Defence power springs into life, and the federal authority is empowered to take such action as it deems expedient for the protection of the Commonwealth. During the war, Australia was practically living under a system of unified government. One can readily imagine that the emergencies of peace may be just as great and serious as those of war. Take for instance the present crisis through which Australia is passing. Although it is necessary for the Commonwealth ParI t might be used to remove liament, to take serious action for the purpose of limiting imports to this country, it is entirely powerless to take any effective action to prevent profiteering. vernment is not asking for such power in this bill. power uuder the bill dealing with trade and commerce. not confer the necessary power. MrM c TIERNAN Yes it w ill ; and this bill also. It is intolerable that the Commonwealth Parliament should not have, in time of peace, power to take action in emergencies for the welfare of the people of Australia because of certain irritating artificial and unreasonable constitutional restrictions. There is yet a f if t h case in which, in my opinion, this power which we seek might be employed for the benefit of Australia. I. submit that it might well be used even though no specific mandate exists for a particular amendment, when such amendment is obviously necessary and expedient, and there is no doubt that, if put to the people, it would be overwhelmingly approved. If it were found subsequently that the people did not approve of the amendment, t l m power could be exercised to withdraw the amendment. One could find instances of desirable amendments to the Constitution which might be so effected. The Royal Commission on the Constitution has referred, for example, to aviation ancl navigation. It appears absurd that complete power should not reside in the Commonwealth Parliament with regard to those two subjects. Furthermore, it is repugnant to common sense that, in order to grant power to the Commonwealth Parliament over these two matters, we, a. practical people accustomed to democratic government, should be forced to go through the ritual of a referendum with its artificial prescriptions and its expense and attendant turmoil.",47,Second Reading

The proposal iu this bill is uot strange to our own written Constitution or to our political experience; it is indeed an extension of a principle of flexibility already contained in the Constitution, because about 40 sections contain the provision that a condition stitution shall remain until Parliament otherwise provides. Those provisions affect Parliament itself, the executive, the judicature and matters relating to the financial and commercial affairs of the Commonwealth and States. The bill before the House is simply to add to the list of enumerated powers of Parliament the power to amend the balance of the sections of the Constitution which at present it may not amend. Tho bill does not propound a principle which is repugnant to a federal system of government.

Willoughby ? leading commentators on the American Constitution. The honourable member will not dispute the authority of Bryce, one of the leading British jurists, in whose monumental work, The American Commonwealth, will be found in Vol. 1, page 259 of the 1910 edition, the following:Those err who suppose that the functions above described as pertaining to the American Courts are peculiar and essential to a federal government. These functions are not peculiar to a federation, because the distinction of fundamental laws and inferior laws may exist equally well in a unified government, did exist in each of the thirteen colonies up t ill 1776, did exist in each of the thirteen States from 1770 t ill 1789, does exist in every one of the 44 States now.

The component parts of any confederacy will no doubt lie generally disposed to place their respective State rights under the protection of a compact unchangeable by the national legislature. But they need not do so, for they may rely on the command which as electors they may have over that legislature, and may prefer the greater energy which a sovereign legislature promises to the greater security for State rights which a limited legislature implies. In tlie particular case of Americai t is abundantly clear that if there had been in 1787 no States jealous of their powers, but a united nation creating for itself an improved frame of government, the organs of that Government would have been limited by a fundamental law just as they have in fact been, because of the.nation, distrusting the agents it was creating, was resolved to fetter them by reserving to itself the ultimate and overriding sovereignty. support of the Government's proposal, demonstrating as it does that it is not",50,Second Reading

I wish to direct attention to one other important matter arising in connection with the first bill. such as that we are now discussing may come before the next Imperial Conference. The Imperial Conference of 1926 issued a declaration regarding the status of the self-governing dominions, and a committee of constitutional experts was appointed to make recommendations with a view to reconciling this new status with the powers of the parliaments of the self-governing dominion's. At the present time the parliaments of the dominions are in certain respects in a condition of subordination, due to the operation of certain imperial statutes. One is the Colonial Laws Validity Act of 1S65 which provides, in effect, that if a statute of the British Parliament is made applicable expressly to a dominion, any statute of that dominion which is repugnant to the imperial statute will be void. mittee considered how the repeal of the Colonial Laws Validity Act would affect the constitutional position in .
