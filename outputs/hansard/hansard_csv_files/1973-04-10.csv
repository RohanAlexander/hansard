I have moved this motion because it concerns a matter of very great importance in the view of the Government. We feel that it should be dealt with expeditiously and in a way that will allow all concerned to express their views and at the same time allow debate to proceed without undue delay in any respect. The matter to which the motion refers has received considerable publicity and certainly it is a matter of vital importance to the Attorney General (Senator Murphy) and to the Government. We see no reason why we should not proceed with this motion forthwith in view of statements made by the Leader of the Opposition and members opposite of their pronounced intention to debate this matter today immediately the Parliament assembled. 12609/73-it-[48 ] The motion I have moved will give to members of the Opposition the opportunity that they demanded over the weekend and at other times for an immediate debate when the Parliament assembled today. Nothing could be more prompt than for me, on behalf of the Government, to accept one minute after the Parliament has met the challenge of those who sit opposite and to give them the opportunity to debate this issue. I see no reason why my motion to suspend Standing Orders should not be agreed to. Order of the day No. 9 on the business paper, which is headed 'Croatian Terrorism', is inevitably linked with the subject we are seeking to discuss in regard to the Attorney-General. Does any honourable member opposite believe that he could debate the question relating to the Attorney General without referring to item No. 9 on the business paper? It is to prevent the honourable members opposite from so consistently being ruled out of order that we have very generously included in the motion the opportunity to debate the issues in to to. Honourable members will be able to link together the various matters under discussion, make speeches that will be easily comprehended and at the same time make full and complete reference to what is under discussion. It cannot be said that the Government is not giving ample time for such a discussion. The Government is prepared to give the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) 45 minutes in which to discuss these questions. That should enable him to cover them. I do not wish to take up the time of the House unduly. I summarise by saying that the purposes of this motion to suspend Standing Orders are, firstly, to give members of the Opposition the opportunity to fulfil their pronounced desire to debate, immediately the Parliament met, the questions that are under discussion and, secondly, to allow them to make their speeches in recognition of the fact that they must refer to item 9 on the notice paper. There is no intention to evade anything. This is a clear declaration of where the Government stands on this matter. Honourable members opposite have the opportunity to take this up. They have asked for it and I would have thought that they were so anxious to debate the subject that they would agree to the suspension of Standing Orders. But am I now to take it that you are running away from this debate? AmI to take it that you do not want to face up to the brutal use of the majority in another place",8,Setup

The Government has given the Leader of the Opposition this opportunity. One can see that, by opposing the suspension of Standing Orders, the Opposition does not wish to face up to the matter before the House today. I have moved the motion to suspend Standing Orders in all sincerity on behalf of the Government to allow honourable members opposite to defend the actions of their colleagues in another place and to see tion to motions of censure or amendments to whether they can defend the actions of their brutal majority which, against all evidence, passed resolutions which were detrimental to the Parliament generally.

It is a matter of great cowardice on It is a sign of the discomfort that the Govcourse of suspending questions and then ernment has and of the concern members of attempting to gag the debate.

He constantly has evaded and prevaricated on .this issue and has been nervous that yet quiescent while a government attempts to use another disclosure would be made to embarrass its power of numbers in this way. We will him, his Government and his Attorney General. The reason for the motion to suspend Standing Orders has no relevance whatever to engaging in the debate, for I assure the Government that we will co-operate in every way to bring on the debate. That was our intention as we walked into the House today. It so happened that we Prime Minister until about 20 minutes before the House assembled today. This is just another departure from the way in which the affairs of the Parliament should be conducted. However, that time did enable me to make some inquiries about the precedents for abandoning question time. I have been advised by the Clerk that questions have been waived in the past for the following reasons: In relacensure; at the opening of Parliament; historical reasons in relation to Budgets; and on other special occasions such as royal visits. There is no precedent for a government to take action to remove questions from the day's business to I really believe that the Prime Minister had the part of the Government to adopt this The Australian people are not willing to sit",15,Suspension Of Standing Orders

The Leader of the House referred to the brutal use of a majority in the Senate. The Senate debated this issue. It spent on questions on this matter a total of 6 hours. It debated this issue for nearly 3 days. Can it reasonably be suggested that the same course should be adopted here? It ought to be adopted here and we will be asking for it. The honourable gentleman said that the purpose of his motion is to bring on for debate item No. 9 on the notice paper which relates to a statement about Croatian terrorists. He said: 'Not a minute has been wasted'. The statement was made on 27th March and has been lying around since., waiting to be debated. We have been ready every day to debate it. The Government has put it off and put it off. Now its day of reckoning has come and we will co-operate in every way to bring about a debate on the 2 issues of which there is formal notice. One is the statement, the second is the proposal of the Prime Minister to move a motion expressing confidence in the Attorney-General. Another is the amendment I will move to the Prime Minister's modon, and that is to call for a judicial inquiry by 3 judges. All3 issues can be debated together. We will give leave so that they can be brought on together and debated. Any suggestion that order of the day No. 9 on the notice paper cannot be discussed on its own is a matter for the Government. I have already indicated that if the Government does not want to debate it on its own we will cooperate to bring all the matters into the debate. House of Representatives by a vote. It can Questions need to be asked, and they need to be asked now-suc h questions as who declassified the document about the alleged invasa doctrine known as collective responsibility ion. Why was that declassification not made last Thursday instead of Friday as a throw-away line in a commercial television program? I want to know whether the Prime Minister has had the opportunity to refresh his memory as to whether any expression of concern was made by the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation as to the events on 16th March involving the Attorney General. There are a dozen questions which my colleagues want to ask, and the Prime Minister and the Government are the ones who are running away from them. They are running away from them because they have no answers. They have been put in disarray, and they are prepared, in the face of all precedent, to rob the Parliament of question time for the purpose of gaining some short term advantage in attempting to protect themselves. As for ample time, the Leader of the House said that 45 minutes will be allowed to the Prime Minister and 45 minutes to the Leader of the Opposition. There is not a member on my side of the House who does not want to speak on this matter. Where is the feeling of open government? The Prime Minister sits in a red flush. He is not proud of the tactic he has adopted, and he has every reason not to be proud of it. Anybody else would feel ashamed of it. We oppose the suspension of Standing Orders. Opposition's time has expired. (2.17)I draw attention firstly to the motion. It is a motion to suspend Standing Orders. It does not in any sense suspend the right to questions later. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) has assumed that. Maybe he is right; I do not know. meeting? meeting, but what I want to say against what has been advanced by the Leader of the Opposition is that we are attempting to restore proper parliamentary usage, which after all fell into great disrepute under the previous Government. Parliamentary usage suggests that the only place in which the Opposition can challenge a government is on the floor of the pass in the Senate as many motions of no confidence in a Minister as it likes, and they matter not a jot. The Government believes in of Cabinet-somethin g which, I repeat, was honoured in the breach more than in the observance in the last several months of the previous Government. But if the Opposition wanted to move a motion of no confidence in the Government or in the conduct of a particular Minister the place to do so was in this House. The Opposition chose not to do this. When I hear all the bleating about the taking away of question time and recall how futile and ineffective question time has been in the hands of the Opposition, I do not think we have yielded very much. All the weekend I heard on television and radio and read in the Press about all that the right honourable gentleman was going to do when the House met on Tuesday. He seems to have been, as usual, a bit slow",16,Suspension Of Standing Orders

I think honourable members opposite will find that so long as they put their confidence in the political strategy of the right honourable gentlesue a course of action which is that of closed man they will be beaten more often than they will win. What is wrong in voting as we want to or putting to a vote the question that this side of the House has confidence in the Attorney General and the way in which he has handled things? Do honourable members opposite want to put it in the negative sense-that they have no confidence in the Attorney-General? know it. are prevaricating when you try to camouflage this as anything but sheer political expediency. When the Opposition resorts to sheer political expediency, as it has done, it cannot expect that occasionally there will not be sheer political retaliation. Surely to goodness this is what this place is about. Opposition members-Politica l expediency. 'sheer political retaliation'. What the Opposition has done is try to elevate into a monster that place upstairs, and the monstrosity is allowed to continue because it is not a place that had to go to election in December. The Opposition can only win there because it takes to its side there a party that has no political representation whatever in this House. has expired. very much that the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) should have sought to be involved in this debate because he knows that I have a high regard for him. I say in quite deliberate terms that on this occasion the honourable gentleman has not enhanced his reputation by his involvement in this debate because what the Government has put forward is, in fact, a very shoddy procedural motion. It is a motion which, I believe, is consistent with the jackboot approach which we have seen in this Parliament during the course of recent days. It is a contemptible motion. It is a motion which shows the Government and members of the Australian Labor Party simply for what they are. This is no group which is concerned about any concept of open government such as we heard mentioned gibly during pre-election days. This is a Government which is determined, in this House and elsewhere, to purgovernment. The motion before the Chair is, in fact, no less than a travesty of the concept of open government. It is contemptuous of any concept of democracy in this country. Certainly it is consistent with the whole approach which the Government has followed in terms of the workings of this Parliamentan approach which would deny the Opposition parties an opportunity to show full well the extent of the concealment and deceit which have characterised this issue since the Attorney General (Senator Murphy) first brought down his statement in another place. the honourable member. He would be better switched off because that interjection shows full well that the Government is determined to switch off the Australian people from an opportunity to be involved. As my leader has made crystal clear, the facts which have been elicited during the course of this particular issue have come forward during question time and the reason why the Government seeks to suspend question time is, as is shown from a simple reflection on the proposition, that it knows it is in trouble. It is well aware that Senator Murphy in another place is running scared, if I may use that expression. He is running scared because, as the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and other honourable gentlemen opposite would know, it is a matter of record that during the course of the last days of last week in the Senate, the Attorney-General himself, a man who alleges a sense of high principle, was seeking in the corridors of that place a shabby deal. He wanted out, according to the best information available to me which comes from the other side of this House. He wanted out. He was running scared simply because the Government realises that this is not an issue upon which it can win and it has been losing very much during the course of recent weeks. The issue is souring so far as the Government is concerned. But does it really care? It is contemptuous of the Parliament. It is contemptuous of the Opposition's right to probe, to cajole and to put facts into this debate because if there is one thing we have not had from the Attorney-General it is the facts",17,Suspension Of Standing Orders

The Government inherited 10 years of apathy towards the existence of terrorism in Australia and years of evasion and deceit about the very existence of such terrorHouse that Mr Barbour was appointed Directorism. I seek leave to table a document listing more than 50 incidents with connotations of violence within the Yugoslav community. lege of seeing the document, Mr Speaker, and until we see it we cannot agree to its being tabled. opportunity. It is not an exhaustive list, having been prepared solely from the resources of the Central Crime Intelligence Bureau of the Commonwealth Police Force. It excludes a number of serious cases still before the courts. We were asked to believe that there was no evidence of any organisation. We were told by Ministers in the previous Government that there was no evidence of the existence of any organisation, and we were asked to believe that these incidents were all spontaneous, isolated, unplanned. Against this background came the visit of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, a visit most welcome to my Government but one which resulted from a standing invitation extended by the previous Government. In the fortnight before the visit took place the Commonwealth Police informed the Government that it believed an attempt would be made to assassinate Mr Bijedic. According to the Commonwealth Police this threat was coupled with threats on the life of the Attorney-General, his wife and myself. In these circumstances I authorised the Attorney-General to take the necessary measures to protect the safety of our distinguished visitor and to ensure the success of his visit. The Attorney-General acted with vigour and correctness. I congratulate him. The Attorney-General had to ensure the complete co-operation with and between the various security and law enforcement agencies under his authority. He knew that the Commonwealth Police believed that there had been lack in 1964 to achieve a watering-down of a proof co-operation and a failure in information exchange with ASIO. Officers of my own Department of Foreign Affairs had also repeatso I shall not table the document. edly complained of the lack of co-operation and information exchange with ASIO -materia l we inherited-the Attorney-General Mr Speaker, perhaps this would be a good opportunity for one to remind the House that, on 3rd April, the Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr Anthony) asked me to table the terms and conditions of appointment of the Director-General of Security. I can tell the General of Security on 22nd January 1970 by the Governor General, acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council for a term expiring on the day on which he attains the age of 60 years, subject to the terms and conditions set out in a separate determination. I ask leave of the House to table a document which, omitting only formal parts, states the terms and conditions set out in the determination. being no objection, leave is granted. Attorney-General that ASIO itself now accepts that there have been, in the past, deficiencies in co-operation and information exchange. We are now confident that these deficiencies and failures will no longer occur. The actions of the Attorney-General have been a major factor in ensuring this.

35,For Lowe ( Mr Mcmahon) Will Remember His,"ASIO was concerned. He would not have been doing his duty if be had not acted directly, personally and vigorously to ensure that he was receiving all relevant information and receiving all necessary co-operation. His visits to ASIO headquarters in Canberra and Melbourne were designed to achieve just that, and they did achieve just that. It is intolerable to suggest that slavia in its complaints about threats to Yugothe Attorney-General should have placed strict formality above the safety of a visiting Prime Minister and, if it matters, the safety of the Australian Prime Minister. I regret, the Attorney-General regrets, and we all regret the publicity given to these visits. The Attorney-General was not responsible for that. It was not the Attorney-General or anybody on his staff, it was not any member of the Government or his staff, who tipped off the Melbourne 'Herald' on 16th March. The Attorney-General himself, as did I and every member of the Government, maintained complete silence until the Parliament could meet. It would have been much easier and personally less embarrassing for the Attorney-General had he felt free to answer questions from the media throughout the subsequent week. He felt obliged-and he was obliged-to maintain silence except for one quite formal and circumspect statement. We are not at all complaining about the Press, but I repeat that we cannot accept responsibility for it. On the basis of this one event, or its interpretation of that event, the Opposition for the past fortnight has turned question time in both Houses into a farce. Members of the Opposition have abused the authority of the Chair in the House and on television outside it and made a concerted effort to impede the real business of this Parliament and this Government. But they have failed entirely to grapple with the important issues involved. Has there been, over the last decade, because it was 10 years ago when there was first a debate on Croatian terrorism, a pattern of political violence and political terrorism in Australia? There has been. Was this organised? It was. Did the previous Government know of the existence of these organisations? It did. Did the previous Attorney-General deny the existence of such organisations? He did. He did repeatedly, deliberately, irresponsibly. Were members of the previous Government satisfied by the level of co-operation and competence being shown in combating this violence, this terrorism? They were not and they complained about it-privately . Did they insist that the previous Attorney-General take all possible action to stamp out terrorism and to ensure the vigilance and vigour of the law enforcement and security organisations? They did not. They complained privately and condoned publicly. Did the previous Government deal honestly and frankly with the Government of Yugoslav nationals in Australia and operations being plotted in Australia against the legitimate Government of Yugoslavia? It did not. Was the present Attorney-General entitled to act promptly and directly to safeguard the lives of the distinguished visitors and distinguished Australians? He was and he did so act. He will continue so to act, and in acting against terrorism from the right or the left or from whatever extremist groups in this country, he will have the unwavering, unqualified support of this Government. I stand amazed at the sense of priorities and proprieties of honourable and right honourable gentlemen opposite. Senator Murphy, we are told, is to be censured for sealing some documents; Senator Greenwood presumably is to be praised for stealing some. It might be best if I deal at once with the proposal which the Leader of the Opposition has proposed as an amendment to my motion, that there should be a royal commission of some form or some form of judicial inquiry into this matter. I read about this proposal over the last few days. I pondered it quite deeply and I may say that, with great reluctance, I have decided to set aside the temptation the right honourable gentleman dangles before me. Nothing could suit me better; nothing could be so politically devastating to the remnants of the previous Government than such an inquiry. Clearly a royal commission would have to cover the whole range of terrorist activities and the attitude of governments and their agencies to it over the last 10 years or more. Such an inquiry would have, of course, powers to call for persons and papers. The persons who have something to answer for from the 1960's to the present time are, of course, overwhelmingly, Ministers in the previous Government. The papers would be 99.99 per cent papers produced for and by the previous Government. The crucial question that such a commission would have to report on would be the neglect and the deceit of the previous Government in the face of the clearest evidence of organised terrorist activities in this country over the last 10 years. I confess I am sorely tempted. I will tell the House why I have resisted the temptation. There are 2 good reasons. Firstly, I am convinced that such an inquiry would not add materially to our ability to crush the terrorist activities which were allowed to grow under the previous Government. I am satisfied that the measures we are taking, and in particular the measures that the Attorney-General is taking to reorganise the agencies which come under his responsibility and to ensure cooperation between the various law enforcement agencies, will be effective in stamping out terrorism, Secondly, I have decidedtempting as the prospect may be-that the Labor Government is not going to have a Petrov commission in reverse. We are not going to have a witchhunt. We are not going to have the first months and years of our Government dominated by an atmosphere of heresy hunting and fear. I repeat: It tempts me to set up a commission which would leave every leading member of the previous Government, the present Opposition, with his reputation in shreds. I assure the House that the material is there. The Leader of the Opposition knows it is there, the last Prime Minister knows it is there, the Prime Minister before that knows it is there and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows it is there. Such a commission would have to satisfy itself, for example, why the then Attorney General, Senator Greenwood, wrote on 16th August last year to the Prime Minister of that time complaining about stories which were then appearing in the Melbourne 'Sun' and other newspapers about political terrorism, a letter in which Senator Greenwood suggested that the departments then headed by the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr significance of that Government not just to N. H. Bowen) and the right honourable memor were 'insufficiently safeguarded'. This is the example, Senator Wright, representing the sort of material that would have to go before the royal commission or any judicial inquiry. We would have a rare old time. We would have to haul before the commission or inquiry not just the right honourable and honourable gentlemen I have named, but the then heads of those departments, the officers who know the truth, the journalists involved and even editors of newspapers. And for what purpose? There would be only one purpose and one result-to destroy the last vestiges of whatever reputation that previous Government and surviving members might possibly have. The Leader of the Opposition puts up this phoney proposal for a royal commission. He is the nominal head of a party whose own Senate group declares its independence of the Liberal Party in this House. That independent group judged the Attorney-General without an inquirya judicial inquiry or any other form of inquiry-o r without a royal commission of one, two or three judges. The Leader of the Opposition now comes forward with a proposal to have an inquiry to pass judgment on the Attorney-General. When will these gentlemen-thi s plethora of privy councillors, this gaggle of ex-Ministers-sor t themselves out? Is there to be a censure followed by an inquiry or an inquiry followed by a further censure? I have had to make a judgment between an easy destruction of the Liberal Party and damage to the welfare of this country. I have decided to put the welfare of Australia ahead of my contempt for the Liberal Party. The long debate on this whole matter seems to have concentrated on Senator Murphy and Senator Greenwood. This is terribly unfair to Senator Greenwood. Senator Greenwood is not significant enough a person to be the scapegoat for the previous Government. The documentation against the previous Government goes back well before Senator Greenwood was even a member of the Parliament and, in indicting the members of the last Government, I want to concentrate on one aspect of their activities and their failures which has not been paid much attention. I refer to their cavalier conduct, their lack of candour towards a friendly government, namely the Government of Yugoslavia. Let there be no illusions about the importance of good relations with Yugoslavia and the Australia but to the world. The previous Government was under no illusions. For then Foreign Minister, told the Senate on 21st September last: Any break up of Yugoslavia could lead only to the creation of a new crisis point in the world today. It is almost certain that under such circumstances there would be increased tension and thus a reversal of the current trends towards a better climate for good relations in Europe after a post-war period of tension lasting over 25 years. Yet that same Government was willing to imperil our good relations with the Yugoslav Government and to condone within Australia",20,Suspension Of Standing Orders

There was no doubt that this organisation existed; no police or ASIO report ever questioned that. There was no doubt that its members were associated with violence. Police and ASIO reports confirm that. Then there is the allegation of the resurgence of the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood, or a similar organisation. This was thought to have disbanded in about 1967. Senator Greenwood in his reply refers to one documenta report by the Commonwealth Police on 23rd November last stating that the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood had been revived. He asserts, in misguided defence, that he never saw this document, as if that were enough. He completely failed to face the clear evidence that 5 dented.

These are amongst the documents tabled. These are amongst the documents available to Senator Greenwood, as to every honourable member of both Houses. These are amongst the documents available to the Australian Government before it told the Yugoslav Government that at the time Senator Greenwood made his statement there was no credible evidence that any Croatian revolutionary terrorist organisation existed in Australia. So here we have a continuing pattern of the Parliament being misled, the people being misled and a foreign government being misled. This is the real default, the real basis Prime Minister could not be guaranteed safety for censure. These are the charges which have to be answered-and the only men who can answer them are the members opposite, the ex-Ministers. What has a government of 4 months to answer for about the growth of terrorism in Australia? Nothing. What has a government of 23 years to answer for? Everything. These are the guilty men on trial. I forbear, and they will come to thank me for it, to put all of them where they should be-in the witness box of a royal commission, where they would be forced to answer once and for all why they allowed, knowingly allowed, the cancer to grow in our midst. I turn from the wretchedness and the recriminations of the past. I am concerned only about Australia's future. If one had to state a general theme for my Government's program it would be the reduction of fear. It is our overriding aim. By our economic policies we are determined to remove the fear of unemployment; our social security program is designed to remove as far as humanly possible the fear of poverty and sickness; our foreign policies are aimed at reducing the fears and suspicions which have so hobbled Australian thinking and distorted Australian attitudes for generations. And we are determined that everybody living in Australia shall be free of fear of political violence, of political extortion, of threats and blackmail. It has been asserted that actions taken by the Attorney-General before and after 15th March, were extraordinary and unprececoncerned extraordinary and unprecedented developments in Australia. To Australia's shame we faced the situation that an honoured guest, the Prime Minister of a friendly country, a country which we have recognised since 1918, when it was formed; a country with which there have been diplomatic relations since 1966-wa s under threat of assassination. This threat was the high point in a pattern of organised political terrorism which had developed in Australia over the past 10 years and more. It has been suggested that the prudent course would have been to cancel Premier Bijedic's visit. My Government was not prepared to allow political terrorism to achieve so shameful a triumph. Was it to be tolerated that Prime Minister Bijedic could visit all our neighbours in perfect safety but not Australia? Was it to be tolerated that his President Marshal Tito, could visit London or New York in perfect safety but that his in Australia? I would not have a bar of such a proposition. Accordingly I instructed the Attorney-General to take all measures he deemed necessary to guarantee the security and success of the visit. The Attorney-General was therefore a custodian, not just of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia but of the reputation of this country. Under such a heavy responsibility I believe he was entitled to take the actions he did to ensure that he had the full co-operation of Australia'a law enforcement and security organisations. In the event, they carried out their duties to the complete satisfaction of my Government. On this occasion there was complete co-operation between ASIO and the Commonwealth Police, between ASIO and my Department of Foreign Affairs, between ASIO and the Attorney-General's Department and my own Department. I am bound to say that this cooperation was not always forthcoming in the past. The Attorney-General was justified in satisfying himself that he was receiving the full information and co-operation by which alone he could discharge the deep responsibility I had placed upon him. As far back as 1964 the Department of External Affairs wished the Government to make strong and unequivocal condemnation of political terrorism. So did the present Leader of the Opposition as Minister for Immigration. The then Senator Gorton insisted that the statement be watered down because he feared adverse reaction from certain backbench members of the Liberal Party. Thus the guilty knowledge was shared at the highest levels by the previous Government. Leading members of that Government privately complained but publicly condoned. The terrorist organisations continued and so did their acts of terrorism-the bombings, the intimidation, the blackmail, the exfortion. It has been a disgraceful chapter in the. history of Australia and that disgraceful chapter was written by members of the previous Government. The previous Government did not deal with the Parliament or the people with candour; it did not deal with the Yugoslav Government with correctness or candour. My Government is determined to call a halt. There is no place for political thuggery; there is no place for terrorism in Australia. Equally we are determined to remove any cause for unease or apprehension among the migrant communities. Certainly we will not shrink from the exercise of the full legal authority entrusted to us by the people; but we shall in no way use that authority to promote authoritarianism in Australia. We are not in the business of spreading fear; we are committed to removing its causes. I address my words now in particular to the Croatian community. The Government will play its part in assisting that community and its genuine leaders to remove the few extremists who besmirch the decent and overwhelming majority, but the remedy also lies in the hands of the. community itself. Terrorism will wither on the vine if the community turns its back on the few malefactors in the midst. Victims of standover tactics, of blackmail and extortion will receive, the fullest supagainst the Axis powers. What an affront that port and protection from my Government in their resistance. I have never supported the proposition that migrants are in some way obliged to forget the affairs of their homelands-thei r ancestral homes. We do not require it of Greeks, we do not require it of Jews, we do not require it of Italians or Maltese, or even of the Irish; and we do not require it of Yugoslavs. But we cannot tolerate the use of Australia as a base, as a recruiting ground or as a source of finance for promoting terrorist activities within Australia or abroad. The line between legitimate interest in the political affairs in one's homeland on the one hand and political terrorism on the other is sharp and clear. It is the only line my Government intends to draw. While I fully recognise and endorse the right of migrants in Australia to maintain their links with, and their interest in, the affairs of their former countries, I have to insist that such interest cannot be exercised in such a way as to distress other Australians. I deplore in the strongest terms the commemoration in certain clubs in Australia of the regime of Ante Pavelic and the celebration of 10th April. Mr My-That is today. is that this very day, 10th April, I should be defending my Attorney-General for cracking down on terrorism; that on this day he should be attacked for it-o n the anniversary of the triumph of fascism in Yugoslavia. This day commemorates the temporary triumph of nazism, racism and anti-semitism in Yugoslavia. It is a matter of the deepest affront not only to the great majority of Yugoslavs in Australia and not only to our Jewish community but to everybody who fought in or had relatives fighting and dying in the war against Hitler and against fascism. What would we say if a German club were to display portraits of Hitler and the swastika flag and to commemorate and celebrate the day Hitler became Chancellor as a community national day? Yet Pavelic was, in his sphere, as violent and cruel as Hitler himself. He was not, as honourable members opposite tend to think, just a good anti-communist. It was his men who assasinated King Alexander of Yugoslavia. He was among other things, the betrayer of King Peter who assumed his majority and represented the popular revulsion of the people throughout Yugoslavia only last weekend the picture of this man",23,Suspension Of Standing Orders
45,Mr Whitlam,"What a supreme irony itPavelic should be displayed in places of honour beside that of the Queen-King Peter's relative. It is matter of deep distress to me that the necessary actions of my Government and its agencies should be the cause of uneasiness and apprehension amongst migrant communities. Nothing could be more alien to the spirit and desires of my Government. I am determined to allay these groundless fears and suspicions. In particular, I wish to remove any grounds for discrimination in matters of citizenship and employment against migrants or any section of any migrant community. There are to be no second class citizens in Australia under my Government. That is why the Government has decided to amend the Crimes Act to prevent the deportation of naturalised citizens and to repeal those sections of the Crimes Act which allow the deportation of members of declared organisations. In the meantime, I wish to make it quite clear that no Australian citizen will be deported, and that there will be no abridgment whatsoever of the rights of any Australian resident in the execution of deportation orders. I repeat: My Government is determined to remove the cause of fear insofar as Government action can affect the conditions of human existence. In that aim we need the help and co-operation of all the people-the Australian born, the naturalised and the nonnaturalised. The previous Government did an immense disservice to Australia in hushing up the existence of terrorist activities in this country. Its greatest disservice was to the Croatian community itself for by its silence, indeed acquiescence, it allowed terrorism to take root. My Government and the Croatian community together will root this evil out. second document relating to representations to the Australian Government to be tabled? There being no objection, leave is granted. Opposition) (3.16)-On behalf of the Opposition I wish to move an amendment to the motion of the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam). I move: That alt words after That* be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'a judicial inquiry of 3 judges be established to inquire into the following questions: (a) Are there any active Croatian terrorist organisations in Australia and have they been responthe Prime Minister what members of the sible for violence; (b) What is the legality of the Attorney-General's actions in relation to the events of 16th March at Australian Security Intelligence Organisation offices in Canberra and Melbourne and the way in which officers of ASIO were treated; (c) Are the actions of the Attorney-General reasonable in the light of his knowledge and consideration of its consequences; (d) Was propriety observed in the actions of public servants in providing information to the Government; (e) What were the real decisions of 2nd March meeting, and (f) What will be the effects of the Attorney General's actions upon the capacity of ASIO to discharge its statutory responsibilities'. The Prime Minister's speech was an extraordinary excuse for suspending the asking of questions. He is inordinately proud of his speaking ability, but he has no basis on which to be proud today after making that speech. I will deal specifically with only 3 points and I will cover the remainder of what the Prime Minister said as I speak. Firstly, the Prime Minister said that his Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) was justified in satisfying himself that he was receiving information. The Attorney-General has said, under questioning in the Senate, that he was not deprived of any information at all. Where is the justification for the raid upon ASIO offices in Melbourne or in Canberra, only supported by the Prime Minister on the ground of the Attorney-General satisfying himself that he was receiving information, when on the Attorney-General's own statement, volunteered in question time, he was not being deprived of any information? The second point to make is that the Prime Minister said how ironic it was that on 10th April he should be defending his Attorney General for cracking down on terrorism. This demonstrates that the Prime Minister does not understand what this is all about. If the Attorney-General of this Government cracks down on terrorism according to the law and through the law, he will have the total support of this Opposition. That was the policy and the action of the previous Government. I say to the Prime Minister that he totally misunderstands, as has been demonstrated by that statement. The third point is that the Prime Minister asked rhetorically what we would do if Germans displayed photographs of Hitler and the swastika to celebrate the day on which Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany. I can tell Opposition would do. We would deplore it in",25,Suspension Of Standing Orders

47,Mr Snedden (Bruce,"Leade r of thethe strongest possible way. We would use whatever resources of the law were available to us to condemn it and prosecute it if it were an offence. We would not put up with it. I say unequivocally and with great pride that those people who would take offence at such actions of Hitlerism deserve a place, in my Party, for that is the attitude of my Party. We condemn it. In my Party there is hardly any man who was of military age at the time who did not fight it and who would not be prepared to fight it again today. If this was supposed to be a snide way of appealing to the sensitivities and the great pride of the Jewish people who are Australian citizens, I say to the Prime Minister that nobody could have, greater pride in the contribution to Australia that the Jewish people have made and nobody would be more anxious to respond to the protection of their position as free citizens of truth was made by the Attorney-General of this country, totally free from any vestiges of anti-semitism, than members of the Opposition. Those points having been put out of the way, I now come to some other parts of this whole saga. The Prime Minister has asked this House to assert its prestige by passing a motion of support for the Attorney-General. Putting it in terms of this House asserting its prestige has some shallow appeal to him, no doubt. But is it the way to go about asking the House to assert its prestige by, for the first time in the history of this Parliament, controverting the forms of the House without the consent of the Opposition, only for the purpose of denying the Opposition the opportunity to question the Government? This is no way for this House to assert its prestige. We do not have to assert the prestige of this House. We are bound by the Constitution and we on this side do not like the Government's departure from it. I think the Government will come to regret this day. The statement on Croatian terrorism made deeply into the tactics adopted by Senator in the Senate by Senator Murphy and here on Murphy and his hapless accomplice, the his behalf by the Minister for the Capital Prime Minister, in perpetrating an outrageous Territory ( Mr Enderby) has been answered by and false smear on Senator Greenwood. Senator Greenwood. Senator Greenwood has established that the Attorney-General started with a proposition which suited his political with membership which is Croatian exclupurposes and then attempted to prove it by a sively. The cause of Croatian nationalism has biased selection of material and suppression burned in the hearts and minds of many for a of other material. At the time of his statelong time and I have no doubt is one of the ment Senator Murphy knew no more of the bonding forces in the very existence of these activities of individuals of Croat origin organisations. That feeling is mirrored in the engaged in violence in Australia than Senator Baltic, Ukrainian and Polish communities. Greenwood had known at the rising of the Parliament on 27tn October last year. Any information he now possesses which Senator Greenwood did not is the product of continuing investigations which were initiated by the former Government last year. Senator Murphy's attack was simply this: Senator Greenwood said and repeated that there was no credible evidence of organisations of Croatian violence in Australia. Senator Murphy then assumes the truth of his own allegation and charges softness on right wing violence and indifference by 3 Attorneys-General. I do not believe that the Director-General of Security has said that Attorney-General Hughes and his 2 successors were indifferent although Senator Murphy has said that the Director General did say it. The truth of that needs to be established to see whether the misstatement or by the Director-General of Security. That is a matter of fact which can only be elicited by a judicial inquiry. Senator Murphy assumes the truth of his allegation and charges softness on right wing violence. This is a castle built on hypothetical sand and if a question based on it were asked in this House you, Mr Speaker, would rule it out of order. The word 'evidence' is used in 2 different senses. Firstly we may reach a conclusion based on facts as they are known or represented and say: This is evidence irrespective of all the facts'. In other words, it is hearsay. Secondly, there is legal evidence by which the first law officer of the Commonwealth is bound-h e especially is constrained to be bound by this-whe n the liberty and reputations of citizens are in jeopardy. If the Attorney-General is asked whether X is an organisation of terrorists committed to violence and he says yes without having the evidence which would prove it in a court, he is robbing people of civil liberties. This is much more than a mere play on words. It goes There are organisations within Australia Who would say of organisations of those much for what was left out as put in. What people that they are terrorist organisations? was missing was the anticipated explanation Who would condemn them? for Casey( Mr Mathews) condemns them. In answering questions said: the Croatian community, there are men willing to display their sense of nationalism and Security Intelligence Organisation headquarters was in hostility to Yugoslavia in ways which can the lead to violence.

The emphasis Attempts to get a clear picture of the events placed by Senator Murphy on organisations, by persistent questioning have not been suctaken with his promises of new Federal police cessful. A judicial inquiry would establish powers, must raise fears in many minds that them. But I have pieced them together. Is it he would attempt to outlaw organisations. It not an extreme thing that the Opposition smacks of attempting to outlaw philosophies, needs to tell the story as it has come out opinions and thoughts. It is a threat to the rather than the Government? That, of course, freedom we have valued as perhaps the points to another reason for a judicial inquiry. greatest quality in Australian life.

This would be a corollary of the first point raised for a judicial inquiry. Senator Murphy says that 'this Government is determined that terrorism Capital Territory swallows that propaganda in Australia will be resolutely stamped out*. because he has read it somewhere but let The Opposition agrees, but adds that it must us see what Senator Murphy said about it. be done within the law and by the law. The Senator Murphy said, in answer to a question, rule of law protects us against the arbitrary that he thought his Private Secretary had use and abuse of power. The rule of law is rung to say he was coming. Where is the still our unqualified right as Australians and appointment in that? However that may be, must remain so.

51,Mr Snedden,"The Minister for theHe and the Prime Minister have persistently refused to offer any explanation at all of the initial decision to go to ASIO headquarters in Canberra at any time. They still refuse to do so. The Attorney-General has stated explicitly that neither the Regional Director nor the Director-General had refused to provide information which he had requested. If he thought that there may be information of the kind in the document, a simple request without the nocturnal drama would have produced it. Perhaps a Mr Milte induced this irrational behaviour. This raises the second point to be considered by a judicial inquiry-the reason and justification for the initial raid on the Canberra office. At about 6 a.m. the Prime Minister's principal private secretary requested the immediate use of a Royal Australian Air Force aeroplane for Senator Murphy. The Prime Minister was kept ignorant of this. One could not be made available immediately, and Senator Murphy travelled to Melbourne on a commercial flight. At about 7 a.m. that day a force of about 27 Commonwealth policemen arrived at the Melbourne headquarters of ASIO in St Kilda. Contrary lo Senator Murphy's constant assertions, it is my belief that watchmen at the ASIO headquarters are not Commonwealth policemen nor are any of that force normally on ASIO premises. There were 27 of them there that morning. The police achieved entry to the building. The means and the authority have not been disclosed. I believe that the inspector leading the raiding party had a telex paper giving him his instructions. I believe that the Commissioner of Police was not informed in advance just as the Prime Minister was not informed in advance. Whatever the paper was in the hands of the policeman, it should be tabled. The Attorney-General has merely said that the police went at his direction. Apparently, already in the building was the Director-General of ASIO. This raises the corollary to the second point to be considered by a judicial inquiry-the justification for the actions preceding the Melbourne raid on ASIO. Once in the building the police sealed all safes for the purpose of preventing them being opened by the officers who normally would have worked on the papers contained in them. Officers of the organisation were refused access to the registry and filing system of the organisation. Persons moving within sense told the Attorney-General that morale the building were accompanied by Commoncould be important. So he ordered the staff of wealth police oflicers. As staff members of the organisation arrived at the building for the normal commencement of their day's work they were directed by the Commonwealth police to an auditorium in the building which was used by the police as a holding area for these staff members. It amounted to a de facto state of arrest for some hours. The staff of ASIO was stoic in this abuse. The tape and seals brought by the Commonwealth police to seal the safes would not stick, so the ASIO officers provided them with selotape from the office stores. At about 9 a.m. the Attorney-General arrived at the building, not only protected by 3 Commonwealth policemen, but accompanied by other persons not identified, including a Mr Milte. Only with the specific authority of the Attorney-General could any officer of ASIO open a safe or otherwise retrieve papers, and then only those papers demanded by the Attorney-General. An officer obtaining papers was accompanied by a police guard. The Attorney-General commanded that the file containing the original of the note of the meeting on 2nd March that he had discovered in Canberra be produced. It was produced just as soon as the tape on the safe was peeled off. Triumph! He had preserved evidence! Of what? That document has now been destroyed totally by the Prime Minister who declared it to be wrong. This raises the third point for a judicial inquiry-the nature of the authority of Senator Murphy in taking possession of information and treatment of ASIO staff concerned. Today the Prime Minister tabled the terms and conditions of appointment of the Director General of Security. Paragraph 4 subparagraph (d) says that the Director-General will 'take reasonable and proper care of all property of the Commonwealth which from time to time is made available for the use of the Organisation'. I presume that this document was a piece of property which was to be taken care of. The Director-General is required to 'keep secret all matters which come to his knowledge or into his possession by virtue of his office except insofar as any such matter may in accordance with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1956 . . . be communicated to another person'. But he had no say about this. Soon after this chain of events, some sixth ASIO together, addressed them and gave them a homily exhorting them to good behaviour and high morale. Then came dramatic reports of speeding cars. The raiding party ultimately dispersed and Senator Murphy left Melbourne with his seized possessions. So obsessed was he with his sense of the dramatic that, to avoid the enemy-it was reported to me-h e arrived at the Trans-Australian Airlines terminal at Tullamarine airport as planned then dashed through the airport to depart on an Ansett aeroplane. We were next told that it was evidence of the conspiracy by public servants which justified the Melbourne raid. When that was declared wrong by the Prime Minister, the rest of the document suddenly was declassified by the Attorney General. From that point onward came the manipulation of the Press, Close sources were never lost for a helpful story. Initially it was put about that thc Prime Minister knew and approved of the raid. Later reports suggested that the Prime Minister had not known and was concerned about the legality of the raid. There was competition between well informed sources. Curiously, the Prime Minister says that he did not know about the raid until the afternoon of 16th March. Most Australians had heard of it from newscasts hours before him. Was there a conspiracy in his own staff to withhold information from him? He did not know of the request for a VIP aircraft for the Attorney-General. Had Murphy's forces penetrated the Whitlam organisation? I cannot believe that the Director-General did not express concern to the Prime Minister when he saw him on 17th March and I cannot believe that the Director-General did not take steps to counter loss of morale of staff by communicating with them about it. I cannot believe that other officers of ASIO who were held would not have sought assurances from the Director-General that a complaint had in fact been made. The Attorney-General issued a non-statement that evening which said nothing not already known about the day's events. The rest of his statement clearly implied that the raid was necessary to ensure that adequate means were taken for thc safety of the Yugoslav Prime Minister. That was the first reason given. Meanwhile, Mr Whitlam said nothing. Today he made a virtue of his saying nothing and the Attorney-General's saying nothing until the Parliament sat. I will come to whether or not that is the fact in a aware of death threats and bomb scares to moment. The Opposition made constant demands for authoritative explanation. It was led to believe that the matter related to national security of the life of the Yugoslav Prime Minister. The Opposition was never given direct responses from Senator Murphy. Instead it was given only obscure references to the issue. The classic example of saying nothing until the Parliament sat was a Press release on the Attorney General's official statement paper written in terms of 'discussions are understood to have taken place' between the ASIO Director General and Senator Murphy, 'it is expected that Senator Murphy will table', 'it is known that Senator Murphy has impressed' and 'Senator Murphy is eager to dispel'. This is the first time. I have known of leaking on the record. But there is evidence of it in the Press Gallery. Then we had the build-up of the Murphy scare syndrome. There were many reports of death threats, bomb threats and plots on the life of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia and on our own Prime Minister. Assembled in Canberra was the greatest security force in the history of Australia. It was not a proud time but it was certainly memorable. The noise and spectacle of a helicopter gunship over the capital's streets will be not soon forgotten. The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia confined his visit to Canberra. He had limited social functions and spent most of his time in consultation with the members of the Yugoslav Embassy. He dined at the Lodge with a powerful oratorical accompaniment from the Australian Prime Minister to the interpreters and a handful of witnesses there assembled concerning the likely deportation of certain individuals. It was sensationally reported, as it was intended to be. Today the Prime Minister in his statement had to undo the harm done by that statement when he talked about deportation not occurring to Australian citizens or there being no abridgement of the rights of Australian residents. The visit of the Yugoslav Prime Minister came as a surprise to the majority of the Australian people. His life was said to be in danger but there would have been no inconvenience if he had not come. We have since learned that the Attorney-General was advised by his security advisers that the visit should be called off. It was not. Stories of death threats and bomb scares continued. Throughout my public life I have been myself and to other Ministers and to many people in public life. For a long period I was receiving a death threat every Wednesday and every Saturday from the same writer. I burned them upon receipt. Until recently at least the advice of the police was to avoid giving publicity so as not to encourage others. Few people know of death threats. They have to be assiduously followed up by the police but not in the blaze of sensational publicity. Never before has officialdom created such an atmosphere in this country. No-one should understate the seriousness of death threats and bomb scares, but this is the wrong way to handle them. There is a new Murphy moodan atmosphere of threat. Australians do not want this atmosphere; it has been too often used in other places as a strategy to win tolerance for abuses of power. It surprised me to hear today the Prime Minister say that if this Government could be categorised as anything, it could be categorised as a Government committed to eliminating fear.

I think that what I have to say will not in any way prejudice the trial of the action. If you think it will, Mr Speaker, I will abide by your ruling. The headlines blazed; action photographs were taken. Arrests were made. That is a fact. But most Australians were deeply disturbed at this arbitrary display of Commonwealth police power. Many migrants remembered the 1930s. The police engaged in an exploration expedition. They had no specific information. The New South Wales police authorities quickly disclaimed responsibility and, curiously enough, they were closely followed in disclaiming responsibility by the Attorney-General himself. The next distraction, of course, was to attempt to allege, through his bitter personal attack on Senator Greenwood, the scurrilous accusation that the previous Government was soft on Right wing terrorists. This was totally unfounded and is now apparent. Senator Murphy has not prosecuted any organisation or individual. He has proved nothing. The next desperate effort was the Public Service conspiracy, which could not be sustained. It was declared to be wrong by the Prime Minister within 48 hours of declaring it a conspiracy. Next came the alleged invasion of Yugoslavia. This was the second matter contained in the document. The Austrian newspaper 'Die Presse' of 25th August 1972 carried this report: The Croatian terrorist movement 'Ustasha' want to send shortly their new commandos out of Australia into Yugoslavia and also plans a bomb attack on the 4th September at the Yugoslav embassy in Australia. Thus writes the Belgrade paper 'Novosti' reporting an article from an Australian 'special reporter'. According to the reporter a secret gathering of the organisaBosnia was because the terrorists chose uncooperative contacts from within the population. a further 2 for illegal Who was the special reporter? Was this the invasion which was expected and referred to in the second part of the document? Where did the information in the report-that is, the document found by the Attorney-General -com e from? Did it come from the Yugoslav authorities or from this special reporter? Who was consulted before the document was declassified? Who told the Attorney-General the invasion would not happen? So much for the distraction and so much for the cessation of question time in this House today. When in 1949 Mr Chifley established ASIO he built in safeguards to prevent its being used for political purposes of the Government of the day. Until last month the Organisation has been free from political exploitation. Now it is under a cloud. ASIO has established close relations leading to the interchange of intelligence information with the security services of our allies and other countries in the Western world. For instance, in 1971 the United Kingdom expelled 105 members of the Soviet Embassy staff in the United Kingdom as persona non grata. The information which led to the expulsion no doubt owed much to exchanged information. Australia, just like any o:her country, would be risking its national security if it did not have such an organisation. In spite of a barrage of misleading and",28,Suspension Of Standing Orders

Honourable members will have heard derogatory criticisms of ASIO which it has not been able to deny or affirm because if it affirms sometimes and does not affirm at other times, it gives information; if it denies sometimes and does not deny at other times it gives information, and so on. So ASIO has had to adopt this attitude of refusing to confirm or deny, as I did as Attorney General in this House. I know the formula well and I know the reasons for it. I have heard people say: ' I know my telephone is being tapped because I can hear funny noises on it'. Now really, if there were an interception of a telephone call the last thing that would be permitted to be heard would be noises. I have heard people talk about ASIO documents floating around. Everybody knows the extent to which the Attorney General went. Apparently he did not see any ASIO documents lying around and, of course, the Intelligence Organisation is staffed by firstevents that have happened, we could deprive class professional men wbom you would be proud to call your friends for they are true Australian patriots and they are just as devoted enemies of the extreme Right as they are of the extreme Left. The damage which the raid has caused to the standing of ASIO in the eyes of all other world intelligence services to receive their information cannot be measured. Inevitably it will have caused concern about the confidentiality of information provided in the past and could lead to a refusal to provide information in the future. This would deprive Australia of important knowledge which it is necessary to have in the maintenance of Australia's national security. Almost from the commencement of this Labor Government reports were cropping up-som e originating overseas-that the intelligence systems of friendly countries were concerned about the security of information in Australia. It was reported that Australia was likely to receive less intelligence exchange. These reports were disturbing and I asked the Prime Minister if they were true. He denied the truth of the reports, but the reports continued unabated. The concern grew further over the Prime Minister's opportunist and politically motivated revelation of part of our security arrangements in Singapore. In strategic appreciation there is no immeonThe diate external threat, but this does not mean statement sbould not be at variance with the interim that we should be seduced into easy comfort and quiescence. We must maintain our national security, which is a Government's first national priority. Action by a government against that security is that government's greatest crime. Agents are a fundamental source of information gathered to protect our security. Every western democracy has such a service. Every Western democracy owes a duty of preservation of the anonymity of the agents who serve it. The agents' job is to penetrate groups about whom it is necessary for the state, for the security of the state, to have information. The information that they obtain now may not be the whole story, but it adds a very important piece to the jigsaw. Their safety is preserved by other servicesso should it be by ASIO-bu t can an agent have this confidence if a political Minister, accompanied by executive police, can seize files? It is a curious irony that if agents cannot continue in their jobs because of the ourselves of information about the alleged organisation of violence. It will take away one of our weapons to find out about them. The files seized have apparently been examined by other Labor Ministers and at least one private citizen. What trust in the security of critical and sensitive information will foreign agencies now place in ASIO? The issue comes down to this: What possible justification could Senator Murphy have had for raiding ASIO with a platoon of Commonwealth Police? This raises the fourth term of referencewhat alternative means were available to the Attorney-General to ascertain the facts? After2 weeks of tortuous questioning in the Parliament, some Press leaks, and a build up of public concern, the Prime Minister deigned to give an excuse for the. ASIO raids. What he fails to do, and what the judicial inquiry must determine, is assess the effect on ASIO of the events of the 16th March and since. Within the terms of reference the judicial inquiry would be required to do this. On the afternoon of 16th March, the day of the raid, the Prime Minister saw a note of a meeting between public servants which read in part: Department of Foreign Affairs made 2 points the proposed statement. The first was that the reply given to Yugoslavia in response to the aideone part of the conspiracy, the Commonmemoire presented to Australia following the wealth Police, to raid another part of the 'Bosnian incident' in 1972. . . .

We will not stand by and see before the Government even admitted it.

The Minister boasted that he would The Defence Minister, Mr Barnard, got judicial inquiry must determine how much, or The kindest interpretation that we can General showed atrocious judgment, that he was precipitous, authoritarian, hot-headed and he bas wreaked. Could it be that he was stimulated to this act by an erratic adviser with an over-developed sense of drama who promised him all sorts of mysteries in the ASIO files-someon e who thought he knew the mysteries? He would have been prone to listen because the ALP has a developed tendency to believe its own propaganda. There has been a vitriolic and totally unwarranted attack on the probity and competence of ASIO from sections of the ALP for more than a decade. It is quite likely that Senator Murphy, like the rest of them, had developed this acute paranoia by virtue of these very stories that the ALP had been promoting. The Prime Minister provided Senator Murphy with an example of behaviour. Presumably, had he not been found out, public servants would have had to take the rap individually or collectively for that episode too. I refer to the disclosures about the Singapore security to a restricted group of journalists which became known within a matter of hours. The most logical interpretation of these extraordinary and damaging actions is that they were motivated politically or that Senator Murphy's judgment was seriously impaired. Whichever it was, he is shown to be a man not fit to hold the high office which he occupies. The ASIO report of the 2nd March meeting interpreted in one way at best gave Senator Murphy an unsatisfactory excuse to grandstand at ASIO. It in no way gave him anything like a justification. The contempt the Labor Party has shown to the Parliament in answering questions on the ASIO raids and explaining their purpose and effects has led us have the support of significant sections of Australian to call for a judicial inquiry of 3 judges into the whole question. The judicial inquiry should call before it under oath all the persons involved in the matter, including the Director-General of Security, his officers and Commonwealth Police. The removal of consideration of this question from the political arena to an independent body should ensure an unprejudiced examination and result. It will enable us in the Parliament to return to a consideration of those very important problems of defence, inflation and economic management that are facing this nation.

Immigration) (4.2)I second the motion moved by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) of confidence in the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy). The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) has moved an amendment to the Prime Minister's motion and has called for a judicial inquiry. The first point upon which he hangs his request is: 'Are there any active Croatian terrorist organisations in Australia and have they been responsible for violence?' The right honourable gentleman is either playing with the House and the nation or has forgotten to confer with his colleagues, because on 3rd December 1969 his deputy, the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Lynch), who was then Minister for Immigration, wrote to the then Attorney-General and said: I feel it necessary to bring to your attention my concern at the likely serious consequences if Croat nationals in Australia are permitted to continue unchecked their terrorist activities and outrages against representatives of the Yugoslav Government and authority generally in this country. The honourable member went on to say: I have reason to believe that the terrorists are endeavouring to create the impression among Yugoslav migrants in Australia that the Croatian extremists society and even the Government. This is his own deputy. He continued: The bombing attack last week on the Yugoslav Embassy in Canberra. . . the evidence of a deliberate attempt to fire the Immigration Offices at Barton on the evening of 1st DecemberThat could not possibly have been successful because those offices are too old, too whiteant ridden and too decrepit to burn anyway the bombing of the Yugoslav Consulate-General in Sydney earlier in the year are evidence of a pattern of extremist activity which should be capable of preventive measures by the law authorities.

He went on to say: The continued disquiet among the Yugoslav community generally in Australia must also have a deleterious effect upon their ability successfully to integrate in the Australian community which I have little doubt is the primary desire of the great majority of Yugoslavs in this country. That was his concern, a concern that was shared by the right honourable member for Minister for Foreign Affairs and who, in a letter addressed to the then Attorney General, pointed out that over the last few years there had been a number of incidents or attacks by extremist groups. The right honourable gentleman stated: . . . come to believe that they can act with impunity and that they can therefore, without risk to themselves, step up the level and frequency of violence. This is an indictment of members of the previous Government who are now on the front bench of the Opposition. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition might very well have conferred with his own colleagues before posing this amendment. (Quorum formed). The Leader of the Opposition, of course, then referred to the rule of law, that is, the law of his Government which sets out that, under the provisions of the Crimes Act, Australian citizens could be deported despite the fact that they held citizenship. So much for his rule of law. It was a bad law and we will change it in defence of the unity and indivisibility of Australian citizens. There is no doubt from the information now available to us, and, indeed, information which was available to the previous Government, that Australia has only narrowly missed becoming the world headquarters for a counter-revolution. There is no doubt that this situation was accepted by the previous Government, as it seems to have held the view that any revolutionary violence planned here would have been exercised outside Australia and not within it. But I make the point-and it should be remembered-that violence is like a disease. One cannot contain it at will or direct its course. Government were rightly concerned. Certainly this Government is concerned with violence from wherever it comes. We have a situation at the moment in which bombs in Sydney injured 18 people and fire bombs in Brisbane killed 15 people. Australians are concerned about this state of affairs. I might say that the concern was felt by some Ministers in the previous Government. To me, as Minister for Immigration, it does not matter at all what the pretext is for violence: Violence in our society must always be condemned. The man in Australia who puts aside the ballot box and reaches for the bomb leaves the ranks of the politically concerned and becomes a criminal. So the bombings of Brisbane and Sydney are both criminal acts even though they might have been carried out as the result of different motivations. The Australian hurt by a bomb does not ask whether the bomb was a right wing bomb, a left wing bomb or just a plain racketeer's the extremists themselves may by now have bomb. He knows he is hurt and resents it. MaterialI am now studying covers some 415 people who have been associated with violence. Naturalised Australians account for 195 of these. Of 51 Australian citizens who came under notice first for violence, 11 are now reported to have died in violent circumstances8 shot in Yugoslavia last year, 2 others murdered in other European countries and one murdered in Australia. Four of these Australian citizens are understood to be currently serving gaol sentences overseas for alleged involvement in violence. A further 9 have charges pending against them before the courts in Australia. Information brought to my notice concerning another 37 Australian citizens, some of whom have convictions for violence, indicates that they are implicated in criminal extremist activities. The Commonwealth Police has brought to the attention of my Department the names of a further 134 Australian citizens who are suspected of association with criminal extremism. Some of these have criminal convictions relating to acts of violence. I remind honourable members that Australian citizens are beyond the deportation provisions of the Migration Act. Amongst the 220 aliens under review are 9 persons who now have left Australia. Three of these are reported to be dead and 6 others are reported to be serving prison",34,Suspension Of Standing Orders

Another 17 have been charged in court for various offences and are awaiting trial. There are a further 25 aliens whose involvement in criminal extremism has been such that they are of significant interest to us. Several of them Minister for Immigration has authority to have previous convictions and information relating to them currently is under study. Information about 167 aliens indicates fhat they are involved in criminal extremism. These cases also are under examination. The list of 415 persons to which I have referred does not represent the total number of those whose histories in Australia are under review. I am informed that further cases are under investigation now and in due course may be referred to me for attention. So, I report the facts to the House. Taken together, they must give rise to deep concern. They must also give rise to the question of how more than 200 people could gain our citizenship without question-if , indeed, that was the situation. We do know from the files that there was some dispute about whether citizenship should be granted. But, be that as it may, the situation is not healthy from our point of view. The facts speak for themselves. While the previous Government was chasing elderly peasants in the hills of Calabria for voting communist 20 years ago, it certainly ignored the violence of the Right; the facts given indicate this quite clearly. The Government and the people of Australia are implacably opposed to terrorism from any sourcefrom the Right or the Left-and the Prime Minister has made that clear. There are no exceptions to this. Equally we are determined that the many shall not be condemned for the actions of the few. There are in the Australian community today more than 140,000 people who were born in Yugoslavia, and the great majority of them are good, sound citizens and residents of this country. I remind the House that Yugoslavs have a long and honourable history of migration to Australia going back well over 100 years. They, even more than the community generally, have reason to condemn the acts of political terrorism which have taken place. Only a couple of days ago I received from a large Croatian organisation a statement of rejection of acts of violence from whatever source they might come. These good people are deserving of the fullest sympathy and understanding of the Parliament of the nation. I should like to refer to the small minority involved in criminal or terrorist activities and those who, sharing their views, may seek to come to Australia. I want to be quite clear on this point. Under the Migration Act, the exclude from Australia any persons who are not members of the Australian community. I shall exercise that authority to the full against people who advocate or engage in acts of criminal terrorism. Officers of the Department of Immigration here and overseas are understanding instructions in this matter and I have re-emphasised those instructions. However, no migrant screening process in the world can completely guard against the possibility that a person may be recruited into this type of activity after arriving in Australia. I am particularly concerned, therefore, about those people who are already here and who attempt to recruit young men to kill and to be killed in campaigns of violence and terror. Under the Migration Act, I have the authority, as Minister, to order the deportation of aliens and immigrants in certain defined circumstances. But I want to make it plain that no Australian citizen can be required in any circumstances to leave his adopted country. Each case in relation to deportation can and will be looked at on its merits. I . am determined to do all in my power as Minister to keep political terrorists out of Australia and to apply the deportation provisions of the Migration Act to the fullest extent, consistent with our system of justice. The special reports branch of my Department will maintain the closest possible liaison with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Commonwealth Police and State law enforcement agencies. Any information will be brought to my notice and whatever action is necessary will be taken within the powers given to me, as Minister, by the Parliament. My Department neither has nor seeks its own police force. The special reports branch is not concerned only with offences by migrants. It is equally concerned with offences which affect the interests of migrants. When evidence of offences is obtained, the information is referred to the Commonwealth or State police for investigations and court proceedings in the usual way. Officers of this branch are neither police officers nor security officers. However, they do work closely with other agencies. I warn those who may contemplate acts of violence to weigh fully the consequences of their actions. I offer them this choice, on behalf of the Australian Government: Live with us in peace or leave. Australia will not tolerate them; neither will it provide a haven for them. I repeat my earlier undertaking to do everything in my power to stop any more such people entering the country and I repeat my warning to those who are already here and who embark upon acts of violence and terrorism. They will have visited upon them the full rigour of the deportation provisions of the Migration Act, within the law. There is no blame or shame attaching to the great majority for the actions of the few. Just as the full sanction of the law will be applied to stop those who engage in terrorism, so too shall we apply the full sanction of the law for the protection of the innocent. I give this pledge on behalf of the Government of Australia: I pledge myself to justice-justic e to the community, to the individual concerned and to the many thousands of good people who, with faith in us and in our country, have pledged their future with ours. The Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Government are unanimous in this dedication. Australian Country Party) (4.16)I second the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden), which seeks the appointment of a judicial inquiry of 3 judges to inquire into matters relating to Croatian activities in Australia and also the raids on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Firstly, I believe that the extraordinary motion brought forward by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) in no way purifies or cleanses the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) in respect of his actions. In fact its unusualness condemns him rather than exonerates him. Secondly, I am staggered by the statement of the Prime Minister in which he said that his Government was going to assert its own authority, asserting the unchallenged right of the majority of the. members of the House of Representatives, to take whatever action it thought fit. In other words, the Executive is going to overrule the Parliament; the Executive is going to overrule existing laws on the statute book. Australians, take note of this. I warn you that I bave never heard such a dictatorial statement in this Parliament by a Minister, let alone a Prime Minister. In the 4 weeks since the Attorney-General directed and took part in raids on offices of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation no real attempt has been made by the Government or the Prime Minister to explain why the raids took place. This Parliament and the people of Australia have been treated with contempt by the Government, and now only 3 speakers from each side are to be allowed to debate this question this afternoon. This House has been shamefully treated by the Prime Minister, who asserts his truthfulness and courtesy, yet does nothing to demonstrate the reality of those assertions. We find it impossible to get the Prime Minister to answer questions and we find it impossible to get him properly to retract vigourous, vicious and hysterical accusations made, against honourable members on this side of the Parliament. Nothing has been revealed which could in any way justify the disastrous actions of the Attorney-General in raiding ASIO. To the contrary, what we have been told is that the justification relied upon by the Attorney-General-the report of a meeting-is false. We have been told that the grounds on which the Prime Minister based his shocking suggestion of a conspiracy by public servants-the same report-ar e false grounds. The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have blundered into this mess like bulls in a china shop. They have thrashed around without the slightest vestige of selfcontrol or responsibility, causing damage at every turn. Public servants have had their reputations blackened. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has been seriously damaged, its standing eroded and its effectiveness undermined. The Prime Minister has been asked over and over again why Senator Murphy visited the Canberra office of ASIO in the first place. Over and over again the Prime Minister has refused to answer this vital question, which holds the key to the whole sorry mess. It appears now that the only way to get at the truth of the whole affair is by means of a judicial inquiry. The Parliament itself, having failed because of the attitude of the Prime Minister to establish the truth, now must resort to an independent inquiry in an effort to uncover information which a Prime Minister with any respect for Parliament already would have given.

61,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Leade r of thediscredited the Government's whole approach to this matter. The statement of the Attorney-General in the Senate was a mass of such assertions and allegations. This Government, by unsubstantiated assertion and by the whipping up of hysteria, has placed every Croatian migrant under a cloud of suspicion which will take a long time to remove. It is not a thing of which the Government can be proud. Is this part of the Government's plan to destroy the Security Organisation? What other motives possibly could have justified the almost unbelievable actions of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General? A judicial inquiry offers the only hope of finding the answers to these questions. To my mind the most important thing, and a much more fundamental and important question than terrorists operating in Australia tant than that? mount principle of which this Parliament must take full cognisance. A dangerous precedent stands to be established, and will be established if we do not prevent its acceptance, by the Attorney-General's attempt to assert what he claims is his ministerial authority over Parliament. In this action he is supported by the Prime Minister. On l l t h May 1789 President George Washington of the United States said: Many things, which appear of little consequence of in the terms and conditions of appointment. themselves and in the beginning, may have great and durable consequences from their having been established at the commencement of a new general government. That is what we are faced with here today. The Attorney-General claims that he has ministerial authority to do what he did on the night and morning of 15th and 16th March when he went to the offices of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in Canberra and Melbourne, stood over ASIO staff and took possession of information which was the property of our Security Intelligence Organisation. It seems to me that unless he can cite directly the authority on which he relies to establish that he is an authorised person in terms of the Crimes Act in the situation he engineered when he raided ASIO, we are entitled to say that the Attorney-General has acted illegally and has placed himself above the laws of this Parliament. If the Attorney-General cannot or will not show that he acted legally, we are entitled to say that he placed himself above the laws of this Parliament as set down in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act. That Act states in section 5 that the functions of the organisation are as follows: (a) to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to security and, at the discretion of the Director-General, to communicate any such intelligence to such persons, and in such manner, as the Director-General considers to be in the interests of security; (b) to advise Ministers, where the Director-General is satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to do so, in respect of matters relevant to security, in so far as those matters relale to Departments of State administered by them or to authorities of the Commonwealth established by or under Acts administered by them. Mr Speaker, this Parliament has passed a law which places ASIO under the control of the Director-General. The law passed by this Parliament did not place ASIO or its Director General under the control of any Minister. The Prime Minister and the Attorney-General rely very heavily-in fact they appear to rely almost completely-o n the terms and conditions of the Director-General's appointment by the Governor General to establish the legality of the Attorney-General's incredible actions. They tell us that the terms and conditions make the Director-General subject to the directions of the Attorney-General. The terms and conditions do no such thing. If the Attorney-General believed the Director General to be guilty of misconduct, certain courses would be open to him as set out He would have to suspend the Director-General and set up an inquiry. There is nothing whatsoever in the terms and conditions which could justify even remotely the Attorney General's action in raiding ASIO in the way he did. There is nothing in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act to allow the Attorney-General to give directions to the Director-General, nor does it make the Director-General responsible to the Attorney General. In my view the Attorney-General has acted unlawfully and in defiance of a law passed by this Parliament in acting as he did. If the Prime Minister is suggesting that the Director-General is guilty of misconduct in the sense of paragraph 8 of section 7 of the terms and conditions, why has not the Director General been suspended to comply with the only course open to the Attorney-General in these circumstances?

He put it that there is no authority for the Attorney-General to do what he did-to give directions. May I direct his attention to section 6 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, a terribly short Act and one which in my opinion is greatly in need of reform. It does on the face of it appear to make ASIO a state within a state, a law unto itself. Previous Attorneys General have apparently never looked at it. In section 6 it states that the Director General of Security shall be appointed by the Governor General always on the advice of the Government. It then goes on to state: Subject to the next succeeding sub-section, the Director-General shall hold office on such terms and conditions as tbe Governor General determines. Certain papers were offered a week or so ago to the Opposition. The Opposition declined the offer. The papers were tabled here today. It is worthy to read them out. Under the definition of misconduct where it occurs on the part of the Director-General we find these words in paragraph 7: Without limiting its generality the word 'misconduct' includes any failure on the part of the Directoryou not here? Was it not mockery? On 21st General to comply with the provisions of the Act or any of the terms and conditions set out in this determination or any lawful direction given by the Attorney-General regarding the Organisation. Now, cop that. It is worthy that the people of Australia know what the Opposition is trying to say. May I also come back to the matter that has been sidestepped so clumsily. It is all the Opposition has to go on. I refer to the question of terrorism. Let us have a look at the acts of terrorism that have occurred. The Opposition seems to ignore the paper that was tabled by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) today. It is not prepared to read it. I will. It gives a record of incidents involving terrorIsm. In July 1963 Croatian extremists from Australia entered the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for the stated purpose of waging a guerrilla campaign against the regime. I will not go through all of the incidents because some of them are concerned with back yard assaults and things of that sort. On 7lh May 1964 a bomb explosion occurred in John Street, Petersham in New South Wales. In January 1965 threats were made to the Mayor of Cooma. In November 1965 4 Serbs were stabbed in the Dalmatian Cafe. In October 1966 there was a case of attempted murder. A parcel bomb incident occurred in November 1966. In January 1967 a bomb exploded on the first floor patio of the Yugoslav Consulate-General at Double Bay. In December 1967 a boy had his hand damaged by a pen bomb. I am sure honourable members will remember that incident. The pen exploded in his hand at a function. In December 1967 there was an incident involving gelignite. In November 1968 there was a demonstration with great violence, and in March 1969 murder. In June 1969 an explosive device was detonated at the residence of the Yugoslav Consulate-General-bomb s again! November 1969, bombs again! An explosive device was detonated in the compound at the rear of the Yugoslav Embassy. January 1970, bombs again! On 22nd February 1970 death threats were made to persons associated with the production of a radio program for playing Yugoslav music. They succeeded, because the music was discontinued. One has to bear in mind that when the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) spoke he tried to mock the Attorney-General's efforts to stop this course of conduct. October 1970, bombs again! Later that year murder was committed at Geelong following a political argument. In December 1970 an incident occurred involving guns and wounding. Firearms were used and 2 Serbs were wounded at Talbingo. On 21st January 1971 the Adria Travel Agency received threats to bomb its premises unless the proprietor removed from his window some advertising material. In January 1971 letters threatening to bomb were written. On llth February 1971 threatening phone calls were made to the Consul-General of Yugoslavia stating that he would be bombed. In May 1971 there were more threats to bomb; in June 1971, more threats to bomb. In July 1971 St",39,Suspension Of Standing Orders

On 12th September 1971 St Sava's Free Serbian Orthodox Church in Carlton, Victoria, was burnt-arson . On 23rd November 1971 in the early hours of the morning a bomb exploded outside the Adriatic Trade and Travel Centre in George Street, Sydney, one of Australia's leading capital cities, if honourable members opposite do not know it. In November 1971 an anti Yugoslav demonstration resulted in a minor matter-stealin g a flag. In November 1971 bomb threats were made again. In December 1971 the Hub Theatre at Newtown in New South Wales, which was screening a Yugoslav film praising the partisans of World War II , was bombed. On llth January 1972 the statue of General Mihailovic in Canberra was bombed. A second and larger bomb failed to go off. On 27th January 1972, a bomb again. Another bomb threat was made to the Yugoslav Consulate-General in Melbourne. On 14th February 1972 shots were fired and a number of bullet marks were found on the building of the Yugoslav Consulate in Perth. On 6th April 1972, bombs again! This time it was outside the house of a Yugoslav, Marijan Jurjevic. 24th May 1972 saw the beginnings of the incursion-cal l it a small invasion if you like-of people from this country into Yugoslavia again, the second time around, and we have been told since then about the other ones. In July 1972 there was the actual incursion by 9 Croats who had previously lived in Australia, 6 of whom were naturalised. Mr Ian Robinson-You have not mentioned the attacks aware of what this Government is trying to stop-the sort of thing that your Government encouraged and allowed to happen. On 7th September 1972 there was an acid attack. Even members of the Country Party might be interested in an acid attack. On 16th September 1972 there were bombs again at the General Trade and Tourist Agency. On the same date, 16th September 1972, there were bombs again in the vicinity of the Adria Travel Agency, George Street, Sydney. In September 1972 there were bombing attempts and also threats to bomb. These things are known. They were disclosed in the 2,000-odd pages of documents which were tabled in the Senate and which I tabled in this House on behalf of the Attorney General, together with the summary of those documents. As I read the debates in the Senate there was not one word of criticism of the summary. I do not have time to go right through all the documents now; they appear from page 708 onwards in the Hansard record. As I read the Senate debate, they were not in dispute. No honourable senator criticised them. Accusations of selectivity have been directed elsewhere, but I invite honourable members to read the summary of the documents. It contains a tale of violence, terror, threats, intimidation and extortion by this extreme minority among the Croatian community in Australia. The Croatian community cries out as much as anyone else to have it stopped. Even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch), as we know from the correspondence, expressed his concern about it in the past, as did the right honourable memment of the day did nothing. In the few minutes remaining to me I turn to this red herring-thi s side issue-whic h members of the Opposition parties have raised to try to distract people from what the Government is attempting to do to stamp out terrorism. They spoke about parliamentary control over ASIO. I have referred to the Act. It is a small Act. On the face of it, it is not the sort of legislation that I should like to see introduced. It creates, on the face of it, an organisation which is a law unto itself. Even with the full credit that one can give to the officers of ASIO, I say that any organisation which is above the law in the way ASIO appears to be above the law until one looks at the terms and conditions of employment of its Director-General, must make mistakes. As a member of this HouseI know from personal experience of occasions when gross mistakes have been made. Every honourable member on the Government side has had this experience when in Opposition. I cannot believe that honourable members who are now in Opposition and who were once in government have not had similar experience of complaints about ASIO reports which there was no way of challenging. I know of a case1 will not name the gentleman concerned, but his wife would be known to many honourable members opposite as well as to many Government supporters -in which over a long period a man was refused naturalisation by the previous Government.

73,Ber For Lowe ( Mr Mcmahon); But The Govern,"Immigration and sought the reasons why this man had been refused naturalisation. By a process of elimination only one ground remained, namely, an adverse security report on the man. I followed it through and could not get anywhere. It was a blank wall to me, yet it was a terrible tragedy for the family concerned. The man did not have much understanding of English. He was a Ukrainian. I got a Ukrainian-speaking man from the Australian National University, who is above reproach, to sit in with me while I discussed the position with the man. We spent hours with him. In the opinion of the Ukranianspcaking Australian, it was a joke that this man could be regarded as a security risk. The whole matter was a mistake-the sort of mistake which the Prime Minister discovered in the minute that has been referred to in this debate. To the credit of the present Minister for Immigration ( Mr Grassby), this mistake has been corrected and the man will be naturalised. When he is naturalised, I will be proud to go to the naturalisation ceremony in Canberra and shake his hand, because he was done a terrible wrong. In the time remaining to me I refer to the mistake-the error, if honourable members prefer that word-that was discovered in the minute prepared by the ASIO officer concerning the report from the Department of Foreign Affairs. of 2nd March? can happen out of the blue, but is it not more likely that they can occur in a way which reflects a pattern? does not know that it was a mistake. Of Prime Minister in this debate was exceeded course he does not. When an organisation is at all it was exceeded by the contribution which required to operate in secrecy, mistakes of the honourable gentleman made. I say with this sort will occur. That is why it is the out any sense of real offence to the Minister Government's policy to make ASIO accountfor Immigration that he seemed more at pains able to the public interest. It will do this by to defend his own actions which have led to way of reforms. An administrative court of such hysteria in the migrant community than appeals will review administrative decisions to defend the Attorney-General in another and will review, at the instance of any place. adversely affected citizen or migrant, any decision alleged to have been made on security grounds. The Government will lay down and trust of a nation when it is prepared to regulations, which do not exist at the indulge in the intrigue and duplicity of the jnoment, governing the conduct of members last month over what we are now asked to of ASIO and other security organisations. The believe was a simple misunderstanding. The court will hear, determine and report to Parliament on any breach of those regulations. In conclusion I say that, if the man in the street outside is listening to this debate, I have no doubt that if he is asked who should run this country, ASIO or the Australian Government, he will side with the Australian Government. Minister( Mr Whitlam) really believed as he so glibly claimed today, that the estabUshment of a judicial inquiry would remove what he has called the last vestige of respect that remains for the former Government, this House knows full well that the honourable gentleman would be totally unable to resist that temptation. His advocacy of so absurd a proposition is, in fact, proof positive of the pathetic nature of his attempt to discharge the burden which he sought to discharge in the course of this debate. If the case put forward by the Prime Minister is the best which he, as a Queen's Counsel, can put together, then no honourable gentleman on either side of the House would be foolish enough ever to seek to retain his services in a legal capacity. I say, in quite deliberate terms, that the Prime Minister and his 2 colleagues in this debate have damned the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) with faint praise and irrelevancy. One can only wonder whether they were, in fact, seeking to save the Attorney General or to desert him in his hour of greatest need. The Attorney-General's appreciation of his own need was such that he is known to have sought a face-saving deal on this issue in the last days of last week, during the events leading to his censure in the Senate.

78,Mr Lynch (Flinders) (4.46),"If the PrimeAttorney-General's action and statements concerning the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation have amounted to a campaign of denigration and villification of the former Government, its Attorney-General and ASIO. It has been a campaign based on a tissue of assertions, selective quotations and personal abuse, circumscribed by a carefully and deliberately contrived state of hysteria. It has been a campaign manipulated by one man, the Attorney-General, initially without the knowledge or authority of the Government and subsequently, with only an uneasy form of tacit approval. It has been a campaign which has clearly jeopardised the future operations of security organisations in this country and which has raised directly the spectre of political control over those security services. On 27th March the Attorney-General come forward if we succeed in the establishbrought down a major statement in the Senate. ment of a judicial inquiry. That statement purported to be a detailed disclosure of terrorist activities within Australia a disclosure of conclusive evidence of the ASIO. Just how great that pressure is can be existence of persons and organisations whom concluded from the fact that there was a tied the Government could prosecute-and a full vote at the Australian Labor Party Federal explanation in justification of the AttorneyConference on a motion to abolish ASIO. That General's unprecedented actions in carrying resolution was not carried and we are now out raids on ASIO. It is now a matter of confronted with foreshadowed legislative record that it was nothing of the sort. The moves to place that Organisation under Attorney-General has alleged that there is rigorous ministerial control. I believe the incontestable and overwhelming evidence of implications of this are serious. A political tbe existence of Croatian terrorist and revoluintelligence unit operating as a direct creature tionary organisations. Of necessity this relates of party politics is alien to the underlying to evidence obtained by him and presumably precepts and principles on which our society specified in the statement of 27th March.

Of course, this is not to which prosecutions can be launched. At this mention the integrity and reputation of the stage the Attorney-General has not acted and Director-General which have been called into any reasonable and logical deduction can conclude only that Senator Murphy is culpable for his failure to act or that he is culpable because he has indicted those organisations without having the necessary evidence. The Opposition believes that the statement was designed deliberately to mislead the public rather than to catalogue the evidence which Senator Murphy claims to have obtained. It was a disingenuous statement characterised by its sophistry and speciousness. It was a clear example of a lawyer's arguing a partial brief contrary to all the responsibilities and ethics pertaining to the position of this country's first law officer. Surely the Attorney-General is a person of whom it should always be said that he ought to tell the whole truth and nothing but the whole truth. But on this occasion the whole truth has yet to emerge and will only It has long been the objective of elements within the Australian Labor Party to destroy services have been severely diminished, as the Attorney-General himself so well knows. In The impact of the Attorney-General's question by the Attorney-General's public vote of no confidence. In spite of the many serious consequences of ASIO's treatment and the unprecedented nature of the Attorney General's actions, a wall of silence has been constructed not simply in this national Parliament but throughout the Australian nation. The statement of 27th March omits, as you know full well, Mr Speaker, any conclusive explanation of the actions of the Attorney General. There are a number of fundamental questions the Government has failed to answer contrary to any suggestion, glib as it might have been pre-election, of the concept of open government. One wonders what the Government has to fear in giving factual answers to questions which have been properly put down by members of the Opposition. Not only have there been glaring omissions from the Attorney-General's statement but it contrived to give the impression that the previous Government was indifferent or myopic in relation to terrorist activities. This House is well aware that successive governments pursued a policy that Australia would not allow its territory to be used as a base for terrorist activities overseas and under which persons who committed acts of violence, whether through political or criminal intent, would be and were prosecuted. I , as did other Ministers of the former Government, expressed concern that all possible measures should be undertaken to counter any terrorist activities in this country. It is a demonstrable truth that previous governments were concerned and did take action. That, of course, is a matter of record which the present Government so conveniently seeks to ignore. The former Government applied constant pressure on law enforcement agencies to investigate allegations made by the Yugoslav Government and by various groups in Australia. I refer to a report to the Attorney General's Department as recently as 19th October last year in which the Commissioner of the Commonwealth Police force stated: All such actions have been scrupulously inves-. tigated but to date no viable evidence at all has been known to this House as not to require elabouncovered to support the contention that Croatian terrorists have been trained in Australia. That is now a matter of public record. The present Attorney-General throughout this affaire celebre has refused to answer questions which the Australian public require to be ansMinister for Immigration ( Mr Grassby) wered. In relation to his words on ASIO he because he has been at great pains to clear has stated: I was not refused any information. He thereby effectively removes any valid reason for his raids. Furthermore, there can be no evidence upon which to describe his actions euphemistically as visits. It is a fact that the Canberra head of ASIO was without warning detained in the middle of the night and interrogated. It is also a fact that the Attorney-General raided ASIO headquarters accompanied by 27 Commonwealth police^ men. During that raid safes were sealed, staff forcibly detained, iflles searched and documents taken. There can be no question in this Parliament of calling that raid a visit. Senator Murphy stated: I did not inform the Director-General before I went to ASIO headquarters. Indeed, elaborate precautions had been taken to ensure that no communication was made between the. Canberra and Melbourne ASIO headquarters which may have foreshadowed the Attorney-General's intentions. Furthermore, the Attorney-General has not yet provided an acceptable explanation for his actions. He has said only: I have also said that I found information This was a reference to his Canberra raidwhich caused me to believe that it was necessary to take the action which I took. By his own admission it had little relevance even to the visit of the Yugoslav Prime Minister, for he said later: Et is probably not correct to say that that was the specific reason for my visit to ASIO headquarters. The Government asked the public to believe that there was a conspiracy either within ASIO or among senior public servants whose discussion on the question of security was subject to the report by ASIO subsequently seized by the Attorney-General and now revealed by the Prime Minister to have been a wrong report. Not the least of the questions which remain unanswered concerns the hysteria which the Government endeavoured to create during the visit of the Yugoslav Prime Minister and the details of this are so well ration here. It was a massive security operation without precedent in the. history of this country. I turn finally to comments made by the his own name and the actions in which he has been concerned. It is true to say that the migrant community, as a group, is now fearful. The Government has cast a slur on the total migrant community. By its actions the Government has been divisive in this community. It has sought to set migrant against non-migrant, Yugoslav against non-Yugoslav and Croat against nonCroat. It has surveyed the concept and the philosophy of guilt by association. That concept does not lie very easily with the concept of the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Grassby) of the family of the nation. Suggestions in this Parliament or outside if of 50 or 300 people about to be deported simply add to the sense of hysteria which the Government has sought to create. There is no doubt that there is an overriding and overwhelming need for a judicial inquiry to seek to uncover the facts which the Government has concealed by a process of deceit in this Parliament and outside it. I believe that need is unquestioned. There is no point in blaming ASIO or the Public Service. The full facts must be the subject of total disclosure in this Parliament. The honesty and integrity of the Government remains very much a matter at issue while those facts *are hidden, as they are at the present time.

The second Government has already embarked on and in proposition can only be that the previous the words used in this House by the Prime Government should have sought to obtain Minister( Mr Whitlam) today. It seems to me convictions with the evidence available to it. that the Government has recently embarked Let us examine that second assertion first. If upon a path dangerous to the liberties we it is asserted that the previous Government have accepted in Australia for years and each should have taken action on the evidence then day that has passed it has advanced further available to it, it is equally true now that the along this path on the pretext of protecting present Government should take action on the Australian liberties. The danger is the evidence it said was sufficient to enable action assumption that merely asserting something, to be taken previously. If it does not take which cannot be proved or which is not such action it is clearly agreeing that there sought to be proved, is sufficient to establish was not sufficient evidence for a conviction; it the truth of a proposition and is sufficient, it is clearly agreeing that there was not sufficient is alleged, in some cases to justify punishment evidence for even a charge and it is therefore and, in all cases, to justify the public conagreeing with and not attacking the previous demnation of individuals or organisations Government for not taking such action on against whom no legal proceedings have been such a lack of evidence. brought. The underlying thought in this approach is that because we abhor and are disgusted by particular actions, that is be that we should take action whether we can sufficient ground for abandoning the protecbring a charge, whether we can get a conviction which the law of the land extends to all tion or not, this is really a most serious citizens, even when they do things which we approach and I believe that we are entitled, abhor, that protection being that they cannot having heard that from the Prime Minister in be punished unless they are charged, prothis House, to call before us the senior law ceeded against and convicted in an Australian court of law.

91,Mr Sinclair (New England) (5.38),"Ithan for us to call the Attorney-General before the bar of this place so that we can ask of him the questions that still remain unsolvedquestions that are fundamental to the standing of the man, the standing of this Parliament and the reputation and administration of the Australian legal system. The unanswered questions to which 1 have referred relate not only to the fundamentals of why the Attorney-General visited the headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in Canberra but also to the very exercise of his ministerial responsibilities. Every Minister is charged directly under the terms of the legislation for which he is responsible with a number of specific duties. The normal pattern of administration is that he has persons in his charge who report to him on the basis of which those duties are carried out. The Attorney-General did not see fit to contact thc head of ASIO to discuss with him the questions with which purportedly he is concerned. Instead, he made a midnight raid-and a midnight raid that was totally unexplained. Why did the Attorney-General so vary ministerial responsibilities? The only way in which we seem to have any prospect of getting an answer to this question is, again, by calling him before the Bar of this House. My colleague, the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr Gorton), quite rightly has referred to his concern for civil liberties. There is today a genuine fear among those members of the Australian community who are migrants to this country, particularly those who came from Eastern European countries, that those midnight and pre-dawn knocks on the door, which are reminiscent of the very reason for their leaving their own countries, are likely to be repeated in this country. There is no comfort in the vague assurances given in this place by the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and others that these raids will not be repeated. They should never have occurred, and the fact that they have occurred has struck genuine terror and concern into the hearts and minds of many thousands of new Australians. If We are to find the purpose of these raids and to be certain in this House order. These raids led to some charges being look so solemn that one really would think laid in the Sydney Court of Petty Sessions and, that they meant the motion that has been as you pointed out this morning, they are sub moved. The only purpose of this motion to judice. morning that nothing should be said that could be prejudicial to the people who are to come before the court to answer charges. The honourable member is entitled to refer to this matter, but he must not give details related to the cases. Mr Speaker. Indeed, it is for the very reason that the matter is sub judice that I believe it is essential that we in this place be given the motives of the Attorney-General in organising these raids at the time at which and in the circumstances in which he organised them, and on what criteria he organised them. Is it, perhaps, that the raids were conducted only on the basis of evidence tendered by another government? Is it possible that the evidence came from a country in which the methods of acquiring evidence and administering the law do not accord with our own standards? Is the Attorney-General acting only on the premise given by that sort of information? These are questions which only an inquiry in this place can answer. There is concern in the civil service. Allegations have been made against individual public servants, but no opportunity has been given for those individuals to demonstrate the side of the case that they must genuinely hold. There is concern about the adequacy of evidence in regard to terrorism in this community. There is also the motive of the left wing of the Government Party in its whole attack on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. In this House over the last 9 years there have been consistent attempts by members of the Australian Labor Party to express concern at the actions of ASIO. If the motives of the Attorney-General are only the destruction of ASIO, it is essential that we in this place have an opportunity to examine him and to ask why he is proceeding in this manner. I believe that it is only by calling the Attorney-General to this place that these and many other significant questions can be answered adequately.

95,Mr Daly (Grayndler,"Leade r of thebefore the Bar of this House is to delay the business of the House. Today we have seen this House pass a resolution of confidence in the Attorney-General, and consistently on this side of the Parliament, the Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) and others have answered members opposite should be patient and I will enlighten them. The real purpose behind the motion moved by the right honourable member for Higgins is to delay the business of the House and to take the minds of the people off the guilty consciences of those who sit opposite. For years honourable members opposite, particularly the right honourable member for Higgins, as I shall show, have gone easy on the terrorists. In addition, honourable members opposite have moved this motion as a diversion. Who would not want to forget the wrangles going on between the Country Party, the Democratic Labor Party and the Liberal Party? Who would not want to put that away? Who would not want to forget the dissension that exists in their ranks and to put away from the public mind the fact that they are split to ribbons from one end of this country to the other and in the Parliament? Everybody knows about this and this motion is a diversionary tactic that honourable members opposite hope will succeed. They are desperate men. Of course they are looking for issues. Honourable members opposite refuse to believe the truth. 1 wonder why we do not ask Senator Greenwood to come before the Bar of the House in order that he might tell us what he has done with the stolen documents that he has hidden in his garage. Of course, no mention is made of this. The right honourable member for Higgins talked about civil liberties. He was a party to that infamous propaganda which was put out during an election and which listed as a communist every person who walked down the street with a communist. We were defeated in that election a few years ago because of the policy of guilt by association employed by the right honourable member for Higgins and those who sit behind him. Everybody knows that the motion moved by the right honourable member for Higgins is a phoney approach to the subject. It is guilt by association. Honourable members opposite have been answered again and again in this Parliament. Documents galore have been produced, and still they refuse to believe the truth. They wish to take the matter to another place so that they may have an opportunity to use again the brute force of numbers that they used so undemocratically in that place. Honourable members opposite pretend that they are defending public servants. Public servants waited 23 years for the then Government to do something for them. That Government would not even give them decent working conditions, yet the Opposition now says that it is defending the good name of public servants. What a phoney proposition. . Let us examine what was done by the right honourable member for Higgins and see how he went easy on these terrorists. I have a document signed by Patrick Shaw, First Assistant Secretary, dated 27th August 1964 and dealing with Croat terrorists in Australia. August 1964 and it states: In the past few months there has been considerable activity towards drafting some public statement which would answer the numerous questions on the parliamentary notice paper concerning the activities of Croat national groups in Australia. As a background there have been further investigations Into the activities of these groups by both ASIO and the Commonwealth Police. My impression is that the Commonwealth Police reports have been more thorough, accurate and revealing than those of ASIO. An important point in the investigations was the turning up by the Commonwealth Police of a film put together by the Croat organisation in Australia, purporting to show the extent of the Australian Government's military and political support of their terrorist activities. This film was obviously designed for use overseas and it brought a violent reaction from the Attorney-General when he saw it. At that time Mr Snedden was about to issue a fairly strong statement in his own name which has been approved in principle by the Prime Minister just prior to bis departure overseas. Let honourable members listen to this: However, Senator Gorton objected because of its possible unpopularity amongst Government back benchers and there have been a number of attempts to redraft a watered down version of the condemnatory statement which contained threats of legal action against terrorist groups. In other words, the right honourable member for Higgins was going easy on his friends in the terrorist organisations in this country; he was going easy on the Croats. That confidential document indicates what a phoney argument he has advanced in this Parliament today. It is a smokescreen by the right honourable member for Higgins. He would not",49,Examination Of Attorney General

99,Mr Daly,"The document is dated 27thhave moved this motion in the Parliament if he had had the numbers, because the last thing he wants is an investigation into how he and the previous Ministry went easy on those who are terrorists in this country. Of course, honourable members opposite will move a motion in this House only when they know that they cannot carry it. I would love to see the secret files on the activities of members of that Ministry in regard to terrorists. At that time Senator Gorton did not want anything done because those great civil liberties fighters who sit behind him would have been embarrassed by action being taken against their fascist friends in the ranks of the Croats in this country. This is the reason why the motion to call the Attorneyprobably could give us a lot on this matter General before the Bar of this House has been moved.' Have honourable members ever heard anything more phoney in their lives? I only wish we had the time to debate in this Parliament the unlimited things that should be said in respect of this matter. But there is legislation to be passed by this House. There is legislation to which we must give effect. We are not like the previous Government. We are doing things. We do not have idle hours to sit here and not put measures through. The fact is that the motion is an attempt to delay the House. It is what might be called a phoney apology for what has been done. The Party opposite has been cut to ribbons by the allegations by the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy). If anybody was demolished today in this Parliament it would be the members of the Opposition when the Prime Minister( Mr through. Tactics of this nature should be Whitlam) had finished speaking in the previous debate. I have never seen such relieved men opposite as when we said that they could have only 3 speakers in the debate. Immediately the Prime Minister finished talking they all walked out from the other side of the chamber. You could have fired a shotgun in the direction of the other side of the chamber without hitting anyone because not one of those great freedomfightersremained to hear the rest of their case. Is it any wonder that we treat this motion as a phoney proposition? The honourable member for New England the document from which the Leader of the ( Mr Sinclair), who is Deputy Leader of tbe House quoted be tabled. Australian Country Party, has to try to fight his way back to the top somehow. His Leader is only the third most important man in the honourable gentleman to ask under the Opposition. Where that puts him, I do not Standing Orders. I would have tabled the know. He is grasping at straws. The Leader document if he had asked by interjection. of the Country Party( Mr Anthony), the great militant, came forward and tried to tell us that he will fight for civil Liberties. The most oppressed people in the country are those who are represented by members of the Country Party. There is no democracy in that Party or in its administration generally. Here today members of the Country Party are telling members on this side of the Parliament what ought to be done. I would have liked the right honourable member for Higgins to have moved that we call to the door of the Parliament some of the great capitalists of this country so that we could hear how they are exploiting the Australian people through prices and such factors. I would like to hear from somebody like Senator Greenwood. He that he is keeping hidden. He must have something to hide because he has pinched the papers and has hidden them in his garage. That is the situation. What a phoney proposition to put up. House is getting a little away from the motion. I name it for what it is-a n attempt to hold up the business of the House. I issue to honourable members opposite not a threat but a word of friendly warning. The Government will not tolerate the business of the House being taken out of its hands. The legislation of this country must go through and it will go judged by the public for what they are. They have nothing to do with national security or the Attorney-General. They are a deliberate attempt to hold up the business of the House and the progressive legislative program of this Government. Keep in mind that such tactics will not be tolerated. Learn early that if you want to debate the big issues, do not waste time on frivolous motions like the one we have just debated.

He apparently relies on a document in which I indicated that I did not think a stronger statement should be made or action should be taken against people whose names I cannot remember. That approach of mine would be made entirely in Une with what I have been saying in the House today; that is that there should be no action and no public accusations unless there is sufficient evidence for a charge to be made and a conviction to be brought.

It is important for honourable members to remember that in the country which is now Yugoslavia there have been tensions for well over 100 years. These are racial tensions-ethni c tensionswhich go back for a long time. It is perfectly true, as the Prime Minister said, that Croat orgam'sa tions Mr ScholesI take a point of order. The honourable member is debating the question for which he is seeking the suspension of Standnot go into the details of the Warburton ing Orders to debate and not debating the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. able member for Mackellar to keep his remarks related to the suspension of Standing Orders. why it is important that we should debate this matter. Things have been omitted from the Government's presentation, and the Government's presentation of this whole case has been one-sided. It is perfectly true, as the Prime Minister has said, that fanatical Croat organisations were responsible for the assassination, for example, of King Alexander. I think he mentioned this earlier today. He did not mention that antecedent to that incident 5 Croat deputies had been murdered inside the Parliament of Yugoslavia and that the assassination of the King followed upon this murder. This is the kind of selection which gives a distorted picture. The Prime Minister spoke of Ante Pavelic as being a Hitler puppet. He was a Nazi. but the Prime Minister did not say that Pavelic was active long before the war, nor does he gay that he was at one time endeavouring to be on the Allied side when Russia and Hitler were in full alliance and the faction that is now the Government of Yugoslavia was the Axis puppet at that time. This is the kind pf selective presentation which the Prime Minister has given us and by omitting so many of the facts and saying so many things which were true he has distorted the whole picture. We want to know more about what has happened in Australia. The Prime Minister has quoted from Australian Security Intelligence Organisation files. I do not know what is in ASIO files. I of course have never seen them, but I know that there is another side to the picture, and it would be surprising indeed if it were not in ASIO files. The Attorney General (Senator Murphy) referred to agentsprovocateurs. This is a most important thing, and it is most important, of course, in regard to the Warburton Ranges affair which the Prime Minister mentioned and which has been mentioned quite widely in the Senate. I will Ranges affair because it is sub judice, but I simply make in passing the same kind of reference to it as the Government has made. In my opinion the Warburton Ranges affair does not show Croat guilt. It shows rather Yugoslav Titoist Government guilt and the use of agents-provocateurs and frame-ups deliberately to give a distorted picture. I may be right; I may be wrong. able member for Mackellar to return to debating why he wants the Standing Orders suspended. I am saying that I believe the debate should proceed in order that this kind of thing can be mentioned in the House. We have heard only one side. I am not giving details; I am referring to the kinds of matters which could be mentioned in a more extended debate. There is the other side, and there is some evidence that this other side is important. The Prime Minister referred to our honoured guest, the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia. He was careful not to mention that our honoured guest had been an officer of the infamous UDBA, the secret police of the Titoist Yugoslavs, and that this is how he achieved his rise to power. The Prime Minister did not tell the House that our honoured guest bad been, in Bosnia, which is in Yugoslavia, the chief of this secret police and that his connection with UDBA was the foundation of his career. The Prime Minister did not tell the House of the numbers of Yugoslav agents who are being attached, in some kind of semi-official way, to the consulates and other bodies throughout Australia.

The motion concerns the right of the Opposition to speak on matters of pubtoday cannot have it brought on in this lic import, to question and to criticise. The Government, by the use of the gag-the motion that the question be now put-has , in respect of this matter and in respect of many other matters I submit, reduced to a minimum the right of members of the Opposition in this House to express a view, to question and to criticise. Indeed, the debate on the motion which was moved this afternoon, virtually without warning, was gagged by the Government. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. was explaining that Standing Orders should be suspended so that the House can debate in full Order of the Day No. 9 on today's Notice Paper entitled 'Croatian TerrorismMinisterial statement'-that is the name the take note of Paper: Resumption of debate . . .'. By the procedure that it has used the Government, virtually without notice this morning, has scrubbed this matter from the notice paper. This was a statement which the Government saw fit to introduce into this House and, one would have thought, it was a statement containing such matters of public interest as would deserve full debate, including debate by the Opposition in this House. The Government has gagged this debate. There are only 2 minutes left to me in which to speak but I want to say that the Government has done a good deal of gagging in this House over the last week or so. Today it gagged this debate after only 3 speakers on this side of the House when my party had a list of at least 15 members who wished to ( Mr Daly), who is sitting here not paying much attention, is always denying the right of ging debates but he always takes the opportunity to speak himself, not very pertinently or constructively but nevertheless he takes the time which he will not give to members of the Opposition for debate. The Opposition has the right to speak, to be heard, to question and to criticise. Goodness, before dinner we had the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) trying to make the fatuous point that if the Opposition wished to debate this matter further it could have it put on the notice paper as private members' business. He knows or ought to know full well that any member who gives notice of private members' business House until next September. So much for that point. In view of the great build up given to this statement in the week before the Attorney General (Senator Murphy) made it in the Senate, one would have thought it touched 3 important areas of public interest in this country. Firstly, there was a question of terrorist organisations relating, as the Attorney General said, to Croatian movements.

When proof is produced I for one and, I am sure, other members on the Opposition side will say that if those persons can be found guilty they ought to be punished within Australian law, and I emphasise 'Australian law'. But the real objective of this statement was to criticise the former Government and the former Attorney General, Senator Greenwood, in particular. It was a straight out attack on Senator Greenwood-that was the real objective of it-and Senator Greenwood has answered that attack in full. The third point and second important matter raised by the statement that the Opposition wants to debate and question is why this Government and the Attorney-General in particular have set out to destroy the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, its standing and effectiveness within Australia and its standing externally in relation to the trust which it had with the intelligence services of our allies, those countries with which we have been co-operating and which have been cooperating with us in the past. vices and Property) (8.5)I do not intend to detain the House for long but I want to clarify the matter for the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) who moved the motion and the honourable member for Curtin( Mr Garland) who seconded it. The motion is a frivolous one. It has not been supported by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lynch), the Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr Anthony) or the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr Sinclair). In other words, it has been moved by 2 discarded-and quite rightly so-ex-Ministers who are sitting in the second-last row of the House at the present time. They are not quite far enough out of the House. Tonight we have had the spectacle of 2 ex-Ministers holding up the business of this Parliament. Seeing their performance in the Parliament on this question one does not wonder why they are where they are today. The honourable member for Curtin spoke about what had not been done today. The Leader of the Opposition spoke on this matter for one hour today-4 5 minutes on one motion and 15 minutes on another which related to the suspension of Standing Orders. That is a pretty fair go in a Parliament which is limited for time. When honourable mem; bers opposite were in Government they did not give us such a fair go. The. honourable member spoke about the gag. Let me remind honourable members what a former Prime Minister-on e who was silly enough to select him for a Ministryhad to say about it. The following is part of a speech by the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr Gorton) on 25th November 1969. He said: But what I think is more important is this play upon the fact that the gag has been moved as frequently today as it has been. It is always within the capacity of an Opposition, if it acts stupidly enough, to force a gag to be moved. Let me repeat it. He said: It is always within the capacity of an Opposition, if it acts stupidly enough, to force a gag to be moved. Nobody would wonder why the gag has to be moved. The stupidity de luxe of the 2 honourable members opposite caused those kind of things to happen. Do not forget that the previous Government moved the gag 200 or 300 times. If we moved it on the hour every hour we would still be miles behind when this Parliament finished. The honourable member for Mackellar stated that all kinds of things should have happened. But what he did not realise was that this Government is giving honourable members free speech. For instance, Grievance Day is always provided except, as happened the other day, when the Opposition deliberately disrupts it. Not only did the Opposition prevent question time but it also stopped the Grievance Day debate being called on because it sought to disrupt the proceedings of the House. Private members' rights were infringed. That was not the fault of the Government; it was the responsibility of honourable members opposite. The other night, by deliberate tactics designed to disrupt the passage of legislation, the Opposition forced the abandonment of the adjournment debate on purpose to show its fighting qualities. Honourable members opposite fight so much amongst themselves that it is public knowledge. So why do they try to impress people with this lot of rot that they are going on with on this occasion? This is the second occasion in succession in this Parliament on which a motion of this type has been moved. Let me give honourable members opposite due warning. I am a very patient fellow but I will not be for long. The Opposition may move frivolous motions. It may hold up the",54,Pairs
122,Mr Daly (Grayndler,"Minister for Serproceedings of this Parliament. It may do so deliberately for all kinds of reasons. But I say tioned the Commonwealth Electoral Bill. that under the Standing Orders no government will allow it to continue to do so in an irresponsible way. As I said earlier, not one responsible member on that side of the Parliament-the y are pretty hard to find-supports this motion. The initiation of this motion has been left to 2 honourable members who have been discarded and discredited by their own Party. Yet this Government is expected to put up with this kind of conduct in the Parliament. I would have throught that the honourable member for Mackellar was old enough to know better. He has had a pretty good run. He ought to take things quietly because blood pressure rises in such circumstances. The only person that he influences and disturbs in this Parliament when he talks is himself. We on this side of the House know that he is up to these antics. When the honourable member was on the back bench he was always a firebrand. But he was a quiet sort of chap when he was emancipated and elevated to the Ministry. Now he is trying to do the same thing in reverse. But we on this side of the Parliament are a wake-up to the honourable member. I suggest to him that, as we are abolishing the means test and doing all sorts of things that he wants us to do, he ought to have more respect for the Government. The honourable member sbould set a better example for the younger members on that side of the House and not try to hold up the deliberations of this great chamber. I do not like to say these things in a hurtful manner because in a strange kind of way I have a lot of respect for tiie honourable member but we cannot allow this kind of conduct to continue without putting the record straight. I just say those few brief words and I ask the people outside do not realise that Opposihonourable members opposite to ponder on tion members are not worth the money they the words of the right honourable member are getting, they soon will if there are any for Higgins( Mr Gorton). If an Opposition is more antics like this. stupid enough it can force a lot of gags to be moved, but in this Parliament we have a lot of legislation to be passed which is tremendously important to the country people, the city people and overall to the Australian people. Therefore we do not want to be interrupted by frivolous motions of this kind. That tion. is why tonight I put the record straight. This Government has no desire to apply the gag. It able member claim to have been misreprehas no desire to stop discussion. Bill? Thirty-three honourable members spoke on that Bill. The debate went for nearly 13 hours on a Bill which consisted of 5 clauses, only 2 of which had any importance. In 1965 on a Bill consisting of 18 clauses there were only about 40 speakers who took part in a debate which lasted about 11 hours and we finished it at 4 o'clock in the morning. Honourable members opposite are the democrats who talk about us. In any case, the Australian Country Party ran out of speakers and one of its members had to talk twice. When honourable members opposite want to talk about these things they should do a bit of homework on them first. I heard the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) say while sitting at the table: 'For heaven's sake, give me something to say on the final clause. The Country Party has nobody else to talk'. Mr ArmitageI overheard him. member for Chifley overheard that statement. Let us not have all this rot about debates being stopped. Time has been set aside for Grievance Day and for General Business. Next Thursday the honourable member for Mackellar may move his motions-bot h of them-if he wishes to do so. This is unprecedented. This Parliament stands for open government and free speech. What is more, we do not steal documents and hide them in a garage. They are here for all to see. We table them. I thought I would put the record straight and bring honourable members up to date and just warn them in the interests of democracy in this country not to waste the time of the Parliament.

133,Mr Holten (Indi) (8.17),"It is interestThe new compensation arrangements in this Bill will be widely welcomed by the large number of people who will be covered under the Act. My information is that the total number of people involved will be approximately 425,000. This figure covers members of the Commonwealth Public Service, employees of Commonwealtli authorities, members of the armed forces and other people covered by such Acts as the Naval Defence Act and the Supply and Development Act. As Ministers and members of Parliament well know, many members of the Commonwealth Public Service and statutory authorities are called upon to work long hours under continual pressure. They need to possess many fundamental qualities to carry out their duties successfully. Some of the more significant requirements are a highly developed sense of dedication together with ability and sound judgment. They also seem to develop a strong sense of loyalty and exhibit a willingness to help honourable members with detailed information on a wide variety of subMinisters of passing the buck to public serjects. Their ability to maintain essential vants when they are in trouble does not confidentiality is another important feature. Every member of the House, particularly who wiil qualify for compensation under a those in the Australian Country Party and proposed new section 5 (c) of the Act. The others who represent rural areas, will agree proposed new section states that the definition that members of the various Public Service of 'disease': departments stationed in country electorates . . . includes any physical or mental ailment, are most helpful and have made it easier for dendisorder, defect or morbid condition, whether of sudus to help country people with their probaggravation, acceleration or recurrence of any prelems. There would not be one of us in the existing physical or mental ailment, disorder, defect or Australian Country Party who has not morbid condition; received valuable assistance at various times When we consider the number of conditions from such people as the District Telephone which could apply to the definition I have Manager and his staff, the District Postal just read out it is not hard to visualise the Manager and his staff, the Registrar of Social significant decline that will take place in the Services, the Regional Directors of Labour health of public servants if they are subjected and the Commonwealth electoral officers and to the unprincipled actions of senior Ministers the members of their staffs.

I mentioned a few minutes ago the various curacy', 'incompetence', 'misunderstanding' fundamental qualities that a successful public and 'misinterpretation'. These words are in servant needs. I must say that as far as Hansard for everyone to see. It is pointless Canberra employees of the Public Service are for the Prime Minister to deny that he used concerned I have no doubt that the basic those words. They are all recorded in Hanqualities I outlined are being stretched to the sard and in the headlines of the national limit by the rash of legislation brought about by the Labor Government and also by the ready willingness of senior Ministers of the Labor Government ruthlessly to attempt to shift the blame for a crisisa crisis either for the Government or for the Minister-o n to members of the Public Service. There have been recent major national examples of this. One involved Sir Arthur Tange of the Defence Department and the Minister for Defence( Mr Barnard) when the Minister was involved in a serious staff problem over a briefing with Lord Carrington, the British Defence Minister. The Minister passed the blame from himself and involved a very senior public servant in Sir Arthur Tange. Of course, we recently have had our attention drawn to a serious matter which concerned the raid by the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) on the headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in Canberra and Melbourne. It would be surprising if the policy of greatly increase the number of public servants or gradual development, and also includes ths The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) when referring to members of the Public Service in such despicable words as 'conspiracy', 'withholding of information', 'malevolence', 'inacPress. I have just one example of this. It is a headline from the 'Daily Telegraph' of 4 days ago, which states: 'PM Blames Public Servant For Raid'. This completely supports my comments. The overall provisions of this Bill constitute a tremendous improvement in the compensation position of Commonwealth employees who, broadly speaking, in the course of their duties are inflicted with death, illness or injury whether or not actually caused by their occupation. Some of the most important proposals that will change the previous situation rather dramatically are, firstly, that an employee's compensation on a pro rata basis will not be limited to 26 weeks but will be available for the rest of his life and, secondly, that a widow no longer will receive a lump sum but will be paid according to her family situation and according to her late husband's pay, with regular incremental increases being taken into consideration. All reasonable people will support the principle that a fair compensation payment should be made in all possible circumstances, and the Australian Country Party unhesitatingly supports this proposition. No-one would begrudge the most generous possible payment to a widow, particularly if she has children. However, it is extremely difficult for members of the Parliament and the nation to assess the practicality and reasonableness of the proposals contained in this Bill. The reason I say that is that the second reading speech of the Minister for Labour( Mr Clyde Cameron), which is the explanatory speech introducing the Bill, is another of the increasing list of measures which are being brought into the House by the Labor Government and which do not contain cost estimates. It illustrates the worrying irresponsibility of this Government in regard to expenditure. Someone must pay. Many taxpayers, including the members of the Commonwealth authorities covered by this Bill, are expressing concern about who will pay and about when information on the cost of these and other proposals is to be made public. As with other measures, this Bill cannot be viewed in isolation; it cannot be divorced from overall budgetary considerations in spite of the Prime Minister's extraordinary statement in his policy speech that social welfare and social security as a whole no longer would be subject to financial or budgetary considerations. This Bill will have another side effect which is sure to cause a big headache to members of private business and industry, small and large. There is no doubt that there will be a follow on in other sections of industry. In an article in the 'Financial Review' of Sth March, before this Bill was announced, the writer said: The Minister for the Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, Mr Kep Enderby, is working on the preparation of ordinances to extend the benefits of the Act to employees privately employed in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory. This illustrates the point that I made that there will be a follow on in other sections of industry. Thousands of primary producers and small business people could have an unbearable burden placed upn them by workers compensation insurance rates, which are very high even under the present arrangement. Apart from the increasing worry for business people of financing the load there is the inevitable increase in costs to the public. Another alternative to be considered is the possible collapse of the small business structure of Australia. Any substantial weakening of the structure of private enterprise would, of course, materially assist the Labor Government towards its announced and dedicated objective of a socialist state in Australia. you will start to believe it. ment Party are interjecting in critical fashion, but surely it is reasonable to put forward some of the points that ought to be taken into consideration. It is reasonable to put both sides of an argument. The Country Party will not oppose the passage of this Bill through the House of Representatives because it recognises that many of its provisions are just and justified, particularly those relating to widows. However, the Country Party wants to convey a warning to the people of Australia, particularly those who will benefit from this measure. The warning is that in the long run all of us as taxpayers have to pay and have to face the day of reckoning which must inevitably come as the Labor Party continues to introduce uncosted legislation involving huge and compounding increases in government expenditure. It is understandable that the beneficiaries of these schemes are experiencing a sense of pleasure and satisfaction in the initial stages of the range of extra benefits. However, we of the Country Party believe that the long term",57,Compensation Commonwealth Employees Bill 1973

135,Mr Holten,"Members of the Governeffect of the new measures involving Government spending, added to by shorter working hours, could have serious inflationary consequences for the overall standard of living in Australia and the general efficiency and cost structure of our domestic industries across the nation. The ability of industry to compete with imports from other countries and on the export markets must be affected. Whilst we appreciate that improvements in the compensation scheme had to be considered, we feel that it is approand some significant changes in the rates and priate for a member of the House to put the other side of the question so that the people may weigh whether the improvements have any significance. They will be able to judge in the future what happens to our cost structure, and that only time will tell. like to say at the outset that I am very pleased that the professional obstructionists on the other side of the House have seen fit at least tacitly to support the Bill. One would have doubts from what has been said by the honourable member for Indi( Mr Holten), who is a member of the Australian Country Party, because whilst in fact members of the Country Party are paying lip service to the measure they are putting arguments against it. Their remarks will be judged by the people who do not believe that it is a pleasure to receive compensation. They receive compensation because they have been injured or find themselves in a desperate situation. It is certainly with some pleasure that I support the Bill. In doing so I applaud the action of the Minister for Labour( Mr Clyde Cameron) in introducing this legislation. It must be for him, as for me, a proud and satisfying moment when such legislation is introduced into the Parliament. There are in my view 3 great steps taken by this Bill. The first of these is the new definition of disease, distinct physiological change as the product of the the second is the quantum of damages now provided in cases of accident or injury, and the third is the proposal, long overdue, for the introduction of a safety code. The Bill must be seen ss another step forward in the implementation of the Australian Labor Party's comprehensive social security program based on the philosophy that society has an obligation to provide adequately for citizens who for any reason cannot take care of themselves or those dependent on them. It is also necessary that any social security payments should be tied to average weekly earnings, including increments, to ensure that the persons receiving benefits will receive automatic increases as productivity increases, as other factors increase general prosperity, or as inflation occurs. The purpose of the Bill, as I have indicated, is to make a number of important amendments to the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1971-1972. These involve a change in the conditions relating to eligibility for compensation in disease cases amounts payable under the Act. Amendments are made to the definitions of injury and disease, and section 29 of the Act is repealed, thus allowing a disease or the aggravation, acceleration or recurrence of a disease to be treated on the same basis as an injury. Eligibility will be established if the disease or aggravation, etc., arises out of or in the course of employment and, as with an injury, a temporal connection with the employment will be sufficient. In my experience the use of legal definition of accident, injury or disease has been such that the workers have not received their proper rights. I instance the action of the Victorian Government in 1964 when on the one hand it increased the quantum of damages and on the other severely restricted the areas in which those damages could be granted, the net result being that employers who are represented by our friends in the Opposition, paid less in compensation payments than before. This was a step heralded by the Bolte Government as an advance in social legislation. An example of the effect of the amendments can be shown by reference -to the Ockenden case, in which the High Court of Australia said: A worker does not suffer personal injury by accident arising in the course of his employment where he suffers at his place of employment a sudden and inevitable development of a progressive disease from which he is suffering and where such change can in no way be attributable to or associated with some incident of his employment. I am pleased that this legislation will remove that terrible impost on a worker trying to establish his rights to workers compensation. I shall outline the main changes in the rates and amounts of compensation payable under the Act. Compensation for total incapacity will be increased to the level of the employee's average weekly earnings, including increments, and will continue at this level during the entire period of his incapacity. Compensation for partial incapacity will be a weekly amount",59,Compensation Commonwealth Employees Bill 1973
136,Mr Innes (Melbourne) (8.33),"I wouldequal to the difference between the employee's average weekly earnings in his pre-injury employment and the weekly amount he is earning after the injury, without any limit on the amount so payable. The Commonwealth will be obliged to provide suitable employment to a partially incapacitated employee or continue weekly payments on the basis of total incapacity; but the payments may be suspended if the employee unreasonably refuses or fails to accept or satisfactorily undertake suitable employment when it is provided. The lump sum compensation for death is replaced by weekly payments ranging up to the full average weekly earnings of the deceased employee. The lump sums payable for specified losses are to be related to the national average weekly earnings, and thus will be varied automatically on a quarterly basis. On current figures this will give a maximum of $26,026 compared with $14,500 provided in the Act. The percentages relating to the various losses have been increased and additional losses have been provided for, namely, loss of binocular vision, loss of the procreative function, bodily disfigurement and the loss of part of the body or of a faculty not elsewhere provided for in the section relating to certain losses. Also these lump sum payments will no longer terminate entitlement to continuance of weekly incapacity payments. An employee who is also receiving a superannuation or Defence Forces Retirement Benefits pension will be given the right to request a lump sum payment in redemption of the liability for weekly payments even though he is totally incapacitated. An employee whose total incapacity for work would be permanent but for vocational training will not have his weekly compensation reduced because of any earnings he receives during or as a result of the training. The law in Australia-thi s is terribly important-has , for at least 50 years, provided 2 ways of compensating a worker who is injured as a result of circumstances connected with his employment. At common law the injured worker has a right to sue for damages if his injury can be found to have occurred as a result of the faultI ask honourable members to note that word-of his employer or fellow employee. Where no fault exists, workers have been able to receive limited benefits by making claims under workers compensation statutes. There has always been a basic difference in philosophy between the benefits obtainable under workers compensation Acts and those obtainable as a result of actions for damages. In actions for damages where fault has been established the law has attempted to put the injured worker in the same monetary situation as he would have been in had his injury not occurred by providing compensation for out of pocket expenses, past and future pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life and future economic loss, including potential loss of income resulting from the loss of opportunity for advancement in employment. On the other hand, workers compensation Act benefits have merely attempted to give the injured worker something towards the solution of his financial problems. They have never attempted to provide a complete economic solution. The degree of assistance has tended to vary between Commonwealth Acts and State Acts, but more often than not the benefits have been only a marginal improvement on benefits obtainable under social service legislation. The increased benefits provided in the Bill will ensure' that the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act is the most generous workers compensation legislation in both scope and benefit ever enacted in Australia. The provisions in the Bill, which compensate for incapacity or disability due to a disease temporarily connected with the employment, provide average weekly income during incapacity, greatly increase lump sum benefits for disability and continue weekly payments in addition to lump sum benefits, will bring the Act closer to: the benefits philosophy of-common law actions for damages than any other workers compensation legislation has ever approached. I believe that the basic principle of all compensation legislation benefits should be to totally compensate not merely to partially compensate. Compensation legislation should ensure that the injured employee is placed in the same economic situation as he would have been in had the injury not occurred. This is not a new proposition. It is a situation which has always been recognised by the common law in Australia where fault has been the cause of the injury. But the overriding concern of governments should be the interest and welfare of the disabled worker or employee, not the establishment of fault in the causation of the injury which has caused disability. This situation is now increasingly recognised by enlightened governments in the Western world and is evidenced by workers compensation legislation and more recently by no fault compensation schemes, an example of which is the scheme recently introduced by the Government in legislation in New Zealand. These Acts and schemes are imperfect examples of the desire of governments to totally compensate injured persons whether they be injured in connection with their work or otherwise and whether or not their injuries occurred as a result of fault. The Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act when amended will still fall short of the benefits that are obtainable in actions for damages. It will still fall short of providing a total solution to the financial problems of injured workers. For example, the lump sum payments will still fall below the amounts obtainable in actions for damages before juries. In the case of total or partial incapacity no allowance is made in this Bill or in the existing code to become empty pious words. It must Act for the fact that the injured employee has more often than not been deprived of promotional opportunity and economic advancement. The weekly payments on death provided in the Bill are not as valuable as the lump sum obtainable in actions for damages by widows, particularly since these payments terminate upon the widow's remarrying. I now turn to the Minister's welcome announcement of proposals for a safety code, a proposal that has been for a long time a plank of the federal platform of the Labor Party. It is the prevention of accidents and disease that is the most important factor to workers. Such action is very long overdue. Previous governments have only provided lip service to International Labour Organisation conventions on the very important matter of safety. I would like to point out to the Minister that a number of ILO Conventions dealing specially with safety codes have not at this point in time been ratified by Australia. This is a dishonest approach. We cannot sit at meetings in which these conventions are made and then come back to this country and simply do nothing at all about them. Some of these conventions include: Convention No. 32 Protection Against Accidents (Dockers) (Revised) 1932; Convention No. 62 Safety Provisions (Building) 1937 and, in particular, Convention No. 119 Guarding of Machinery, 1963. In my view it is not good enough to say that under Commonwealth jurisdiction the Government considers that there are no manufacturers of machinery in the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory and that there are major difficulties in ratification in the States. One of the promises of this Government has been that in its Territories it will set up model legislation as an example to the States. Even if there are constitutional difficulties in persuading the States to ratify this Convention, 1 would hope that in the near future the Commonwealth Territories will have legislation which does conform to the Convention and the Minister and the Government should take steps to see that its contracts are directed towards the companies which abide by the provisions of the Conventions. I also suggest that the relevant ILO Convention dealing with safety be referred to the representative committee envisaged by the Minister in his second reading speech. This committee would play a major part in not allowing this decision to establish a safety become a reality in the interests of people who suffer as a result of accidents and who look to this legislation as a means of obtaining justice in this area. BrieflyI refer now to the Seamen's Compensation Act 1911-1972. I am sure that this is a mere oversight by the Minister but I draw his attention to the quantum of damages provided in the Act. As the Minister will be aware, the Act provides for the payment of an amount of $14,500 in respect of the various more serious injuries. This amount and the percentage of that amount which is paid for the other injuries are set out in the Third Schedule to the Seamen's Compensation Act. The percentages therein in some cases fall well be'ow those in the table on page 8 of the Bill we are now considering. There are other defects in the seamen's legislation. For instance, there is no provision as to compensation for loss of the procreative function-thi s is very important to the seamen-o r for the suffering of facial injuries or the loss of binocular vision. I realise that the Minister has a great number of issues before him but I take this opportunity to urge him at the earliest possible moment to bring the legislation relating to seamen into line with this Bill now before us. I also look forward to the day when the Minister can announce that ILO Convention No. 55 of 1936 which deals with the shipowner's liability in respect of sick and injured seamen has been ratified by Australia. However, I have indicated that I believe firmly that the amendments proposed by this Bill must be supported for the reasons I have already stated. As I have said, this is undoubtedly the most beneficial piece of workers compensation legislation ever passed in Australia. It will substantially improve the situation of disabled or incapacitated But the point is that we must consider the Commonwealth employees entitled to receive its benefits. In supporting the Bill, however, I in prices with a consequent addition to the ask all honourable members to recognise that the increased benefits provided by the Bill are still only a further step towards the ultimate goal of compensation legislation designed to compensate injured employees fully. The hypocrisy of the honourable member for Indi( Mr Holten) who asked where the money is coming from Order! I must point out to the honourable member and the word 'hypocrisy' is unparliamentary and I ask him to withdraw it. to other people to judge for themselves. The way in which the honourable member presented his case and the futility of his argument rest on that basis. He asked where the money is coming from to provide such benefits to Commonwealth employees. There was no trouble in financing the war in Vietnam where we sent our young people to fight and die in the jungles of that country. SoI do not see any difficulty in finding the necessary funds to finance this piece of legislation. Regardless of fault, the people who rely on this legislation will receive benefits which will place them in the same position financially and economically as they would have been in had their injuries not occurred. I commend the Bill to the House. remarks will be brief. I do not intend to oppose the amendment which will be moved in Committee or the Bill because I think that the provisions of the Bill are very generous. I am sure that they will be acceptable to the Commonwealth employees. The only matter about which I express wme concern is that, in my opinion, the Government's proposals may have a chain reaction throughout all industries and throughout all States. 1 realise that the bringing down of this Bill will probably be looked at as being a lead by the Government to industries and to the States for employees compensation. This brings to my mind the flow over that must occur in all areas in which people are employed. For instance, in industry if these generous provisions are adopted there must be an added cost of operations. I am not suggesting for one moment that it would be a bad thing if industry did adopt the provisions of this legislation. I think it would be a darn good thing. additional costs which could mean an increase inflationary trend. There were anomalies in the previous legislation. That is not news. I remind the present Government that thc previous Government had also recognised that there were anomalies in the legislation and that it was committed to the removal of those anomalies had it been re-elected to office. I am very pleased to see incorporated in the Bill provision for compensation for employees who are incapacitated as a result of disease contracted in the course of their employment. A number of people in the Commonwealth sphere would benefit from this provision. This is a grand idea and a move in the right direction, especially for those peopleI know some of them-wh o have contracted dermatitis in the course of their employment and have no resort to compensation. I am sure that the automatic adjustments to weekly compensation payments will be extremely acceptable because it will remove a great worry from the recipient of compensation payments. I notice that the principle involved in awarding compensation for partial incapacity is to be retained but the limitation is to be removed. I also notice that the Commonwealth is to provide suitable employment wherever it can for partially incapacitated employees. This is an excellent idea and I hope it will be carried through. There are many people in receipt of compensation who are not completely incapacitated and who feel that they are redundant. If employment could be found for these people they would then become productive, and remain so, in a field of work which suits their ability. This would give them a purpose in life. When one thinks that a 35-hour working week could be introduced into this country, one feels that we will need as many members of the Australian work force as we can possibly get in order to produce. Every person who is productive will help the Commonwealth and will help himself. In this respect I feel that vocational training for the severely handicapped is to be recommended. 1 would",60,Compensation Commonwealth Employees Bill 1973

It would have been reasonable for the Government when introducing this Bill to give the Opposition some indication of the estimated cost of the proposals.

The Parliament should know the estimated cost of these proposals. difference? difference in that one could then look at what should be done in connection with the financing of the overall structure of the economy. The Country Party has been left in the dark by the Government as to the cost of the proposals. We want to know how the scheme will be financed and how thefinancingof this scheme, in conjunction with all the other Government expenditures, many of which are reckless, will affect the community. We should like to know whether extra taxation will be required or whether some of the benefits that are already available in other spheres will have to be reduced tofinancethis scheme. The Minister might give attention to those matters. Will the recipients of the benefits of this should flow to all industry. If the flow on proposal have to contribute through further does occur, someone will have to meet the taxation to provide for these benefits? I know extra costs. The Minister may care to offer that the answer will be no because it would some information on the matters I have be good politics to say no. The presence of raised.

Among those contributors a whole. The Minister commented on that in his second reading speech. It was a very brief comment, but at least a comment was made. The Minister said that it is only right and proper that there should be a comprehensive compensation code to cover all workers who arc injured. We do not object to that but I point out that this would involve a cost to the community. How is that cost to be met? The cost of providing this standard of compensation should be taken into consideration when assessing thefinalcost to the community. In asking these questions I repeat that I am not suggesting that these standards of compensation should not apply, but I am suggesting that the Government should have given some indication of how this legislation will affect the whole of its economic and taxation policies. An indication should have been given of the extent to which prices might have to be increased by industry if these standards ot compensation are to be finally applied to industry. Does the Government expect that industry, and small businessmen in particular, will be able to carry this extra cost when eventually it has to be met, as certainly it will have to be met? Is the Government of the opinion that employees other than Commonwealth employees are not entitled to the same standard of compensation as applies to Commonwealth employees?

144,Mr Corbett,"Yes, it would make awill be some who will benefit from the introduction of this legislation. I should like to know the net benefit to the industrial accidents and disease will have the employees and how much of the benefit will be eroded in different ways. I feel that we should not have had to ask for an explanation on this matter; it is something which the Minister should have explained in his second reading speech. In common with other speakers I welcome the reference to the need for continuing efforts to be made to reduce the number of accidents and to improve the health of the community. I appreciate that reference and I hope that success will be achieved in this direction. I hope that some reduction will be made in the number of cases for which compensation will have to be paid. I believe that every right-thinking person will agree that every endeavour should be made to cope with this matter and the fullest possible research should be carried out the economic and perhaps industrial power that to see that the maximum amount of safety is provided. I am sure that the people of Australia would co-operate fully in applying the most effective safety measures available. Any step that can be taken to reduce suffering and to maintain people in gainful employment should be among the highest priorities of the Government and of every member of this Parliament. I am very pleased that the very deserving Commonwealth employees will receive the benefits that are envisaged in this by no less than 93 per cent. This is a magnifiBill. My only concern is that these benefits may be very seriously eroded if the Government does not adopt a more responsible attitude to the economic state of this country. However, my colleagues on this side of the House welcome and support the Bill. Minister for Labour) (9.11)-in replyI thank the Opposition for the co-operation it has shown in this matter. Further, I thank members of the Opposition for the thoughtful contribuOne has to go to Senator Murphy or to Senations they have made to the debate. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Corbett), touched upon a terribly important point when he said that our aim should be to prevent industrial accidents and disease rather than to ignore these matters and to go on increasing the amount of compensation paid to injured employees. In other words, we have to think in terms of human suffering rather than trying to compensate for it. We have to try to eliminate accidents and disease. The honourable gentleman was absolutely correct when he drew attention to this aspect of the Bill. I am sure that he is right when he says that anything the Government does to try to eliminate wholehearted support of the Australian people. I know that this aim has the support of every Party and every member of the Parliament. I will be introducing shortly, perhaps towards the end of this year, a Bill to provide for a uniform code for the prevention of industrial accidents and disease. The dearest wish of all of us is to prevent industrial accidents and disease. It is no help for employers, insurance companies, union secretaries or anyone else saying it is not possible to reduce the incidence of industrial accidents and disease. It can be reduced. Whatever anyone might say about the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and whatever criticism may be levelled at company exerts, no-one can deny that BHP has set a magnificent example in Australia in showing just how much can be done to prevent industrial accidents. Over the last IS years in the Australian iron and steel industry, which is one of the most dangerous industries in Australia, BHP, through diligence and through applying itself to the task, has been able to reduce the incidence of industrial accidents in its iron and steel plant cent record. The Wiltshire File Company, which is now owned by BHP, has reduced the incidence of industrial accident in its plant by about the same degree. make? files-nail files, wood files, steel fi'es and all that kind of thing. They do not make Australian Security Intelligence Organisation files. tor Greenwood to get those sorts of files. But this firm makes all the other kinds of files. I was recently at the Kwinana steel works and I was tremendously impressed by what I saw when I chanced to drop in upon a meeting of the safety officers of that company. I was absolutely astounded when I learnt that the company had now completed three million man-hours without losing one single day through industrial accidents. This can be done. We are losing $ 1,000m worth of production each year because of industrial accidents. As the honourable members for",65,Compensation Commonwealth Employees Bill 1973

147,Mr Clyde Cameron,"Ordinary steelMaranoa has correctly pointed out, tbe proper thing to do is to see that industrial accidents are reduced and, if possible, eliminated. The Commonwealth ought to be setting the example. At the moment the Commonwealth does not have even a uniform code of industrial safety within its own departments and it does very little, I am ashamed to admit, to enforce a code of industrial safety. The Commonwealth makes not one-tenth of the effort that BHP makes to prevent industrial accidents. This situation will be rectified within the next year at the very latest. Workers' Union? That union has played a position for us to take. more effective part than most people. Workers Union is a union about which I do member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) did not know very much. The honourable member for Maranoa he introduced legislation which for the first raised a proper point when he asked what the time gave Commonwealth employees full pay proposed benefits would cost, and 1 complifor a period of 26 weeks.

At any rate, Ausbenefits provided for in the current amendtralia is now in the forefront. We are leading ments now before the House. The reply was the world and it is a proud position for Austhat the additional cost should amount to tralia to be able to claim. I am very proud about $2,700,000 per year for all of the that this Bill-thi s great advance-is to go Commonwealth's employees and for employthrough with the full co-operation of all ees working for Commonwealth agencies and parties in the Parliament, and for that I am instrumentalities. The amount is really not as grateful. much as that because once employees become entitled to the benefits of this Bill they would not be entitled to social service benefits. So that amount would be subtracted. In addition, employees would have to continue to pay ordinary income tax. Therefore the cost would not be as great as that. At its worse the and agreed to. cost would be $2,700,000. I think the strong point of the case presented by the honourable member for inserting after sub-section (11) the following subMaranoa was that we ought to be aiming at section:the elimination of industrial accidents. He is absolutely right because this is what we ought that to be doing. If we can do this-and we must earned by him from employment during a specified do it-the cost will be nowhere near the figure of $2,700,000. I conclude my remarks by thanking the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bonnett) for the co-operation that he has given in this matter. This is an urgent and important Bill and it represents a great step forward. The passing of this legislation will mean that Australia will have moved to the front in the field of compensation. No longer will we be able to point to Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and say that these are the countries that are leading the world in workers compensation. We have now taken the lead. No other country in the world has a system of workers compensation to Before concluding my remarks I want to when last year as Minister for Social Services Question resolved in the affirmative.

153,Mr Chipp,"The Minister might be moregovernment revenue, the pattern seems to be that a householder can get his bottles free in the form of the empties that he has after buying bottled beer from the brewery or the hotel and drinking it. He saves himself 17c a bottle in excise and suddenly it seems to be a lucrative proposition for him to brew beer at home either in his plastic dustbin or, to the consternation of his wife, in the enamel bath. However, for many reasons, the lustre of this exercise seems to lose a little of its keenness after a time and experience seems to be that many people who come into this venture with a burst of enthusiasm soon lose that enthusiasm and are queueing up at the bottle shop after a month or two of experimentation. For those reasons we believe that the measure is a wise one. It is in line with comparable legislation in other countries. Alternaalcoholic liquor outside normal premises. tive legislation could not be policed and the existing legislation has never been policed except when breaches have been reported to the Department of Customs and Excise. My friend the honourable member for Angas( Mr excise on each bottle of beer. As a result the Giles) is not in the chamber but I would like to put a personal view. One looks at the justice of the complete removal of excise from wine while beer drinkers still pay excise of 17c a bottle. The equity of that action has never quite been described to me. I have never been persuaded on it. Further, I have never quite been persuaded about a party which is the self-confessed champion of the workers but insists that a worker pay excise of 17c on each battle of beer he drinks while an executive having his bottle of wine in a plush restaurant drinks it excise free. With those remarks the Opposition supports the Bill. raise one or two points about this Bill which deals with the excise duty on beer produced for non-commercial purposes. I believe that it is a discriminatory Bill, but at the same time it is clear that any alternative legislation would be impracticable. It is rather a strange set-up. In this case we are supporting the principle of discrimination against the majority in favour of the few. I am somewhat perturbed at legislation which encourages the production of alcoholic drinks brewed in other than recognised premises. I am referring, to use the old expression, to home brew. It is a novelty for a man to produce a brew that is acceptable to his friends. He may create some enjoyment in that way. But I am concerned about the long term results. I think immediately of the effect on health. Many honourable members will remember that during World War II servicemen who could not secure sufficient alcoholic liquor decided to produce their own. On numerous occasions they had a certain amount of success but on other occasions adverse effects resulted. In many instances people suffered rather badly. I have a vivid recollection of being a patient in a hospital where no fewer than 12 servicemen were admitted after consuming home brew. Unfortunately, 4 other drinkers did not make the hospital as they lost their lives after drinking that home brew. That is why I am showing some concern this evening about encouraging the production of On the discriminatory side one immediately thinks about people who purchase their beer from the normal sources. They contribute substantially to revenue by paying about 19c Commonwealth collects in revenue about $400m a year. That is no mean figure. The excise collected on other alcoholic beverages is somewhat small by comparison. The revenue collected from excise on whisky each year is about $4.6m; brandy $ 10.7m: rum $6.3m; and gin $3m. Recently the Parliament removed the excise payable on wine. I might well ask why that was done. Do we discriminate in favour of some as against others? The honourable member for Hotham( Mr Chipp), who is at the table, referred to that aspect. The Government now in office prides itself on equality. Dr. J. F. Cairns-Com e off it. porters are always talking about equality, but on this sort of issue I cannot see that they are motivated by equality. Government supporters pride themselves on representing tbe worker who has a daily glass of beer at a hotel on his way home from work. Dr. J. F. Cairns-It shows what you know about workers. I have never known one who would stop at a glass. need for me to answer that interjection. The Minister has explained my point.

156,Mr Kingi Do Not Think There Is Any,"length on these issues but I simply ask honourable members to note the points 1 have raised. I believe that there could be great dangers in encouraging the production of home brew through the removal of excise. The Government is saying, in effect: 'Produce it as cheaply as you like, fellows. There is no limit to it.' I am reminded of an article I read recently in local newspapers by a writer calling himself 'A Modest Member'. The article was written following inquiries of the writer by some of his friends about the operations of a neighbour in a little building outside his premises. He and his mates decided that they would conduct a raid on what they called 'Fred's office'. He described the raid as follows: But when we forced our way in, we found, not an enjoy the superior drink. Getting back to the office, but the most weird and wonderful home brewmain point, I believe the new Government ing outfit ever seen. There was an old bath bubbling quietly to itself. on wine at a time when they did not need There were shelves of assorted bottles, some with altering. corks tied down with string, some with heavy weights on top of the seals. There were jars of yeast and tins of sugar with ants laying siege. There were mouldy marks on the ceiling where bottles had blown their tops. There were petrol funnels, bits of gauze, there was a bit of almost everything. I will say this for Fred, he wasn't mean with us after the dust had settled. When we agreed to sample some of his homework he put on his mask to protect him if a bottle exploded, and stealthfully approached a particular batch of bottles. He reverently lifted one down, stood it in a china wash basin and advised us to stand clear. Then he bravely took the top off and managed to catch quite a lot of beer in the basin as it came down. It wasn't long before we had enough in the basin to start. We tasted it. You couldn't really say it was like the bought beer, but it was, well, interesting, and it would make a rabbit fight a bulldog. That is one of the reasons why I criticise this Bill. (9.40)Mr Deputy Speaker Dr. J. F. Caims-We have heard some rabbit. What about the bulldog? to speak in support of the amendment that the Government is making in removing the excise from home made beer. I would like to congratulate the Minister for Overseas Trade and the Minister for Secondary Industry (Dr. J. F. Cairns) for perhaps the smartest comment I have heard him make in 6 i years. It is wonderful what oflice does to some individuals. I would like to take up the point raised Chipp), the former Minister for Customs and Excise, in referring to the discrimination displayed by the new Government in removing completely, by regulation in the first couple of weeks of its coming to power, the excise on wine. The honourable member for Hotham pointed out to the Minister that the new Government has introduced a measure that makes it easier for the businessman with an expense account to entertain and drink wine and yet continues the high tax imposed on those people who enjoy the very humble drink-I must confess that as a worker I like it too-beer . MightI say, while I am standing up for the worker, that the XXXX beer in Brisbane is probably one of the best beers one is ever likely to taste in Australia, and it is a pity that the excise on beer continues to make it more difficult for the people of the south to altered the regulations to remove the excise wanted to keep the excise on wine? able member for Riverina popped in here 3 years ago Order! He is the Minister for Immigration. wears many caps, but looking at him in that wine coloured suit, it is not an unfair comparison. He could be the wine coloured suit man or the Minister for Immigration, but I will always know him as the bubbling, popping member for Riverina. The Government introduced this measure to placate the honourable member for Riverina-the Minister for Immigration. It came after I had sat in this Parliament long enough to bave beard arguments from both sides of the House on the matter and after I had heard the honourable member for Angas( Mr Giles), when we were in Government, campaigning strongly against the former Government's decision to introduce the wine excise. The Liberal Government halved that excise and I did not note the advantage to the consumer. The new Government has removed the excise completely and still I do not see any advantage to the consumer.",70,Excise Tariff Bill No 2 1973

177,Mr Grassby,"There were prosecutions. ICustoms and Excise. They are on file at present. I pleaded with him that action be taken. The letters are on file and I was proud to make those representations. I am particularly pleased that the Government is taking action to do something which I am sure the honourable member for Hotham wanted to do himself but in respect of which, under the weight of the Cabinet at the time, I have no doubt his voice was lost. That is all I wanted to say in relation to my own efforts. The point 1 make is that there was, in the case of the modest home brewer, the fear of a knock on the door in the middle of the night or perhaps in the early morning and his modest apparatus being the subject of very close scrutiny by the visiting officers. This, of course, would be upsetting to most fair minded members of the Parliament. Despite the fact that the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Donald Cameron) has been riding a bicycle in two directions at once this evening-that is very difficult even under the influence of home brewI believe that all honourable members opposite support the Government on this occasion. Of course, it has become a tactic to say: 'The Government's action is all right, except that . . . ' . I do not think that there should be any qualification at all about this Bill. An honourable member is either for a tax on home brew or he is not. Let us be clear about this. I say clearly and definitely that the Government has taken the action that was sought by very many people. It has taken action which is fair. As a matter of fact, it is interesting to look at the brief on this subject and to find that the cost of home brewed beer is 7c a bottle and that the Opposition's sturdy freedom fighters for the workers seem to be defending the right of the worker not to have home brew at 7c but to buy commercial beer for 42c a bottle. It seemed to me that that was the impression that was given. who said that. You are being very careless with the truth this evening. says that I am being careless with the truth. I have been listening to the opposition to this measure. An honourable member is either for it or against it. I suggest that the honourable member choose his words more carefully. Honourable members have been talking about the worker calling for his beer on the way home. There has not been much praise for this measure which the Government has introduced. There is such a thing as damning a thing with faint praise, and I think that is what honourable members opposite have been doing this evening. It has been a pretty poor performance. After all, if they are opposed to the Bill they should say so and vote against it. Some honourable members opposite have linked their remarks on this Bill with references to the wine tax. I must make passing reference to the references members of the Opposition were permitted to make. It has been suggested that there was something discriminatory in lifting a tax which had been imposed by the previous Government on the only viable and sound industry that it had left in the countryside after its recent disastrous reign. This was the wine grape industry. The wine grape industry was not in trouble until the. Government got to it. When it did, it immediately applied an excise against the advice of its own people, against the cautions of its own advisers, against the wishes of the industry, and against the advice of the Australian Wine Board. The unanimous advice to the then Government was not to impose an excise, but the Government would not take that advice and it imposed the excise. Of course, it found that there was some trouble as a result. The predictions of trouble were coming true; so the previous Government, bending a little with the wind-the wind that was blowing was a pretty critical one-halve d the excise. blowing now. sion of wind from the honourable member who interjected. I am quite willing to hear his interjections at any time and to deal with them on their merits. However, I must say that it is strange to have the Opposition almost pleading that there should be a raising of taxes on a beverage. This seems to mc to be the tenor of the remarks. Do Opposition members suggest that we should not have removed the wine tax? They had the opportunity to vote against that proposal when it came before the Parliament, but they did not do so. It seems to me that they are. trying to ride a bicycle in 2 directions at the one time. They should make up their minds ori exactly what they want. Did the Opposition want us to retain the wine tax? Mr Donald Cameron-Yes .",72,Excise Tariff Bill No 2 1973

I will give the honourable member thc opportunity to express himself clearly. I have been listening intently to this debate and I gained the impression that the Government was being criticised for lifting the wine tax. I Chair allows some tolerance in debate. The gained the impression that the Government was being criticised for lifting the tax on home brewed beer. If that is what the criticism amounts to, let honourable members opposite say so clearly and definitely. Mr Donald Cameron-There has been no benefit to the buyers of wine. Order! The honourable member for Griffith will cease interjecting. the criticisms which have been made about the wine tax have been continued. I accept the point made by the honourable member for Griffith. As a matter of fact, it was a good one. He points out that there was been an upward spiral in the cost of wine. That is so. It is because of this sort of thing that the by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Government is giving serious attention to prices. There will be an opportunity for the honourable member and other members of the Opposition to Mr KingI rise to order, Mr Deputy Speaker. of the Opposition 3 Government supporters present. to the honourable member for Boothby that if be wishes to speak in the debate he should rise in his place when the Minister has resumed bis seat. If he does not want to speak, I suggest that he remain silent. order is that we are dealing with excise on one commodity and the Minister for Immigration is talking about another commodity. I appreciate that he said that it was a passing reference, but that was some minutes ago. I suggest that it is time he came back to the seems to me to be a very fair one, a very Bill and told us why honourable member is taking a point of order; he must not debate the question. Mr KingI am not debating it. I want to bring the Minister back to the Bill. matters which are being referred to by the Minister have been raised previously in the debate and they are fairly closely related matters. Speaker. The point of order was quite frivolous, as you have ruled, and I am surprised at the honourable member for Wimmera because normally he has an innate sense of fair play. Dr. J. F. Cairns-He certainly is not frivolous as a rule. never have thought that of him. I am somewhat hurt this evening that, on this issue, after making his contribution and referring to all these matters including the matter of the wine tax and perhaps questioning the stand taken Giles), he should take a point of order. AllI can say, more in sorrow than in anger, is that he should at least be able to sit for a moment or two and listen to the facts in relation to an industry which, of course, he harmed by his vote which enabled the imposition of an excise which hurt the industry. BeforeI was interrupted I was referring to the fact that there has been an upward movement in prices and that this is a matter of grave concern to all of us who are in government. It is not only on this one matter but on a whole range of matters. There has been price racketeering in our country. In respect of beverages there has been some fancy racketeering. This is known to anyone who drops in, perhaps without being properly briefed, on some of the places, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, which can best be described as clip joints. The prices bear very little relationship to the product and very little relationship to what the grower receives. I think it is time that we had an examination of the justice of these things. If the honourable member raises these points in a spirit of frivolity I accept them in the spirit of seriousness. Much has been made of this measure which just one and one of common sense.

It is perhaps a minor point but nevertheless while Papua New Guinea has not yet reached the formal stage of self government it is virtually that now, and perhaps it is time at least in Ministers' speeches if not in the legislation, to refer to the government of Papua New Guinea as just that. The proceeds of the loan will assist in financing a highway project in Papua New together with the consultancy services for both.

I know that the question of aid is a matter There may even be occasions when Australia might best be financed by such an arrangement. A good example could be the massive hydro-electric potential of the Purari River. However, the prime motivating factor is naturally the attitude of the Papua New Guinea Government. But there is an increasing tendency in the sphere of international aid for a number of countries to join together in a consultative group to place their assistance to a particular under-developed country on a well-planned basis. Therefore, it is not impossible to imagine such an arrangement being made with an independent Papua New Guinea. Australia is now withdrawing from Papua New Guinea. Although we will continue to assist, increasingly the brunt of decision making will be with Papua New Guinea's own leaders-and so it should be. It is not our country but theirs. It is not our future but theirs. The present Government in Papua New Guinea has shown how capably it can administer its affairs. There can be no doubt that thc next few years are the most important to the future of Papua New Guinea. It is the time of decision and of actions that set the course of a new society. I believe that, above all countries with which we are associated, Papua New Guinea needs special consideration as it moves through self government, independence and beyond. Our relationship is changing as we discard the former relationship of administering authority and administered country. So far this process has been achieved without bitterness or recriminations from either party. On the contrary, the relations between our 2 countries have been soundly based on goodwill and trust. The fact that independence is coming will not mean an end to our assistance or indeed to our association. The events of history and geography have dictated that our -2 countries must have a close relationship. We are too important to each other for it to be otherwise and not to be to the detriment of in this approach. As it is a multilateral instiboth countries.

This, of course, up to Goroka to open up the inner highland does not necessarily flow from the bilateral region which contains about one-half of the form of aid. Countries normally are interested population of Papua New Guinea. This advice in a particular area and in putting forward and consultation resulted in the building of a their own point of view in that area. So gravel road as far as Goroka. It was opened in 1965. This proposal will update and improve the Goroka highway and the other highway to the Mekeo area, giving access to the Port Moresby market. The resulting economic expansion which should follow from the opening up and improvement of these 2 highways should make a very marked difference to the economy of Papua New Guinea. In September 1972 the Asian Development Bank reviewed the project, examined it and approved the granting of these loans. Papua New Guinea entered the Asian Development Bank in 1971. It was the 36th member. So far no-one has mentioned the importance from the point of view of Papua New Guinea of its being admitted and becoming ah independent member of that organisation. Towards the end of last year a committee appointed by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs examined this question of Australia's overseas aid. Many of the meetings were chaired by the Present Minister for External Territories ( Mr Morrison). One of the recommendations made by this body was that an increasing proportion of Australia's overseas aid should be given in multilateral form and relatively less in bilateral form. This is very apposite to the loan we are discussing. The Asian Development Bank, apart from its importance to Papua New Guinea and apart from' Papua New Guinea's importance to us, has a very direct importance to Australia's interests and participation in the South East Asian area. We are interested in a general way in the success of that institution and its workings which are in our interests in promoting the development of our own area. Particularly in these countries it brings a multilateral treatment to their problems. There are considerable practical advantages there is no question of a particular country following its own bilateral interests. It becomes",75,Papua New Guinea Loan Asian Development Bank Bill 1973

197,Mr Morrison (St George,"Minister for-House to the developments in Papua New Guinea and also to such international institutions as the Asian Development Bank. This is the second loan negotiated by the Papua New Guinea Government. I stress, in response to a query by the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Peacock), that it is on behalf of the Papua New Guinea Government that these loans are negotiated. Of course we had to provide guarantees, and the Australian Government has indicated that it will provide guaranAustralian aid. Nobody could say that Austees for all loans entered into on behalf of Papua New Guinea through to independence. The Asian Development Bank, as honourable members opposite have pointed out, is one of 4 international bodies of which Papua New Guinea has become a member. The other organisations ajre the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, the World Health Organisation and the South Pacific Conference. Papua New Guinea became a member of the Asian Development Bank back in 1971. I think this is important because what the previous Administration did under the honourable member for Kooyong, who was a Minister, and what we are doing now is to provide an international identity for Papua New Guinea. This is not only in advance of independence; it is also in advance of self government. Each decision that we are now making in terms of self-government is being looked at from the point of view of the impact that it will have on Papua New Guinea in terms of independence. By the time we come to self-government, which the previous Government decided would be granted on 1st December 1973 and which we fully supported, and before Papua New Guinea gains independence it will in fact have an international identity. We regard this as a very important manifestation of our policy towards Papua New Guinea. In terms of Asian Development Bank loans, as honourable members opposite are very well aware, there are 2 types of loans. The first is the ordinary funds which are made available on normal commercial conditions and terms. The second, the one that we attach a great deal of importance to, is the special funds. The report of the Committee to which the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Bury) referred paid special attention to the approach that Australia should take in international aid to the special fund provisions of the Asian Development Bank. The legislation we are discussing tonight rein the budget roughly into two areas-recur lates to a loan for the construction of a highrent expenditure and the development program. 1MW/73-R-[50 ] way in Papua New Guinea. As all honourable members will understand, particularly those who have been to Papua New Guinea, it is highly important for the development of the country that access to the very remote areas in Papua New Guinea should be made easily available. The advantage that flows from Papua New Guinea being involved in loans from other organisations, particularly the multilateral organisations, is that it does supplement tralia can provide the totality of the aid that Papua New Guinea will need in the futurs. We considerI think I can speak here on behalf of the Opposition too-.that Papua New Guinea and Australia bave a special relationship. Certainly to my mind this calls for special conditions and a continuance of the special relationship. We would not want to stand in the way-moreover , we would not want to be seen to stand in the way-of Papua New Guinea receiving aid from other countries. We have, as the honourable member for Kooyong mentioned, indicated that Australian aid would be a continuing aid commitment. The Prime Minister( Mr Whitlam) during his recent visit to Papua New Guinea indicated that we will undertake a 3-year program starting in the budget period of 1974-75. We regard this as important because Papua New Guinea will need to have certain conditions that are known to it so that it can structure its own budgeting arrangements. The honpurable member for Kooyong mentioned the concept of project aid. I think it is important that the budgeting processes in Papua New Guinea be revised. It was not very long ago that the Permanent Head ot the Department of Finance in Papua New Guinea -the Treasurer-indicate d that the budgeting arrangements in Papua New Guinea were 50 years out of date. I am glad that he as the officer responsible there said that because it was a thought that struck me over the years in discussions we have had in this House on the Papua New Guinea budget. It is a very unsophisticated and simple budget, but it was tailored to the needs of a colony. As Papua New Guinea approaches self-government and independence it is very necessary that the structuring of the budget-the budgetary practices-in Papua New Guinea be changed. One of the areas of change which the Government has sought to encourage and to which we have had favourable response is the division I think this is important because if Papua New Guinea is to attract aid from other countries, it should have a development budgetin Papua New Guinea it is called, in general terms, an improvement budget-so that foreign countries can attach themselves to projects that are thrown up in the improvement program. This is certainly the form of approach that the Japanese Government has adopted in aid to the less developed countries and it is a form that many other countries will follow. The Government will attach itself to this notion, but because Australia has had a very long association with Papua New Guinea it will not be in strict and inflexible terms. So these changes will take place. We will be looking towards an improvement or development budget and a change in the budgetary systems in Papua New Guinea, and we will be looking towards a definition in the Budget of projects that will open the way for assistance from the developing countries in aid to Papua New Guinea. The particular project that is under discussion in the House at present is the upgrading, realignment and sealing of 75 miles of the Highlands Highway. As the previous speaker has pointed out, this is an area of very dense population and the access which this road will provide for the sending out of goods and products will be invaluable to the meal and subsistence farmers in that area. I should like to apologise to the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Whittorn) who directed a question to someone else the other day. I was told, nine-tenths of the way through the question, that I was the Minister responsible for answering it. In essence the question was why the present Australian Government was forcing Papua New Guinea to borrow its loan funds from overseas and limiting Australia's contribution to a 'miserly' SlOm. The point is that the Government is not forcing Papua New Guinea into world loan markets in preference to assistance from the Australian Government, but I think it is important for all honourable members to realise that there are advantages for Papua New Guinea in seeking loans from overseas to finance part of its expenditure. In the first instance these supplement Australian aid and Papua New Guinea revenue and increase the financial resources available to Papua New Guinea. The second point is that it is important for Papua New Guinea to establish itself on the world loan market. It is important that it establish itself at this time because Australia can still provide the guarantee. If we leave it much longer Papua New Guinea will have difficulties in entering the international loan market if it cannot provide the sort of guarantees that Australia can provide. I think Papua New Guinea will build up its credit worthiness as a borrower through this process. I notice the honourable member for Balaclava has just entered the chamber. I apologise to him for the irrelevance, perhaps, of my answer to him, but I think it is very important that Papua New Guinea now entering into the international loan market and becoming an international identity is to be recognised in the international loan market. We regard this as one of the important objectives in bringing Papua New Guinea to independence smoothly. It has to establish a reputation in the international loan market and the only way it can do this is by borrowing on the international market. Question resolved in the affirmative.

My idea was-and this was also the insertion might run through or that one imprint might run through stating perhaps 'Supplements to South Australian country newspapers', or to the newspapers of whatever State one might be thinking. Once again we were knocked back. I see that I have written a note on the bottom of Mr Hann's letter saying that this request is a most reasonable one and in my view it should be agreed to. The note goes on to say that the present regulations work against efficiency and the alteration requested is most reasonable. I asked whether the then Postmaster-General would have a most careful look at this matter. He did. I have a letter from him saying that he intended to refer the matter to Mr Lane, the Director-Genera! of the Australian Post Office. As late as 16th pany then set about ordering 3,000 cartons of November 1972 I had a letter from Mr Lane A10 apples from New Zealand.

In order that the supplier-in this case the Riverland Fruit Products Co-operative Ltd-ca n get sales it must retain shelf space on a wide variety of lines.

To do this, I will bring to the attention of honourable members one specific case which is typical of many complaints that 1 and State Australian Labor Party members in Macarthur are receiving. On 1st September 1972, a constituent from Shellharbour purchased a Datsun 1200 utility for $2,087, phis registration and insurance. Although the vehicle was sold to him as new on a 6 months or 6,000-mile warranty, it was later learned that the vehicle was a 1971 model. There was no obvious evidence of rusi in the vehicle at that time, but after 3 weeks when the utility was put in for servicing ii was discovered that there was rust in the panels vehicle and stated that it considered that the of the car. Soon after, the paint work began to fade on some panels and the car, instead ot being a uniform blue, started to resemble a patchwork of fading panels which could not be restored by rubbing back as it subsequently was learned that the undercoat used was of a isolated case and there is a general requiregloss base on some panels. The owner paid $100 in service costs during eventually will involve governmental action, the 6 months warranty period to preserve the and the sooner the better, in my opinion. The guarantee. He started to suspect that he had Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) been sold a demonstrator model which had referred last week to the Government's plans been involved in an accident or a second hand with respect to road safety. It is about time vehicle which had been involved in an accident. that Australia paid much more attention to Neither of these suspicions could be proved. safety problems caused by vehicle defects. I However, his suspicions could well have been refer honourable members to an article in the true because from then on the vehicle began ""National Times' of 5th March 1973, in steadily to deteriorate although, other than a which many of these consumer problems are tail shaft wobble that prevented the vehicle being driven above 40 miles an hour, its mechanical condition was not too bad. But tbe vehicle had become a first grade 'lemon' in the United States vernacular. From this time on this poor owner engaged in argument between himself and the company from which he bought the car and, eventually, the New South Wales agent, Capitol Motors Ltd. He wrote to the Nissan company in Japan and to the Consumer Affairs Bureau. He went through every process possibly available to him. The list of jobs that eventually the company agreed to do included the following: The bonnet had to be resprayed, the upper outer corners of the windscreen sealing rubber had to be resealed-to no avail, eventually-the corners were sticking out from the bodywork and there were buff marks on the right hand side of the turret. The list goes on for pages and pages. decided, the National Roads and Motorists Association decided after a subsequent inspection and Capitol Motors decided after another inspection that there was still a large amount of work to be done on the car. The front bonnet had to be resprayed again-the rust was showing-the tailgate had to be resprayed, the undercarriage had to be treated with rust prevention material and repainted, windscreen rubbers had to be replaced, the car leaked, there was a whining noise in the differential, there was vibration in the vehicle and it had an erratic fuel gauge. Again, the list goes on. The Japanese company, NissanDatsun, expressed great and prompt concern for this man and his troubles with his New South Wales State distributor, Capitol Motors, should work to overcome his problems. As I stated at the outset, this is not an ment for overall remedial action from both consumer and safety points of view. These",82,Adjournment
203,Mr Kerin (Macarthur) (10.50),"I wish tooutlined. The3 major United States car manufacturers in Australia and the United Kingdom firm British Leylond enjoyed different conditions from those pertaining to their parent companies. But now Leyland has set out to emulate the buyer protection scheme introduced by American motors which resulted in their lifting sales by 20 per cent. It is to be hoped that the same reward will accrue to Leyland in Australia in its pace setting endeavour. The article states: The Australian consumer should know about American conditions in order to judge whether things need to be changed in Australia. In Australia motor vehicle safety is on an advisory called Finlayson who apparently arrived in State level and is dependent upon the voluntary cooperation of the auto industry. In the US the Federal Government controls motor vehicle safety standards and compliance by the auto industry, local and foreign, is mandatory. Federal control has: (a) made cars safer for Americans; (b) not cut back private enterprise; (c) has not interfered with commercial competition. The assistance and protection afforded the prospecmittee which was formed that night or to any tive car buyer and the car owner Jn the US are detailed in the 1972 Annual Report from the US Department of Transportation which also: Publishes comparative performance data sheets on all vehicles, both local and imported.

Requires all manufacturers and dealers, local and foreign, to provide information performance sheets, including clear statements regarding the manufacturer's compliance with the US Federal Department's mandatory Federal Motor Vehicle Safety, Standards. Requires all manufacturers and dealers to make this information available to all inquirers whether buyers or not, precisely for comparative shopping.

It is quite obvious that his complaints have not had a fair hearing at governmental or company level. The Australian Government must give similar protection to the Australian consumer by asking all United States car companies operating through subsidiaries in Australia, and all other subsidiaries which import vehicles, to meet the same safety and pollution control standards as well as notification of defects and recall programs as is the case in the United States of America. (10.58)I rise tonight to correct an impression which was caused by the program This Day Tonight'. The program dealt with a meeting which took place in Katherine on 7th March. The program was produced by a man Katherine, in the Northern Territory, with a preconceived idea and plan of how to present this meeting to the people of Australia. I think that he definitely set out to misrepresent the tenor of the meeting, what it was ali about and what caused it. He certainly did not refer to any of the members of the comof the items which that committee put in its terms of reference. Apparently he arrived in Katherine and decided that the town was a racist part of Australia and he set out to produce his show to back up those ideas. He parked in the main street of Katherine, leaned over the door of his utility and said that Katherine has never been known for its good humanitarian relations between races. That was a bad enough start in anybody's language. the program 'This Day Tonight'. This was the way in which he started and he continued throughout the whole program to put this point of view.

(2) If not, what action is planned. member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The promotion of tourist resorts and attractions within Australia is currently the responsibility of the respective State Governments. Internationa] promotion of Australian tourist attractions is carried ont by the Commonwealth Government through the Australian Tourist Commission. Phillip Island is included in the Commission's marketing activities overseas through its films, publications and advertising campaigns. Emphasis is placed on the uniqueness of the fairy penguins which frequent the Island. Fof example, details of Phillip Island are included in the Australian Travel and Accommodation Guide and in a recent Commission film 'Australia, Big Country, Big Welcome'. Department Employees (Question No 73) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: (1) What (a) number, and (b) percentage of persons employed by bis Department are migrants. (2) Has he issued any instructions to his Department concerning the employment of migrants within his Department. able member's question is as follows: (1) (a) 436. <b) 20.75 per cent. (2) No. Immigration: Employment Opportunities and Priorities (Question No. 84) Mr Lynch asked the Minister for Immigration, upon noiice: (1) Is there a shortage of (a) skilled (b) semiskilled and (c) unskilled workers in any categories. (2) If so, has he directed that shortages in any category be met by overseas recruitment. (3) If a direction has been given, what is the level of recruitment in each category. able member's question is as follows: (1) This is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Labour but it is obvious from recent announcements that employment opportunities are increasing. (2) and (3) As I have announced, the future emphasis of immigration programmes will be on the re-union of immediate family members and sponsorship will also be given priority. National need will also be an important consideration and where recruitment has been temporarily suspended in certain categories the situation is being regularly reviewed. There is close and continuing consultation with the Department of Labour on the numbers and categories of workers that may be accepted at any particular time. Base Pension Rate (Question No. 192) Mr Street asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: What is the estimated cost of raising the base pension rate to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings and when is it expected that this proportion will be reached. member's question is as follows: of Immigration: Migrant Based on average weekly earnings per male unit for the December Quarter 1972 of $104, it would be necessary to increase the base rate of pension by $4.50 to $26 a week in order to raise that rate to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. If all existing age, invalid, widow and service pensioners were to receive an increase of $4.50 a week, it is estimated that the additional annual cost would be about $290m. Average weekly earnings for the December quarter, being inflated by overtime pay and Christmas bonuses, are always much higher than for the immediately preceding and succeeding quarters. A cost estimate based on average weekly earnings for the December quarter is thus somewhat inflated also. No firm date has been fixed by the Government for bringing the pension rate up to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Its announced policy is to raise the base pension to that level by increases of $1.50 a week each Spring and Autumn. The Government will respond appropriately if these increases do not achieve the desired result within a reasonable time. Wage Awards: Basis of Increases (Qoestion No. 380) Mr Garland asked the Minister for Labour, upon notice: (1) Did he state that he will support wholeheartedly the principle that future wage awards should be made on the basis of a flat rate rather than percentage increase. (2) Can he say whether other nations' governments have attempted to restrict wage adjustments to flat, all round rises; if so, with what result in each case. (3) What representations has he received from the craft unions on this matter.",84,Adjournment
