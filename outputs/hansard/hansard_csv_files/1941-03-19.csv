Assistant Minister for Commerce make a statement to the House, either tb-day or when it next meets, following his investigation of the difficulties confronting the wine industry in South Australia ? fairly thorough survey of the wine industry in South Australia. Having visited most of the wine-growing districts in that State, I am able to say that arrangements have been made to process the whole of the grape crop for the present season at least. No decision has yet been arrived at in regard to next season's crop. That is a matter which will he determined after a conference of all of tbo interests concerned. inform the House of the reasons for the delay in sending out income tax assessments for the year 1939 -40? Is he aware that money is being deducted from the earnings of many men employed in mines and elsewhere who had no taxable income in that year? instructions to the Taxation Department that, in respect of employees who are known to have had no taxable income last year, discretion may be exercised, witb a view to avoiding hardship? which has engaged the attention of the Taxation Department ever since the instalment plan for the payment of taxe3 was introduced. The department has been instructed-and the instructions have been carried out faithfully-to expedite the issuing of assessments, in order that the minimum amount only shall be deducted by way of instalments in respect of taxable income for the year ended the 30th June, 1940. That procedure will be followed. However, in the light of the honourable member's statement, I shall have further inquiries made. for Commerce been informed of this restrictions imposed by the Government of Western Australia resulting in a deadlock in the distribution of drought relief funds to fanners other than clients of the State Agricultural Bank?

17,Mr Ward,"Has the Minister forSolicitor in Sydney over the week-end, any further statement to make regarding the army boot scandal, and may we expect that some arrests will be made? had a discussion with Sydney representatives of the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, and the Inspector's Branch, the Chief of the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, and certain detectives who are making investigations. I went over all the facts, as well as the legal aspects of the case. I have no statement to make at this stage, boyond saying that the honourable member may rest assured that, at the appropriate time, a prosecution will be launched. Later: honourable member for Werriwa( Mr accuracy, the Government's policy will be Lazzarini) asked if the Acting Prime Minister was aware that Fostars Proprietary Limited and McEvoys Limited, were identical with Joe Gardiner Limited, and that Joe Gardiner Limited was, in fact, George Cull and Son Proprietary Limited and requested that an inquiry be made into the matter, in fairness I must state that during the week-end I received a telegram from, and was visited by, a representative of a Joe Gardiner Limited, who invited the fullest investigation of the honourable member's allegations. The firm declared that the honourable member's statement was entirely without foundation. Investigations take time, but if the honourable member still pursues his request in the face of the emphatic denials that have been made to me, I shall have investigations made. AND MEMBERS. that many honourable members are desirous of discussing matters arising out able the services of Mr Justice Maxwell of the ministerial statements delivered at secret meetings last week, particularly matters affecting home defence, some of which are urgent, will, the Acting Prime Minister state whether a day will be set aside next week for another secret meeting of members of Parliament? receive the consideration of the Government. Prime Minister say whether there is any truth in the inspired paragraphs which have appeared in a section of the daily press, that the Government does not intend to resume the secret meetings of both Houses of Parliament, so that honourable members may question Ministers on their statements dealing with the war situation, which were made at the two secret meetings already held? If the paragraphs be neither true nor inspired, will he take action under regulations issued under the National Security Act against such newspapers? newspaper statements to which the honourable member referred. As to their made known to the House as and when required. ter for the Army state whether it is a fact, as has been reported in the press, that it is the intention of the Government to set up a royal commission to inquire into federal aspects of the Abbco bread contract case? If so, will the House be given an opportunity to discuss the terms of reference and the personnel of the commission? leave to make a statement on this subject when the honourable member forestalled me by his question. It is true, as reported, that the Government has decided to appoint a royal commission to inquire into what is now known as the Abbco bread contract case. During the week-end, I communicated with the Attorney-General in. New South Wales and asked him if he would make availas a Commonwealth royal commissioner when the present State inquiry has concluded. The Attorney-General approached the Chief Justice of New South Wales, who indicated that the services of Mr Justice Maxwell could be made available for the purpose desired.

The Government proposes to invite the Leader of the Opposition to assist it in drafting the terms of reference to the commission. of the Minister for the Army been drawn to the fact that for the first time in the history of royal commissions in New South ""Wales the person making charges against the Abbco Bread Company Proprietary Limited, namely, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, has not been given representation on the commission making the inquiry? In view of the fact that there appears to be no counsel with the determination to delve into the heart of the matter, will the Minister consider the propriety of deferring the appointment of Mr Justice Maxwell as a Commonwealth royal commissioner until after the State commission has completed its inquiries? As Mr Justice Maxwell will not have before him the fullest details in regard to one section of the charge, he might come to a decision that would militate against his giving a contrary decision at the next inquiry. of the accuracy of the honourable member's first statement.

""What the American people did last week is certain to he a decisive happening in this war; indeed, I believe it. will prove a vital event in the history of humanity. But even the help which President Roosevelt has vouchsafed does not mean victory now. ""We would delude ourselves, if we did not recognize that we have still the roughest part of the road to tread. Por every Australian the words of the American President will be a challenge to us to "" march breast forward never doubting clouds would break"". Great Britain has shown that it can not only stand up to what is coming to it but can also strike back smashing blows in reply. The United States of America now prepares for a long night of slogging work before the new dawn. I am confident that I express the spirit of Austo go on unfalteringly and unitedly in tralia when I say that "" Australia will be up with the leaders at every stage of the race "". We did not hesitate to enter this war; we shall not hold back now, and at the finish ""Australia will be there."" Two vital points come to my mind as I recall the challenging speech of President Roosevelt. He called for speed and more speed. "" The urgency,"" he declared, "" is now "". Surely that is the note that ought to sound from every anvil in every workshop in Australia. urgency applied to Australia's war programme must be tlie overriding consideration of every office, factory and farm, and predominantly of Parliament itself. The more we give of our best, and the quicker we give it, the sooner we shall win. If we give half-heartedly now and promise that we shall speed up six months or twelve months hence we may find that we are too late. Then President Roosevelt spoke of the unity which is ours. His country, Great Britain, Australia and Canada and the other dominions and Greece have not been brought together by propaganda or browbeating, but by tlie common conviction that the time has come when we all must, for the time being, willingly sacrifice our to implement, that law-to make the dry privileges in order to make the future worth living. It is a unity of the heart which does not depend on formal treaties or axis pacts. The United States of America has accepted the Lease or Lend Bill because its President and people know deep down in their hearts that there are evil forces abroad which must be destroyed in the dread reality of a total war, or the things we value most will themselves be destroyed. There can be no compromise and no appeasement of these forces, but only a firm "" No"" backed by all the ships, the planes, the guns and ammunition, the total resources which each and every one of the democracies can and must supply. The world has heard that firm word "" No "" from the lips of this great American, this great Democrat. It is a word backed by the voluntary offering of the total resources of this country. In the name of the people of Australia, I place on record our deep and abiding gratitude for this timely help. In your name I pledge Australia the valiant company of the American people. the Opposition) -by leave I associate my party with the expressions of apprecation which have fallen from the lips of the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Fadden) of the speech which President Roosevelt has delivered, and more particularly of the achievements which made that speech not only possible, but also a statement of things happening and to Speed and happen. The measure which passed the American Congress is properly known as the Aid to Democracies Act. Its short title may well be "" The Lease-orLendA c t "" ; but the proper title is, I think, the more accurate description, of what the United States of America has undertaken to do. It has undertaken to aid democracy with all the material resources which that extraordinary country possesses-resource s which in themselves would not be nearly so useful, but for the extraordinary efficiency of American industry and the millions of American citizens who will handle the raw materials and productive plant. Behind this new law, and this speech which indicates how the Government is bones live in rich achievement-is the spirit which unites lovers of freedom and liberty the world over. It is not inappropriate at this moment to consider, however",16,President Roosevelt S Speech
49,Mr Curtin (Fremantle,"Leade r ofbriefly, even though it involves some restatement, why this speech has been delivered and this law to aid democracy has been passed by the great American Republic. The United States of America is not a belligerent, because it has not been attacked. Being a democracy, it will not attack unless it is itself attacked. That truth concerning the United States of America lies at the very core of the issue which we, with the other people in the British Commonwealth of Nations, have had to face. We have not sought to attack another country. We are a democracy and we believe not only in the freedom of a country to govern itself, but also in the basic and fundamental principle of democracy that the citizens of a country have personal rights. We believe, too, that minorities have rights which shoiild not be suppressed and obliterated merely by brute strength. We are fighting to defend and advance the liberties of men and women as men and women. We draw the line at that point where a State seeks to coerce its citizens and force them into a certain course of conduct. Our outlook on this matter, like that of the American people, is formulated in our Constitution. Our Parliament meets under the terms of a written Constitution. thing may be considered by some to hamstring a government in carrying out its own wishes. the American and the Australian Constitutions selves, the machinery for their own amendment. within the power of the people who are governed to say how they shall be governed. The point is that they may be governed in a certain way with, their own consent. declaration by President Roosevelt, of the decisions made by the American Congress cannot be other than welcome in this country, not alone because of tb' material assistance it will bo to us in this greatest of all struggles, but also because of the very principles upon which those decisions rest, such decisions having been made in conformity with our own belief* and our own outlook. I hope that this manifestation of goodwill which has been made towards the democracies will reinforce all over the world confidence Mr Curtin. in the genius of democracy, and the determination of democrats, to make democracy an instrument of government which will not only provide political equality but will also give to every citizen the right to a share in the control of his own country. Such a government will assure each citizen that his own individual needs, with those of his fellows, will be served by an economic and social democracy in which the riches of the earth will be so distributed as to express the equality of man with man. Prime Minister inform me whether the Government has given consideration to the use of the bauxite deposits at Tambourine Mountain, near Brisbane, for the manufacture of aluminium?

Prime Minister) [8.4S] I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next at 3 ji.m. To-morrow morning a squadron of warships of the United States of America will reach Sydney in the course of a training cruise. I suggest that the -House should adjourn late this afternoon until Tuesday, so that Ministers and members of the Parliament, may have an opportunity personally to welcome to Australia Newton and the other officers and ratings of the squadron. The visit to Australian waters of these American warships is, in itself, an event of the greatest interest, and significance is added to this interest when we reflect that the visitors come from a country which, even in these difficult, days, has shown unmistakably that it is a most: friendly neighbour. When the squadron's call at Sydney was first proposed the Government hastened TO let the Government of the United States of America know that such a visit would he greatly appreciated by the Australian people. 1 know that this action will wholeheartedly be supported by members of this House. It is intended that on Thursday and Friday of this week a series of official functions shall be held at which the Commonwealth Government, the State governments, and the civic authorities will bo able to greet the officers and ratings of the squadron, and express to them our cordial goodwill, and warm appreciation of tlie strength and power which the United States of America is giving to the democracies of the world. The adjournment of this House for the period I have proposed may rightly be interpreted as a tribute we are proud to pay to our American visitors and to the nation in whose service they are enlisted. For the information of honourable members, I give the following brief details of the arrangements made for official functions in Sydney on Thursday:7 a.m --The Show Boat w ill leave Circular Quay so that honourable members and their wives may have aji opportunity to sec the squadron arrive in Sydney Harbour. 8.30 a.m -The squadron will berth at Woolloomooloo. Later in the morning, official calls will be made. squadron will march through the streets of Sydney. His Excellency the Governor General will take the salute in front of the Town Hall. 12.45. p.m A luncheon w ill be tendered to personnel of the squadron, at which I shall extend a welcome on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. 7.15 p.m -The Commonwealth Government will entertain officers of the squadron at dinner, and speeches wil l be made by myself, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), and the Premier of New South Wales( MrM a i r ) .

Bill brought up, and read a first time. for the Army) [4.8] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is designed to make more stringent the existing provisions of the Defence Act relating to fraud in connection with the supply of food, material and equipment to the Defence Force. At present section 73c of the act makes guilty of an offence any contractor, purveyor or other person, including any employee, who fraudulently supplies for use by the Defence Force certain inferior goods. At least my legal friends opposite will appreciate that it is one thing to been delivered, considerable prove that a contractor has supplied goods of an inferior quality and quite another thing to prove that he fraudulently did so. The presence of a fraudulent intent heavy payments for interest? may be obvious, but it is one thing for the fraudulent intent to be obvious and another thing to prove it before a court. The purpose of clause 3is to remove the word "" fraudulently"", but at the same time to make it a good defence if the contractor is able to show that there was no intent to defraud and that he was not aware of the inferior quality. In other words, instead of the Commonwealth having to prove fraud, the amendment throws on the person charged the onus of showing an absence of fraud. The same section of the act also makes itan offence for an officer of the Commonwealth fraudulently to receive any such, goods. Consequently the clause goes on to omit the word "" fraudulently "" in this 0 case also, aud to cast on the officer the onus of proving that there was no intent to defraud on his part and that he did not know that the goods were supplied in contravention of the section. As honourable members are perhaps aware, when the Commonwealth enters into a contract for the supply of certain goods for the defence force it usually arranges for the inspection of the goods and places on them certain seals or marks to indicate that they are up to standard. Only goods so marked will then be accepted in fulfilment of the contract. I honourable members a case in which good3 bearing a forged mark are alleged",21,National Credit

84,Mr Spender (Warringah,"Ministe rto have been delivered. The most effective way that I can imagine of obviating any similar act of so reprehensible a nature is to make it an offence for any such contractor to have in his possession goods fraudulently marked. I believe that if the Commonwealth can nip this sort of thing in the bud, as it were, by catching the offender while the goods are still in his possession, rather than wait until the goods are delivered, this practice will quickly be stam,ped out. That is the purpose of the new section 73n which, clause 4, proposes to insert. To persons of a certain type, who are able to make a substantial profit by their fraud, the imposition of a penalty, however large, may not always be a sufficient deterrent. cannot be imprisoned. section 73E proposed to be inserted by clause 4 is designed to bring these provisions of the Defence Act in line with Section 29B of the Crimes Act makes it the provisions of the National Security Act, and to make every director and officer concerned in the management of a company guilty of the offence of which the company is guilty unless he can show that the offence took place without his knowledge, or that he had no means of preventing it. The proposed section 73r is designed to bring into line with the provisions of the National Security Act the penalties which may be imposed in respect of serious frauds of the nature to which I have referred. The proposed section 73G is designed to prevent a company from sheltering behind the lack of guilty intent, or authority to act, on the part of its servants. The provisions of the bill will, by virtue of clause 2, be made retrospective to the date on which the war commenced. The measure is undoubtedly drastic, but I make no apology whatsoever for introducing it. I find it difficult to conceive of any crime of a more reprehensible character than those with which this bill deals. This country is at war, and to defraud the Commonwealth during the period of war is itself a most reprehensible act; but when that fraud takes the form of supplying to the Commonwealth equipment for the use of its forces of such an inferior quality .that the safety, and perhaps the lives, of its forces may be at stake, the natural hesitation to make retrospective any measure appertaining to the criminal law must then disappear.

The Department of Information appears to be one for the employment of journalists associated with the Murdoch press which not only issues comic strips but also indulges in subversive propaganda at elections to secure the return of the United Australia party. For this purpose the Murdoch press also uses the radio stations which it is operating to-day in defiance of the regulations of the Postmaster-General's department. It operates a larger number of "" B "" class stations in each State than is permitted by the regulations. The Murdoch jiress is more than a law unto itself; it is the dictator of the present Government's policy. The Government does what the Murdoch press directs. Mr Williams, on the date of his appointment as Director General of Information, was general manager of the Courier-Mail, Brisbane, and previously he was assistant editor of the Melbourne Herald.

Many Australians remember him as the gentleman who published in his newspapers six or seven years ago the text of stolen cablegrams that passed between Ministers of the Crown and were used by his press to influence the people's verdict at an election so as to secure the defeat of the Scullin Ministry statements, I am inspired by a deep sense of duty, because I think that the real interests of Australia will be better served when the present Government depends in the real sense on itself and less on newspaper magnates, the Chamber of Manufactures, the Chamber of Commerce tlie other bodies whose entire interest in the war effort is in direct ratio to the profits they are making out of it. I do not expect the Government to take any notice of what I am saying on this subject, for it would not dare to clear that, in my opinion, Public Enemy No. 1 of the liberties of the Australian people is the Murdoch press. I trust that no further appointments of representatives of, or persons associated with, the Murdoch press will be made to the Department of Information or to the Censorship staffs. Some time ago I made certain complaints to the Minister for the Army( Mr Spender) concerning the State of affairs at the Holdsworthy detention camp. In compliance with my request, the Minister said that he would make arrangements for me to visit the camp in order to make the closest inquiries.

This is surely a shocking state of affairs. Recently a young man named Lees, who asked the camp authorities to telephone a certain hospital in. order to mother who, he said, was seriously ill there. A call was put through. Honourable members are, no doubt, Avell aware that to nine out of ten of such inquiries the hospital authorities say, in one form or another, that the condition of the patient is satisfactory. That was the reply given to the inquiry made for this young man. He was subsequently found guilty of having made a false statement when he said that his mother was dangerously ill, and was sentenced to solitary confinement on bread and water. mother was, in fact, so seriously ill that she had to have a leg amputated before she could leave the hospital. Such an operation is not a trivial illness. Why should a boy be sentenced to three days' solitary confinement in such circumstances? I assure the Minister that if he is willing to have an inquiry held into the charges that I am making ample evidence will be forthcoming to substantiate my case. On the 2nd March two men escaped from the camp. They were recaptured. While one of -the men had both arms pinioned at his sides he was struck a smashing blow by an officer of the camp. The two men were put in separate cells and a sergeant was detailed to give eaeh a lashing there. ber speaking about Germany or Australia? occurred at the Holdsworthy detention camp. Relatives who wish to visit inmates of the camp are obliged to obtain permission to do so from Captain Lees. Recently the wife of one of the men applied for permission to visit her husband. She resided at Deewhy, which is in the Minister's own electorate. The time fixed for her visit was 9.30 a.m., The overflow of water from which, I think the Minister w ill admit, is a f a i r l y early hour to fix for any person who would have to travel from Deewhy The to Holdsworthy. The wife had taken two children w it h her because there was no one with whom she could leave them. She arrived at the camp at 9.32 a.m., two minutes after the appointed time. was detained in the camp, Although the time specified for visits of this nature is twenty minutes, she was refused permission to see her husband. It ascertain the condition of his seems that the general public is not aware of the existence of such conditions in this country. Another woman left her home at Springwood in order to visit her husband, who was under detention at the Holdsworthy camp. She arrived four minutes late, and was not allowed to see her husband. The fact that guards at the camp are continually asking to be transferred for duty elsewhere, because they object to the brutality of the treatment meted out to men who are detained there for trivial offences, proves that there is The boy's dissatisfaction even amongst the guards. During the last twelve months between 50 and 60 guards have been transferred fro m the camp at their own request. I do not blame them. Many of them are just as disgusted with the state of affairs existing there as are honourable members. The Minister may have been misinformed in regard to conditions at the camp. It may have been reported to him that all is well and that either the complaints were baseless or matters had been rectified. I ask the honourable gentleman to institute a proper inquiry and to give his personal guarantee that, if men who have been transferred from tlie camp give evidence before the inquiry, they w ill not be victimized. I . have been assured by a number of these men that, if such an undertaking be given, they w i ll be pleased to supply the Minister with any information he may desire.

The men have been detained on account of trivial offences, and they are entitled to receive better treatment than is being accorded to them. I urge the Minister to conduct an early inquiry. protest against the ""mark-time"" tactics of the 'Government, which apparently is merely sparring for time until the Prime Mini°ter ( Mr Menzies) returns from abroad. Some honourable members have travelled thousands of miles in order to attend these sittings of Parliament, but have been given nothing to do but twirl their thumbs. We have been in Canberra for nearly a fortnight, and little or nothing of value to the country has been accomplished. This is a time of crisis. strain every nerve and do our utmost to advance the nation's war effort. Nevertheless, the House has adjourned day after day without having anything to show for its deliberations. I object to these laiissez-faire methods. We should get on with the job for which we were elected; or stand aside and allow other people to do it. This backing and Government can do nothing more than bring our so-called democratic institutions into contempt, and discredit this Parliament in the eyes of the nation. There are many problems that the Parliament should consider, including adequate wages, child endowment, widows' pensions, malnutrition, and monetary reform. Malnutrition does exist amongst our people; that was learned by the inquiries into the subject a few years ago. It is an important problem because the proper physical development of our people ensures a strong first line of defence for Australia. In spite of all this, we seem to be dawdling along while the Government spars for time and awaits the return of its leader. I protest very strongly against this policy. [4.55] I wish to discuss a matter relating to a large employing industry about which the Minister for the Army( Mr Spender) should have some knowledge. If he is not in possession of all the matter was referred to in the Sydney facts, I ask him to pass on my representations to the proper quarters. Recently clothing manufacturers had their businesses thrown out of gear by a request; to manufacture khaki drill to be sent to India. The employees in the industry were also affected. In normal times our weaving machinery would now be engaged in the manufacture of cloth for winter overcoating, but it is fully occupied in the manufacture of khaki drill, which will be manufactured in India into uniforms for units of the British armed forces. The manufacturers do not object to doing this important work, but they ask that the arrangement be extended so that the khaki drill may be made up into uniforms in this country, thus obviating the displacement of labour caused by the We are told that we must transfer from peace-time operations to this special war-time job. I ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to this request. gret that certain important functions to be held in .Sydney make it expedient for Parliament to adjourn to-day. In view of the Government's wish that this sitting be terminated quickly, I shall filling on the part of the speak briefly now and amplify my remarks at the next sitting. I speak now because the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner), who, as chairman of the Commonwealth Man-power and Resources Survey Committee, is vitally concerned with my representations, is in the chamber. I remind honourable members that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said some months ago at a gathering at royal commission that made the Hotel Australia in Sydney that wastage of man-power was a definite present -to Hitler. This afternoon I asked the Acting Primp Minister (M.r. Fadden) if he was awave that the New South Wales Government was not co-operating fully with tbi Commonwealth Man-power and Resources Survey Committee. The Premier of that State objected to his departmental, officers giving evidence before the committee on important matters about which the committee required information. He contended that anything required by the committee from his officers should go through him in the form of a written statement. I have evidence of that. The",29,Committee Activitie S

126,Mr Morgan (Reid) [4.58],"I reMorning Herald more than a week ago, and a member of the Manpower and Resources Survey Committee, the honourable member for Dalley( Mr is able to give useful evidence. I shall Rosevear), has pointed out that the New South. Wales Premier's action seriously handicapped the committee, which is anxious to get on with its work. The committee's inquiries are of great concern to New South Wales, because in that State alone, there are 40,000 unemployed who are anxious to help in the Commonwealth's war effort. In the electorate which I represent there are between 2,000 and 3,000 unemployed. The matter was again brought up in the State Parliament last week, and in answer to a question by Mr Matthews, the Premier( Mr Mair) reiterated that so far as the New South Wales Government is concerned evidence can only be submitted to the committee through him in the form of a written statement. On another occasion I shall deal with the reasons why Mr Mair has taken that stand. I also understand that the chairman of the committee promised the only deputation which has yet waited on the committee that it will make interim reports. The Acting Prime Minister said to-day, however, that the committee would report direct to the Government. I urge the chairman of the committee to bring forward interim reports so that honourable members may be informed as early as possible of the facilities being provided for the unemployed to be engaged or trained to take their place in our war industries. I can hardly imagine that the Acting Prime Minister is ignorant of the facts I have given. The war has been in progress eighteen months, and surely in that period the Government has taken some interest irt the matter of absorbing the unemployed in our war industries. In addition, Mr Mair's attitude has been indicated in press reports published a week ago, and has also been commented upon in the State Parliament. It seems extraordinary, therefore, that the addressed a letter on the same matter to Acting Prime Minister is unaware that Mr Mair is not co-operating with the committee. self crying out for co-operation from all other sections of the community, he is, apparently, frustrating the efforts of that committee. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to empower the committee to call any person who it thinks deal with this matter more fully next week. wish to make a few observations with respect, to the remarks of the honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan). Every member of the Man-power and Resources Survey Committee has worked very hard, and the Committee has gathered a great deal of information. However, it cannot be expected so early in its investigation to be in a position to tender an interim report at this stage. So soon as it is able to do so, it will forward its report to the Government, and the Government will decide what shall be done with it. Honourable members will appreciate that during the last week it was not possible for the committee to resume its inquiry. The committee will proceed to Melbourne to-night, and during the next few days will continue its investigations in that city. It is determined to make a thorough investigation, and to deliver its report to the Government as soon as possible. Honourable members will appreciate that the subject of the inquiry covers a large field, and cannot be dealt with lightly. However, the committee will not delay in any way its investigation. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Eaclden) was correct in saying that he was not at this stage aware that any difficulty of the kind mentioned by the honourable member for Reid .had arisen in New South Wales. At all events he is not officially aware of such a difficulty. Information which I gave to the Acting Prime Minister on that subject was given in such a way that he would not regard it as an intimation that the committee was experiencing any difficulty. I have had further correspondence on the subject with Mr Mair. The Acting Prime Minister has also Mr Mair in the hope that he will permit the committee to interview While Mr Mair is himdirectly officers of government departments in New South Wales. All members of the committee will agree with me when I say that the committee cannot properly",30,Committee Activitie S

So far, we have received the utmost co-operation from all public bodies and all men whom we have approached for information. The position which has arisen in New South Wales is probably no more than an. unfortunate misunderstanding. Should we be unable to obtain the information we desire in the way we consider necessary we shall then officially advise the Acting Prime Minister to that effect, and I have no doubt that he will take appropriate action. for the Army) [5.5] -in reply-The remarks of honourable members, particularly member for (Melbourne Port( Mr stance in truth as his statement relating Holloway), will be brought under the notice of appropriate Ministers.

I do not doubt, however, that, whatever the facts may be, the picture painted by the honourable member will be found to be, like the false report of Mark Twain's death, slightly exaggerated. honourable member. the honourable member. I have found on previous occasions that a substance of truth is often used to paint a picture for purposes other than ventilating a grievance. member for East Sydney first made allegations of this description in this House. It is perfectly obvious that he has known for some time what he alleges to be facts. I asked him to tell me the date on which ho visited the Holdsworthy Detention Camp, and he refused to answer. If , in matters of this kind which touch so urgently the administration of our forces, any honourable member believes that he has facts which require investigation, it is his duty to bring them to the as he knows of them. However, the real interest of the honourable member for East Sydney, in this matter is revealed by the fact that he has left the chamber rather than wait to hear my reply. I shall, not prejudge the facts. I shall have an investigation made by an independent person, and when the report comes to hand I shall act accordingly. With respect to the statement made by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), I merely observe that his statement that Sir Keith Murdoch has any influence over this Government is unfounded. those of the honourable member's statement has as much subto the expenditure of the Department of formation on which the honourable member based what he terms "" deductive logic"" may be judged from his statement that the expenditure of the Department of Information this year will amount to £900,000, whereas in cold truth it will amount to £193,000.

160,Mr Calwell Asked The Minister Repre,"awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and/or all determinations of State wages, boards and State arbitration courts governing -wages and conditions of employment? of tender and contract for supplies of Commonwealth manufacture or production to govern contracts arranged by the Contract Board, Department of Supply and Development, require compliance by the contractor with the requirements of Commonwealth and/or State laws in :respect of the rates of wages and/or conditions of labour of persons employed in connection with the contract. In the event of any question arising as to the contractor's failure to comply with such requirements, the contractor may be required to make a statutory declaration that he has fulfilled the conditions of contract in this respect. Penalties may be enforced if the provisions of the wages and labour conditions are not fully performed by the contractor. In view of the foregoing I am of opinion that amendment of the conditions of contract at present in use in the direction .indicated is not necessary, but if the honourable member will furnish particulars of instances in which contractors are not observing Commonwealth or State laws in respect of wages and labour conditions, I will give further consideration to the adoption of the suggestion. Commerce, upon noticeWhat are the conditions imposed by New South Wales,-Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia on farmers for repayment of advances made to them out of tlie Commonwealth Loan (Drought Relief) Kuiid of £2,800,000 available to the States for ing difficulty in obtaining supplies of the alleviation of hardship suffered by primary dried fruits, particularly prunes, for the producers through drought? are responsible for the repayment to the Commonwealth of the loan funds made available to them under the Loan (Drought Relief) Act 1940. Therefore, they determine the conditions of the repayment by farmers of the advances made to them for drought relief. The States will be asked to supply the information desired. R. W. G. MACKAY . Minister, upon notice1. in view of the general importance of the matter, will the Acting Prime Minister himself investigate and report to the House whether in his opinion the action of Mr Rorke, Censor, in censoring a national broadcast address prepared by Mr R. W. G. Mackay (of the British Labour party) was justified? 2. Will he also take into consideration other examples of Mr Rorke's exercise of his great power as Censor, with a view to determining (a) whether that gentleman is fairly distinguishing between the legitimate exclusion of matter which is prejudicial to the war effort and the improper repression of comment upon matters of political and public policy, and [b) whether suitable action should not be taken to remedy the position? honourable member's questions are as follows:.1. The subject of the first question asked, by the honourable member has already been discussed by me with my colleague, the Minister for Information, who is in charge of censorship. I find that the proposed talks by Mr Mackay as censored by Mr Rorke were submitted to the Minister for Information. The Minister approved of the action of the State Publicity Censor. The State Publicity Censor a'-led within the powers vested in him and with due regard to Censorship Regulations and national security. 2. Tf the honourable member will submit, examples of the exercise of censorship jmwer with which the honourable member is not in agreement, I shall be pleased to discuss them with the Minister in charge of the department. honourable member for Calare( Mr. Breen) asked, without notice, whether steps would be taken to find out whether Army contractors were havArmy, and if difficulty was not being experienced, would a recommendation be made that the regulations prohibiting the export of dried f r u i ts be repealed. The Ministerf o r Supply and Development has furnished the following reply:Investigations disclosed that service demands fi'ir some dried tree fruits could not be met from the supplies usually available for export.

166,Mr Spender,"On the 12th March, theFLAX. honourable member for Wannon( Mr McLeod) asked, without notice, whether it was a fact that the price of flax was fixed by a committee on which the growers of flax have no representation. The Minister for Supply and Development has furnished the following reply :-The price paid to growers for flax straw is fixed by the Minister for Supply and Development on the recommendation of the Flax Production Committee. The committee, before making its recommendations to the Minister, cunferred at length with representatives of the frroweis* associations. The committee also had the advice of representatives of the Departments of Agriculture in each State concerned. It is not considered, therefore, that any purpose would be served by growers' representation mi the committee. honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr -Tolinson) asked, without notice, whether a greater share of defence work would be given to Western Australia, and whether munition factories would be established in that State. The Ministerf o r Munitions has f u r nished the following reply The question of placing orders to the utmost capacity that Western Australia can absorb is receiving the earnest consideration of the Department of Munitions, and it will be developed as machine tools, mid tools and gauges become available. March, 1941, the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens) asked the following question, without noticeOver a year ago, investigation was made of sites suitable for an aerodrome in the Tully district. As I understand that a site has been selected about two miles north of Cardwell. will the Minister for Air state whether anything has been done in regard to the construction of an aerodrome there? I am now in a position to answer the honourable member as follows :At the request of the local council, an officer of the Civil Aviation Department some months ago inspected a site near Cardwell to determine its suitability as a municipal aerodrome. The report of the inspection was communicated to the council, but no further departmental action is proposed, as an aerodrome is not required at the present time in the vicinity of Cardwell, either for civil uviHtion or air defence purposes. ARMY CONTRACTS. honourable member for M a r t in ( Mr. McCall) asked, without notice, whether the Contracts Board requires a percentage guarantee in respect of every contract let, and whether a number of small contractors are not able to provide this money and have to resort to the assistance of financiers; also whether such a practice results in in creased prices. If this is so, w ill the Minister inquire from the Commonwealth Bank whether some system of finance can be arranged with the bank for tenders. The Minister for Supply and Development has furnished the following reply:Where material and accessories are issued to contractors from departmental stock for use in the production of goods for the Defence Forces, it is the practice to require the contractor either to make prepayment, or to furnish u bank guarantee to an amount which would represent the value of the Commonwealth property which would be in his possession at any ono time. The evidence available to the department is that this practice does not increase the cost of goods to the Commonwealth.",36,Supplies Of Dried Fruits
