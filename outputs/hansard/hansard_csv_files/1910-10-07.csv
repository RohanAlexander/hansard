If the honourable member wants an assurance that it shall be provided in the regulations that the person shall be asked to say, not only where he was on that particular day, but where he had been for the previous six months or so, I shall be glad to give it to him. I should think that would meet the honourable member's objection. suggestion which we made before was that a period of six months might be taken. Does the Attorney-General mean to substitute absence for six months for absence on the day of assessment? questions on the paper to which the taxpayer would be asked to give a reply would be, "" Have you been resident in Australia for the last six months "" ? sticks tenaciously to the form of the clause, it would be as well to have something in the return to enable the taxpayer to state that he was absent on that day, but not for change of residence. whole question hinges on the meaning of the word ""residence"" in connection with which we have had a peculiar experience ' under the Queensland Electoral Act. There have been about twenty definitions of what ""residence"" means, and the honourable member for Echuca has directed the attention of the Attorney-General to that very point. means in the Queensland Electoral Act, then directly a man is away for one day over the six months, he will be an absentee. of course. we say. it means.

Apparently he is an absentee because he does not now reside in Queensland. member is a singularly undomesticated man. If that is his home, and he persists in remaining away from it, his conduct is calculated to create a public scandal. I had quite another opinion of the honourable member. If a man goes to Great Britain and remains there for six, eight, ten, or twelve months, he can still satisfy the Commissioner in exactly the same way as the honourable member can satisfy the Court. Under this Act the person concerned has only to satisfy the Commissioner. That is a very different thing from satisfying a Court. Of course, if the Commissioner decides against him he can go to the Court. Let me point out to the Attorney-General how unfair paragraph b is. It says that if a person has been absent from Australia, and its territories, during more than six months immediately preceding the date of assessment, he will have to pay the land tax as an absentee, which means a much larger rate of tax than he would have to pay as a resident. Six months is not sufficiently long, and the Attorney-General might very well make it twelve months. A man leaving Australia on business leaves If it means in this Bill what it his business behind, and leaves his wife and family, his home goes on just in the same way as usual, but it takes him, perhaps, twelve months before he can complete what he has to do in the Old Country. His home is really in Australia, and yet, if he is absent for more than six months, he becomes an absentee. I do not think that is fair.

There are two kinds of co-operative effort. There, is, for instance, what is known ber know of any co-operative butter comas the English democratic co-operative movement with an unlimited share list, each shareholder having only one vote, whilst there are registered in Australia cooperative societies which are similar to an ordinary trading company. For instance, we have the Civil Service Company, of New South Wales, which has not an open share list, and there is a movement afoot to form a wholesale society. doubtedly is a good idea. local co-operative societies will take shares in a company that will handle the wholesale end of the business, but that wholesale society will not be amalgamated with the others, and I do not think that the property held by it will be liable to taxation. prevailing in the honourable member for Richmond's district, but from his remarks I infer that some of the local co-operative societies have an interest in other companies which he fears will bring them under the aggregation clauses of the Bill.

I hope that the Attorney-General will not accede to the request of the honourable member for Richmond.

If we exempt co-operative butter factories, we shall have to exempt other co-operative trading companies, such as co-operative breweries, of which there is a very large one in Victoria, and co-operative stores, like the Sydney, I am not aware of the conditions Civil Service store. I am a shareholder in a co-operative concern in the city, and in co-operative concerns in the country, and have no hesitation in saying that very few co-operative societies, composed of pro-' ducers, will have to pay land tax. Quite recently, at Terang, the producers bought out one of the largest country storekeepers we have, paying £25,000 for his business and goodwill. I do not think that they will have to pay any tax on the unimproved value of their land, but I see no reason for exempting them any more than for exempting other trading companies.

There are five other sites, and, therefore, it is likely that the unimproved value of the company's land will be taxable. Furthermore, the company is amalgamated with a distributing company in Sydney, its shareholders holding a very large number of shares in the distributing company. It also has a smoking establishment in Sydney, and is interested in a boxmaking company there. concern. operative, the shares being held solely by the producers, who send cream to the different factories. The farmers who established the original company have extended their operations into other districts than Byron Bay, and increased the number of factories. As they hold shares in other cooperative companies, probably, the whole of the co-operative movement on the Richmond river, will be taxed under the aggregation clause at the highest rate. This, of course, may prevent the extension of operations, because the acquirement of more property will not only increase the amount of tax, but also its rate. Do honourable members desire that? The honourable member for Richmond has spoken of a large co-operative concern in his own electorate, but there are other cooperative concerns which I do not think he would wish to exempt from taxation. The largest buyers of wool, hides, and similar commodities in Sydney are an English co-operative company, whose capital is something like £4,000,000, which does a very large business, and has a big area of land at Botany. There is also a co-operative wool and pastoralists' association in New South Wales, and a co-operative store, which, perhaps, has the biggest retail business in wines and spirits in Sydney. By purchasing a share in that company, at a cost of perhaps about £ 3 , you can have liquor sent to your house with other groceries by the single bottle. None of the ordinary co-operative concerns would come under the Bill. Take those in the Hunter river district. wealthiest of them holds land whose unimproved value is £2,000. mated their holding of land would be much more valuable than that. large co-operative trading concerns, and tax the ordinary business companies with which they compete? It must be remembered that a co-operative concern may register under the New South Wales Friendly Societies Act, and probably in cases in which the tax is likely to press heavily, trading companies will try to register as co-operative concerns if we grant the exemption asked for. The Byron Bay company is virtually a trading company, and should pay taxes like any other trading company. It is a wealthy concern, and I wish it further prosperity, because it does good to the district; but the Government is justified in taxing its wealth. It would be unjust to exempt that company from taxation and to tax its competitors. I am pleased that the Attorney-General is considering the proposal to exempt cooperative companies. He might well go further, and exempt all companies. It is not generally known how small the average share holdings in our large companies is. For instance, the average holding in Dalgety and Company is only £700, and the average dividend per shareholder £ 4 7 , while the average holding in the Bank of New South Wales, which has 3,221 shareholders, is only £800, and the average dividend per shareholder only £ 7 7 . The honourable member for East Sydney complained the other day that in these times a poor man can never own a business, but there is nothing to prevent him from buying a few shares in a company. Industries are being more and more owned by large companies, and there is no reason why the workers should not buy shares in them, and thus become owners of the industries with which they are connected. about some of the companies, which are rather shaky. considerable part of the capital, they could appoint their own directors, and manage the company themselves. I think that in that direction the solution of a great deal of our industrial trouble lies. I thought the workers regarded the companies as too strong and wealthy, and making too Probably not the big profits, but I gather now, from the interiection of the honourable member for East Sydney, that the workers are nervous",20,Lines

The Attorney-General seems to be in a liberal frame of mind today, and I hope he will exempt, not only co-operative, but all, companies. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.47] -No one can appreciate more than we on this side do the benefits of co-operation, but I am bound to say that co-operation seems a singularly effective way of becoming possessed of the good things of this world, if we are to estimate its general effects by the special results in the cases cited by the honourable member for Richmond. I understand tliat, in his district, it is the common practice for gentlemen who are, as it were, overflowing with good things as the result of one co-operative concern, to become members of another, and, having produced more wealth, to proceed to distribute it. That is an admirable idea, and, no matter how rich they get, they deserve it all. But, all the same, I would ask the honourable member what real difference there is between a co-operative company and a joint-stock company? If it comes to that, everybody is co-operating. All the profits of a joint-stock company are -shared amongst the stockholders). The only question is how much each gets. He gets in proportion to his share, according to the amount he has invested, just like a member of a co-operative society, such as the honourable member has referred to. are distributed according to the amount of produce that, he puts through the cooperative company. There are co-operative societies, like the Civil Service Co-operative Society of New South Wales, referred to by the honourable member for Darlinga fine, flourishing concern, magnificently managed-to which any one can go and buy goods, and the Society makes its profit in the usual way. The honourable member for Fawkner suggests that we should include the poor, struggling institution known as the Bank of New South Wales, and Dalgety's, and other poor, helpless, wayside stragglers; and really there is no reason why they should not come in, for goodness knows they believe in co-operation stalwartly enough, and endeavour to practise it. If we merely put in "" co-operative societies,"" I do not see what is to prevent any society becoming [i.S3l a co-operative one, and going clean through the Act. We have to be very careful, and I am afraid the amendment suggested by the honourable member will open the door too wide. I am, however, prepared to look into the matter, and to do anything that can be safely done. What the honourable member asks for is too much. Amendment agreed to. posedThat the word "" public"" in paragraph d, wherever occurring, before the word "" charitable "" and before the word "" educational,"" be left out. [11.53] -The amendment will be of no use unless the Attorney-General consents to leave out the words "" and not for pecuniary profit."" I mentioned on a previous occasion that, under the clause as drafted, all our public schools, convents, and other places would be liable to the tax. All the large schools belonging to the different churches charge fees for the education of the children. In the convents a large nv-mber of children are educated by the nuns. Those who can afford it have to payfees, and under this provision all these religious bodies will be heavily taxed. I wish ta support the request of the honourable member for Balaclava for the omission of the words "" and not for pecuniary profit."" There are not a great many of these schools and other institutions, but I have in my mind one which has a very large playground used entirely for the benefit of the boys. The master receives the fees, and has to pay the expenses, and he just about gets a living wage out of it. It may be called a pecuniary profit, but it is a very small one in practically all these cases. If the clause is not amended the effect will be that those schools will really have to sell their large playgrounds. The Attorney-General might look into the question, because I do not think he intends to bring these educational establishments, some of them connected with churches, under the operation of the Act.

90,Mr Glynn (Angas) [11.55],"Whenleave the words ""pecuniary profit"" unqualified, because they will apply _ to institutions which can still be charities, although a profit is made in some way or another. If they are charities, the question of profit really does not come in at all; but, although there have.been a number of decisions in England on the point, I confess that they are really inconclusive. Some of them declare that the application of the moneys ought to be the' test-that so long as the profit is applied to the maintenance Or development of the charity, that charity should be exempt. Take a refuge as an example. You cannot have a better charity: Suppose they do some work, and a profit is realized upon it, and all the money is devoted to extending their efforts, not a penny piece being used for any other purpose than the maintenance or development of the refuge. That is a true charity, but the question has been raised in some cases whether the fact that a profit is made does not alter the character of the institution. It is a pity to have any doubt upon the point, and I ask the Attorney General to accept my suggestion, if he will not strike out the words "" and not for pecuniary profit,"" altogether. cases of religious communities, in which the sisters slave night and day, and deny themselves everything. It is the rule of their order that they are not to get their own meals until every person dependent upon them has been satisfied. In many cases ""they are kept down to half rations to do that, and it would be positively cruel if , under a measure like this, they were by legal construction excluded from the benevolence that we think ought to be applied to them. I move That, after the word "" profit,"" paragraph d, the words "" applied to other than such charitable or educational purposes"" be inserted. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.59] I do not think it would be wise to accept the amendment. The honourable and learned member admits that the authorities are not very clear as to what a charity does precisely mean, but I think it is perfectly clear that '' pecuniary profit"" does not refer, for instance, to fees received. The object of the charity has to be looked at. The mere fact that fees are received will not remove an institution from the exemption. Supposing there is a laundry attached to an institution, and a charge is made for the work done, I do not think it could be held for a moment that that would deprive an institution of exemption, provided that, viewed as a whole, it is a charitable institution. In the case of schools, again, fees may be received; and, indeed, I hold that the words "" pecuniary profit "" must be read according to the subject-matter. Regarding the question in that light, I think the whole ground is covered by the clause; and the words proposed to be inserted might be held to give quite an extended meaning to the provision. take it tiiat the words of the Attorney General show the spirit in which the Bill will be administered-that it will not apply to institutions, which, as part of their working, may carry on industries, the proceeds of which go to the support, of the institution? For instance, there are several large farms, or homes, in connection with the Salvation Army, and the profits from the products of these are devoted to the institutions themselves, and not to private gain. tion is a mere cloak for a business, the case I know is different. any exemption in such case; there must be a genuine charity. that if the fees or profits of a charitable institution or a school are devoted to a general fund, out of which salaries and so forth are paid, such institutions will be exempt. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [12.3]. I quite agree with the Attorney-General that the mere acceptance of fees will not deprive a charitable institution of its character; but I think he overlooks the state of things in connection with a large number of both charitable and educational institutions. The words ""or in trust for "" would imply that there is a legal person for whom the land is held in trust, but a man might hold money given to him for a certain purpose, and, within the meaning of an Act of Parliament, that would not be "" in trust."" To illustrate what I mean, let us take the common case of property belonging to some particular church. In vernacular language, we may loosely speak of that property being held by the trustees of the church in trust, say, for a school;",22,Lines

The funds of the church are applied to the maintenance of a school in connection with which fees are charged to the pupils; but I agree with the Attorney General that such a fact would not prevent this being regarded as a charitable or educational institution. The property is not, however, held "" in trust,"" because, if , in one year, there happened to be a surplus it would not belong to the so-called institution, but would belong to the church fund, and any deficit would probably have to be made up out of the same fund. In fact, the position is exactly the same as when trustees hold property for a church, which really means for all the members of the church, either with the consent of those members or under some statutory or other authority, to be applied to particular purposes. I ask the Attorney-General whether he does not think there ought to be some amendment of the clause dealing with this point; because, otherwise, we may remove from the exemption such common cases as I have mentioned. In the case of the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School, for instance, there is a certain amount of property held by the trustees for the Church. That property is not held in trust for the Church of England Grammar School as a separate institution, because the Church might, from time to time, alter the destination of the fund. of land on which these schools are, and it permits its funds to be used where necessary in aid of the school.

If he finds that he will have to pay a tax equal to about half the rent that he would otherwise have to pay, he will say that he can only afford to give half the rent he would otherwise give. We are, therefore, really taking away from the societies which are exempted the benefit that we purport to give them under the exemption. Take large areas of city property as an instance. The honourable member for Gippsland referred in an interjection to the St. James' property in Melbourne. That is held by the Church of England for church purposes. The income from it is derived solely from it being let out in large and valuable parcels, all of which would be liable to taxation. If we say to the Church of England trustees, "" We exempt you fromall taxation with regard to this land, because the moneys you derive from it are applied to strictly charitable and religious purposes,"" we appear to be giving them a concession. But, on the other hand, we say to their future lessees, "" If you venture to take a new lease from the church you will have to pay the full tax,"" and that will necessarily deprive the church of the whole benefit of the previous concession.

Is it the common practice of churches to let out very many parcels of land worth £5,000 and over in unimproved value? Mr W. H . IRVINE -Yes, in cities. ought to pay. When the honourable member for Darling Downs says that this will depreciate the value of church property, he forgets that all property is treated on exactly the same footing. If a man wants to lease land from any person, he has to pay the tax, and therefore, proportionately, the value of church land will not be depreciated. The church will be in practically the same position as every other landowner, except that it will not have to pay any tax itself. That, however, is a very material difference. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The unimproved value of a good many of these city properties runs up to anything from £500 to £ 1 , 0 0 0 a foot. there are not cases of that sort.

I ask the Attorney-General whether he 'considers this fair, considering there is not another provision in the Bill to that effect? Why is this done?. Because it is feared that by the subdivision through leasing some revenue may be lost. But revenue will be lost simply because we declare that certain lands must be exempt; arid it is a departure from the principle of the Bill to destroy the effect of the exemption and make the leaseholder pay the total. looks at clause 12 he will see that the provision is limited entirely to the ownerthat it does not extend to any other person. say to a land-owner, "" As long as you hold this land you are exempt, arid as long as you lease it your rents are exempt, but the moment you do lease it the lessee will be taxed to the full rate."" Surely that is an assertion that that man's land must be discounted when it is competing for lease. The whole idea of this provision is to endeavour to prevent a loss of revenue from subdivision or leasing, but in making that effort we are' destroying one of the principles of the Bill, and bringing within its scope people whom we say should be exempt. We"" should place lessees both before and after the Act in the same pos""^ tion. Before the"" Act lessor and lessee each pay in proportion to their interest; but iu the case of a lease made after the Act comes into operation, the lessee will have to pay the sum total. That is unfair. I ask the Attorney-General to adopt the principle followed in other taxing systems-and followed in his own measure, as regards leases entered into before the Bill comes into operation -by leaving the amount Of the tax to be apportioned between the lessor and the lessee. If one is exempt do not tax him; if the other is not exempt; then tax him only to the ex^ tent of his interest in the land. I dra* the attention of the Attorney General to paragraph a of clause 13, which declares that, with respect to land which, under the preceding clause is exempt from land taxthe exemption shall be limited to the owner specified in that section, and shall not extend to any other person who is the owner of any estate -or interest in the land. Let us take the case of the City of Sydney, which owns market buildings, which, we will say, are worth £100,000. Under this Bill that property is exempt, but is it the intention of the Attorney-General that, in the event of the municipality leasing the buildings, only the leasehold interest that the tenant holds shall be taxed? lessee bear the whole of the tax on the -unimproved value? difference as between tliat case and the case of an ordinary lessor and an ordinary lessee. If ah owner has an estate 'in fee-simple and makes a lease to the tenant, then there should be ari apportionment of the taxation between the lessor arid the lessee. If the Attorney-General intends to tax the lessee, let him be taxed only in respect of the value of his interest. Do not let us take away the exemption by making the lessee pay the whole amount that the lessor would have to pay if he were not exempt.

It i view of the statement made by the honourable member for Darling Downs, I think it is clear that if clause 26 applies td exempt lands', it will* mean that a lessee will pay only on the actual interest that he holds.

The desire seems to be to place leaseholders on an independent footing-that they shall be called upon to bear their own burdens and not to take over that of the original holders of tlie land. There are in the Committee solicitors who will endorse my statement that there are a very large number of holders under what is not a lease, but tantamount in all respects to one.

It seems to me very unjust that, if a man misses one day in the payment of his tax, he should incur a penalty of 10 per cent. No inducement is given to a man if he has made an error, to hasten up and pay the tax. Rather is there an inducement not to pay until the Commissioner takes steps to force him. It is, however, a fair thing to make the penalty 10 per cent, per 28 annum, so that, if a man makes default 18 for a few days, he will not be penalized so heavily as if he makes default for some IO months. Moloney, Parker means that if a taxpayer were in arrear Ozanne, A. T . only one month, he would pay only 1 per Riley, E. cent. ? Scullin, J. I-I. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Yes. In that Spence, W.
