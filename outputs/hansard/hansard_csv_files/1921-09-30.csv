For Works And Railways) [11.1]","I lay on the table the annual report of the River Murray Commission, and I move That the paper be printed. Question resolved in the affirmative. Minister for Works and Railwaysi f the works on the River Murray arc in f u l l progress, and if there is any' fear that their progress wil l be interfered with by the high state of the river. answer the honourable member if I shortly state what the position is. At the Hume Reservoir, which will contain about 1,000,000 acre-feet of water, work is proceeding well. the New South Wales side there are now 300 men engaged. Good progress has been 'made, all the plant has been assembled, and the actual construction of the dam itself has been begun. As a result of these operations honourable members w i ll find that quite a little township [464]2 has sprung up on that side of the river. On the Victorian side there was a long delay owing to industrial troubles. I am glad to say that these have been overcome, and there are to-day on the Vic-' torian side over 180 men engaged, and work is being proceeded with. It is estimated that from 480 to 500 men are at present engaged in the construction of works on the Upper Murray. Lower down the river at Torumbarry the Victorian Constructing authority is carrying out construction work on behalf of Victoria and New South Wales, and very considerable progress has been made with the lock at that place. Some industrial trouble arose, but that has recently been settled, and now work is proceeding satisfactorily. In South Australia. I am glad to say that the Blanchtown Weir and Lock have been completed. It is the first work on the River Murray to be completed. Por three years those engaged in construction were faced with considerable difficulty owing to the condition of the river. SO September, 1921. Three floods were at different times coming down the Darling threatening operations. It was a race between the engineers and thc floods, and I am glad to be able to say that the engineers won. The work to which I have referred is now completed, the coffer dam is being removed, and the lock w ill be in opera-' tion in the near . future. In South Australia also at No. 3 Lock work is proceeding, the plant and all the neoesarry material is being assembled, and good progress is. being made. No. 9 Lock is the one which I ask the is to be used in connection with ths storage at Lake Victoria. The necessary material has heen purchased, and advantage has now been taken of the opportunity to transport some of it for purposes of construction. Honourable members w ill realize that some, of the material required for works on the River Murray has to be carried over hundreds of miles. Work is beiug resumed in connection with the big works at the Lake Victoria storage, where On provision is being made for the ftorage of over 500,000 acrc-feet of water for the irrigation settlement in South Australia. The works here are being carried out in part by the Government and partly by contract.

It was found later that the number of ex-Imperial men who desired to settle was greatly on thei increase, and in October last it was evident that if we continued to make advances for settlement as originally proposed, we should be unable to provide from repatriation funds sufficient money to cover advances required for the settlement of members of the Australian Imperial Force.

Ordered to be printed. ter and Attorney-General) [11.30] -(B y leave.)-On the 7th A p r i l , 1921, I made a statement to this House setting out the principal questions to be considered at the Conference, and giving reasons why Australia should be represented. Let me remind you of what I then saidTlie Conference has been summoned to deal with questions of foreign policy, naval defence, and the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. Certain other subsidiary matters are also set out on the agenda-paper. One relates to communications (including wireless) between various parts of the Empire; but I shall direct my remarks mainly to those matters which are of fundamental importance. I emphasized the importance of foreign policy to Australia in general and the Anglo-Japanese Treatyi n particular, the dependence of the Empire on sea power, and expressed my opinion that the Treaty ought to be renewed, and in such form , if that should prove By any means possible, as would be satisfactory to America. I concluded by sayingIf I_ am asked if the Commonwealth is to be committed to anything done at the Conference, I say, quite frankly, that this Parliament will have the amplest opportunity of expressing its opinion on any scheme of naval defence that is decided upon before the scheme is ratified. As to the renewal of the Treaty with Japan, this is my attitude, and I submit it to the conBritaini n 1914. A bolt had fallen from sideration of honourable members: I am in favour of renewing the Treaty in any form that is satisfactory to Britain, America, and ourselves. I am prepared to renew it in these circumstances. If it is suggested that the renewal should take the form which would involve the sacrifice of those principles which we ourselves regard as sacred, I am not prepared to accept it. In such circumstances, I shall bring back' the Treaty to this Parliament. I think I have put the situation clearly; and since these matters have sometimes to be settled quickly, I want honourable members to say whether they will give me the authority I ask for. With regard to the expenditure involved in any naval scheme, the House will not be committed to the extent of one penny. The scheme will be brought before Parliament, and honourable members will be able to discuss, and accept or reject it. Honourable members, therefore, were f u l ly aware of the main objects of my mission and of my attitude towards them. I undertook not to commit Australia to any expenditure unless approved by ParOF DOMINIONS EMPIRE'S liament. The Parliament gave me the A p r i l I l e f t for London. I have been earliest possible moment after my return, I propose to inform the Parliament and the country of what the Conference did. I need hardly say . that the pledges given by me have been carried out, not only to the letter, but in the spirit. The Commonwealth is not committed to any expenditure. Everything done is subject to parliamentary approval, and Parliament w ill have the fullest opportunity of expressing its opinions. Before plunging into the details of the subjects dealt with in London, a few prefatory words about the Conference itself seem called for. The recent meeting of the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and the overseas Dominions differed in many respects from those which preceded it . i Prior to the war, Imperial Conferences were ceremonious and social functions rather than .serious attempts to co-ordinate the activities of a far-flung Empire. The experiences of war,showed clearly that as the t safety of every part of the Empire depended upon united action, means for insuring to each member an effective share in guiding its course must be devised. Matters over which we had no control, in shaping which we had no voice, about which we were indeed quite ignorant, had led to a declaration of war by Great the blue; Britain was at war; as part of the Empire we were involved. Britain had done much for us, under her sheltering wing we had rested for over a oentury",23,Butter For Export
56,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime Minisi n perfect peace and security. Our hour of great t r i al had come; we had to prove ourselves worthy of the traditions of our race and onr liberties, or perish The war has changed many'things. It has destroyed dynasties, uprooted ancient institutions, readjusted the boundaries of the nations, and created many difficult problems; but it has also given us a wider and more splendid concept of Empire. We have realized that the British Empire is a partnership of free nations, every one being free to act as it pleases, yet all united in council and in action. Our isolation did not insure our safety. Before the war we had stood aloof fro m world politics, yet the maelstrom of war engulfed us, and this young Democracy has proved itself worthy of it s ' breeding and of its liberties. 'The legions of Australia fought alongside those of Britain and the other Dominions. Our ships were on every sea; our armies in the forefront of the far-flung battle line in Europe and Apia. We had been a Dominionj the war made us a nation within! the Commonwealth of Nations. The admission of the representatives of the Dominions into the Imperial War Cabinet marked the first great step in the new era. Then came the Peace Conference on which the Dominions were granted separate representation, and sat on a footing of equality with the great nations of the earth. But not only was our status as nations thus conceded, but by virtue of our membership of the British Empire we exercised an influence and wielded an authority f a r greater than that of the majority of the nations gathered round the Peace Table, for as members of the British Empire Delegation-the name by which the Imperial -Cabinet was known during the Peace -Conference-w e enjoyed privileges denied to all save the-great Powers; we were consulted on the vital matters which came before the Council of the Four, and our voices and votes shaped the policy which the British representatives urged in that Council. We affixed our signatures to the Versailles Treaty. The status granted in War haa been -confirmed in times of Peace. Mr Lloyd -Georgei n his opening Speech t0 the Conference said:In recognition of their services and achieveperity of the whole Empire. ments in the war the British Dominions havo now been accepted fully into the comity of the nations of the whole world. They aresignatories to tlie Treaty of Versailles and of all other Treaties of Peace; they are members of the Assembly of the League of Nations, and their representatives have already attended meetings of the League; in other words, thoy have achieved full national status, and they now stand beside the United Kingdom as equal partners in the dignities and responsibilities of the British Commonwealth. If there are any means by which that status can be rendered even more clear to their own communities and to the world at large, we shall be glad to have them put forward at this Conference. In these words, the Prime Minister of Britain, the President of the Conference, set out in, clear unambiguous language the concept of a partnership of free nations, all equal in dignity and responsibility, to which the Conference subsequently formally and officially set its seal. I ask this House and this country to note all that is involved in these words of the Prime Minister of Britain, accepted by his colleagues and endorsed by the Conference, I ask them to contrast this concept of a British Commonwealth comprised of free nations, each enjoying the status of nationhood, each claiming and being accorded an equal voice in shaping Empire policy, with that other concept, which, not many years ago, stood unchallenged-of B r it a in supreme in power and authority, deciding without question the destiny of all. In those days when one spoke of Empire the B ritish communities oversea seemed only the appanages of Britain's glory; Britain loomed so large as to dwarf a l l others. Tn the minds of men B r it a in was the Empire. But the years have passed; much water has run under the bridges, much blood has been shed; the Dominions have established their right to be treated as equals, and Britain, not waiting for formal demand, has been the first to acclaim and gladly welcome us as'her equal, and bid us sit w it h her at the Council table of Empire. The Imperial Conference of 1921 was one in which all members met as equals to discuss not the prosecution of a war, on which common agreement was easily attainable, but the intricacies of foreign policy in many countries and the measures necessary for the safety and prosFor the first time, then, in the history of this great Empire the representatives -of Great Britain and the Dominions met in time of Peace on terms of perfect equality to lay down the policy which was to guide the Empire. Foreign Affairs, once the special prerogative of Britain, became the concern of every member of the Commonwealth of Nations. At the outset, in attempting to set before the House the work of the Conference in proper perspective, I find myself in difficulties owing to the vastness of the field covered by our discussion; and that, indeed, must be my apology for thus dealing with it in a prepared statement. I feel that unless my remarks are severely circumscribed, I shall never be able to set out in proper perspective, or, indeed, to cover in any fashion, the work of the Conference. The Conference took for its province Foreign and Imperial policy, that is to say, the affairs of the whole world; for the boundaries of the British Empire march with those of nearly every State in the world, and its shores are washed by the waters of every ocean. The policies of every country in every Continent are a matter of vital concern to this worldwide Empire of ours. As the great canvas of Foreign Policy was slowly unrolled by the Foreign Secretary and his colleagues, and we saw the immensity of the stage on which it moves, we were able to appreciate to the f u l l the greatness and majesty of the British Empire, and to realize still more vividly how great a privilege it is to be able to claim it3 citizenship. It may be that there are still some people in Australia who regard Foreign Affairs as something outside the realm of practical politics, which do not concern us, or with which Britain acting alone can and ought to deal. This, I (believe, is not the view of this House, nor of the bulk of the people of Australia. Australia, remote as she is from the western world, is a western nation; and, though the farthest outpost of the western world, is profoundly affected by all that the western nations think and do. The late war, unhappily, made it only too clear that our remoteness, our isolation, could not save us from the cataclysm that burst over Europe. And the modern world grows each day smaller, and the nations of the earth more inter-dependent. We are no longer Mr Hvghes. like dwellers in wide spaces, who go about their own affairs regardless of what other men may do, their own doings passing alike unnoticed; we are like inhabitants of a crowded city, who, jostling each other at every turn, can do nothing without affecting, and, in turn, being affected by their neighbours. Not wars or the dangers of wars only concern us, but the varying social and economic conditions of every country of the world. The corner stone of our national, social, and economic life, the White Australia Policy, and those pillars of our national temple-the standard of living, the wages paid for labour, markets for our produce-are , or may be, affected, not only by what other nations do, but by what they say and think. Now, since it is obvious that ho one can be a good citizen of Australia who does not recognise how intimately and vitally we are affected, and may be menaced by what other nations doj it is necessary that we should consider how Australia's voice can best be heard, her influence felt, and her interests protected in the chancelleries of foreign nations. And there is obviously but one way by which this can be done effectively. The voice of Australia, with its 5,500,000 of people, would be lost across the waste of waters, its influence in the councils of the nations negligible, its strength but that of a stripling. But when the voice of Australia speaks as part of i the British Empire, with its 500,000,000 of people, its mighty Navy, its flag on every sea, its strongholds on every continent, its power and its glory shining and splendid, acknowledged by all, then she speaks in trumpet tones that are heard and heeded throughout all the earth. With our hands on the lever of Empire, we move the world; but, casting this aside, we are shorn of our strength and count for little or nothing. Australia is great. She has already done great things, in peace and in war. The splendid promise of her future beckons us on, but whether we shall achieve it or not depends upon ourselvesj and, as I see it , upon our remaining a partner of this great Commonwealth of Nations. Its unity is our strength. And this is true, not only of Australia, but of every other part of the Empire. Let me quote the words of Mr Lloyd Georgei n his opening speech dealing with this very matterSo undoubtedly it is a fact that the Empire spoke during the war as a whole with its united strength, with its concentrated. strength, with a united purpose. That is What has made history as it is going to be for centuries to come. Therefore, I think, We ought to start there, that the first thing we ought to seek is some means by which the Empire can speak with one voice. NowI should like to take another phase. There is no part of the Empire that would be as potent speaking separately as it is now when speaking as part of the British Empire. The United Kingdom is very powerful. But it goes without saying that its influence would not be as determining an influence as the one which it exercises when it has the whole Empire acting with it. A clear understanding on Foreign Policy is absolutely essential to our safety and our welfare. We must know what is being done, and we must, as f a r as our geographical and other circumstances w ill permit, have a hand in shaping it . Before leaving for the Conference I said in this House that Australia could not afford to go blindly along the road which leads to war ; that we were entitled to, and must have a voice in formulating the Foreign Policy of the Empire. I saidWe have at length become alive to the fact that, in the modern world, no nation can alford' to be indifferent to what other nations do, and that war may come upon ua from the most unexpected quarter, and npon. the most trivial pretext. We cannot afford to ignore the Foreign Policy of other nations, nor of our own Empire. Of my opening speech to the Conference, which was published, T shall quote two short extractsNow, Mr Prime Minister, amongst the great problems that are to be considered, three stand out. You referred to all of them yesterday. They are-Foreign Policy in general, the Anglo-Japanese Treaty in particular, and Naval Defence. There are other problems, of course, which are intimately associated with these. If we are to give effect to the principle, which I take it has already been accepted, viz., the right of the Dominions to sit at the council table on a footing of equality, and to discuss with you and the other representatives the question of Foreign Policy of the Empire; these also must be, not only considered, but settled. I do not think I am misinterpreting the opinions of all my friends here when I say that this voice, this share, in the councils of the Empire, in regard to 1 Foreign Policy, must be a real one, must be of substance, and not merely a shadow. Conference. 11633 . The whole Empire is concerned in Foreign Policy, though this was for many years re* garded as the sole prerogative of Great Britain. Wars are hatched by foreign, policy. No one is able to say that any act affecting foreign nations will not in the fulness of time lead to war. No one is able to say that the most apparently trivial and innocent action will not involve us in international turmoil, and in the fulness of time bring us to the bloody plains of war. So, when we see on every side, the British line-or , if you like, the line of this Commonwealth of British nations being lengthened, and the line of defence necessarily thinned, the points of potential danger multiplied, we are naturally uneasy. We have seen that a cloud, no bigger than a man's hand, can cdver the whole heavens. And so, sirI speak, not only for myself, of courseI am sure you will quite understand our desire to know the reasons for your policy in Mesopotamia, in Palestine, in Russia, in Egypt, in Greece and_ Turkey. If I have singled out these things, it is not because they cover the whole field of Foreign Policy, but because they are, perhaps, the most obvious. The British Government agreed entirely with the views thus put forward. They recognised the right of Australia, and the other Dominions, to an equal voice in formulating the Policy on Foreign and Imperial Affairs, and, as I have said, gave the Conference a very f u l l and clear account of British Foreign Policy all over the world. The discussion on Foreign Policy covered many sittings. The British and Dominions Ministers all took part, and the procedure was that usual at Cabinet meetings. The Conference was unanimous as to the necessity for a complete understanding, and common action in Foreign Affairs. The delegates were supplied w it h a l l inward and outward Foreign Office telegrams during their stay in London; all important matters of foreign policy arising during the Conference were brought by the Foreign Secretary to the Conference, and dealt with in exactly the same way as Cabinets deal with matters brought before them. This marks a great advance in Imperial relations, and is an auspicious augury for the future. The candour with which the Dominions were met established an atmosphere of complete confidence, which had its effect on. all the discussions which followed. Time will not permit me to review even in the briefest wav all the questions of foreign policy which were discussed, by the Conference. The field is too vast, and many of the problems too intricate and difficult for presentation in summarized form. Among the more important questions' discussed, the following may be mentioned:-The position in Mesopotamia, Palestine, Anatolia, Russia, the Graeco-Turkish war, the policy of the Empirei n the League of Nations. About two others-Silesi a and E g y p t I will say the Canal-affect s the whole of the E m a few words before I come to the AngloJapanese Treaty and matters relating thereto. The situation in Upper Silesia threatened at one stage of our sittings to assume very alarming proportions. For a time it menaced the peace of Europe and the world. Honourable members are, no doubt, familiar with the main outlines of the situation. A plebiscite has been taken with the object of ascertaining the wishes of the' inhabitants, who, as you doubtless know, are Poles and Germans. The Peac'e Conference found this question one of the most baffling with which it was called upon to deal. Evidence on both sides was abundant, and I am almost tempted to say, equally overwhelming and unreliable. The plebiscite was an attempt to find out whether the majority in certain districts were Poles or Germansnot merely in origin, but in sentimentthat is to say, whether they wished to be under German or Polish rule. As might have been expected, it l e f t things very much as they were. In July last the trouble suddenly assumed an acute form. Apart from its intrinsic! importance, the submission of the Silesian problem, when it had assumed a most menacing aspect, by the British Government to the I m perial Conference, is most significant. The matter was dealt with by the Conference as one at once vital and most urgent, and a policy unanimously decided upon. doubt that the hands of the British Foreign Minister were strengthened very materially by his being able to speak on behalf of the Empire, and not merely for Britain alone. Honourable members are, of course, well aware that the threatened crisis was averted, and a modus operandi found. I turn now to Egypt. The discussion the question of British Policy in Egypt was one of vital' importance to Australia, and so requires special mention. the British. Empire rests on sea power, and while Australia depends, as she does, for her very existence as? a nation upon Mr Hughes. the British Navy, the affairs of Egyptwhich lie right across our line of Communications, are very much the concern of Australia. Anything that menaces the Suez Canal and British prestige in Egypt-o r in any of those territories which are, as it were, the hinterland of pire vitally. No useful purpose would be served by recounting the incidents which have led up to the present position of affairs in Egypt. It is only necessary to say that the views of Australia were quite clearly set out before the Conference, and that the policy subsequently agreed upon was unanimously approved. I come now to the problems of the Pacific. The main reason for summoning the Conference in June of this year was to consider the Anglo-Japanese Treaty and the Pacific problems with which it is inseparably connected. Briefly, the position in regard to the Treaty was as follows : In its original form the Treaty had been concluded by Lord Lansdowne in 1902. The present Treaty was signed by Sir Edward Greyi n 1911. The 1911 Treaty contained a most important modification to which the attention of honourable members is invited. Article4 of the 1911 Treaty readsSliould either High Contracting Party conclude a Treaty of general arbitration with a third Power, it is agreed that nothing in this agreement shall entail upon such contracting party an obligation to go to war with the Power with whom such Treaty of Arbitration is in force. A t that time L o r d Grey was endeavouring to negotiate a Treaty of Arbitration w i th America, but this was rejected by There is no reason to the United States Senate. In September, 1914, however, Lord Grey succeeded in concluding a Treaty entitled, "" W it h regard to the establishment of a Peace Commission,"" under the terms of which a l l disputes between the contracting parties -Great Britain and the United States of America-were to be referred to a special Investigation Commission. Although not in terms an Arbitratio n Treaty, it is in which centred in effect equivalent thereto, and the then Government of Great Britain accordingly informed the Japanese Government that While the "" Peace Commission "" was regarded by them as equivalent to an Arbitration Treaty, and that the conditions prescribed by Article4 of the Treaty of 1911 applied. cepted the interpretation without demur, and Article4 has since been applied, thus precluding the possibility of the AngloJapanese Treaty leading to war between the United States of America and Great Britain. It is well that the whole world should note this, for the facts flatly contradict the opinions held in America and elsewhere that the Anglo-Japanese Treaty might possibly involve a conflict between America and Britain. The position on the day the discussion opened was that the Treaty was held to expire within two weeks, viz., the 13th July, 1921, but three months' extension had been asked for by the British Government in order to give the Conference an opportunity of considering the question of renewal. The belief that the Treaty expired on 13th. July arose from a joint notification made by Great Britain and Japani n June, 1920, to the League of Nations, intimating that as the AngloJapanese Treaty did not conform to the provisions of the Covenant, both parties desired that it should do so. The text of the notification was as follows: The Governments of Great Britain and Japan have come to the conclusion that the AngloJapanese Agreement of 13th July,' 1911, now existing between the two countries, though in harmony with the spirit of the Covenant of the League of Nations, is not entirely consistent with the letter of the Covenant which both Governments earnestly desire to respect. They have the honour, therefore, to notify the League that, if this Agreement is to continue after July, 1921, it must be in a form which is not inconsistent withthat Covenant. This notification was regarded by the British Law Officers as constituting a denunciation of the Treaty as provided in clause 6, which stipulates that twelve months' notice of denunciation shall be given by either party before the Treaty can terminate. The question before the Conference when ib turned to the discussion of the Treaty was whether it should be renewed in a form consistent w i th the Covenant of the League of Nations or be allowed to lapse. In the general discussion which followed, the matter was dealt with in its broader aspects and upon the assumption1. That unless the Conference decided to renew, it would terminate at the expiry of three months. The Japanese Government ac2. That if it were renewed, it must conform to the Covenant of-the League of Nations, and that every effort should be made to insure co-operation with the United States. There were wide differences of opinion. I shall set out my own views by brief quotations from my speeches. Before doing so, however, let me recall to your minds what I said before I l e f t Australia: What is the ideal at which we are to aim at this Conference and elsewhere, by every means at our disposal? It is, as I see it, a renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty in such form-modifie d if that should be deemed proper-as will be acceptable to Britain, toAmerica, to Japan, and to ourselves. While making every effort to retain the friendship of Japan, we cannot make an enemy of the United States of America. Nor can Britain do so If we .cannot secure a satisfactory Treaty, then it is obvious that any adequate scheme of naval defence will involve us in much greater expenditure, and at a time when our resources are strained to the uttermost In the first speech, delivered by me before the Conference, copious extracts of which were published by authority of the Prime' Minister of GreatB r it a in , ' I amplified these views. I saidI now leave foreign policy in general, and come to the Anglo-Japanese Treaty. Here we are dealing with a matter definite and urgent. It is not a thing to be settled in the future,, but now. The British Government have only postponed settlement in order that the matter might be dealt with round this table. It is an urgent matter. It must be settled without delay. The attitude of Australia towards it has been quite clearly stated. We have not a clean slate before us. If we had to consider for the first time whether we should have a Treaty with Japan, the position might be very different. We have not. For many years, a Treaty existed between Japan and Britain. Its terms have been modified, but, in substance, the existing Treaty has been in force for a -long time. No doubt, it cannot be renewed in precisely its present form. It must conform to the requirements of the League of Nations. But the case for renewal is very strong, if not indeed, overwhelming. To Australia, as yon will understand, this Treaty with Japan has special significance. Speaking broadly, we are in favour of its renewal. But there are certain difficulties which must be faced. One of these arises out of the attitude of America towards this Treaty. I am sure I state the opinion of Australia when I say the people have a very warm corner in their hearts for America. They see in America to-day what they themselves hope to be in the future. Wfi have a country very similar in extent and resources, and it may be laid down as a sine qua non that any future Treaty with Japan, to be satisfactory to Australia, must specifically exclude the possibility of war witli the United States of America. In any future Treuty, we must guard against even the suspicion of hostility or unfriendliness to the United States. Some America's objections as so strong that they felt it their duty toi oppose the renewal of the Treaty on any terms. W it h these views I did not agree. I said-I am as warm a friend and as resolute a champion of the Union of English-speaking people as any man. 1 yield to none in my desire to bring this about. But I do not mistake the voice of a noisy, anti-British faction in America for the sentiment of that great Republic; and I will not believe that we shall advance the cause of the peace of the world, and promote more friendly relations with the United States of America, by a weak vacillating policy which seeks always the approval of this faction, before we dare pursue a policy founded upon justice, and compatible alike with the welfare of mankind and the greatness of this Empire. Wc have been summoned here to formulate a foreign policy which will protect the interests of every part of the British Empire. This we must endeavour to do. I am for the renewal of thc Treaty, and I am against delay. I am for an immediate declaration of our intention to renew upon terms that will at once be compatible with the League of Nations Covenant, which will give America ample opportunity to be officially consulted, and which will exclude specifically, and in set terms, the possibilities of our being ranged in hostile array against America by virtue of that Treaty. That is my position, and I venture to say that a further postponement will, and can, place us in no better position than we are to-day. On the second day of the Conference I had thrown out two suggestions, one, to which I shall refer in detail later; urging Mr Lloyd George to invite the great nations of the world, in particular America, Japan, and France, to a Conference to discuss disarmament, and the other, that America and Japan should be invited to a Conference in order to discuss the terms of a tripartite treaty to talro the place of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, or, failing a tripartite treaty, to ascertain from America what form a Treaty between Japan and B r it a in should take to be acceptable to her. Negotiations on these lines were undertaken at once, but it became obvious as these proceeded that the suggested Conference must consider not only the AngloJapanese Treaty, but many other Pacific' questions, e.g., the ""Open China and Immigration, tions are naturally related, to the AngloJapanese Treaty, to naval rivalry in the Mr Bughes. Pacific, and so to disarmament. As a fact, as the discussion proceeded, it .was found impossible to treat one phase effectively without dealing with all, and so of my colleagues regarded the debate covered the whole field of Pacific problems and of disarmament. It is not to be assumed that the discussions on the Treaty went on in unbroken sequence. In the very nature of things, it was necessary for us to obtain the views of Japan and America., and this involved delay, "" in the intervals the Conference discussed naval defence, the proposed Constitutional Conference, and various questions of foreign policy. Before the negotiations with America and Japan, conducted' through their respective AmbassadorSj had resulted in any definite conclusion, President Harding's invitation to a Disarmament Conference was received. The invitation was brought without delay to the Conference, and was at once unanimously accejDted. Mr. Lloyd George made his public announcement in the Commons, and then returned to the Conference, in order that we mightconsider the new situation. Naturally, since the invitation to the nations to disarm went to the very roots of Foreign Policy, the proposed Washington Conference fundamentally changed the situation. But th© invitation to the Washington Conference, though it affected procedure, was not itself a solution of the great problems confronting us. Indeed, the necessity for a settlement of the Pacific questions was not less, but, if possible, more imperative, and it appeared to us a condition precedent to disarmament that there must be a preliminary discussion and settlement of the Pacific problems. There did not seem anything incompatible with acceptance of the invitation to the Washington Conference and' such a preliminary discussion. The Prime Minister, and the Conference generally, when drafting the reply which the PrimeM in ister made in the House of Commons, were indeed under the impression that President Harding contemplated two conferences. And we all certainly held very strongly that no satisfactory result could follow from a Disarmament Conference unless a modus vivendi on these problems had been previously arrived at. The Powers to be invited to this preDoor"" in liminary Conference were America, for these quesJapan, China, and the British Empire. In the reply to the Dnited State^ Government, accepting the invitation to the Disarmament Conference, the Prime Minister set out this position very clearly. The points to be settled were1. The Anglo-Japanese Agreement, the present form of which, though subject to re-interpretation in accordance with the Covenant of the League of Nations, is, in the opinion of both the High Contracting Parties, obsolete. 2. The special interests of thc three Powers -the British Empire, the United States, and Japan-in different parts of the Pacific littoral, evitably caused by postponements and deand in the islands of the Western Pacific. 3. The independence and integrity of China, and the preservation of equal opportunity for all Powers in the assistance of Chinese development. In our view, these essential consultations between the f o u r Powers mentioned could not be arranged as part of the agenda of the Washington Conference. The special interests of Australia in all Pacific questions were pointed out, and in the opinion of the Conference it was essential that the Commonwealth should be directly represented. The practical difficulties in the way were stated. While not unduly emphasizing the convenience of the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand, iv was pointed out to the American Government the presence of both would be very material in securing the f u l l and cordial assent of the people of both Dominions to the decisions reached. More important still was the convenience of all the invited Powers. An y attempt to combine the special consultations of the four Powers with the main business of the Conference would be open to two f a t a l objections. In the first place, the representatives of the other Powers could hardly be expected to await their summons to Washington, or, alternatively, to linger in Washington outside the Conference until the four Powers had concluded their special discussions. To make any such proposal might jeopardize the very holding of the Conference!. In the second place, even if the other Powers were to accept such an arrangement, the Conference would inevitably be prolonged thereby to a period too long to admit of the presence of any European statesmen of the first rank. It was difficult for any leading Ministers in European. Governments to make even short absences from their work at that time, which was unusually complex and. arduous in the. then critical state of European politics. None could attend to a Conference on the other side of the Atlantic so protracted as a combination of Pacific consultations and a Disarmament Conference would inevitably became. In the thir d place, attention was drawn to the effect of such procedure on public opinion in the countries most closely concerned. In some parts of the British Empire public feeling was very strongly excited upon the Pacific question, and would be further disquieted by the doubts and suspicions that were in lays. In the interests of a settlement, which depended very largely upon the atmosphere of public discussion in all the countries concerned, an early consideration of the Pacific problem was urgently desirable. Those were the views of the Imperial Conference, and they were in substance' presented to the Government of the Dnited States of America for its consideration. Negotiations were protracted, and the situation changed almost from day to day. Before following it to its conclusion, it will be convenient to turn to another phase of this many-sided question. When the Imperial Conf erence met, the Naval rivalry between Japan and the United States of America-was an outstanding and disturbing feature of the International situation which we had to take into account. The effect upon a world greatly disorganized and groaning under the crushing burden imposed by the great war was most lamentable. That mad and suicidal competition in armaments, which mankind hoped would never be revived, seemed inevitable. On 21st June, at the second meeting of the Conference, and in my opening speech, which was published practically in extenso, I made the important suggestion to which I have already referred. I urged the Conference to set an example to the world by calling upon the nationsparticularly America and Japan -to meet, and discuss the abolition of armaments. Addressing the Prime Minister of Great Britain, I saidSpeak, therefore, on behalf of this gathering of Prime Ministers. Let us give the world, weary of war, and staggering beneath its crushing burdens, a lead. Invite the United States of America, Japan, and Prance to meet us. We cannot hope that the world will boat its sword into a ploughshare, but, at any rate, it can stop building more ships. Let us stop this naval construction, and naval expenditure, other than that necessary for the-maintenance of existing units without prejudice to what may be agreed upon hereafter. If the world resolves to stop making any further preparations for war, everything is possible; until that step is taken we are only beating the air. Such an invitation issued with such authority behind it, would, I think, find great suphonorable members of our geographical port in America, and I hope in Japan .too. . . . I do most strongly urge you to set an ex,, ample, speaking as you will be able to do on behalf, not merely of England, but on behalf of all those free nations whose representatives are gathered here. Let us show the world that these young nations gathered around this table have resolved to make their entrance into world politics by setting an example which the world long wanted. I am not without hopes that such an invitation on your part, and such an example on ours, would be provocative of great good, and prove to he the turning point in the world's history. islands; its population is increasing Three weeks later, President Harding issued his invitation to the Powers to a Conference on the limitation of armaments. comed this invitation with enthusiasm. And here I mention one fact which is most significant. Members of the Conference differed widely on many matters-o n the -Anglo-Japanese Treaty, the Constitution, naval defence-bu t upon disarmament and. the preservation of the world's peace there was complete and striking unanimity . I have said that I had suggested to Mr Lloyd George that we should invite the great Powers to meet to consider disarmament, but it is doubtful whether any other Power than the United States of America could have issued such an invitation with any hope of success. W it h the exception of America, the nations of the world, through their sacrifices in the war, were staggering under a burden of debt, and an invitation from any one of fchem would probably have been interpreted by the others as being merely an indication of financial and national weakness. I tur n now to the consideration of the Pacific problems as they affect Australia. The destiny of Australia lies in the Pacific. Through ignorance of the facts, or that too close familiarity which breeds indifference, there is danger that the Pacific problems of Australia, may not be understood or their vital importance appreciated. L e t me, therefore, set out the Tjosition. Before the war, the strategic centre of the world .was the North Sea. But the defeat of Germany, the re-grouping of the Central Powers, the collapse of Russia, Mr Bughes and, of course, the opening of the Panama Canal, have entirely changed the position. It is unnecessary for me to remind circumstances. We are a Pacifio power. As I have said, our destiny lies in the Pacific. And it is on this vast stage that the great world drama of the future is to be played. The Pacific Ocean is now what the North Sea onde was-the world's strategic centre. For us the Pacific problem is for all practical purposes the problem of Japan. Here is a nation with nearly 70,000,000 of ""people crowded together in narrow rapidly, and is already pressing upon the margin of subsistence. She wants room for her increasing millions of population, and markets for her manufacThe Imperial Conference weltured goods. And she wants both these very badly indeed. America and Australia say to her millions, "" Ye cannot enter in . "" Japan is then faced with the great problem which has bred wars since time began. For when tribes and nations of the past outgrew the resources of their own territory they moved on and on, hacking their way to the fertile pastures of their neighbours. But where are the overflowing millions of Japan to find room ? Noti n Australia; not in America. Well, where then ? This then is one problem. There remains the other. The 70,000,000 Japanese cannot possibly live except as a manufacturing nation. Their position is analogous to. that of Great Britain. To a manufacturing nation, overseas-markets are essential to its very existence. Japan sees across a narrow strip of water 400.000,000 Chinese gradually awakening to an appreciation of Western methods; and she sees in China the natural market for hex goods. She feels that her geographical circumstances give her a special right to the exploitation of the Chinese markets. But other countries want that market, too; and so comes the demand for the "" open door."" What is Japan to do? Do not forget that unless she is content to lie stagnant in a backwater she must have room to expand. And yet see what stands in her way. This is the problem of the Pacific-the modern riddle of the Sphinx, for which we must find an answer. Assuredly we shall not solve this problem by turning our backs upon it , by ignoring it . These things are real; they are hot mere words; not such stuff as dreams are' made of. And they cannot be dissolved by words, nor even by Conferences, unless these recognise facts, and are prepared to consider Japan's point of view as well as that of other nations. Talk about -disarmament is idle unless the causes of naval armaments are removed. It was for these reasons that I so strongly advocated a preliminary Conference or meeting to discuss the Pacific question. Addressing the American Luncheon Club on the 21st July, I saidTlie object of the Washington Conference is to get the great powers, and, in particular, -the great naval powers of America, Japan, and Britain, to agree to some basis for the limitation of armaments. The two naval powers that are. pushing on with great naval programmes are Japan and America. As Britain must necessarily maintain her position as a naval power, she will be compelled to keep pace with them unless an agreement is arrived at. One of the main reasons why America is increasing her Navy is the condition of affairs in the Pacific. Japan, of course, is a Pacific power. If an agreement is not arrived at in the Washington Conference, Britain will be compelled to build more ships than those already existing, and provided for. Therefore, unless, and until, the Pacific problem is settled, it is obvious that the prosvitation should be unequivocal, and that pect of the great naval powers coming to an agreement on a practicable scheme is remote. Therefore, we must have the Pacific Conference first. And on this Australia and New Zealand should be represented. These were the views that I ventured to representative was to remove every possubmit, to the Conference and, through sible obstacle from the path of the Washthe American press, to the people of ington Conference in order that it might America. I regret very much indeed that be attended with complete success. the American Government could not see its way to accept the suggestion. I am satisfied that it would have proved most has, as I have said, changed the situation, helpful. As I see it , the Disarmament the Pacific problems and, of course, the Conference cannot have practical results question of the renewal of the Treaty, unless and until a modus vivendi satisstill remained. This had not been defactory to Japan, America, and the finitely British Empire is arrived at. The proposal to hold a Pacific Conferthe Treaty, according to the B ritish ence received the unanimous: support of law officers, expired on 13th J u l y and' the Imperial Conference, and was conthat even if the three months extension sidered a.t great length, the negotiations were agreed to, a decision must be arspreading oyer several weeks. Asi t was rived, at before the Imperial Conference practically impossible for the Dominion disbanded, and before the Washington Prime Ministers to attend at Washington Conference began. in. November, it was at first suggested to the United States Government that the seemed threatened w i th an impasse. On Pacific meeting should be held in London. the one hand it was essential that we Subsequently, in order to remove any possible misconception' in the minds of the American statesmen, and to meet what was thought to be the American view, the Conference volunteered to attend a meeting on the American continent, when a friendly interchange of views might facilitate the work of the main Conference which was to follow. The British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, together with the Dominion Prime Ministers, were prepared to attend such a meeting. A f t e r negotiations had been in progress for some considerable time, it appeared that the American Government were not in favour of any preliminary meeting which might overshadow the Disarmament Conference, and that President Harding's reference to a preliminary discussion on Pacific questions had been misunderstood. The delegates to the Imperial Conference were greatly disappointed at the t u r n events had taken, for it was still felt that no Disarmament Conference could succeed u n t i l the Pacific problems were settled. As the American Government did not favour the idea, it was at once, but most regretfully, dropped. It was felt by the Imperial Conference that the acceptance of the President's in nothing should be done, directly or by suggestion, which might tend to injur e in the slightest degree the prospects of success at Washington. A t every stage the desire uppermost in the mind of every Although the Washington Conference settled, though a majority favoured a renewal. It was evident that The position was very difficult; we sliould do nothing that would give umbrage to America, nor prejudice the discussion on disarmament i u any way; and on the other hand it was imperative that some definite steps must be taken, otherwise the Treaty would expire before the Washington Conference began. It was at this stage that the matter was referred to the Lord Chancellor for an opinion, views having been expressed at the Conference that the presentation of the Note by B r it a in and Japan to the League of Nations was not an act of denunciation under article 6. If this interpretation wore correct the situation would, of course, be completely changed, and the urgency for deciding upon a policy in regard to the renewal no longer pressing. I cannot do better than present the position as it then was, and as it developed when the Lord Chancellor's decision was given as presented in the statement prepared for delivery in the House of Commons by Mr Lloyd George: The broad lines of Imperial Policy in the Pacific and the far East were the very first subject to w hich we addressed ourselves at the r meetings of the Imperial Cabinet, having a special regard to the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, the future of China, and the bearings of both of these questions on the relations of thc British Empire with the United States. We were guided in our deliberations by three main considerations. In Japan we have an old and proved ally; the agreement of twenty years standing between us has been of very great benefit not only to ourselves and to her, but to thc peace of the world. In China there is a very numerous people with great potentialities, who esteem our friendship highly, and whose interests we, on our side, desire to assist and advance. In the United States. we see to-day, as we have always seen, the people closest to our own aims and ideals with whom it is for us not only a desire and interest, but a deep-rooted instinct, to consult and cooperate. Those were the main considerations in our meetings, and upon them we were unanimous. The object of our discussions was to find a method combining all these three factors in a policy which would remove the danger of heavy Naval expenditure in the Pacific with all the evils which such an expenditure entails and to insure the development of all legitimate national interests in' the Par East. We have in the first place to ascertain our exact position in regard to the Anglo-Japanese Agreement. There has been much doubt as to whether the notification to the League of Nations made in July last constituted a denunciation of tlie Agreement in the sense of clause 6. If it did it would have been necessary to decide upon some interim measure regarding the Agreement pending further discussions with the other Pacific Powers, and Mr Bughes. negotiations with this object in view were in point of fact already in progress. If, on the other hand, it did not, the agreement would remain in force until denounced cither by Japan or ourselves, and would actually not be determined until twelve months from the date when notice of denunciation was given. The Japanese Government took the view that no notice of denunciation had been given. This view was shared by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but as considerable doubt existed, we decided, after a. preliminary discussion in the Imperial Cabinet, to refer the question to the Lord Chancellor, who considered it with the Law Officers of the Crown, and held that no notice of denunciation had yet been given. It follows that the Anglo-Japanese Treaty remains in force unless it is denounced, and will lapse only at the expiration of twelve months from the time notice of denunciation is given. It is, however, the desire of both the British Empire and Japan that the Agreement should be brought into complete harmony with the Covenant of the League of Nations, and that wherever the Covenant and the Agreement are inconsistent, the terms of the Covenant shall prevail. Notice to this effect has now been given to the League. This then is the position as it stands to-day. The Treaty is in force and w ill continue to operate u n t i l twelve months after the date on which either party gives notice of denunciation. So much for the Treaty. A word or two now to summarize the Pacific questions in relation to the Washington Conference. As I see it , it is impossible to Jiscuss disarmament without raising the principal phases of the Pacific question, and as we are vitally interested in many of these, Australia will not be directly represented at a Conference at which, if Pacific -problems are to be seriously discussed, questions vital to its welfare w ill be raised and possibly decided. It was a recognition of this fact, and of the settled determination of thrAustralian people to stand fast by their White Australia ideals-^to preserve them if possible by peace-that impelled me to insist so strenuously on a preliminary Pacific Conference.. Australia has much at stake. Peacei n the Pacific means more to her than to any other nation. Y e t u n t i l the causes of war are removed, talk about peace cannot be more than beating the air. Frankly, I see no hope for disarmament until the Pacific problems to which I have referred are settled, and this can only be done by a modus vivendi satisfactory to Japan, America, and Australasia. I come now to the last phase of the Pacific question with which I intend to deal at length-nava l defence. ' When I l e f t Australia, the two great Pacific Powers-Americ a and Japan-ha d announced huge naval building programmes, and had not disguised the fact that they were building against each other. This, coupled with the announcement of the British Prime Minister that Great Britain could no longer afford alone to maintain a fleet necessary for the safety of the Empire, was calculated to f ill every Australian with grave misgivings. A recital of our geographical circunjistances is surely quite unnecessary. safety depends on the British Navy, and not only on an undefeated Navy, but upon its capacity to strike at any threatened point. Before leaving Australia. I set out the position to honourable members as I saw it . I saidWe are confronted with a position grave in tlie extreme. What are we to do? What is our policy to be? We depend for our very existence on the maintenance of the control of the sea by Britain. Britain says she can no longer afford to maintain tlie Navy at its relative pre-war strength, and calls upon thei Dominions th© Disarmament Conference, and further to consider the question, and, presumably, to contribute their share. What are we going to do? The Conference has been called to consider the question. Upon its decision rests the Conference had concluded its labours. safety, the very ""existence, of the Commonwealth, ancl, indeed, of the Empire itself. Whatever may be agreed ujpon at the Washington Conference, one thing is clear -that we must have such naval defence as is adequate for our safety. Naturally, the amount of forefs necessary to insure our safety in a world which has agreed to suspend naval construction, a world in which the three great Naval Powers have, for example, come to such an understanding as would have the force and effect of an alliance, wonld be much less than in a world which resounds with the clang of the hammer beating into shape bigger and still bigger navies. That applies, too, to the renewal or the non-renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty; but in any case we must have such naval defence as is necessary for our security. The war and the Panama Canal have shifted the world's stage from the, Mediterranean and the Atlantic to the Pacific. The stage upon which the great world drama is to be played in the future is in the Pacific. The American Navy is now in those waters. Peacei n the Pacific means peace for this Empire and for the world. W it h an agreement between three great Naval Powers, or at worse between twothen the force necessary to defend this Empire by sea would be much less. But whatever "" it is we must have it . A very clear and comprehensive statement of the Naval requirements of the Empire was laid before the PrimeM in i ster by Lord Beatty, the First Sea Lord. This was supplemented by statements on the military side from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, and by A i r Marshal SirH . M . Trenchard, Chief of the A i r Staff. Australia's After a general discussion on Imperial defence, the strategical position was considered by the Prime Ministers and Lord Beatty. The Conference having all the facts before it , and after most careful consideration of the whole field of foreign and I m perial politics, decided that the Empire must have a Navy at least equal to that of any other Power. Before th© discussion on Naval and Military Defence could be concluded; President Harding issued his invitation to consideration of Imperial Defence was postponed until after the Washington The following resolution was agreed to: That while recognising the necessity of cooperation among the various portions of the Empire to provide such naval defence as may prove to be essential for security, and while holding that equality with the naval strength of any of the powers is a minimum standard for that purpose, this Conference is of the opinion that' the method and expense of such co-operation are matters for the final determination of the several Parliaments concerned, and that any recommendation, therefore, should be deferred until after thc coming Conference on disarmament has concluded its labours. On the question of air and military defence, steps nectessary to insure co-opera-' tion in the Military and A i r Defence of the Empire were considered. Nothing done at the Conference involves the Commonwealth in any financial obligation. I leave now questions of foreign policy, the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, and the Washington Disarmament Conference, on one side, and come, to a matter of a very different kind, but of vital importance. I mean the Constitutional Conference Contemplated when the recent Conference.was summoned. H o n o r a b l e members w ill recall t h a t a t t h e I m p e r i a l W a r Conference, in 1917, a t w h i c h A u s t r a l i a was not represented, a resolution was passed a p p r o v in g t h e summ o n in g of a special Conference as soon as possible a f t e r t h e w ar to consider t h e c o n s t it u t i o n a l relations between t h e component parts of t h e E m p i r e . As I stated before I l e f t A u s t r a l i a , it was not proposed a t t h e recent Conference to do more t h a n deal w it h t h e agenda for t h is pro posed C o n s t it u t i o n a l Conference, w h i c h was to be h e l d in 1922. The re was some danger, however, t h a t the c o n s t it u t i o n a l question once raised by discussion of t h e agenda, a n d on procedure, m i g h t e x t e n d over t h e whole f i e l d , a n d reof self-government enjoyed by independent s u l t in substantive changes in t h e Const it u t i o n . As is w e l l k n o w n to honourable members, I have always opposed a Const it u t i o n a l Conference, considering it b o t h unnecessary and u n w is e ; a n d I took t h e earliest o p p o r t u n it y of settin g o u t . m y views before t h e Conference. Suggestions made by some of t h e D o m in i o n representatives a t t h e Conference filled m e w it h apprehension as to w h a t m i g h t happen if a C o n s t it u t i o n a l Conference were held. I , therefore, strongly opposed it I said no Conference was necessary; t h a t to meddle w it h t h e C o n s t it u t i o n was the surest way to dismember t h e E m p i r e . As the m a t t e r is of v e r y great importance, it is necessary t h a t I should quote from my speech to t h e Conference: It has been suggested that a Constitutional Conference should be held next year. It may be that I am very dense, but I am totally at a loss to understand what it is that this Constitutional Conference proposes to do. I s it that the Dominions are seeking new powers, or is the Conference to draw up a declaration of rights, to set down in black and white the relations between Great Britain and the Dominions? What is'the Conference to do? What is the reason for calling it together? I know, of course, the terms of the resolution of the 1917 Conference. under the bridges since then. Surely this Con. ference is not intended to l i m it the rights we now have. Yet, what new right, what further extension of power, can it give us? What is there that we cannot do now? What limitation is now imposed upon the self-governing powers of the Dominions? What can they not do, even to encompass their own destruction by sundering the bonds that bind them to the Empire? What yet do they lack? Canada has asserted her rights to make Treaties. She has made Treaties. She is asserting her right to ap* point an Ambassador at Washington. these the marks of Slave States or of quasi sovereignty? In what essential thing does any one of the great self-governing Dominions differ from inMr Hughes. dependent nations? It is true that there is a sentiment, a figment, a few ancient forms; there is what Sir P. Pollock calls a figment of the right of the British Parliament to make laws affecting the Dominions. Supposing the British Parliament should make a law tomorrow which would take from me the very position in which I now stand, namely, a representative of a Parliament that exists and was brought into existence by a Britisli Statute. Such legislation would apply to all of us. No one can deny the British Parliament has power to pass such a law; and if it did, as far as legal or constitutional status is concerned, we should have ceased to exist.' But, as Sir P. Pollock says, this power of the British Parliament is a figment, a shadow. Britain still has the power to pass such laws, only upon the condition that she does not exercise it . In effect, then, the Dominions have all the rights nations. What more. do they desire ? What more can be given them? Either, then, this* Constitutional Conference must limit the rights of self-government, or weaken the bonds of Empire, or simply content itself with a declaration of rights that are ours already, and that none can question. That being the position, what is the Constitutional Conference to do? The proposal is causing considerable anxiety, at any rate in Australia. So far from anticipating that it is going to give us greater powers, somo fear that it w ill take away some of the powers we have, and my difficulty is, and has been, to t r y to allay those doubts, which are strongly held. Tlie difference between the status of the Dominions now and twenty-five years ago is very great. We were Colonics, we became Dominions. We have been accorded the status 1 of nations. We have achieved this wonderful progress along certain lines-ar e we not satisfied witli the progress made? Our progress in material greatness has kept pace w it h our constitutional development. Cannot those v ho desire this Constitutional Conference be satisfied? Let us leave well alone. That is my advice. We have now on the agenda-paper matters which mark a new era in Empire government. We, the representatives of the Dominions, are met together to formulate a foreign policy for the Empire. What greater advance is conceivable? What remains to us? I know of But much water has run no power that the Prime Minister of Britain has that* any of the Prime Ministers of the Dominions have not. Our presence here round this table, the agenda-paper before us, the basis of equality on which we meet, these things speak in trumpet tones that this Federation of free democratic nations which men call the Britisli Empire is, as Mr Lloyd George said yesterday, a living force. Speaking later t p a proposal to l ay d o w n certain principles by w h i c h t h e for e i gn policy of the E m p i r e should be decided, AreI saidI do hope we sharl not attempt to do anything that w ill fetter onr rights to discuss these things on their merits, and that we shall not attempt to limit our freedom of action by reducing the Constitution to writing. Such a course can only have the effect of making the relations that exist between the different parts of the Empire impossible. The moment you set down what Britain can do, and what the Dominions can do, it becomes at once apparent that if both insist upon exercising their powers to their uttermost limit, there is an end to the Empire. It is only by wise restraint, by refraining from exercising our undoubted rights as self governing communities, that an Empire such as ours, which rests on two conflicting principles-autonom y of the parts,'and unity of the whole-ca n endure we have been cast in the .same mould and bred in tlie same constitutional environment, that we have exercised our privileges with that restraint without which this Empire cannot continue to exist. We had been asked to subscribe to a postulate which laid it down as a' hardand-fast rule that in deciding foreign policy "" in spheres in which any Dominion is peculiarly concerned, the view of that Dominion must be given a weight commensurate with the importance of the decision to that Eominion."" This meant that in determining foreign policy we were to be guided by this postulate, and not, as now, by the merits of the case and by consideration for the welfare of the Empire as a whole. Speaking on this proposal, which I had opposed very strongly-no t because I did not believe in its application as an argument, but only because I declined to be bound by it as an ironbound, principleI saidTlie other day, we listened to an admirable statement of the case for the Indians in South Africa. I ask those who wish us to be guided by postulates, and by a writton Constitution, to answer this question, Is the voice of India in this ca$e to prevail; and if not, why not? If it is to prevail, what has General Smuts to say? Who is to decide between the representatives of South Africa and India? If any authority can decide, then it is this Council. But we cannot decide save by their consent. There is no written Constitution, no binding laws or code which limit their rights. Tlie Empire is united only because every member of it is free to go its own way. But if we once lay down this or any principle in writing, it must prevail. Sastri, know perfectly well what this would mean. General Smuts knows that the authority of this Council, if it has any, can now only be applied if the parties agree. But if we lay down principles, the position will be fundamentally different. What would he say if we attempted to coerce him? And how can each part have complete autonomy when sdme authority superior -to themselves can impose its will upon them? I went on to ask if any amendment of our constitutional relations that could be affected by a Conference, could give us greater power than we now have? I invite those of my colleagues who desire this Constitutional Conference to tell me what it is we cannot now do. I have said we cannot make treaties with foreign countries, so that if they want to make a Treaty with a foreign countryI am sure they do not, and am only taking that as an illustrationI say they can-' It is because not do it as a nation within the Empire. That is the constitutional position; but, apart from that, where are the limitations upon our authority ? What is it we cannot do? When I am told that we need more power, and there is something the Dominions have not got, I want to know what there is of substance that we yet lack. I know of nothing, but if there is anything in whioh we f a l l short of greatness, let us see what it is, examine, and, if necessary, grant it . But we ought not to be asked to agree to a Constitutional Conference Unlessi t can be shown that it will give us some advantage we do not enjoy, some real thing which we do not possess, and which cannot be given here and now. I do not believe that there is any such thing. I am against a Constitutional Conference; it is not only unnecessary, it is dangerous. I am very strongly opposed to any attempt to reduce the Constitution to w r it in g ; I am against any flamboyant declaration of rights. The chief glory of our Constitution is its elasticity; under it nothing is impossible; under it we have already received everything we need as a self-governing nation. What we have become, what we are, we owe to this Constitution-thi s most wonderful, flexible, and efficient instrument of free government that the world has ever known. It is as boundless as freedom itself; it has no limitations. And where there are no limits, disputes about the ambit of power cannot enter in . I asked the Conference not to forget that the rock on which our house But General Smuts, and Mr rests is u n it y ; I said that we must at our peril reconcile automony of the parts with this unity of the whole; that both are essential-the one to our freedom, the other to our safety-that the Constitution, as we know it , evolved by our changing circumstances, reconciles these two inconsistent principles of unity and autonomy; and that it does this because there is nothing that limits the freedom of has dealt with' great affairs of vital in action of any of its parts, nothing is forterest to the Commonwealth, the Empire, bidden to us, we are all free to take our and the whole world. own road, and, knowing that we are free to separate, we deliberately choose to reon the 27th A p r i l .

The centre of Empire may, indeed, come East; for who can set a limit to the growth of our own country?

I notice, in connection with the estimates of the Postmaster-General's Department for additions, new works, and buildings, that the expenditure this financial year will be considerably less than it was last year Last year it was £940,917, and the estimated expenditure for this year is £823,506, a reduction of £117,411 . I believe in economy being practised wherever possible; but I do not think this is an instance where expenditure should be curtailed, because that is being done principally at the expense of the country districts. The Postmaster-General( Mr. Wise) knows very well that residents in the country have been placed at a great disadvantage, as numerous applications for telephonic connection by country residents have been awaiting attention for a ' considerable time. Applicants have been informed that the Department has been unable to comply with the requests made because money was not available for the purpose. It was urged some time ago that the war was laxgely responsible for the delay, and consequently honourable members did not press the matter too strongly, because they realized that we were passing through a difficult period. That time has, however, passed, and we have now reached the stage when the Postmaster-General's Department should be in a position to deal w it h the applications which have been standing in abeyance for so long. We still have to carry many of the responsibilities that were incurred during the war period; but when we find that the amount allotted for telephonic connexions is to be reduced, it is time strong objections were raised. According to the figures before us, only £750,000 has been set aside for I think we should this purpose. The Treasurer ( Sir JosephA r e men going to sea in a that the amount of £750,000 is to be page 400, doubti n that respect ? know, further, whether it is the intention of the Department to expedite the granting of facilities to people in the more remote country districts. TheM in ister is aware that there are thousands of applicants throughout Australia-it applies to every State and to every electorate-wh o have been unable to be connected by telephone because the money or material was not available. During the war period, material could not be supplied in sufficient quantity, and of course the financial position d i d not warrant too heavy an expenditure in this direction. We are now in a different position, and if we cau afford to increase our expenditure to almost £1,000,000 in other directionsparticularly in connection with Defencesurely it is unfair to cut down the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department, because that branch of the Seryice is of the greatest importance to the people of this country, and of greater value than expenditure on Def ence at the present juncture. Tho proposed military expenditure has been dealt w it h by other honourable members, and the votes in this connection w ill , I understand, be debated later. It is very unfair to reduce the expenditure of such an important public Department, and at the same time considerably increase the expenditure for Defence purposes We must not lose sight of the fact that the facilities enjoyed through the Post Office cost much more now than they did prior to the war, as we have 2d. instead of .

When we begin to feel the pinch, this Department is not the first in which reductions should be made, particularly when the proposed expenditure is to be less than it was last year. Notwithstanding the fact that thousands of applications are awaiting attention, the Government intend curtailing expenditure in this important branch of the Service, which w ill naturally interfere considerably w i th those living in country districts. Frequent reference has been made to the necessity of encouraging immigration to the Commonwealth, and to the desirableness of settling a larger number of our own people on the l a n d ; but if we do not provide the residents in rural districts w i th facilities for getting into touch with the main centres of population, we cannot expect land settlement to be successful. Many settlers are not within reasonable reach of railway communication, and some of them have not even a coach service. In these circumstances, we should be prepared to provide them with telephonic connection, as such services are not only necessary to enable them to transact business expeditiously, but are' imperative in the case"" of sickness, so that medical, attendance can be summoned in the shortest possible time. Under present conditions, some rural settlers cannot secure the services of a doctor under a day or two, but w i th proper telephonic communication the time would be reduced by one-half. This matter is of vital importance to those living in country districts, and whatever we may do in reducing expenditure in other directions, we ought to pay careful attention to the legitimate needs of the community. reducing expenditure in a Department which has been niggardly dealt w it h for a number of years, and particularly one which has shown a surplus during the last five or six years. This year the revenue did not come up to expectations. Dr. increased charges. something to do w i th it . Now that the war is over, and our fighting men have returned, the overseas mail matter has been enormously reduced, and, in consequence, the revenue must be less. Whatever the reasons may be, the fact remains that we are not justified in reducing the expenditure in the Post and Telegraph Department before facilities have been provided for people in the country getting into close touch w i th the main centres of population. There is legitimate grounds for complaint as to the reduced expenditure. Had the vote been somewhere near the. amount on the Estimates for last year, there would not have been so much room for criticism, but even last year honourable member's were complaining that it was insufficient. did not spend the whole of it by a long way. trouble.

Hitherto there has not been a fair proportion of the money available expended on country telephonic extensions, and I think the Minister should let us know how the vote is to be allocated this year. I am not prepared to go on passing Estimates in which one section of the people secures greater concessions in this respect than other sections. A ny suggestion to expend the vote in city and country districts in proportion to population would be unfair to the country districts, because they are sparsely populated, and the construction of telephonic and telegraphic lines there is naturally more costly than in metropolitan areas. share in the prosperity of the cities. might reply to my honourable friend by saying that the country people make the cities.' That is the position. that both have their place in our national life. that they do not. All I am saying is that there should be a fair proportion of this expenditure in the country districts, and I think the Minister should make a statement as to the intention of the Government in this respect. I join with the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) in the view that country districts should get a fair deal in connection with telephonic and postal expenditure generally. The Estimates, as presented to us to-day, are really a travesty of what Estimates should be. When one remembers what happened last year, one realizes that the presentation of these Estimates is simply a farce. Last year the House readily passed £147,000 for work in connection with the various post It is well known to honourable offices, and additions to our telephonic services, but during the whole of the year only £27,904 was expended in providing, these facilities, chiefly in country districts, and for which the agitation had been going on since before the war. We also find Y o u are making a misthat the Government turned a certain amount of revenue over from the PostalW e always get that Department to the Treasury, and then boasted about being able to complete the year w it h a surplus of £893,000, of which £120,000, representing the unexpended constituency; vote last year for postal services, was a portion. During all this time we were told that there were no funds available to go on with these necessary works. Three post offices in my own division are really a disgrace to any civilized country. of course, that require attention, but these three have been down in the Estimates for years. The position is much the same in other districts. I was in Mildura during the summer months, and I can assure honourable members it is scandalous that public servants, or anybody else, whether white or black, should be obliged to work under such undesirable conditions in the hot sultry summer weather. Similar conditions obtain in post offices in our But the country people humid coastal towns in the north, and I say that to carry out a policy of economy by neglecting these necessary works is staiting at the wrong end altogether, especially when the Postal Department is being used to enormously increase the revenue by means of the ^ d . increase in the postal rate, and subsequently the second \ d . for war revenue purposes, though the I am not arguing latter increase is likely to defeat the end in view because it has resulted in a falling off in business. The same difficulties are reported in connection w i th our telephonic service. This year £750,000 is provided for telephones which are urgently needed throughout the Commonwealth, especially in country districts. But what is the position ? The Government can get plenty of copper wire fro m a local company, who are prepared to manufacture if they can get continuous contracts. other day that the Department had no wire in the New South Wales stores. prised at that, and I suggest that the time has come to put an end to all this trouble in connection with the Postal Department.",43,Earle Page Probabl Y Owing To That This Particular Matter Vitally Con

117,Dr. Earlepage,"I am not surFrom the inception of Federation, the Department has been the Cinderella of the whole of the Commonwealth Services, and has been starved, notwithstanding that it has been able to show a surplus. The present system is breaking down. If there is one thing that denotes civilize tion, it is the effectiveness of a country's communications, and if there isi on© thing that encourages people to settle in outback-districts it is the facilities that are provided to enable them to keep in touch with their fellow-men. What drives men, especially married men, off country holdings, is inability to readily obtain medical assistance when the need for it arises. It should be the first aim of the Government to correct the deficiencies in our means of commiinication. The time has come when Parliament should prevent the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department from being dependent on the whim of the Government, according as it may choose to bring in the Estimates in the first or the eleventh month of the year. The affairs of the Department should be conducted like those of a private business firm. I might refer to a couple of telephone lines on the north coast of New South Wales. needed line between Glenreagh and South Grafton was not erected because it would have cost £ 1 , 1 0 0 ; but, in my opinion, it would have been better to expend the available amount of £700 in erecting a portion of the line, finishing it the next year with an expenditure of £400, than to spend the money on another work which was not nearly so urgent. is a pity that the control of much expenditure in the Post and Telegraph Department is in the hands of in dependent authorities, because this necessarily causes delays and prevents useful work from being done. come when th© whole system; should be changed.

Since the replacement of the old coaches by motor cars we find hundreds of people travelling where the traffic was formerly very small. In the same way the provision of telephonic communication would create a demand for the service, and 20 to 30 per cent, would be returned on* the outlay. It is remarkable that the control of postal construction should be in the hands of a Department other than that of the Postmaster General. When trouble arises in the spending of money allotted, by Parliament, we have to go to three or four Departments before we can get satisfaction. I have been unable to learn why the Wing ham Post Office, which is in the New South Wales list of post offices to be constructed, has not been gone on with. Tenders for it were called nearly a year ago. In the first place, we were told A much that certain additions had been asked for. I saw practically every man in the locality, and was informed that additions had not been asked for locally at all. The additions must have been p ut in by the Department itself. A t any rate, that was the excuse. Subsequently the reason given for not proceeding with the work was that the Department' had It not the necessary money. It is useless to pass these Estimates if the Government does not intend to construct the works for which we vote the money. We should not pass sham Estimates. The time has that it would be false economy to curtail expenditure in connection with the Postal Department by withholding the facilities needed in outlying districts. W© are merely repeating now what was said in this Chamber on many occasions last year.

124,Mr Bell (Darwin) [ 3 . 0 ],"I agreecopies of replies received in various districts from the Deputy Postmaster-General for Tasmania that the telephonic extensions asked for could not be granted owing to lack of funds. I want to know from the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) if it is a fact that he has not been given the money he required to provide these extensions, or was the promise which the Treasurer gave the House last year to hold merely for a few months 1 It was stated at that time that the policy of the Government was to give facilities to outlying districts, and to grant the communication which this afternoon the Leaders of the Labour party and the Country party have said are most necessary. 'Nothing will do more to develop our unpopulated centres than the provision of facilities for communication. on this subject just prior to the adjournment, I stated that it was not only the people who received the extensions who benefited, but all those already connected by telephone, because it must be remembered that there are two ends to every telephone line. people alone who reap the advantage of a telephone extension, but every business man in the adjacent towns; so there is no conflict between city and country interests in this matter. The extensions are required, not in and around the cities, but in the outlying districts. Last year some £750,000 was voted for buildings, and it remains unexpended, merely to permit of a false surplus being shown, I cannot help blaming the Postal Department for this, because, when money had been made available by Parliament, there was no reason why the buildings provided for should not have been constructed. This applies to practically every electorate in the Commonwealth. brought home to me because certain post office buildings in my own district have not been proceeded with. Last year, for instance, £2,000 was provided for the Ulverstone post-office, and, although I have approached the Postmaster-General regarding it on several occasions, it was not until a few weeks ago that tenders were called for the building. I was told that the Works Department had prepared estimates for the work, and that the matter had been sent on to the State authorities; but the result is that £2,000 has been carried forward unexpended. amount has been put on the Estimates again this year, but the building should have been erected long ago. I shall not Mr Bell. say that the present structure is a disgrace, but it is inadequate. Although we have the assurance of the Treasurer that money will be provided as the Postmaster General requires it, we find that works are held up simply to produce a false surplus. Por this the Department itself must carry the blame. Will the Postmaster-General tell us whether he is now being furnished with the funds that, in his opinion, are necessary to give the telephonic extensions provided for in these Estimates? He is anxious to run this Department on lines that will be satisfactory to the people. AlthoughI am one of those who "" preach "" economy, I hold that it is not economy to starve the Postal Department. I do not want to Speaking draw distinctions between one Department and another, but if the Postal Department is not given the money that the Postmaster-General requires, then I , for one, am not going to give my vote to provide funds for certain other Departments. There are many ways in which we can It is not the country reduce expenditure. I want telephonic extensions in my district. That is putting it plainly, and if the Postmaster General cannot provide them, I am not going to agree to unnecessary expenditure in other directions. The people are prepared to pay for increased postal facilities. They do not want to reduce expenditure on means of communication. I have been fearful for some time, because the cry for economy is rather popular with the Government, that this particular Department would be attacked when the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) turned his attention to the general question of economy. I intend The matter 'ia not only to enter my protest, as I am doing now, but also to record my vote against money being expended in other directions. I hope the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) will be good enough' to tell us what the position is from his point of view. Is he able to give us these telephone extensions? I pass over the question of new post-office buildings. Although they are needed, they are not so important as the lengthening of our telephone lines. Unless he is in a . position to say that he can give immediately the That extensions that his Department feels are justified, I will not support the Treasurer's Estimates. If the Postmaster General will give the assurance that we require it will clear the air very much. agree with those honorahle memhers who are taking their stand against the curtailment of postal and telephonic facilities. It has heen noticeable ever since Federation that the one Department that has not had the attention that it deserves has been the Postal Department. A ll through the war period we had the ex-Postmaster-General( Mr Webster) complaining that the annual profits of his Department went into the general revenue, and that the Post Oflice was not allowed to make use of them. The Post Office was starved during that period. Instead of the Department buying material when it was cheap, and when it had the money to do so, it waited until material could not be procured, no matter what it was prepared to pay for it. With regard to the construction of new (buildings and the repair of existing buildings, almost all the items on this year's Estimates appeared on last year's Estimates, and the votes were not expended last year. scheme the officers of the Department might have for extending the facilities of the Post Office, the "" k n if e "" prevented regard to the future defence of this counthem giving effect to it. There is nothing new upon the Estimates in respect to new works and buildings. I re-echo the statement that in every part of the CommonwealthI can speak more particularly of the circumstances in my own electorate, where there are hundreds of applicants for telephones-the one reply that applicants for telephone extensions receive from the Department is^ "" No material available.'' I venture to say that if mittee would have been wise if it had you were to search the departmental premises throughout New South Wales you 0 would find the.stores empty, although copper wire-drawing works in the State cannot get orders from the Government. This is a position to which the Committee should give some attention, because, of all the Departments under the control of the Commonwealth Government, none affects the interests of the people of this country so much as the Postal Department, with its telephone system. It is part of the every-day life of the people, and is an adjunct to their business, whether in the country or the city; it is in every sense of the word a real, live agent for all business concerns. more expeditiously the Post Office can meet the needs of the producers and the business people of the community the better it will be for Australia. While the Post Office is being starved the Government has the audacity to ask the Committee to vote thousands upon thousands of pounds to increase the expenditure on the Defence Forces. there. There is no increase; works and everything else included, the expenditure this year is £25,000 less than it was last year. right enough in. one sense. There is less expenditure in respect of works, I admit; but look at the general Estimates. general Estimates and everything, there is less expenditure this year than last year. is as the Minister states, surely, after all No matter what we have gone through during the last five or six years, we can afford to rest a little until we know what our mind is in try. It seems that the Defence Department is the one Department upon which money can always be lavished, while the Departments furnishing true services to the country are starved. There are buildings used for the accommodation of Post Office employees that are a positive disgrace to the.community. In many cases they are insanitary. Yet the policy of starvation continues. I think the Comsent the Estimates back for the Government to recast, with a view to providing the facilities that the people want. rather pleasing to see the non-party spirit in which this matter has been dealt with. The discussion should make it evident to the Minister controlling the Postal Department that he has the sympathy of this Oommittee in the expenditure of money to provide increased postal services, subject, of course, to the money being wisely expended. It seems to be the general impression of this Committee that the spending of money in this way is certainly, no contravention of the principle of The economy.

During war time we increased our postage rate for a special Alpurpose, but it has been found that the 2d. postage rate and the increased railway fares and freights are, as a matter of fact, producing a lower revenue than was derived from the lower rates.

Stilli t is deplorable that day after day we should get replies from this Department, which seems to be the most, conservative 'of them all, that funds cannot be found to provide telephonic communication for some isolated place. I have always said that the Post and Telegraph Department should not be expected to pay at all, because I regard it as a great civilizing agency. We are on the wrong track in continuing the 2d. postage rate, and as a consequence .of it many business men in the cities find that it pays, them better to deliver their letters than to post them.. It represents a substantial tax also upon settlers in isolated places. make inquiries he will find that there is no country in the world that has not increased its revenue from postage within three, years after changing from a 2d. to a Id. rate. there has. been no material increase in population, and it demonstrates that any postage rate above Id"", is resented by the people generally. The Postmaster-General is a representative of a country district, as-1 am myself, and he knows how every increase in postal and telephonic facilities is appreciated in country districts. There should be a telephone in every house in the country, and if the system were thus popularized we could afford to allow the subscribers six free calls a day, and charge them l d , for every additional call. I notice the Postmaster General smiles. It is the policy of the Postal Department to smile at any progressive proposal.

The Committee should be told whether the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) spoke correctly when he said that the Treasury was open to the Postmaster-General. I know that the sympathies of the Postmaster General are with the people living in isolated places, but he should take a bold stand. Last year the finances showed a If the Postmaster-General will surplus of £6-000,000; how much better a position would the Postmaster-General be in to-day if he had been able to spend £500,000 of that surplus onnecessary works and servico? I am. told that the mamrfacturers of copper wire in New This has occurred where South Wales cannot get a market for their commodity, although it can be bought almost as cheaply as the galvanized iron wire which the Department has imported. If that is true* the importation of galvanized iron wire is outrageous. The best policy would be to appoint three business men to conduct the Postal Department, but not to operate it as a commercial concern. Penny postage is the proper policy for this country; the re-introduction of 2d. postage was a retrograde step, as has been proved by the fact that the revenue of the Department is decreasing. Not only is the Postmaster-General losing revenue, but he is inconveniencing the public, and penalizing the residents in the back-blocks. The men and women who conduct allowance post-ofiices have been paid at the rate of £5 per annum for their services, and' we are told that that amount : is being cut down because of the insufficiency of the revenue from this' source. Realizing what cheap communication means to this country,, we should insist upon the Government restoringpenny postage. The CHAIRM AN (Hon. j ; TS..

133,Mr Austi N Chapman,"The Deing your direction, Mr Chairman, I shall defer any further remarks until the general Estimates are before the Committee. during an election campaign, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( MrI would like to know who gave instrucAustin Chapman) ""were to advocate penny postage, a telephone in every house, and six free calls per day-as he did on one occasion in this House-n o other candidate would have a chance against him. A feature about the Estimates which strikes me as peculiar is that a large proportion of the sums voted by Parliament in previous years for postal and telephonic works is unexpended. I notice that last y/sar Parliament sanctioned an expenditure on postal buildings in New South Wales of £44,671, of which only £6,921 was spent. The amount voted for Victoria was £41,251, of which £7,537 was spent, and for Queensland £10,640, of which £2,509 was spent. Several times during the last twelve months I have asked the Department to carry out certain works in my constituency, and have been told that no money was available. If that answer was true, what is the meaning of these unexpended balances? It seems to me that although postal and telephonic works are most urgently needed, they .fare worse than any others. I remind the Country party that during the first ten years of Federation the Postal Department was literally starved, and it was not until the advent of a Labour Government in 1910 that the Department received anything like justice. The Treasurer of the day provided £3,000,000 for postal and telephonic services, but that was not nearly sufficient to make up the leeway, and I fear that the situation amounts to a reflection upon the present Postmaster-General( Mr Wise). The position is the same to-day as it has been for years past. the Department has always been starved by every Liberal and Nationalist Government. If the Country party desire to bring about progressive government they must change their tactics and vote for the elevation to the Ministerial benches of members selected from this side of the House. Honourable members who have any knowledge of the city of Sydney must know that the General Post Office is the most overcrowded postal building in the Commonwealth. Asi t stands to-day it is a discredit to the Government, and to previous Governments. The question of additions and alterations has been submitted to the"" Public Works Committee. tions for the architectural preparation of a monstrosity of a plan for those alterations. The proposal to which I refer is to take the building up thirteen stories. Presumably, persons who want to buy a penny stamp will have to travel thirteen floors before they can post a letter. I know something about building construction. The lifts necessary to conduct the business of the General Post Office, when it has been altered according to the plans just indicated, will occupy very considerable space on each floor. The outside walls of the present structure will not support extensive alterations and additions. That was proved by Mr Barnett, architect for the New South Wales Government, about twenty-five years ago. If a structure of thirteen stories is to be built over the present General Post Office the ' contractors will be compelled to rear from the foundations numbers of inside columns in order to carry the weight and provide for inevitable vibration; and, to do that, those pillars, or columns, will have to be from 4 to 5 feet in diameter. I would like to know who is answerable for placing such a project before the Public Works Committee. The congestion and inadequate accommodation in the Sydney Post Office could be overcome by the purchase of land at the rear of the General Post Office block through to King-street. The cost would not be abnormal; the buildings at present on the site are unsuitable and inadequate to the central nature of so valuable a block. The purchase price would be almost as nothing compared with the expense of constructing thirteen-story alterations. What has been proposed is, Indeed, in effect, to pour two quarts of water into a quart pot. The present building will not carry the additions. I have taken a deep interest in the subject. I got the president of the Architects Association in Sydney to assist and advise me, and to take action by making representations in the course of evidence given before the Public Works Committee. In addition to the Sydney architects, I am supported",49,Earle Page Probabl Y Owing To That This Particular Matter Vitally Con

135,Mr West (East Sydney) [3.41],"If,in my plea for common-sense handling of the difficulty by the chairman and members of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce. There is one other subject to which' I propose briefly to allude. I refer to the installation of the automatic telephone system in the city of Sydney. The project has been under consideration for six or seven years, but at present the whole position seems to be in a muddle. One Sydney firm received notice that it would be connected w i th the automatic system, and it spent about £900 in alterations to its premises in order to be prepared for the modern installation. That, was five years ago, but, so far, no further word has been received from the Postmaster' General's Department. The value of the complete installation of the automatic system in Sydney would be enormous; probably one half of the present annual costs, under the keyboard system, would be saved. Here, then, is an opportunity to economize, seeing that there would be a' direct saving without any loss of efficiency, and certainly without any deprivation of public privileges. the Postmaster-General w ill do something in the directions I have suggested. I know the excuse is made that the necessary material cannot be obtained, but if the Department were serious in the matter, most of the instruments connected with the telephone system could be manufactured at the Shaw Wireless Workshop which has been taken over by. the Government. There may be some difficulty in obtaining soft steelI am informed the difficulties have been overcome-bu t brass, zinc, timber, and' copper and there is only required some i m provement in the insulating process. There seems to be no one who has any keen desire to use Australian goods, so* accustomed has the Department been to the ordering of material from places thousands of miles away. In this regard there ought to be a better spirit inculcated, not only in the case of officials, but of honourable members themselves; and if such a spirit were created and found expression in action, all our present troubles w i th the Post Office would be obviated, and this House would be relieved of continuous complaints. cease merely making speeches in the House, and do something definite. W h a t [465]2 is the use of our passing Estimates if the money is not spent? The Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) may talk about saving the country by showing a surplus, but any one can have a surplus if he keeps his money in his pocket. Tasmania and m South Australia are the only two States for which any money is to be voted for the year 1921-22. If there was no money in the Treasury which could be spared for such works, I should say no more; but I know that money must be available, or thesevotes would not appear on the Estimates. amendment ? member the amendment I should like to propose, I am sure he would not agree with it . In any case, there is no hope of . a change of Government in Australia. years the Government have been doing nothing, and doing it dashed w e l l ! . Moreover, those with whom the honourable member is associated are for economy, I hope because of their fear of extra taxation. Personally, I do not fear extra taxation, for money, properly spent, is put in circulation and tends to the prosperity of the country. This was shown in the case of every loan raised during the war The unemployment question is acute, and Parliament will have to do something by way of a remedy if discontent is to be allayed.

140,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime MinisHonora'ble members on this side of the Chamber have made representations to me to the effect that they were under the impression that the House. would not meet until Wednesday next, and, consequently, had made arrangements to proceed to the other States to fulfil engagements there. I would like to point out that honourable members who return at the week-ends to other States find business awaiting them when they arrive in Sydney or Adelaide on the Saturday morning, spend each Monday on various interviews., and really require the Tuesday in order to complete any matter in hand. What we do in this House does not represent all that honourable ""members have to do. A great deal has been said about honourable members being killed through being compelled to sit here four days a week and travel backwards and for'wards on the other days. Yet the Government apparently propose to continue that slaughter. work here would be done justas speedily by a reversion to the old system of sitting three days a week. The State Parliament does not sit four days a week. Why should we do so, who have to travel 1,200 miles each weekto attend got through just as quickly by sitting for the sittings of the House? cannot get home at all at the week-end. Let us get the business through straight away by sitting five days a week. Sundays also, I suppose? I am not prepared to do that, and if the House meets on Tuesday next I will not be here. --There was a general impression among honourable members that the House would not meet next week until Wednesday, and mostof us have made arrangements to return to our own States for this week-end ister and Attorney-General) [4.2] I at least.

Therefore, I shall vote, if it be necessary to do so, to meet their wishes in regard to meeting on Wednesdays, but I want those honourable members who can get to their homes at the week-end to have some consideration for those who live in far distant States. If we may conclude our work by sitting for an extra day a week towards the end of the session, I want them to do so. not think that it is fair to place on the shoulders of honourable members opposite the whole of the onus for submitting the request that the House meet on WednesI am sure that our day next instead of Tuesday. I want to add my little support to it. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) will bear me out when I say that the extra sitting day did not help very much in the discussion of the Tariff. We would have three days a week, because, to a great extent, the additional day was wasted in anticipatory talk, and, as it were, in oiling the machine for the following day's work. I intend to vote for meeting on Wednesday. I hope that honourable members generally will agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Foley) in extending consideration to representatives of South Australian and New South Wales constituencies. I am sure an extra day to devote to their offices would be very acceptable to Ministers: have heard sufficient to satisfy me that the majority of honourable members do not wish to meet next Tuesday, and, in order that what we may do to-day may not prejudice what may be done next week, I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Wednesday next, at 3 p.m. Question resolved in the affirmative.",51,Tuesday Sittings
