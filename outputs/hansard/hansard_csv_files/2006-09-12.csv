Telstra (Question No. 3172) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 2 March 2006: (1) Can the Minister confirm media reports that Telstra is proposing to slash 5000 payphones as part of its cost-cutting measures; if not why not. (2) Has the Minister read the report of the review commissioned by the Government titled ‘Payphone Policy Review’, published in March 2004, which observed that there is a clear social requirement for payphones for people needing to make emergency calls, people without access to a phone at home, young people and low income earners; if not, why not. (3) Is the Minister aware of the report’s observations that Telstra’s requirement to provide reasonable access to payphones is not clear and precise, and that Telstra has considerable latitude in meeting its obligations; if not, why not. (4) Can the Minister ensure that payphones in the electorate of Lowe have not been, and will not be, targeted by Telstra’s planned cuts to services; if not, why not. (5) Which laws ensure that Telstra provides and retains payphones in a manner that meets the social needs of groups which have a high level of reliance on payphones. (6) Will the Minister exercise powers under Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to “give Telstra such written directions in relation to the exercise of powers of Telstra as appear to the Minister to be necessary in the public interest”, and request that current payphone levels be maintained; if not, why not. (7) Will the Minister introduce amendments to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standard) Act 1999 to ensure that Telstra’s universal service obligation contain enforceable mandatory targets which are not subject to wide discretion or interpretation; if not, why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) I have been advised of Telstra’s Payphone Rationalisation Program which proposes to reduce the number of payphones by approximately 5,000. There are currently more than 60,000 payphones in Australia. (2) Yes. The Government accepted in full or part 31 of 33 recommendations of the Payphone Policy Review Report, which are aimed at improving service levels, in recognition of the clear social requirements for payphones for people needing to make emergency calls, people without access to a phone at home, young people and low income earners. Telstra’s Standard Marketing Plan (SMP) was amended as a result of the recommendations of the report to include a payphone siting criteria to accommodate the needs of people without access to a phone. (3) Yes, and the Government agreed with the Inquiry’s finding that the previous approach required improvements, including amending Telstra’s SMP to implement recommendations of the Payphone Policy Review Report. The report was published in 2004 and Telstra’s SMP has been amended to implement recommendations of the report. Furthermore, on 8 June 2006, I announced a package of payphone initiatives that Telstra is now implementing. One of these initiatives involves a commitment from Telstra to further amend its SMP to give a clearer description of what constitutes having ‘reasonable access’ to a payphone. (4) Telstra, as the primary universal service provider, is required by the Universal Service Obligation (USO) to make payphones reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. Telstra’s SMP sets out the circumstances in which Telstra can remove payphones. ACMA’s role is to approve and monitor Telstra’s compliance with the SMP. This means that Telstra is unable to remove payphones that it is obliged to maintain under the USO, including those in the electoral division of Lowe. (5) As primary universal service provider, Telstra has a legal obligation under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to ensure that payphones are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. Telstra’s SMP describes how it will provide payphones under USO. (6) No. The Government has already exercised its powers under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standard) Act 1999 to legally require Telstra to ensure that payphones reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business. The package of initiatives I announced on 8 June 2006 will provide customers with a better understanding of their rights in relation to payphone services, improve Telstra’s processes, and improve consumer access to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in its compliance role. ACMA will now have a more active role in monitoring Telstra’s compliance with the USO and investigating payphone removals. ACMA will have dedicated staff on hand to fulfil its new complaints handling responsibility. Every Telstra payphone removal or relocation notice will also notify payphone users of ACMA’s role in handling complaints. ACMA has broad powers to take remedial action if it considers that Telstra has breached its Universal Service Obligations. (7) No. There are already enforceable mandatory requirements on Telstra to ensure that payphones are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business under the USO.",125,Questions In Writing

173,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Defence, In Writing, On 8 August 2006:","statements before the Joint Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to the effect that the F-22A is not available for export. (2) Will he confirm reports that attempts to clear the F-22A for export were stifled when the former Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Hill, and then Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Houston, unilaterally bypassed the AIR 6000 fighter project by rejecting the F-22A in favour of the Joint Strike Fighter. (3) Will he advise whether Japan is currently lobbying to acquire F-22A aircraft from the United States. (1) A United States legislative prohibition has been placed on the overseas sale of the F-22A since approval of the Financial Year 1998 United States Defense Appropriation Bill. Australia has never formally sought release for sale of the F-22A. Ongoing assessment continues to reaffirm the Defence assessment that the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) will mature to most cost-effectively meet Australia’s future air combat capability requirements. (2) Australia joined the System Development and Demonstration phase of the JSF Program in 2002 after consideration of the full-range of aircraft available for Project AIR 6000. Ongoing detailed Defence analysis reaffirms this decision and the Government remains confident that the stealthy, fifth generation, multi-role JSF will mature to meet Australia’s air combat capability requirements in the most cost-effective way. (3) While there has been press reports suggesting that Japan may be considering pursuing an F-22A acquisition, the Government can not confirm if such an action is being formally pursued. NH-90 Helicopter (Question No. 3802) (1) Will he confirm that the German Bundeswehr is the international launch customer for the NH90 helicopter.

(3) Will he advise whether deliveries of NH90 helicopters to Germany have commenced; if so, how many aircraft have been delivered and when. (1) Yes. (2) On 31 March 2006, the Executive Meeting under the NAHEMA (NATO Helicopter Management Agency) qualification procedure was held. During this meeting, the Final Compliance Report was accepted. This is the equivalent of granting qualification. NH 90 helicopters were in use for operational test and evaluation, but not in operational service as at 19 June 2006.

177,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For Defence, In Writing, On 8 August 2006:","(a) The F-22A is currently facing obsolescence issues in relation to its avionics and sensor suite. (b) These obsolescence issues are being addressed now. (c) The Joint Strike Fighter Program will avoid obsolescence issues through a number of strategies: An open systems approach has been adopted for both hardware and software to ensure new systems can be readily accommodated. JSF sustainment will be managed through a performance based logistics approach in which responsibility for addressing obsolescence issues will rest with Lockheed Martin and the subsidiary original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The linking of production and sustainment of components with OEMs provides surety of business to the OEMs. The JSF global fleet will be of sufficient size (compared to the F-22) to make the demand for replacement and repair of parts sufficiently high to make viable continued OEM investment into product improvement and continuity of supply. The JSF follow-on development program will include a scheduled minor upgrade every two to four years, providing an opportunity to pre-empt obsolescence issues. A key factor for assuring uninterrupted production and sustainment of the JSF Air System will be process-driven and proactive mitigation of the effects of Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS), which is defined as the loss, or impending loss, of manufacturers of items or suppliers of items or raw materials that support the F-35 JSF Program. In order to accomplish this, the F-35 JSF Program will institute a proactive, technology management process with the objective of protecting aircraft manufacturing, deliveries, and sustainment by ensuring that DMSMS does not preclude the availability of sufficient materials and/or parts-onhand.
