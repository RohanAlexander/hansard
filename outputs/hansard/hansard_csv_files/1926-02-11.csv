This matter was previously referred to the Public Works Committee by an order in council on the 19 th of May, 1925. On the 9th of March, 1923, the proposal to erect provisional adminstrative offices at Canberra, was referred by Parliament to the Public Works Committee for investigation. The committee examined the project, and on the 21st of June, 1923, submitted a report, in which it recommended that the suggestion for the erection of provisional offices be not approved, but that two units of permanent buildings be erected, and the design be the subject of an architectural competition. On the 25th of August, 1923, a resolution was passed by this House that it was not expedient to carry out the erection of provisional administrative offices, but that it was expedient to invite competitive designs for permanent administrative offices as recommended by the Public Works Committee in its report. Arrangements were accordingly made to hold a competition among Australian architects for the design of a permanent building, and this was concluded in December, 1924, the first premiated design being that of Mr G. Sydney Jones, A.R.I.B.A., of' Sydney. After investigation as to the amount of accommodation that might be obtained in two buildings on the sites indicated by the cided, after consultation with the chairman of the committee, to call for competitive designs for one building only, to be erected on a site within the governmental area, but somewhat to the north of that previously proposed, and to be sufficiently large to accommodate the whole of the public servants to bo transferred to Canberra.

When I was there about twelve months ago I found that the divisional walls in the bathrooms of certain cottages that were being erected by contract were built of bricks on edge, a practice that is not permitted in any other city in Australia, Even during the bnilding boom in Melbourne over 30 years agoi, when whole streets of jerry-built houses were erected in Elstemwick and other suburbs, the contractors were not allowed to build internal walls with bricks on edge, and the practice should certainly not be tolerated in what w ill be the model city of the Commonwealth. I hope that members of the> Public Works Committee w ill get into touch witb reliable builders who w ill instruct them on matters of this kind, so that no undesirable practices in building will be possible in the f u t u r e at Canberra.

I understand that I feel sure that the committee the deposits in New South Wales, although good, are not of the high-class quality of the Queensland marble, or of ibe deposits at Angas, in South Australia. 1 have been interested in this subject for ' some time. In a letter which I received from tbe Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten), under date 18th December last, I was informed that the Tariff Board had taken evidence in Melbourne on the 13th January, and in Adelaide on the 14th January, 19*5, in regard to applications for protection to enable the Australian marble industry to be developed. My grievance then was, and still is, that the Tariff Board did not visit Central Queensland to investigate the possibility Stucco walls for the of developing the deposits there. I see in this motion an opportunity to direct the attention of the Public Works Committee to the subject. The Tariff Board, after what I regarded as a more or less I trust, however, that Canperfunctory investigation of the position, reported as follows to the Minister: With the exception of marble for monumental purposes it can be claimed that Australian marble has a high commercial value. In order to obtain the higher grade marble it will be necessary to encourage the. full development of the local quarries until the greater depths are reached. At present the AustraUan marble industry is in a very depressed condition, and several quarries have closed down. Meantime imports from Italy are increasing. There are, as I have said, some very fine marble deposits in Australia, and I hope that the possibilty of utilizing them will be f u l l y inquired into by the Public Works Committee.",19,Administrati Ve Building Ral Capital Commission Has Been I N Touch

The desirability of postponing Harold Parker, the well-known sculptor, states that the Central Queensland marble is equal to the finest in the world, and compares very favourably with the bast Italian marble. Queenslanders have spent £25,000 in tbe purchase and erection of the necessary machinery to work the quarries there, but unfortunately, owing to the competition of cheap Italian marble, the' demand for the Queensland marble has fallen off. Aa a result the quarries bave been closed, and hundreds of men have been thrown out of work.

The Public Works Committee, in its report of the 28thNovember, 19 Iff, on ornamental waters, recommended-(a ) that the suggested eastern lake be indefinitely postponed; (6) that the provision of other ornamental waters be delayed any consideration of a very large expenditure on the formation of these lakes is concurred in by the Federal Capital Some enterprising Commission; but, at the same time, it is deemed advisable to improve the river, from a scenic point of view, in the central portion of the city, and to. provide boating and bathing facilities, and to give necessary regulation to the flow. The course* of the river is at present itnsaliisfactory, and improvements to the waterway are very necessary. It is therefore proposed that, to meet immediaterequirements^ a weirbe constructed across the Molonglo River at Yarralumla, which would create a reasonably good stretch of water, and at the same time not raise the floodlevels in the city proper to any appreciable degree.

Question resolved in the affirmative. Debate resumed from the 10th February (vide page 855), on motion by Mr. That tlie bill be now read a second time. by way of amendmentThat all the words after the word "" T h a t "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof Tbe Labour party bas long claimed that "" This House is of opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn wrEh a view to re-drafting so as to eliminate the obnoxious clauses referring to industrial disputes, as such clauses, asParliament, in order that it might sociated with the Crimes Act, are an unwarranted affront to the great bodies of organized labour."" I commend tbe Government for the early introduction of this bill, which, on a close examination, substantially fulfills the promise made by the Prime Minister at the time of the election. He promised that the Government, if returned, would arm itself witb sufficient legislative power to protect the Commonwealth in certain directions in which it was menaced. The bill deals with no imaginary ills, but with a positive and definite wrong perpetrated against AustraUa at a time when she was almost legislatively helpless to defend herself. It is to be hoped that the House and tbe country will not think, because tbe great strike that then held this country in a condition of paralysis has come to an end, and because the voice of the Sir George arch-mischief-maker has been silenced, that the need for such a bill bas passed. It is significant that the clear voice of the people has silenced these extreme men who, for the time being, are in our midst, but it has not got rid of them, nor can we hope that it has changed their hearts. I listened carefully to the comprehensive address of tbe Attorney General( Mr Latham), in which he outlined the causes for, and the difficulties under, which this country is suffering, and the remedial measures the Government propose to adopt. Personally, I feel that tbe greatest good that will follow the passing of this bill will be due to its preventive effect. The Government asked the people to authorize the granting of these powers, and it gained the most sweeping election victory in the history of federation. From every State, and, in fact, every corner of the Commonwealth, except the massed industrial centres, it received big majorities. There was a bounden duty laid upon it, therefore, to fulfill its promise. In my judgment, it bas substantially done so by introducing this measure. Comprehensive powers, some may even call tbem drastic powers, are being asked for in order to assure continuity in tbe essential services of the country; but surely tbe Government should be entrusted with such powers. tbe fullest powers possible under the Constitution should be vested in the function in all respects for tbe benefit and protection of the nation. It hardly rests with those honourable members now, therefore, to challenge this Government for seeking full authority to protect tbe nation from attack. The bill deals chiefly with two aspects of wrongdoing. One of these concerns unlawful associations of people which, of course, usually centre round some evil genius who has sufficient power to control a crowd, and can find those who are willing, though thoughtlessly at times, to",22,Wharfage Accommodation At Darwin

In most of our great industrial upheavals the masses have surged around some individual who was the tarek mischief-maker, tihe evil genius, OT perhaps the misguided f anatic. The bill seeks to clothe the Government with powers which previously have mot been -vested im it, to deal with these unlawful associations, and to completely protect Australia from their machinations. The executive, however, will have no power to select certain individuals, and deport tbem. All persons who are charged must be presented before our law courts, and, if 'contrial troubles.

Tbey have not challenged it in regard to .unlawful associations, and therefore we may take it as being agreed to. The principle having been admitted, it becomes a question of the degree in which it may ""be applied. The other substantial pr-ovision <£ the hill deals with industrial disturbances. Proposed new sub-section 30j (2) is hot couched in the language that I would choose, but that can be dealt witb later on. In it the Government asks forauthority to take full responsibility for maintaining the essential services of fhe nation. Transport, both overseas and between the States, is included. Although oversea shipment is the life-hlood of this nation, for nearly three months last year the entire country was kept in a condition of complete paralysis because of the shipping strike. _ I venture to say that this was done 'chiefly by the miscbiefmaking activities -of one or two men. Nobody contends that the British seamen were communists, and that their special design was to play into the hands of those who wished to hold up the trade and commerce of Australia and of the British Empire; but crafty men who bad influence with tbem obliged' them to participate in such , a design, which was Mr Rodgers. foreign to the welfare of tbe nation. In my opinion, the Prime Minister's statement at Dandtnoug was carefully weighed by the people. They realized what was involved, and tbey gave a clear direction to tbe Government to obtain whatever power was necessary to preserve our industrial life. Personally, I should not like deportation to be resorted to except in extreme cases, but I believe that the Government sbould be clothed with absolute power to defend the country against these industrial wreckers. Honourable members of both Houses in this Parliament know the type of individual who is generally the king pin in indusledgable, vioJent main, who will desist from Ms destructive work only when he knows that ithe severest penalties may be enforced against bim.

'There seems to have grown up in the minds of some representatives of the industrialists the feeling that the striker is entitled to absolute freedom in this country. He cannot have recourse to the courts of the country, the advantage of judicial awards, and at the same time the power to incite the workers into a state of revolt against society. The outstanding figure in the last great strike at the Australian end was the leader of the Australian Seamen's Union, Thomas Walsh. tion bim. The person chiefly responsible for the whole difficulty goes scot-free with an advertisement that for the time being ibe was the supreme leader of the movement; but a loss of' £3,000,000 was incurred by the shipping interests, .and the families of hundreds of British seamen were brought to the verge of starvation. This man still masquerades as a "" great industrial leader,"" to use a phrase .of which honourable members opposite are very fond.

He might have been candid enough to admit that those provisions have been introduced because we had recently a seamen's strike in this country. I point out that the Britisb seamen's strike was not brought, about by the industrialists of Australia. There was no strike amongst the seamen of the interstate shipping companies, the troll eymen and draymen, or the waterside workers of Australia. brought to this country by the British seamen. He would be a very callous man indeed who could not sympathize with men who resisted a reduction of wages as the British seamen did. They had signed a contract to take a voyage from Great Britain to Australia at a wage of £10 per month, and when they arrived here they were told that the monthly wage was to be reduced to £9 per month. was no machinery here to adjust tbe matter, because the British seamen were not members of our community. sisted the reduction of their wages by the British ship-owners, and I say that they were justified in doing so. Labour organizations in Australia, and honourable members on this side, had nothing to do with tbe matter. criminal act committed in connection with tbe strike-and I do not say that there t was-it was brought about by the British shipping combine in reducing the British seamen's wages from £10 per month, for which they had contracted, to £9 per month. British boats receiving a wage as low as £5 per month. ( Mr Bruce) might have assisted to bring about a settlement strike. Inchcape and the British shipping companies, ""We do not want this dispute in this country. Unless you agree to pay your men the wages they contracted for when they left Great Britain, we shall not allow your ships to enter our ports."" The reduction in the British seamen's wages should not have been made until they had returned to British ports, and had been paid off from their vessels. If that had been done tbe trouble would not Mr E. Riley. It believes in tbe have extended to this country. This bill has been brought in to deal especially with the workers of this country. here did not affect the strike of British seamen in South Africa, New Zealand, and in Great Britain itself. Africa, British vessels were tied up for some considerable time owing to the strike. I admit that in England the strike did not last long. When there are 1,500,000 people unemployed in a country, whose wives and families are starving, men are compelled to accept work at reduced rates. The strike was In Australia the position was different. We had no great army of unemployed, and, consequently, there was no surplus labour. Tom Walsh cannot be blamed for the fact that the British seamen wenton strike in South Africa, New Zealand and Canada. Government fed the strikers. ists of this country sympathized with the British seamen in their protest against the reduction of their wages, the NationThey realist Government, the alleged great champion of the people's liberty, has introduced this bill whose purpose is to place our industrialists under the criminal code. There are 791 unions in the Commonwealth, with a membership of nearly If there was any 800,000 men and women. When any section of these unionists takes any action that interferes with the trade, transport, and commerce, of Australia, its members may, under the bill, be treated as criminals. The Labour party stands for arbitration. There have been fewer strikes There were some men on the since it has been the law of this country.

That principle has been laid down by all Arbitration Court judges, including Mr Justice. Higgins, Judge Heydon, Judge Beeby, and Judge Edmunds. In spite of that fact, Sir John",25,Latham

Only 30 or 40 men at Mort's Dock were involved in the first place, but pressure was put on them to obey the award, and the dispute extended to the patternmakers, blacksmiths, moulders, and shipwrights. Over 1,000 men are now out on strike. Is the employer, who is responsible for lockouts to be subject to the provisions of this bill ? When this legislation is placed on the statute-book any attempt to give it effect will cause serious complications. posite always find excuses for unjust legislation. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) deplored, the loss of millions of pounds owing to the British seamen's strike. I have read speeches made by Americans in justification of the system of slavery. They said that if the slaves were emancipated a great loss of money would result through interference with trade and commerce. finest preachers in America were heard justifying the system of slavery. great reformer, John. Brown, had the courage to advocate revolution in order to free the slaves. He was executed, but his spirit went marching on. As the result of his labour the American slaves were freed. Meni n this country have advocated Kanaka labour for Queensland. They said that North Queensland could not be developed with white labour. But the then Labour Government, with the assistance of the democrats of this country, abolished Kanaka labour, and to-day, notwithstanding the opposition of those who cry "" stinking fish "" when any great reform is proposed in this country, Queensland has developed under white labour, and is likely to continue to do so. Honourable members supporting the Government say that the bill is justified because it will prevent strikes. It will do no-' thing of the kind. Strikes cannot be prevented. Men of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic races have always resisted oppression and fought for their rights. . The bill w ill be as effective in preventing strikes as sticking plaster would be as a cure for cancer. No government can control strikes. I do not blame this Government for introducing the bill .

General to point out in what way the bill deals' with lockouts. An employer 'of labour can easily cause a lockout on the excuse that he is shutting up his works for repairs and alterations, or that there is a shortage of raw material or orders. But if, because of a notice in a workshop (that after a certain date the hours will be increased, or the wages reduced., a man calls together his fellowworkers, -and has the courage to say that they .should leave the job rather than accept the altered conditions, he will be liable to be -declared a criminal and fined, or imprisoned, .and deported. This clause makes it a criminal act for a man to endeavour -to sell his labour at the 'best obtainable price. I agree with the urovisioas relating to unlawful associations. Honourable members on this side do uot believe in the methods which those provisions are designed to punish. We desire this country to develop sanely :and steadily. ment of industrial disputes by arbitration; but even under that system industrial peace will not be ensured if judges give unjust .awards. awards that were against the weight of evidence. The men who refuse to work under fair conditions imposed by a court will, by this bill, be made criminals and be liable ,to deportation. However, the Government, if it will not be advised by honourable members on this side of the House, must go its chosen way. Similar coercive tactics were employed during a strike Gregory Wade, the then of New South Wales. Some of the men were put in gaol, and others in leg irons, but at the first opportunity the people annihilated the Wade Ministry.

86,Mr Bruce,"The basis of demoremind the House of the conditions that preceded the introduction of this measure and the amending Immigration Act of 1925 ? For many months of last year. Australia was in the throes of serious industrial turmoil. Industry and transport services were held up repeatedly, not by mere local disputes, affecting a few employers and employee's, but by wide-spread and well organized troubles, which undermined the foundation of our national and economic life. Whether people agreed or disagreed with the methods adopted by the Government, whether they voted for or against the ministerial candidates at tbe last elec-' tion, the majority recognized that the time had come when, in the interests of the nation, steps should be taken to overcome and, if possible, obviate the difficulties with which we were confronted. I need not recapitulate in detail the interference with Commonwealth officers in the discharge of their public duties at Fremantle and elsewhere, but tbe House, is aware that, because of many sinister occurrences of that nature, the Government passed through Parliament legislation to grapple with this evil. Under the newly conferred powers, the Government took firm action, which was later supported by the people at the polls. The legislation introduced by the Government was acceptable to the electors; whatever the High Court may have decided, the people, at any rate, thought that the Government had taken the right course. After the Immigration Bill had been passed, and before our intention to appeal to the electors was announced, I made the Government's position quite clear. I saidI believe the people are prepared to support vide a method of settling industrial disme in what I have done, and I will not hesitate at any time to appeal to them for their endorsement of my actions, and, should necessity arise, to ask them for a mandate to take such further action as is essential in order to prono need to seek further powers, and, in tect the happiness and prosperity of Australia, and ensure the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth. Shortly afterwards the Governor General dissolved Parliament, and again, in my policy speech at Dandenong, I said definitely what the Government would do if the people, by their votes, declared their , confidence in it . I saidThe Government is determined to defeat the nefarious designs of the extremists in our midst, and, armed with the mandate of the people, will take all necessary steps to accomplish this end. Although under our Constitution there is a King's peace of the Commonwealth which co-exists side by side with the King's peace within each of the States, up to this date in the history of Australia there has been little need for the Commonwealth to take action for its preservation. Generally speaking, the' authorities and laws of the States have been adequate to deal with what may be generally regarded as breaches of the King's peace. Eecent happenings have clearly demonstrated the existence of actions prejudiced to the peace of the Commonwealth. The time has now arrived when the Commonwealth Parliament should exercise its powers and pass effective legislation to deal with offences against the peace of the Commonwealth, including action against those persons who are actively engaged in associations and propaganda work having as their object the overthrow of the Constitution, interference with Commonwealth activities, resistance to its laws, and generally taking part in unlawful action' for tiie purpose of subverting external and internal commerce and intercourse in Australia. The measure now before the House carries out the pledge I then gave to the people. It deals with external and interstate commerce, and aims a blow at unlawful assor ciations which are trying to subvert the existing forms of government. I do not think any members of the Opposition will deny that during the election campaign the people understood thoroughly what the Government would do if it were continued in office. This bill is a natural sequel to our declarations on the hustings, and is, I believe, acceptable to the overwhelming majority of the people. It does not do the injury to trade unionists which honourable members opposite have declared to be our design. It is directed solely against those extremists who are trying to overthrow constitutional government and bring about political and economic chaos. It does not attempt to proputes; that problem is foreign to its purpose. The Leader of the Opposition declared yesterday that the Government has support of that contention, quoted section 24A of the Crimes Act. The honourable member could not have been sincere in suggesting that that section gives to tbe Government .the powers conferred by this bill. It does not deal with unlawful associations. deal with persons who try to create disaffection.",28,Latham
87,Mr Chablton,"It gives power toman must realize that his statement thai, what the Government seeks to do can be achieved under the existing law, is con trarv to fact. If the honourable member will read the whole of the legislation referred to, he will realize that the case which he put forward cannot be maintained. Whether he agrees with what we propose to do or not, obviously we must pass this legislation to get the additional powers asked for. The law as it stands certainly does not give them. I regret that tbe measure which the Government hopes to bring down at a later stage, for the settlement of industrial disputes, could not be introduced concurrently. amount of consideration and research is necessary before we can introduce it . That bill will deal with one of the most difficult problems that has ever confronted this country. It is a very grave misrepresentation to suggest that this bill can be regarded as an attack upon trade unionism. The Leader of the Opposition, in attempting to show that it was directed against trade unionists, asked why they were not exempted from certain of its provisions, as they are in the Unlawfu l Associations Act of 1916. The honourable gentleman suggested that there was something sinister in that. It is a pity that he had not read the act more carefully. Byi t certain organizations are declared to be unlawful associations, as, for instanceAny association which, by its constitution or great injustice to trade unionists. Before propaganda, advocates, or encourages, or incites, or instigates to, the taking or endangertbe bill , it would have to be proved that ing of human life or the destruction or injury of property; eentleman should read the proviso. It exempts trade unionists. witb the point raised by the honourable member, If he will look at the proposed new sub-section 30A, paragraph b, of the bill, he will find that unlawful associations are to be deemed to includeAny body of persons, incorporated or unincorporated, which by its constitution, or propaganda, or otherwise, advocates or encourages the doing of any act having or purporting to have as an object the carrying out of a seditious intention as defined in section 24A of this act. That provision is practically identical with paragraph b, section 3, of the act of 1916. Paragraph c of the same section addsAny association which the Governor General, by notice published in the Gazette, declares to be, in his opinion, an unlawful association within the meaning of the last preceding paragraph. Bnt there is this provisoProvided that this last sub-section shall not apply in the case of any association registered under any Arbitration law' of the Commonwealth or any State or any law relating to trade unions in any State. which I made. I was a member of this Parliament when tbe measure was under consideration. man had read the act more carefully, he would know how hopeless his contention is'. Tbe proviso exempting trade unionists relates only to associations wbich tbe Governor General, by proclamation, declares to be unlawful associations. Evidently he did not then protect the interests of trade unionists in the way he now declares to be necessary. I think I have made the position clear to the House, if not to the Leader of tbe Opposition. H is whole case rests on the statement that we are now proposing something different from what was done before. Trade unionists were not exempted under paragraph b of section 3 of the 1916-17 act, and they are not exempted under this b ill . T suggest that the honourable gentleman has done a very a trade unionist could be convicted under he was one of a body of persons who advocated or encouraged the doing of a seditious act, as defined in paragraph b of proposed new section 30A. DO trade unionists encourage these things 1 I understand that they do not. Under the I am about to deal 1916 law organized trade unionists were properly exempted in certain circumstances, but there was no exemption for an offence against the community such as encouraging or instigating the taking or endangering of human life or the destruction or in j u ry of property. Trade unionists have nothing to fear. I think the Leader of the Opposition w ill realize, when he has thought the matter over, that the trade unionists have not",29,Latham

Another fact which tbe honourable gentleman stressed was that his party dissociated itself entirely from the extremists whose object is to subvert the government and destroy our economic system. formed us that, during the election campaign, he had done his best to assure the people that the Labour party had nothing whatever to do with them. observed, however, that he spoke very quietly, and apparently did not display a great deal of courage. but, unfortunately, we got no publicity in tbe press. man, I venture to say, never told the people that, if returned to power, he would take drastic action against the extremists to prevent them from continuing their pernicious activity in the Commonwealth. I have no desire now to stir up feeling over this matter. Leader of the Opposition assured us that he and his party were in no way associated with the extremists, but he pointed the finger of scorn across the table and invited the people to compare the attitude of his party with what he regarded as the disreputable action of the Prime Minister in encouraging the Fascisti, whom he regarded as worse than the extremists. He suggested that we were encouraging these people to subvert the Constitution and bring about disorder in this country. I can only say that the honourable gentleman must have been carried away when he quoted the letter to the gentleman described as the organizer of the Fascisti movement in Australia. It passes my comprehension how the Leader of the Opposition could have been unaware of what had happened. know, because I was out of the State during the election campaign. letter being published by newspapers that were supporting tbe Labour party, I can imagine the letter being quoted by some of the honourable gentleman's followersI do not indicate to whom I refer-bu t it passes my comprehension that the Leader of the Opposition should quote it, and try to base an argument upon it . I can only assume that he does not know the circumstances of its publication. If he knows nothing about it, that is to bis credit, because it was one of the most disreputable episodes in the recent election campaign. As the honourable gentleman has again referred to this letter, and has based his He incase against the Government upon it, I must, at the risk of being a little wearisome, once more state the facts concerning it. The letter was published in the I Labour Daily, Sydney, a few days before the election. It purported to be written by A . K i r by Hewlett, organizing secretary of the "" B r it is h Fascisti,'' to Captain Hatcher, organizer of the Australian branch. In the course of that letter, Mr. Hewlett was made to sayI t is pleasing to learn that your Federal Government has been assisting in initial organization work. ' Fortunately the last elections made the position safe in England, but in Australia the position is different. Labour is in power in four States, and our experience has been such that almost any means would be justified in The preventing it from ruling Federally. If necessary, steps should be taken to precipitate open hostilities with the militant unions. Open rioting would give us an opportunity to smash the unions and cripple Labour politically. In this we have the definite assurance that the present Federal Government would co-operate, and will secretly instruct its officers to work in conjunction with our forces. You need have no fear, tlierefore. Use your force to prevent Labour from assuming office should a Laibour victory at the polls eventuate. That is part of the letter, and I shall quote another part later. I was in Sydney about a week before tbe election, and a few days prior to the publication of the letter. I heard persistent rumours to the effect that the Labour party had a trump card that would be produced at the right moment, and that disaster would then overtake the Government. I waited with some interest until the letter was published. It was reproduced photographically, with the object of condid not vincing readers of its genuineness. In vestigations were immediately made, and several things that made one wonder whether the letter was genuine at once caught the eye. In .the first place, the letter was dated the 17th September, and it contained a reference to the Australian election. On that date, no announcement of the election had been made, and no one knew that there was to be an election. The person who wrote the letter made that trifling slip in",30,Latham

112,Mr Bruce,"proposed new section is intended to become operative only wben persons in tbe community, at a time of national crisis, are endeavouring to take action which will seriously affect the whole of tbe people, and lead to chaos in our national life. Tbe Leader of the Opposition said lhat many trade union leaders in a time of industrial disturbance work day and night to settle tbe dispute. agree witb him that many of these men do invaluable work, not only in connection with the settlement of disputes, but in endeavouring to counteract the activities of a few wild leaders, .the extreme views of which if given effect, would damage the best interests of their own friends as well as those of the community at large. As a matter of fact, the provisions of this proposed new sub-section would never apply to reputable trade union leaders. Let us look at the matter from two stand-points. It has been suggested, in the first place, that the Government would not hesitate to cause to be issued, under the provisions of this proposed new sub-section, a proclamation declaring that some little industrial dispute that might arise to disturb the peaceful life of the community, was a ""serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among tbe States,"" and that persons who were connected with such a minor disturbance could then be imprisoned or deported. wrong conception. No government witn a proper sense of its responsibilities would defeated in the fight. The second point think of issuing such a proclamation unless 'circumstances unquestionably warranted it. It has even been suggested that the Government would issue such a proclamation in the most light hearted way merely to serve its own ends or to deal with particular individuals. that that should be the case. altogether from any idea of fairness or any sense of decency, no government witb the slightest intelligence would falsely proclaim that a serious industrial dispute existed in the community. Would any government tliink of seizing men and compelling their appearance before a court if it thought that there was a possibility that they would not be. convicted? Some honourable members of the Opposition have argued that, in any case, the Mr Bruce. people are entirely opposed to legislation of this description. The reverse is the case. The people were consulted on this particular point, and, by a very large majority, they disagreed with the views of honourable members opposite and agreed with those of the Government. In this country governments have always to go to the bar of public opinion to ascertain I heartily the judgment of tbe people. No government would dream of exercising its powers despotically, for it would know that if it did so judgment would inevitably fall upon it. May I offer one word of advice to honourable members opposite? I know they do not like my advice^ as a rule, but perhaps they may be disposed to accept it on this occasion. I advise them to consider whether the people of Australia will tolerate them continually saying in this Parliament that tbe electors did not rightly determine the issue that was submitted to them at the last election. The people said, quite distinctly, that the Government acted rightly in endeavouring to suppress and deport those who were disturbing and prejudicing our trade and commerce. They said, in effect, ""We believe that the Government acted rightly in bringing tbese men before the Deportation Board. We believe that legislation of this character should be enforced against such men."" Honourable members opposite would be well advised to take the That is an utterly decision of the people in a more sporting spirit and not whine because they were that ought to be considered is whether it is not necessary that the Executive should have this power. Seeing that tbe interests of the whole of the citizens of this country may be materially damaged by big industrial upheavals, which may be caused by even one man who deIt is inconceivable liberately aims at bringing chaos into our Apart economic life, surely it is essential that the Government should have power to deal with these people. It would never think of exercising such power despotically, because it would know that . the people are the masters, and can bring swift and rapid retribution on any government that misuses its power. Our object in including tbese new sub-sections in the bill is to give effect to tbe expressed will of the people. I assure honourable members, and, through them, the country generally, that these proposals are not aimed at trade unions, or at the leaders of trade unions. They are only aimed at those who are tryin g to destroy our national lif e and to bring untold misfortunes upon tbe whole of our people. Exception has been taken to the provision in tbe b ill that individuals may be deported for two specific things. It has been said that tbe Government should not have power to send any one out of the country. I cannot understand the attitude that is being adopted by honourable members opposite. Persons have in the past been deported fro m Australia. Probably not one honourable member would agree to yield up the right that we possess to send men out of Australia if they commit certain unlawful acts. I have not heard any objection raised to the deportation of an individual upon conviction of any of the offences that fal l under the provisions relating to unlawful associations. I believe that every one is in favour of those provisions. A distinction, however, is drawn, in favour of British subjects, not because any principle'is involved, but because the idea is held that the power to deport such persons may be misused, and that the Government may take action against men who should not be subject to it . No government would dare to misuse those powers. But the righ t to take proper action must be vested in every government. For the moment I shall confine my remarks to the application of the bill to aliens. Take the case of a man who, after entering Australia, preaches doctrines that lead to industrial unrest, and commits acts which hamstring our transport system. taken before a court, and convicted. It is proved that he has been a source of trouble wherever he has resided,'and that nothing can be said in his favour. If such a person is sent to prison, he does not remain long in confinement. ""Upon his release he again moves about amongst the people, and continues to act unlawf u l l y , hoping that he will not again be convicted. Isi t suggested that we shoiild not exercise our right to deport him ? Why should we shelter in Australia men who w ill not subscribe* to the views and the sentiments of the Australian people ? Every honourable member w ill probably agree with my argument in its relation to foreigners; but there are some who say, "" You must not deport British citizens. Once they have made their permanent home in Australia, no steps should be taken to get r i d of them, no matter what they do."" That has not been the practice in the past. Many British citizens have been deported from Australia. Twelve cases, at least, are on record in which that action was taken. Another matter to be considered is the maintenance of our White Australia policy. Does any honourable member subscribe to the view that we have not the power to deport a British citizen who is not a member of a white race? I cannot be charged with lack of sympathy with the British Empire. I believe in the Imperial connection. It is the greatest safeguard that Australia could have. Our whole future is wrapped up in the British Empire. But if a citizen of any country within the commonwealth of nations that form the British Empire enters Australia, and commits acts that menace our welfare, he should be sent back to the country from which he came. W h y should we be saddled w i th him? Bolshevism is training its propagandists for the furtherance of its doctrines in very country. We in Australia do not believe in those doctrines. A citizen of Russia oan make littl e headway with his propaganda in a British' community. But many men have gone to Russia, where for upwards of two years they have undergone training designed to fit them to propagate in the BritishE m pire the doctrines of Bolshevism. Have we to keep in , Australia a man who so far forgets his own nationality and the promptings of patriotism, that he w ill He is submit to training in a foreign country in order that he may assist in the subversion of constitutional government within the Empire to which he belongs? We are not required to do that. On the contrary, he should be returned-to bis own country. T should readily deport such a man. The power to deport w ill be exercisable in only two cases. That power is inherent in every government, and we should jealously guard it : F r o m every point of view we are entitled to get r i d of those who do not belong to our country, and w ill not conform to our national standards and ideals. One other point has been raised. It is said ' "" Y o u propose to deal with these men in a way different from that in which you would deal with Australian citizens. W h y do you not get r i d of an Australian citizen if he commits acts which you believe are dangerous to the r [REPRESENTATIVES.] country ?""

He said that we stand for constitutional methods to secure a change in any system that we think ought to be changed. The Prime Minister complained that the honourable gentleman made that declaration in a very _weak voice, and did not proclaim it aloud. Another honourable member on the other side interjected, "" If you had said that before the elections, ycu would have won."" I heard the Leader of the Opposition, before the elections, make the same declaration most definitely, in a ball in the centre of the electoral division of Plinders, represented by the Prime Minister. I read the garbled press report of the honourable gentleman's speech which appeared tbe day after, and it was one of the worse pieces of reporting that ever came under my notice. The Prime Minister commented upon that speech, and says that it was very weak. I listened to the speech and it was a strong declaration, even more strongly worded than that made here yesterday. It ill becomes the Prime Minister and honourable members opposite, who won their election because of the powor of money and because a united press starred what they had to say and suppressed what was said by honourable members on this, side, to say that if these declarations had been made before the elections, the result would have been different. In the circumstances, it is of no use for honourable members opposite to talk of their mandate and the power they possess. The election was a fight for the mass of the people against the privileged classes, 'and the people had, as always, to fight against the organized power of. wealth which finds its expression mostly in the press of this country. The Prime Minister was greatly upset about the reference made to the Fascisti. I am not view, the Fascisti and similar associations represent but a passing phase. If honourable members opposite point to the fact that a great organization, which does not stand for the constitutional methods in which we in Australia believe, holds the reins of power in Russia, we have an equa? bight to remind them that a similarly unconstitutional organization governs in It a l y . the methods employed in either of these countries can be introduced in Australia, and become a menace to this country, unless we bring about in Australia the same conditions as those which have been responsible for revolution in other lands. That is what this bill has a tendency to do, and the more of this class of legislation that is passed, the more likely are such conditions to be brought about. While I am not very concerned about the Fascisti business, the pointthe Prime Minister made to prove that the letter referred to was a fake, was the date of the letter,-17t h September-and the fact that that was a date prior to any announcement of the Federal election. That was the strongest point he made. Mr 6. FBANCIS T h a t is not so. It was that the man referred to neither signed nor sent the letter. only a matter of denial.

I have said that I am not concerned about the letter at all, but I want to stress another point, and it is that it was well known in this country long before any official announcement of it i ' that there was to be an election.

September. was well known for weeks before that that there was to be an election. date of the election was known because of the date for which the halls were engaged. This was several days before the official announcement of the date of the election in this House. I have said that I am not bothering about the letter, but Mr Hatcher said that the Prime Minister knew all about his organization. The Prime Minister said that that statement was untrue, but I read a statement in the press that Mr Robert Hatcher had expressed his astonishment that the Prime Minister should have denied any knowledge of the existence of the organization here, because he had himself made the Prime Minister acquainted with it, and wrote the statement which the Leader of the Opposition read in this House yesterday. The Prime Minister is angry that any suggestion should be made that he or the party opposite is in any way connected with the Fascisti. I do not wish to connect the party opposite with Fascism or with the things which are done by those who claim to be Fascisti, but I ask that in the same way honourable members on this side shall not be connected with communism.'violence, and bloodshed, as they were throughout the election. Honourable members opposite during the election were fighting the Labour party, and told the country that the issue was law and order versus lawlessness. What was the insinuation in that statement ? We were no of individuals who happened to be associated with the working class movement than were honourable members opposite, for the wild and stupid utterances of some who stood for the employing class. We ask that we. shall be judged by our platform, our programme, and our record, and by nothing else. That was not the issue put before the people in bhe stunt election which was held. I should not have risen to speak upon this bill were it not for the provisions in it which are directed against the great trade unions of Australia. Under cover, of an attack upon unlawful associations, the bill makes a subtle, and in some provisions, an open attack upon unionism. I insist that unionists shall not be classed as criminals. It is an insult to the great body of trade unions to propose to deal with industrial disputes in a crimes bill. Tf the Prime Minister is in earnest, and does not believe that the bill should deal with disputes between trade unionists and their employers, let him accept the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, and omit from the bill the clauses dealing with such disputes. They should be dealt with in an industrial bill, and not in a crime's bill. The Prime Minister said that the bill is not aimed at trade unionism, and that he believes in trade unionism. There was a chorus of cheers from his supporters when the statement was made. They believe in trade unionism. They admire it , and praise it-provide d it does not take any action. it, too. any action, honourable members opposite will not support it .

A hundred years ago, that was the attitude taken up by the people who then represented the interests which are now represented by honourable members opposite. There was a time in the history'of Great Britain when there was in existence what were known as the combination laws, which made trade unions illegal, and made it a crime to form a union, or to hold a meeting of a union. Men were deported for forming trade organizations. were repealed by another law of Great Britain, but the law repealing them still provided that ""any action which may arise from deliberation of . workmen is illegal."" Whilst men could form their unions, and they were considered lawfu l associations, to take any action as the result of the deliberations of unions was illegal. That was the law in GreatB r i tain for many years. That is indicative of the frame of mind of those who are responsible for this bill . Trade unions are all right, u n t i l they take some action, and then this law is to come into force, and jails, and deportaton are provided for those who take action to bring about better conditions. ber does not suggest that the Bill would apply to ordinary conditions. member to read the b ill .

Let me lay it down that no law passed by the Parliament should be unjust. No t only should the law be just, but its """"application should be free from bias, and should be removed from party politics. I am sure that the honourable member for .Fawkner w ill agree with those conditions. A law should be just, and its application should be free from political and party bias. This bill does not comply with those conditions. honourable member that it does not. This is a law dealing with industrial disputes, and it depends for its application upon a proclamation to be issued by the Government. Ordinarily, a law passed to doal with criminals depends for its application upon the police. force and the courts of the country, and not upon the initiative of the Government. But this law can come into operation only when the political head of the country says it ought to. not discrimination. Every one w ill be amenable to the law after the proclamaThe combination laws tion. ber knows enough about political bias to realize that matters which are lef t to the decision of a political head are not given that serene and judicial consideration which we expect from a judiciary. The proclamation of this law will depend entirely on the w ill of those who are for the time being in power. That is fundamentally wrong. In the case of a law against criminals, the police take action without any proclamation by the Government, and the courts decide the issues. Such a law comes into operation automatically. Similarly, this law should act automatically on the lockout, or on the strike, a n d , the very fact that ' it does not proves it to be biased, because its application rests on political opinion. While, on the face of it , it does not discriminate between strikes and lockouts, even if proof can be obtained that a lockout has taken place, we must wait for the Government of the day to proclaim that there exists a serious industrial disturbance before the honourable we can bring the offending employer before the court and secure an order for his deportation, which, of course, I shall come to them is not likely to be made.

The bill, in some respects, is an improvement on a previous measure, inasmuch as the Deportation Board has been abandoned. fought in the election was the right of trial before a properly constituted court. We had previously fought it here against the unanimous vote of honourable members on the other side, and we fought it again in the country. Although we put ourselves in the position of -appearing to be supporting the actions of some men whose deeds and utterances we did not support, we stood for the principle of the riglit of those men to be tried by a court It is the right which is given to the worse criminal in the land. Although we went down fighting for that principle, evidently our protestations have had some effect on the minds of the people, and even on the Gtovernment, because the stupid and iniquitous policy of having a court to judge this issue has now been abandoned. When we went to the country, quoting Magna Charta and our own Australian Constitution, we were sneered at, but the H i g h Court has since justified us in that regard, and scarified the Government. The deportation provided for in this bill is in addition to whatever imprisonment may be imposed by a judge. It is thus a double punishment-wha t I may describe as composite punishment. This bill deals with things other than unlawful associations. It deals with splitting bank-notes, forging documents, and stealing, side by side with the refusal of men to work because they do -not consider the conditions under which they are asked to work are suitable. It is a disgrace to this Parliament that the two things should be put side by side, but when we examine the measure f u r ther we find that there is in it that discrimination which the honourable member for Pawkner says should not be indulged in. The Attorney-General will not be able under this bill to deport any man who has been convicted of forgery, of splitting notes, or stealing; but no matter how slight may be the offence of a man who takes part in an industrial dispute, if he is one of. those who happen to give trouble to the powers that be, he may be shanghaied out of the country at the will of the Attorney-General. We are asked, "" Cannot we trust the Attorney-General?"" If the present Attorney General were placed on the H i g h Court bench, to-morrow, I would trust him. I believe that he would carry out the One of the big issues we traditions of the judiciary if he were placed, there, but I refuse to trust h i m while he is influenced by Cabinet or party meetings in a political action of this description. I am backed up in that belief by the statements of the Attorney General himself when the previous measure was being discussed. I shall quote from a report of his speech made at Kew on the 13th September of last year. I have never seen a contradiction of that speech. He was then j u s t if y in g the appointment of the Deportation Board to try Walsh and Johnson, and he saidThere were some facts that could not be proved by legal evidence. . . . It was found necessary to alter the law. I can imagine what the Attorney-General a political board instead of would say if he were defending a criminal in the courts of this country, and any attempt were made to find him guilty without legal evidence. The honourable member is a trained lawyer,, and understands the use of words and the weight of evidence, yet he makes. that statement in justification of a board that is not a properly-constituted body. Two days after he made thespeech at Kew, he came down to this House and protested against an appeal board deciding questions of taxation, because he said that it was not a court properly constituted under the laws of this country.

Let me say to those honourable members, who for political ends, and to cover up their own political record when facing the certain vengeance of the electors, decried this country, and hold it up to the world as a place of continual trouble, that the statistics quoted yesterday, by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Australia could be deported. Charlton), proved this country to be the most peaceful in the world. Let me quote a recent opinion by Mr George Pairbairn, to-day the Victorian Agent-General, at one time a member of this House. Mr were not born bere could be deported. Pairbairn was strongly opposed to the Labour party, politically, when he sat in this House, but he was recognized by both sides as a fair-minded man. I do not agree with his political opinions, but on a question of fact I believe that Mr before going on strike. Yet under this Mr Scullin. Fairbairn would give an honest opinion. On the 26th of last month he was interThe viewed by a representative of the Geelong Advertiser, and, after deprecating the sending from Australia of cables that were injurious to its credit, he dealt w i th the alleged disturbances in this country. We are asked to leave to the He said, "" My own impression is that there is more disturbance in one day in Glasgow than there is in Australia in a year, and in my opinion Australia is about the quietest place on the face of opposite, the earth.""

The Prime Minister said It was a strike of men who came a great deal about the mandate that he Empire. received fro m the people.

Somebody sugunless the gested to the Prime Minister at one of were serious; but in this his meetings that the wives of the comparatively unionists should also be given a vote, and The British seamen went on he, the Prime Minister, thought it an excellent idea.

It means sancNo previous Gotioning every strike for which a majority of the members of a union vote. If a majorit y of unionists vote in favour of a strike, and a strike occurs, then the Attorney-General, under this bill, circumstances may issue a proclamation declaring the Commonwealth to be in . a state of grave industrial disturbance. In that case the men who voted for the strike, and also the minoritv who voted against it , and who would go on strike in loyalty to their comrades, could be thrown into gaol, and those who were not born in What about the wives who may have been given a vote ? They could be charged w i th encouraging a strike, and and also thrown into gaol, and those who We have tbe materials here for a Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera. The policy on which the Government received a mandate from the country was the enforcement of a secret ballot by unions bill unionists, if they carry' out the decision of a majorit y in favour of a strike, may be declared criminals. H o w can honourable members reconcile these things?' I suggest that it would be analogous to insist on the taking of a secret ballot by burglars before tbey attempt burglary. ment authorizes a secret ballot-and it intends to do so under legislation to be introduced, and wbich should bave been introduced before t h is I suggest that it cessation of work brought about by emcould be charged w i th encouraging a strike, and ought to be gaoled, and those of its members that were' not born in Australia deported. The Leader of the Opposition yesterday emphasized the fact that, ever since penalty clauses have been inserted in tbe arbitration laws, it has been absolutely impossible to prove a lock-out. Employers bave the position in their own hands. Every reasonable-minded man in this House knows that to be true. There is no need to put in the bill any provision relating to employers acting in combination. An employer is a combination in himself. A man who employs in his business 2,000 or 3,000 men can lock them out for some reason or other, and he need not act in combination w it h anybody else; but if his employees wish to protest against their conditions, they must act in combination, to be successful. ""We cannot compare things that are different. It cannot be said that under the b ill we are treating both sides alike by providing penalties for both strikes and lockouts. It is impossible to prove a lockout, although it is easy to prove a strike, since it must be done openly. We cannot compel an employer to employ men under any other than his own conditions. bonorable member has -read the second part of the definition ""of a lockout. will observe from it that a combination is not required.

""Under those circumstances the men can be treated under this legislation as strikers and imprisoned. I do If the Governnot say that all employers would adopt those tactics, because many of them desire to give the men a fair deal. According to the bill a strike is a ployees acting in combination. Those who framed the bill know perfectly well that the men have to act in combination or else f a i l . We know that united action by the workers has enabled them to emerge from the p it of poverty, and that without that action their conditions would not have improved. What crime have the workers committed to warrant the Government branding them as criminals? Tbe honourable member for Wannon. ( Mr Rodgers) said that the workers could not have it both ways-the y could not bave both arbitration and the right to strike. Let the Government fight that out as an economic and industrial question, and let us put our views to this country. But we are not now arguing whether men have the right to strike, and at the same time have an Arbitration Court or Wages Board. We say that the Government has no right to make criminals of men who refuse to sell their labour at a price which they do not consider suitable. Contrast the attitude of this Government towards different sections of the community. Do they utter a word of protest against the men who combine and refuse to sell tbeir commodities to tbe workers except at exorbitant prices? A t one time we were supposed to have an act to deal with combines. Has there I do not think that the been any suggestion on the part of the Government to alter the Constitution to He deal w it h the millers' combine, which refuses to sell flour to any baker who w ill not sell bread at a fixed price.

The workers of Australia are being told that it is high treason to strike, but if the employers or manufacturers refuse to sell their products at acertain price it is termed patriotism, and they are recommended for a title.

I have read a report of the speeches delivered by respectable and reputable members of the House of Commons at a meeting held in London on the 14th liberately threw out a challenge to the Government of the day by repeating word for word the utterances upon which these men were indicted. That is the kind of challenge this Government will get when they bring this measure into force and a crisis comes. opinion of Canon Lewis Donaldson. He saidThe Government's fear is not communism but the Labor movement. They did not fear force, they feared the growth of the knowledge of the people. The basis of the present Mr Scullin. order of society is not service but self-interest. Its methods were not co-operation but competition. Its aim is not to make life but to make wealth. A good deal of interesting evidence has been given before the coal commission which is now sitting in England. One of the witnesses summoned before the commission was the Duke of Northumberland who, in cross-examination, admitted that he took £75,431 .out of the coal industry in the form of royalties during the twelve months ended September, 1925. He was asked if he thought he ought to draw such a large sum for doing nothing, and in payment for coal which he did not place in the ground. He was also asked if he thought he was rendering the same service as 440 miners, whose yearly wages would aggregate that amount; and he said he thought he was. He said that his expenses and the money he disbursed should be taken into consideration. I suggest that 440 miners would disburse their wages as freely, widely, and wisely as the Duke of Northumberland would A decision for the moment has disburse his money. It was also shown that for the twelve months ended September, 1925,. the Marquis of Bute drew £150,000 in royalties, and the' Duke of Hamilton £115,000. In a general statement submitted it was shown that no less than £6,000,000 was drawn in royalties.' Obsolete panicky legislation that has been a dead letter in Britain for centuries is now being brought into operation 'there, not because there is a fear of insurrection or . acts of violence being committed, but because the authoFor that twelve comrities areafraid of free speech on were imprisoned, and the the industrial problems which have to be' faced in the near future. That, I suggest, is what is actuating this Government to-day. There is a suggestion of a great crisis approaching in England, which will be to the detriment of these royaltymongers, who have rendered no service to December last, when they deBritain. A deliberate attempt is being made to interfere witb the conditions of the men, and terrorize them by bringing them under old legislation, under which they can be placed in jail if they utter a word of protest. One of the great boasts of Britain has been that she has allowed freedom of speech Let me quote the in all circumstances, and the future peace of the country lies in granting freedom of speech in the widest possible sense. Even though the bounds may be overstepped at times and wild statements made, we will achieve more by sweet reasonableness than by force and coercion. In The Industrial History of England, H . D . B . Gibbons writesWlien we look back on tlie last century we can only wonder that trade unionists have been so moderate in their demands. We know that the workers have had to fight every inch of the way to their present position, and that, u n t i l the Arbitrahave frankly admitted that certain acts tion Court was established, wages boards appointed, and the unions were strong, their only protection was the right to strike. In the past the workers of Britain faced .guns and swords, and heard the dungeon doors slam, but they fought on. Isi t to be thought that the workers in Australia, who have sprung from the same stock, are going to take this kind of legislation lying down-that is, of course, if the Government dares to enforce it . Do the Government imagine that men whose ancestors fought for their rights in such a determined way, are likely to. cower like craven curs before any petty tyrant that may arise to-day in the Government of this country ? I believe that the workers in Australia are not getting a fair deal. I do not think that our social system is just, but I believe in the evolutionary method of changing it . believe in constitutionalism, and that even under a system that may not bring perfect justice to the workers, we ought to t r y to get together to settle economic questions in a reasonable and peaceable way. It is because of that belief that I denounce this legislation, which destroys the atmosphere that we should create to bring the opposing parties together. the very spirit of peace-the possibility of a better understanding, and the closer cooperation which must exist if industry is to be successfully, carried on. There are many thousands of thoughtful trade fore discussing the provisions of the bill unionists, and thousands of thoughtful, I should like to reply briefly to some of honest employers, too, in Australia who the statements made by the honourable are anxious to see a cessation of strife, member for Yarra( Mr Scullin). and desire that the workers shall receive a greater share of the wealth they prostate of the House. duce.

Agitators, however, could not cause dissension in the ranks of the workers unless there was cause for it . Remove the cause, change the circumstances, and the agitators will have no chance of indulging in the stirring-up process. Not'a word do we hear from honourable members opposite concerning anything done by the employing class. We are committed in the name of labour of which we do' not approve. We have frankly admitted that we do not stand for all the utterances and suggestions made in the name of labour, but there is no such frank admission from honourable members opposite concerning employers. . There is no appeal by them to the men of wealth and education, who have had opportunities in life, to extend the right hand of fellowship to their fellow men. In the opinion of honourable members opposite, the workers are always wrong. In every industrial dispute which arises, the workers, according to them, are at fault. Are the workers to accept every proposal of the employers without opposition? They are spoken of as "" hands,"" in terms of "" hiring "" and "" firing."" The way in which the GovernI ment proposes to treat trade unionists is clearly shown in this bill . It in tends to brand trade unionists as criminals under a measure that should relate only to criminals. I strongly protest against industrial offences being included in a measure of this kind. We should provide for them under industrial legislation, and not under a bill of this It destroys nature. The measure is vindictive and unreasonable, and will not produce the result we all should desire.

The honourable member for Yarra should credit honourable members on this side of the House with being as honest in their convictions as I hope they are. The honourable member also criticized the press of Australia because it did not give the ton) a fair report of his policy speech, which he said was made to appear a weak effort. Included in my friends are a number of ladies who take a keen interest in politics, and a few days before the elections one of them said that she had "" listened in "" to the speech which the Leader of the Opposition delivered in Adelaide. The opinion she had formed was that it was a weak effort, and consisted principally, as she put it, of an abuse of the Prime Minister and his people. Another statement of the honourable member for Yarra. was that Nationalist candidates had engaged all.the halls in tbe principal towns throughout the Commonwealth; but in answer to an interjection it was disclosed that thore were only three halls in the vicinity of Melbourne that, were not available to Labour deny orable member, because I know that a number of the halls in Adelaide and its suburbs were not engaged for a long time after the issue of the writs. The Leader of the Opposition stated that strikes are not as ""numerous in Australia as in other countries. He omitted to point out that in other countries the strike is the only weapon the worker has, whereas in Australia Parliament has provided an arbitration system for tbe settlement of industrial disputes. people of Australia were assured by the advocates of arbitration that .when it became the law of the land strikes would cease. Now the workers are told that they can try arbitration, and if an award does not suit them, they can resort to the strike, and no matter how they break the law they must uot be punished. Honourable members opposite have said that it is very easy to prove the existence of a strike, but difficult to prove that workers have been locked out, but in recent years the greatest difficulty has been experienced in the Arbitration Court in proving either the occurrence or authorship of a strike. Critics of the bill take exception Mr Parsons. to the power to be granted to a Minister tb declare the existence of a serious industrial disturbance. Yet the Riot Act may be read by a sheriff, a magistrate, a mayor, and even a common or garden justice of the peace. When that emergency _ power is granted by the Riot Act to comparatively irresponsible people, there is nothing extraordinary in empowering a Minister of the Crown to declare the existence of a serious industrial disturbance. We have listened to heated protests against the principle of deportation, but deportation is only expulsion, and_ Labour unions expel members from their ranks almost daily. Deportation under this measure must be preceded by a conviction in the courts, and the deportee ""will not be prevented from earning a living in some other land. But men have been expelled from trade unions, and subsequently pursued with such vindictiveness that they could get no employment and were compelled to starve. The Leader of the Opposition quoted a letter which showed that some person or persons stooped to one of the lowest tricks that can be imagined. Apparently, that letter had been forged in order to serve a political end. No honcandidates.

This measure is designed to carry out the direct mandate of tbe people. It s purpose is to put an end to the disturbances that have caused the cessation of transport on a number of occasions in recent years. Those troubles were engineered by persons who, although posing as ' the custodians of tbe rights of labour, are in reality tbe greatest enemies of labour and all other interests in this country. strikes have been aimed at transport, and have occurred at such seasons and in such circumstances as to prevent the marketing of primary products, and cause untold loss to tbe producers.

It s interference was fol lowed by tbe deportation of Adam and Evef r o m the Garden of Eden: Right through the ages civilization bas gradually but steadily advanced, but not u n t i l the beginning of tbe Christian era, when the divine teachings of Christ began to be practised, did tbe lot of the worker substantially improve. Theu p l if t i ng of the masses continued through the centuries; tbe signing of Magna Charta was the commencement of a new epoch. Another outstanding event in industrial evolution was Great Britain's stand for tbe abolition of slavery. ""Within the last 50 years tbe position of the worker bas continuously improved, and always the driving force has been the influence of Christianity. That, and that only, is the foundation of liberty. Long before there was a Labour party as we know it to-day, men imbued with the best of motivesChristian men-worke d for the emancipation of the worker. I state most emphatically that the root cause of the industrial unrest of more recent years has been the intrusion into the ranks of Labour of communists, who are anti-Christian. Christianity, theirs is a creed of selfishness; it is vicious and uncharitable. Because of tbe communists, men like the right bonorable member for No r t h SydneyI f the honourable ( Mr Hughes) have left the Labour party and joined that with which I have the honour to be associated. In the toils of the communists the Labour party is struggling and is almost strangled. Because"" I believe in this great country, the land of my birth , I intend to support the bill . It should have no terrors for the honest trade union leader. It is not an attack, fronta l or covert, upon the true ideals of trade unionism, in earnest support of which I yield place to no man. This legislation is Tbe aimed at the men who in season and out of season are striving to tear down the whole of our social fabric that is built upon the teachings of the Bible, and substitute ungodly and inhuman terrorism. I say unhesitatingly that Labour is in the hands of the communists. The Leader of the Opposition practically admits that when at last he joins hands with us in endeavouring to Adam was cast out communism. Sitting suspended from 6.89 to 8 p.m. if a number of honourable members of the Opposition are sincere in their condemnation of communism. In this connection, let me quote from the Workers' Weekly, tbe official organ of the Australian Communist partyIt may occur during the progress of the fight that members of the Labour party, even the Labour party itself, may decry the Communist party. Let this not deter the communist members from doing their duty in this fight, which will be acclaimed all over the world ns a class fight. Mr Garden, speaking at a conference in the early part of last year, saidThe shadow of communism is over the Labour movement, and all efforts to banish communism and communists are bound to fail. The good old times of playing at politics are gone; revolution has stepped on the stage. Others contend that there is no such thing as communism, or, if there is, that the communists have no influence in the community. Mr Gillies, the ex-Premier of Queensland, speaking subsequent to the Queensland railway strike, saidThere are certain influences at work in the community. . . . These people have preI n contradistinction to pared communistic literature during the strike. Among other things, they said, "" Why bother about arbitration when you can fold your arms, and paralyze industry? And, again, on every burning question that affects the working class you will find that the nuclei leaders are first in the field to give direction to the working",46,Latham

165,Mr Parsons,"It is very doubtfulclass how to meet the situation. I admit that tliese revolutionaries can destroy what has taken the Labour movement'25 to 30 years to build up.' I do not wish to see destroyed that which the Labour party has taken so long to build up, and for that reason I shall support any effort to r i d this country of communists. Mr Washington Mather, the secretary of the Albany branch of the Waterside Workers Union, and the representative for Western Australia on the federal executive of the federation for the last five years, saidThis big federation of labour was standing still like ships at anchor, while the wasps of communism were working round and getting control of the Labour movement by electing their representatives on the councils of Labour. It was time the Labour party woke up to the fact, and came out and fought the people who were trying to smash the planks Of its platform. W r it in g to a union official while at the strike conference, Mr Mather saidI hear there are those who reckon Tom Walsh is a heaven-sent saviourof the worker. It is a pity some of them did not follow the occupation of wharf labourer. We have 3,000 of our men idle in Sydney, because heaven sent to earth a man named Walsh, and the committee is receiving daily requests from employers and employees to help bring a useless Btrike to an end. Some of the British seamen have lost two years' pay because of this man. who is simply using these poor devils as means to further his own ends, and he does not. give a damn about them and their wives and families. That all goes to show that persons outside this Parliament who are prominently connected with the Labour party are prepared to admit that communism is whiteanting the party and the trade The honourable member for Yarra Scullin) referred to the wages paid to British seamen. if those wages were paid in Australia the men could not live.

Socialization is communism. The socialization of production is production for use and not for profit. It was tried in Russia. The Russian peasant, knowing as little about the socialization of production as does the average preacher of the doctrine, went about his farming in the usual way. He produced as much as he possibly could, and worked more than. 44 hours a week. When his crop was harvested the communist officers arrived. They allotted a certain portionof the crop for the farmer's use, and took the rest.. The Russian farmer thought he had found an improved marketing scheme under government control, but when he inquired the price he was to receive for his produce, he was informed that he would get nothing, because he was producing for use and not for profit. The Russian peasant is supposed to be simple, but he was not simple enough for that. The next year he produced for use and not for profit, and grew sufficient for his own use only. The consequence was that men, women, and children died of starvation, and Russia, one of the greatest granaries of the world, had to f a l l back upon the charity of the noncommunistic world to save her from the results of communism.

For that reason, and for the reason that it w ill give tbe Labour unions a chance to wrench the control of their unions from tbe grip of tbe communists, I shall vote for the measure. The honourable member for Angasi n the last Parliament ( Mr Gabb), was sometimes designated ""Mosesf r o m the bullrushes."" Of his illustrious namesake it can t r u l y be said that he became a great leader. Tbe honourable member for Angasi n this Parliament ( Mr Parsons) may be described as a political babe in the' woods. uufamiliarity of bis surroundings. Tbe insipid and inane speech which be has just delivered proves that he has not yet learnt to appreciate his oportunities as a representative of the people. He has yet to learn that substantial argument, and not the irrational conclusions to which he bas given utterance this evening, is necessary in this chamber if his remarks are to have any weight. paid a poor compliment to tbe intelligence of bonorable members when he in dulged in such a tirade of abuse and misrepresentation as he has just given us. He contended that the Labour party is being strangled by communism, that the root cause of Labour's setback is that an irresponsible and extreme section is governing the activities of the movement. He also challenged the objective of the Labour party, saying that it is not consistent w it h Australian ideals. In that connection, let me read the remarks of one for whom tbe honourable member, no. doubt, entertains a high regard. One of tbe leaders of the party to which the honourable member belongs made the following remarks:' I liavc never said, nor do I say now, tliat the Labour party seeks to obtain its objects by violence. The platform of the Labour iparty-abou t which, by the way, we hear vcrv little at election time-make s it perpaid agents .of anti-Labour forces than fectly plain that that party aims' at securing its objects by constitutional methods. There ciinnot be tlie slightest objection to tliat. We on this side of the House hold views that are different from those which are held by honourable members opposite, but we are all entitled to uphold our views by fair argument. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) at least was prepared' to recognize and [39] admit the Labour party's dissociation with the school of thought that advocates alleged foreign doctrine. Tbe honourable member for Angas declares that our views are entirely foreign to Australian sentiment, but the Attorney General admits that we do not countenance the doctrine of violence and the adoption of unconstitutional methods. It is clear that -' the argument of the bonorable member for Angas was based upon false premises, and therefore, his criticism of the Labour movement was structurally unsound. His opinion, I am confident, is shared by very few citizens of Australia. I remind him also that his presence in this chamber is in the nature of a poliH e is entirely lost in the tical accident. Before he has been many months in this Parliament he will find that his views are not endorsed by the majority of the people of his division, notwithstanding that he secured a majority at the ballot-box a few months ago, and I have no doubt that, when next an appeal is made to the people, his predecessor w ill appear again in this chamber as his successor in the represenHe tation of Angas. The honourable member was unfair in his references to-night to trade unionism. I remind h i m that trade unionism is represented in this Parliament by honourable members on this side of tbe House, and our presence here is an absolute, contradiction of his contention that irresponsible extremists have captured the Labour movement. Indeed, it may be said that the irresponsible and arrogant advocates of outrage and violence are sheltered and encouraged byand in concert with the profiteer, rent racker, and tbe general exploiter of society. This subject has been treated witb a certain amount of flippancy. Honourable members opposite bave attempted to pour ridicule upon the suggestion' that, in recent times, at all events, certain extremists have been in their pay. All I can say is that these enemies of Labour could not have worked more effectively as the they did during the last election. Whenever the forces of reaction were impoverished for an election cry in order, to rjlay upon the emotions and feelings of a credulous public, there were ever at hand individuals ready to assist them. One man in particular, who was ""starred'* by the Government as responsible for",48,Latham
168,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [ S . L L ],"so muchdisorder, and who, by tbe way, was not hindered in any respect during the election, volunteered the information that a certain group photograph of communists which he had supplied to a conservative newspaper in Sydney, was a genuine, and not a faked, production. add, was printed on an election poster, with the inquiry, "" Are you going to vote for this or for Bruce? "" I understand that the man referred to actually furnished the photograph to the newspaper which assisted the forces of reaction against the Labour party. paid for it . there are persons of the same class. They do not wish to see the genuine leaders of tbe Labour movement in tbe position of responsibility. They know perfecly well that were Labour in power they would get scant sympathy from the Government of the day. They believe that with th« advent of a government unsympathetic with the cause of the workers, there will be placed on the statute-book repressive measures that are likely to cause resentment aud lead to industrial strife. Tbey live in the hope that if disaffection can be caused among the workers, tbey will be driven to a state of desperation. that a Labour Government, being sympathetic with the aspirations of the people, will endeavour to provide better working conditions, and by improving the environment of the people generally, remove any cause for revolt. Recent events have disclosed that the Government-is the friend of these and other reactionaries, such as Fascisti, who thrive on chaos and disorder. The policy pursued by this Government is calculated to contribute to this end. It is a matter for regret that during the recent election a fictitious issue was placed before the people, and that well reasoned argument proved of no avail. The Government, to save its face, bas brought down this bill. RecentlyI received a pamphlet entitled "" The Communist Danger."" Its author is Mr T. .R. Ashworth, past-president of the Employers Federation. The articles contained in the pamphlet in the Melbourne Age shortly after the seek a mandate from the people. Mr Ashworth, wbo champions the Nationalist cause, stated in the pamphlet that the issue of the election was freedom versus authority-that Labour certainly stood for freedom, and the Nationalist party for authority. I agree that this bill indicates a display of authority rather than a desire to give expression to the will This photograph, I may of the people. Strong opposition must be expected to provisions which seek to associate the legitimate efforts of organized labour with a criminal code. Part II . shows that the Government prefers repressive measures to attempts to improve the economic and industrial conditions of the workers, and seeks to provide further privileges for the wealthy section that it represents. In South Australia Such a measure merits emphatic condemnation. If the Government had been sincere in its avowed desire to protect and maintain tbe great principles for which trade unionism stands, it would have been prepared to accept the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition; but it is not even ready to adopt an attitude of reasonableness. It does not recognize the rights of trade unionists to strive for improved industrial conditions and a greater share than they now enjoy of the wealth that they help to produce. Tbe Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) stated this afternoon that the Government had no intention to intrude upon the domain They are well aware of trade unionism, and that it was regrettable that the proposed amendments of tbe Commonwealth Arbitration Act could not be considered simultaneously with this measure. If the Government recognizes the desirability of bringing down those amendments at the present juncture, what is the urgency for this bill ? Does a state of industrial unrest that demands immediate attention exist in Australia to-day? The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) bas declared that for the last five years the Government has been aware of the presence of disruptive forces in our midst. It cannot, therefore, be said that this is urgent legislation. If Ministers desired to 'be fair to the workers, they would have brought down a bill to amend the Arbitration Act contemporaneously with the introduction of this bill. The far-reaching nature of the provisions of Part II . of the bill suggests a sinister appeared motive on tbe part of the Ministry, in rushing this legislation throuerh immeGovernment had decided to diately after the hysteria of the recent elections Recognizing, as it does, the restricted powers and functions of the",49,Latham

But that would not suit the purposes of the Government. It finds that with industrial unrest, it can play upon the feelings of the people and thus obtain a further tenure of office. From its point of view, that is the first consideration. This Ministry is unable to appreciate the industrial situation, because not one member of it has had a day's experience as an industrialist. the fullness of his knowledge, to tell tbe House of any such experience that he has had. Had the right bonorable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) been a member of the Cabinet, my criticism in this respect would not have held good. cannot truthfully say that, even of the present Government. Honorary Minister claims to have a knowledge of industrial matters, he bas turned it to very poor account. His standing in thb organization to which I belong was such that I would not regard him as a judge of that subject. Surely the evolution of industrialism demands that we shall meet the issues of the moment. Throughout tbe world there is a feeling of discontent in industry-a n aftermath of the recent war-and workmen bave failed to reap tbe reward that scientific discoveries and mechanical progress sbould have provided. Industrialists are regarded, not as beings with souls, but as mere machines. Tbey are looked upon as instruments for profit-making, and Httle consideration is shown for their welfare and the security of theirhomes. Therefore, they challenge the position that confronts tbem. Not until such time as the captains pf industry-wh o to-day, in many instances, have become insolent with wealth recognize their responsibility to be free from the disturbing circumstances that now exist in our community life. As a law-maker and a constitutionalist, I offer no objection to the Government providing safeguards against those who, by violence, would endeavour to overthrow constitutional authority, and adopt the tactics of the bully, but let the Government also remember that it is Its plain duty is to seek essentially its duty and obligation to secure to the great masses of the people a greater share than they now enjoy of the wealth, prosperity, and security that should be the portion of every citizen. remarks in connection with this humbugging measure will be as brief as the occasion warrants. I have bad considerable parliamentary experience, and T regard this as tbe most humbugging bill ever placed before the House. During the war period, the ex-Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) introduced a bill declaring the I leave my friend, iu Industrial Workers of the World to be an unlawful association. At least the right honourable gentleman bad the courage of his convictions, and was prepared to declare a specific organization to be an unlawful body. But we now have the spectacle of this Government telling the country that we are assailed by associations that seek to undermine constitutional government, whose object I do say it. If tbe is to disrupt the peace, order, and good government of this country, and that the communists are the great menace. Wliy has not the Government shown the courage of its convictions and declared those persons to be members of an unlawful association? I challenge the Attorney-General to say whether the Government is prepared to take that step. It is time to end this humbug. On the hustings, the party opposite told the country that Messrs. Donald Grant and Jock Garden, and certain other persons, were "" out to dismember the Empire,"" to disrupt the Constitution, and to upset law and order. Tbe Government obtained a mandate, so it said, to protect the community against the schemes of unlawful associations; but we have it from no less an authority than the Attoisney-General himself, that the Government does not intend-to declare unlawful the propagation of ideas, or to interfere in any way with freedom of speech. tlieir Alli t proposes to do is that if a persoa or an association decides to use force tbe community, will Australia to undermine constitutional authority, it will declare that association unlawful, But the Communist Association will be allowed to preach its doctrine. According to the Attorney-General no action will be taken against the communists. W l i j",50,Latham

When that wrapper is torn off, we see that the object is to deal a deadly blow at trade unionism. If ever I was surprised it was when the right bonorable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) applauded the Government for attacking trade unionism, and compared tbe actions of trade unionists on strike with those of men engaged in a riot. I have a very lively and personal recollection of the right honourable gentleman not many years ago telling the wharf workers of Sydney when they were on strike how to deal with ""blacklegs."" He said: "" There is an easy way to deal with them. Let them go down the holds, and then drop a few bundles down, and it will be as hard to find a scab in the hold of a ship as the cross of Christ in the bottom of hell."" That was said by the right honourable gentleman who now preaches to us ! It is about time we were done with this kind of humbug. The right honourable member, wbo condemns strikes to-day, made his reputation as a strike leader, and it ill becomes him, above any man, to cast reflections on trade unionists who stand staunchly and solidly for their principles.

180,Mr Mahony,"The bonorable memwere sent to j a i l , transported, and exiled from their wives and .families for helping to improve the conditions of their fellow workers. To-day we are throwing back hundreds of years. Coercion to suppress trade unions has been tried time and time again, and as fast as it has been tried it has failed. It will f a i l towith the attack on trade unionism that day, just as it failed centuries ago. Trade unionism cannot be suppressed by tyranny or coercion. There was never a revolution that was not born of the poverty misery, and despair of the people. The way to remedy the present evils is not to indulge in coercive legislation, but to face the facts fairly , as sensible men and women, and ascertain what is the matter with the system of to-day. As a life-long trade unionist, I say that the present arbitration system, which was created about 25 years ago, has outgrown its usefulness. It may have been all right 25 years ago, but. the conditions then were different from those of to-day. We must now adopt a different outlook. The Government has the mandate, and I am required only to point in a humble way to the fault . arbitration suggest 1 on that subject when the Government has the courage and time to submit its promised Arbitration B ill . The serious problem with which we are dealing is facing not only Australia, but the whole of the civilized world, and it is of no use attempting to cloud the issue by screaming something about a red menace fro m Russia. To-day Russia is gripped by the capitalistic system as firmly as she ever was. Shouting little catch-cries or conspiring with the press wil l not silence the voice of Labour. member think it is possible to silence the voice of Labour! it very effectively during the election campaign by means of its paid press. As a rule, I am able to obtain a little publicity from the press, but even I failed to do so during this campaign, and I assure honourable members that it was not for the want of trying. While we are talking about the press, I should like to ask the Government how much it paid the proprietors of the Sydney Daily Telegraph to distribute freely the thousands of copies of its newspaper that were broadcast just prior to the election. That would be in teresting information. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), to whom I referred a few minutes ago, will not be a member of this Parliament for many more months. ' It is an open secret where he is going, and that Mr Archdale Parkhil l will be his successor here. I am greatly surprised that he should conclude his parliamentary career he delivered in.this chamber last evening, and that he should assist the Government to place this obnoxious measure on our statute-book. We shall not cure our industrial ills u n t il we improve anv arbitration methods. One of the glaring faults of the system to-day is that unsuitable judges are appointed. W it h all due respect, and without making any personal reflections upon them, I say that in some cases they are quite untrained and unfitted' to discharge the work that devolves upon them.

192,Mr Mahony,"F a r be it from me,been tbe cause of more industrial unrest tban any other single thing that I could name! ment to make. honourable member for North Sydney would think it a silly statement, for he was responsible for the appointment of Sir John Quick as a Deputy President of the court. There were some reasons for that appointment which I shall take the opportunity of alluding to on some other occasion. Tbe reference would be out of order just now. The judgment to which I draw attention has been responsible for Mort's Dock, Sydney, locking out 1,500 men, although the dispute really concerns only 20 men. It arose in this way. A certain number of men are casually employed by tbe company as painters and deckel's Their duty is to clean and paint the bottoms of ships' while these are in dock. Sir John Quick, in an award covering their employment, provided that they were to be classed as permanent and not casual employees. It was pointed out to His Honour in court that if he made an award in those terms trouble was certain to occur; but he did so. Mort's Dock ""Limited naturally classed theso men as permanent and not temporary, and so was entitled to pay them less than casual rates. The men protested, but tbe management pointed out that it was acting in accordance witb the terms of the award. Thereupon, the men ceased work. Subsquently the firm locked out from its employment 1,500 men. The remedy for that kind of thing is not to declare the strikers criminals, and imprison them for one or two years, with the option of deporting them at the end of that term if tbey happen to have been born out of Australia; it is to reconstruct our arbitration machinery so as to make such absurd award impossible. The only way to solve the industrial problem is to get into close grips witb it . Employers and employees should meet round the table and talk matters over sensibly as man to man. If the Government does not improve our industrial arbitration methods and >ersists in placing on the statute-book ! egislotion of this description, it will be necessary to build many more gaols than we have. The number of criminals that may be made by reason of the provisions of this measure would more than fill all our jails. Australia is not in a state of industrial unrest, though one might think so from newspaper reports. We have, as a matter of fact, less industrial trouble than any other country in the world. America and Great Britain are seriously involved in it. But they do not advertise the fact to the world. They do not shriek from tbe house-tops that they are on the verge of a revolution, and so undermine their financial stability. Just recently Great Britain bas been through one of the most serious industrial upheavals in her history, but her statesmen did not broadcast the fact, nor were they afraid that the country would pass into the hands of the revolutionaries, or that Lenin and his ""red army"" would sweep down on London and take the city by storm. They faced the problem properly and solved it. It is of no more use for honourable members opposite to prate about revolution than it is for the editors of city newsHis Honour papers to sit in their dingy offices and squirt their dirty ink over the trade unionists of this country. That may win a temporary victory for the Government, but it will do nothing to solve the problem. Seeing that the city newspaper editors are so interested in the industrial problem, may I suggest that the Primo Minister should call them to a conference, and ask them to submit to him their proposals for its solution. If we really desire to ensure permanent industrial peace we must treat the matter as serious minded men and women would do. The Government would be well advised to shelve this measure for tbe time being, and introduce its amendments to tbe Arbitration Act. We sbould then be able to see what practical proposals it has for improving, the machinery of the court. Coercive measures of this character, designed to suppress trade unionism, will not satisfactorily solve tbe social problem. I urge the Government to give some sane and calm consideration to devising constructive legislative proposals to assure the welfare ancl advancement of Australia. sonal explanation.

I was hopeful that honourable members would have had the opportunity to consider the measure in conjunction with the proposed amendment of the Arbitration Act . I quite appreciate the position in which the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) found himself. He has laboured indefatigably to frame these provisions, and I have no doubt that the demands which w ill be made upon him by the other measure w ill be even more exacting. step in the direction of tightening up our industrial legislation. The speeches and actions of honourable members opposite have absolutely assured the passage of the.bill. It is of supreme importance not only to industrial workers, but also fco every citizen in Australia, and it w ill vitally effect the development of this country. able members opposite to assist to pass it , and thus place their party in a position from which they could face the future with confidence. Although they oppose it they have not advanced one reason in justification of the withholding of the unanimous support of the Labour party. A t the recent elections the industrial conditions existing in Australia overshadowed every other consideration. The question was seriously weighed by the large body of unionists who have raised unionism to the position that it occupies in Australia to-day. Honourable members know how profoundly it moved the solid body of Labour from one end of Australia to the other. Before the introduction of this measure suggestions were made reI take very strong exgarding the attitude that honourable members of the Opposition intended to adopt when it was brought forward. It was stated that they would champion the cause of persons who had proved a curse to Australia. Y e t since the inception of the debate not one word of apology has been offered for those men. If the Government had not taken prompt action to deal with this dangerous element it would be false to the promise that it made on the hustings. I want to state a few home truths for the benefit of my friends opposite. I like them; and if they would be guided by the dictates of their consciences they would be liked by everybody. They are not allowed to do t h a t; they are merely machines that respond mechanically to the instructions they receive from outside. go so far afield as Moscow to receive bad instructions; they are issued from a spot not a great deal beyond the eaves of this building. I want to know whether my honourable friends intend to embrace tbe magnificent opportunity that now presents itself to bring about their political salvation. BeforeI embarked upon my campaign I had many casual talks with good, sound Labour men-the right type of Labour men.

Tbat was fully proved during the election, as honourable members opposite know. members opposite so mealy-mouthed concerning the men who were wrecking this country and ruining its interests, and at the same time doing a greater injury to the great Labour party than to any other section of the community? Tbe bonorton), along with other honourable members opposite, was notably prudent in his statements. always fairly so. His method of speech is mystifying. He has a. mysterious way of making a partial statement and coming back later to introduce the completion of it, where it does not fit, thus destroying the proper sequence of his remarks. champion at that kind of address, and on that account is probably more dangerous than is the blatant fellow who says straight out what be thinks. Judging by the honourable member's smiles, he takes what I have said concerning bim as a compliment. I have no doubt that be will continue to speak in the same fashion to the end. All the talk we have had about the provisions of this bill being a direct blow at unionism and decent unionists is utter, abominable rubbish. It is hypocritical rubbish, as honourable members opposite know. Tbe Prime Minister today delivered a very fine speech, witli a sincerity that is' characteristic of him. He uttered words of wisdom, and displayed a burningdesire to protect honourable members opposite from tbe error of their ways, and to save tbe people whom tbey were sent here to represent, but whom tbey will not represent if they do not vote for this bill. No man who took an interest in the last federal election and went from one end of the country to the other will refuse to admit that the electors never before expressed such an overwhelming desire for the return to power of the party on this side. collected in Melbourne had something to do with its return. with it than tbe last little spider that bit the honourable member when he was sleeping. There never was a time in the history of this Parliament when the people of Australia were waiting so anxiously for a word from honourable members opposite on this question. What has so far been said in this debate from the other side to satisfy those souls that are in anguish lest the temple of Labour, built up by tbeir struggles over a quarter of a century, be destroyed because men charged with its safety may prove unfaithful and permit a condition of things to continue iu this country Avhich may mean tbe loss for a score of years to come of tbe magnificent work done by earnest patriotic supporters of Labour?

I know that tbe people of Kalgoorlie will learn what is taking place here, and so will the people, generally, of Western Australia. They will recognize that what honourable members opposite have to say will not help them very much. I am speaking to my honourable friends opposite, not in anger, but in sorrow, and with a desire to put them on the right track. It is unnecessary that I should repeat what was said to-day by the Prime Minister. I made similar statements to the electors every night for six weeks, and I never met people more receptive or more terribly in earnest. Those people expect that the Prime Minister will fulfil every promise he made. If he does not do so, I for one shall turn against him without hesitation. I know, however, that he will do so. I shall have ten times as much to say on tbe bill which is to follow this measure, and when its pi ovisions are known it will be seen that this bill is much more necessary than honourable members opposite realize. tbe bonorable member should have been considered before this bill. bers opposite say something on this bill, or let it go through at once. see now how the last election was won.

I shall not say much about tbe labour which tbe honourable member claims to bave performed, but some day, when bis biography is written, we shall find that he was never on the bread-line, and his hours of labour were not fixed by an Arbitration Court award. had greater advantages, and when the history of his life is written it will be seen that there was more luck than good judgment or hard graft in it. The honourable member made a most passionate appeal, and I want to suggest that that was tbe way in which honourable members opposite won the last election. I do not oppose the provisions of tbe bill which the Government secured a mandate to put into effect against unlawful associations and those elements in our midst which it was stated were menacing tbe welfare of tbe community. During the elections, consideration of strikes and their effect upon the development of the country went by the board. the subject when the community was being stampeded during the elections. The honourable member for Swan( Mr country live, and advocates such methods Gregory) knows what exerted the greatest influence during the elections. He knows that postcards were sent to every elector, exhibiting two flags, one tbe Australian flag and the other a red flag, with tbe question, "" Wliich do you stand for ?"" He knows also of the publication of a photograph in which Jock Garden appears, and wbich it is alleged was faked. I saw it for the first time to-day. It is a photograph of the executive of the Third one corner and at an angle that does not fit the rest of the picture. Tbat is the kind of thing which the party on the other side used to stampede tbe people. it is a perfectly genuine photograph, and that be is proud of it. Gardeni f he lay on bis stomach in this chamber and swore that be was white. I should expect, if he were washed, to find that he was of quite a different colour. If the Prime Minister is prepared to rely on the word of Jock Garden, he can do so. I would not do so, and if the right honourable gentleman wishes to know something of GardenI advise him to look up the answer to a question that wa3 asked in the Senate concerning a man who was employed by tbe Defence Department, and the way in which he was hoisted out of it . He might ask why he wasallowed to travel the country and scab upon Nationalist organizers. Men of bis type were the best organizers tbe Ministerial party had. Mi*. COOK -I s not Mr Garden secretary of the Trades and Labour Council, in Sydney? acts in that capacity, it does not give him any authority todominate the political policy of the Labour party. His attainments may fit him for the position of secretary, and he may carry out his duties admirably; but I am not prepared to march behind him as a leader along the road to that social salvation for which we are all looking. I have no objection to that part of tbe bill wbich deals with unlawful associations, and makes provision for the deportation of certain people, because any man who adopts an attitude that is likely to bring bim within the purview of this measure, or any man who does not like the social conditions under which the people of this of reform, ought to get out of it. A l though tbe Government was returned to power qn the issue of communism, it is not entitled to fasten communism on tbe Labour party.

Those dreadful conditions of labour dissociate have, ceased because of the efforts of from communism, or because organized labour. The' honourable mem first; but ber for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) spoke of his working days, and of the labour he has done, but can he show a record like that of organized labour? The fight is even harder to-day because the combinations of capital are so intricate, and if a man should go off the beaten track and talk out of his turn he is likely to be treated as a criminal and imprisoned. If be persists in the cause in which he believes, he is liable to be sent overseas if he was not born in Australia. If I chose to take up a line of action that would bring me within the provisions of this bill, I might be sent back to England, while my daughter and her three children would remain in Australia. That is the sort of legislation we have brought in by a Government that, states its belief in trade unions and its love for its fellow men. We are now asked to link working men with the criminals of the community. I take it that a crime is something done to injure deliberately and with malice aforethought some person or persons, or the general community. comes w it h in the category of criminal action, but when we have a body of men banded together with the idea of selling their labour in the markets of the world, it is, as I have said before, totally u n f a i r with the pure merino Australian. It is not to regard them as criminals. They are merely following the example set to them by capitalism. Capitalists who can corner a market, and secure a monopoly, increase the price of the commodities they have to sell, and if there is a shortage of labour, men are brought in from overseas at the expense of the. general community to keep down wages. The workers cannot successfully compete with the controllers of industry, and this legislation will deal with them immediately they attempt to do so. It w ill not be the rank and file of unionists, but tbeir leaders, who w ill be haled before a court, and deported, if they come w it h in the purview of the act, and if they were not born in Australia. Honourable members of tbe Opposition are acknowledging the result of the appeal to the people when they ask that the industrial provisions so obnoxious to labour sbould be taken out of this bill, and dealt with, if necessary, in an amendment of tbe A r b i tration Act. Certain penalties could be provided for in that act, but they should not be too drastic or of tbe unfair character of those contained i u the bill before us. The right honourable member for No r t h Sydney( Mr Hughes) has pointed out that no matter what legislation we may pass, we shall never prevent strikes or lock-outs. Wbo can define a lock-out? In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred disputes can be so manipulated that the blame is thrown on the operatives. The contention raised by bonorable members of the Opposition is not ouly based on our perusal of the measure, but is also supported by certain sections of the press of the Commonwealth. I shall quote fro m the leading article published on Wednesday, the 3rd February, in the Adelaide Registera conservative journal. Under the heading of "" Enforcing a Mandate,"" the leading article, inter alia, saysBut an objectionable feature of the earlier law-the distinction drawn between Australian-born and British-born disturbers of the social or industrial peace-is perpetuated in the bill. An Australian native, no matter how gravely he may offend, cannot be expelled, though he may be imprisoned up to one or two years; a native of the British Isles, even if he has lived We know what usually here for 25 years, may be both imprisoned and deported. The latter, for the purposes of the bill, is classed with Russians and other foreigners; his British citizenship avails him nothing, and the longest term of residence in the Commonwealth fails to put him on a par wise for the Commonwealth, as we have urged before, to discriminate in its legislation between Australian-born and Australians who have settled here from the Motherland; and the discrimination is no less injurious because it is applied under the trade-and commerce or other provisions of tbe Constitution, instead of under the immigration section. That is tbe voice, not of Labour, but of the tory element of South Australia. In that State Labour has only a weekly journal; but no Labour newspaper could have dealt more effectively than the Register did with the Government's wrongful discrimination between British born and Australian-born citizens. The leading article also deals w i th the industrial provisions of the b ill , and bears out the argument used by tbe Leader of tbe Opposition when moving his amendment. It readsThe association of revolutionary and industrial .activities is open to objection, but the difficulty of the Government is plain. Certain strikes which have inflicted incalculable loss and suffering upon the community have been of a frankly revolutionary character: they have not been genuine industrial disputes, but disturbances created for the purpose of making the "" capitalist"" conduct of industry impossible, and in the hope that they will lead to a revolutionary upheaval. Nevertheless, tlie Government is aiming at the acquisition of dangerously drastic powers. It seeks the right to imprison and deport persons engaged in "" a lockout or strike"" in the circumstances indicated. Imagine the position reversed, and a Labour Government in power proclaiming the existence of "" a serious industrial disturbance,"" are silly, it might be as well to preclude and seeking the imprisonment and deportation of ship-owners who -may have been driven to lay up their steamers by a. course of WalshJohnsonism. Doubtless the word ""lookout"" -a n elastic indefinable term-ha s been inserted in proof of the Ministry's impartiality, and witli little expectation that the power will ever be invoked. But it is not good policy to pass laws in tlie belief that they will be permitted to remain inoperative; nor, for that matter, is it easy to believe that the expulsion of one or two strife-promoters, for whose benefit much of the elaborate mechanism of the new Crimes Bill appears to have been devised, would automatically terminate the troubles which have lately convulsed the waterfront. We shall nob reach finality in the CrimesB ill , and it is a dangerous power to put in the hands of any government. If this bill becomes law the Register foresees the t danger of a Labour Government followi ng any example set by this Government. I remind the Ministry of the truth of Abraham Lincoln's words, that you may fool some of the people all the time, and you may fool all the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. If this legislation is on the statute-book when Labour returns to power, according to the Register, we may use it , and if honourable members opposite know why strikes are caused, and who are responsible for them, it will be just as easy for us to gain that information in regard to lockouts. able that that should be done. and is given effect in the manner advocated by some irresponsible supporters of the Government, the Labour.party, when in power, w ill in turn be able to take action against any Australian capitalist, born overseas, who causes a lockout in this country. The Register points out how the Labour party could use that power, and how dangerous it would be in the hands of any government. member think that there is anything in that argument? those in control of.the Register would be pleased to hear that their leading articles were silly. I believe that the leading articles of that newspaper did a lot to secure a mandate for the Government. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) suggested that the PrimeM in ister should call together the editors of all newspapers, and should ask them for their solution of the difficulty. If the honourable member for Pawkner suggests that the leading articles of the Register its editor from the suggested conference. cards that the Labour party when returned to power will have to administer the CrimesA c t . The honourable member does not suggest that a Labour Government might do anything unjust. suggests that a Labour Government might misuse that power. It may happen that in time of stress our passions will override our sense of justice, and we may do 1 things under this legislation which would not otherwise be possible. It is dangerous to have in the house poison which is uot labelled. Government would do what is just, as we intend to do. lation is passed the honourable member's intention w ill be carried into effect, but we have reason to doubt it , because during the election the Government made use of greatly exaggerated statements. It grossly misrepresented the menace of communism, and the Labour party's connection with that movement. It knew f u l l well that communism played a small part in the Labour organization. The methods used by the Government are not We are quite agreealways clean, and I should like an assurance from tlie honourable member for If this bill is passed, Fawkner that this legislation, if passed, will not be put to an immoral use. I take uo exception to that portion of the b ill which deals w it h unlawful associations, but I hope that it w ill not be used injudiciously aud unfairly . The necessity may arise for the Commonwealth Government to be clothed with that power. I shall support the amendment'moved by the Leader of the Opposition, and I hope that the Government will accept it . The the honourable trade union movement of this country should be placed on a proper footing, and any infringement of the arbitration laws I do not think that should be treated as a misdemeanour, and not as a crime.

I defy any one to say that I have been in any way associated witb communists, or any other section of the community which desires to bring about the realization of their ideals by force or violence. I would not harm any one. I do not wisb to see even my worse enemy suffer in the slightest degree. my means, but I do not .wish them any bodiily harm. of the communists do not extend further than I desire in the hope for tbe regeneration of the world; but I . do not wish to force my ideas down the throats of other people. I wish them, however, to understand the principles which I advocate. Those of us who are seeking improved conditions for the working classes in Australia will, of course, make mistakes, and we may have to alter our methods; but we do not wish to be stamped as criminals. Those who are fighting_ today for what they believe to be right will eventually win out; and if tbe present generation does not derive benefit, our children will value the privileges we bave won for them, [i0.5] I desire to define my attitude on this measure as clearly and as briefly as possible. I am opposed to the bill, lock, stock, and barrel, as I believe it has been framed with tbe sole intention of suppressing trade unionism, and tbe persecution of trade union officials throughout Australia. We have been informed by tbe Attorney-General( Mr Latham) that some of its provisions are to enable action to be taken against unlawful associations. No sucb association is menEvery action tioned in tbe bill, and if trouble occurred -it would be difficult for the government of the day to prove that any organization was an unlawful association.

If I were directed to control an political opponents by fair industrial dispute in the pastoral, or any other industry in Australia.

It has been stated, particularly during tbe election campaign, that the members of the Labour party were associated with the communists. Thousands of pounds were spent on misleading tbe electors, and the Government was returned to oflice under false pretences. It attained power through the expenditure of unlimited capital, and I suppose one would be safe in saying that probably £1,000,000 was spent during tbe last election in defeating the Labour party. Tbe press of Australia was at tbe disposal of tbe Government and its supporters, and numerous canvassers went from door to door in tbe various constituencies misrepresenting the Labour party by saying that we were (West Sydney) the agents of Russia, and were supporters of communistic principles.

Tbe only exceptions to that Bruce) did not receive a mandate from tbe people to legislate in tbe manner oroposed in tbe bill.

The real responsibility for it rested with the Britisb owners, who reduced the wages of some seamen from £10 to £9 per month, and of others from £9 to £8.

Their duty was to support the strike, and had I been in their place I would have done as they did. Indeed, I told the electors of West Sydney that I was supporting the seamen, and would assist tbem in every possible way to win tbeir fight. The Labour party opposed the deportation legislation regardless of the individuals to whom it applied. We did not care whether the men menaced were Walsh and Johannsen, or Brown and Jones; no government should have power to deport Australian citizens. Under the Immigration Act of 1925 the Commonwealth Government has power to secretly drag a man away from his wife and family and send him to worse than death --exile. power. Once a man, be he a Russian, Frenchman, German, Dane, or Swede, Mr Lambert. bas resided five years in Australia and becomes naturalized, he sbould not be rule are Asiatics. This bill contains very drastic proposals relating to trade unionism, strikes, and lockouts. If honourable members will read tbe industrial history of some of the great trade unions operating in Australia to-day, particularly tbe Australian Workers Union, they will find that not many years ago in regard to navigation. workers were shot down like dogs, imprisoned for fifteen to twenty years, or How then hunted like wild beasts, because they had dared to attempt to improve their conditions. This bill is a return to the by tbe dark ages, when men were persecuted, We have beard a racked, and thrown into dungeons for standing up in. defence of their rights. Honourable members opposite seek to blame the workers for every industrial shipdispute. In the coal-mining industry the miners have always been fighting for safe working conditions, proper testing apparatus, and decent wages. In the metalliferous mines men had to work in heat, foul air,and dust so thick that when their knowledge, bethey came off shift only the whites of their eyes could be distinguished. In the BrokenH ill cemetery 80,000 of the young Johannsen and Walsh were men of Australia, victims of dust, leadSeamen's poisoning, and other diseases incidental to Were they to condemn their tbe mining industry, are buried. Yet the miners who fight to improve their conditions will be classed by this legislation as criminals, and disturbers of the peace. What of the BrokenH ill mine-owners, who have drawn from the bowels of the earth dividends amounting to over £20,000,000 ? What of the coal mine-owners who have been enriched by the industry? Tbey must share with the workers who produce the wealth at the risk of their lives the responsibility for industrial upheavals. The Government should not act vindictively towards the workers; it should not legislate hastily or hysterically. This rotten, brutal, unfair, and almost criminal proposal is a product of hysteria. It is a foolish and meddlesome measure that is liable to create more disturbances and strikes than any other legislation ever submitted to this Parliament. The Government may endeavour to suppress unionism, but the more it is oppressed tbe more virile it will become. That has been the experience of Tbis bill will continue that many tyrannical governments, czars, and dictators throughout the ages. It is impossible to stem the tide of human progress. progresses the masses get a better understanding of tbeir rights. ""With the greater facilities for education that now exist, tbe people have a new outlook. It is as futile to attempt to annihilate this movement as to crush the world by dropping a feather on rob their longing for progress. of this bill will not close my mouth. I refuse to be robbed of my right of free speech. I shall not act the part of a coward when the rights of the workers are in jeopardy. If Providence places me in a position demanding action, I hope that I shall be worthy of the trust reposed in me. I should be prepared to go to jail in the interests of my fellow men. union leader, and every sincere trade unionist in Australia. Tf the Government attempts to deport those who defy it, 50,000 militant trade .unionists, who vvill not stand for this legislation, will have to be deported. Andi f persons not born in Australia, but who are now citizens of Australia, are to be deported, it will mean the deportation of 50,000 more. Most of the men who have come here from other countries are genuine workers. They have joined the Australian trade unions, and are prepared to fight for better conditions. The Government proposes to deport citizens of this country if they do not subscribe to its political creed, or dance to its tune; it matters not whether they have been citizens of this country for 50 years. If my father were now alive, he would be about 95 years of age, and under this measure he would be liable to deportation if he raised his voice against injustice to the working class. ber's father would have far too much sense to act unwisely. agitator for the rights of the working class, and in that respect he was for many years my tutor. never be afraid to follow in his footsteps. This bill, if passed, will not do a great deal of damage, because immediately the Government attempts to imprison or deport industrial workers, there will be a general dislocation of. industry. I hope that it will not pass. If one or two of my fellow workers were deported, _ I should do my best to disorganize the industry in which I was employed, and I As humanity sbould probably succeed. If deportation became general, chaos, disorganization, dislocation, and probably revolution, would follow. If the liberties of the workers are to be interfered witb in the manner proposed in this bill, tbey would be justified in taking any steps to preit. The Government cannot serve the rights for which they have the workers of Australia of fought for centuries. The passing -Afte r tbe able introductory speech of the Attorney-General, it is not necessary for me to say a great deal. The Attorney-General referred to the dangers of communism. Those dangers are as real in Australia as in any other country. The Prime Minister, in an explicit addiess this afternoon, explained the provisions of the proposed new sub-section 30j. Like the Tbat"" spirit characterizes every honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), I found the recent campaign very strenuous. Everywhere I went I was struck with the seriousness with which all sections of tbe communityparticularly trade unionists-regarde d the issues at stake. Consequently, I feel it incumbent on me to draw attention to what I consider is one of the most sacred promises ever made by an Australian Prime Minister, namely, that . if this Government were returned, the right honourable gentleman would take all necessary steps to deal .with the unrest in Australia caused by ihe British seamen's strike, or similar disturbances. He stated that bis Government would act in tbe interests of all sections of tbe community. I also made a promise to my constituents, and that is the main reason for my rising to-night. T promised tbem ' that if I were elected to this Parliament, I would, by my voice and vote, support the Prime Minister in any action which he deemed necessary in the interests of Australia. We have had in the debate on this measure a number of good speeches concerning trade unionism. I have no doubt that honourable members opposite were perfectly sincere in' all that they said. TheyI hope that I shall have had considerably more experience in industrial matters than I , and, perhaps, many other honourable members on this side of the House, have had; but I suggest that the excellent dissertations on trade unionism to which we bave been treated have nothing whatever to do with tbe bill.

It is unfortunate that we have not had an opportunity to consider the proposed amendment of the Arbitration Act, which may be regarded as the complement to the bill now before the House, but I am satisfied that tbe right honourable tbe Prime Minister will fulfil the promise which he gave to the people, and that when the measure referred to is before us it will be on perfectly sound lines. Tbe Government represents the majority in this Parliament. Our friends opposite have, on many occasions, referred to Parliament as the high court of the land. That was before they became enamoured of the High Court in consequence of its decision concerning tbe recent deportation proceedings. The honnan) will agree that it would not be right to expect any judge of the High Court to make a pronouncement not in keeping with the judicial functions of that tribunal, such as taking the responsibility to issue this "" proclamation. As the Prime Minister said this afternoon, any government that did not consider the interests of the community generally would be quickly hurled from office, because Australia is a democratic country, and any laws passed must be ratified by tbe people. I presume that before any proclamation is issued under this measure the Government will be satisfied that the circumstances justify drastic action, to prevent the community from suffering as it suffered during tbe unfortunate seamen's strike. Honourable members opposite have said a good deal about the interests of the wage earners' and trade unionists. I remind them of another section of the people-the primary producers-who bave to be content with what their produce returns to them in tbe home or overseas markets. fortunately, the primary producers in the Gladstone district of north Queensland, in common with other parts of the Commonwealth, . suffered very severely during the recent shipping Their produce was rotting wharfs, and consequently their wages, in the form of returns on its sale, were withheld from them. I feel sure that honourable members opposite are broad minded enough to admit that the primary producers of Australia should not be penalized in this manner. I subMr Gardner. mit, therefore, that this legislation is entirely justified, that it will work no injustice.to.trade unionism, and that it will be distinctly in the interests of tbe community generally.
