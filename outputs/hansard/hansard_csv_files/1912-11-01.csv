Mr W. J. JOHNSON -Has the Minister of Trade and Customs seen the cablegram which appears in to-day's newspapersBefore the Empire Trade Commission to-day evidence was given by the delegate from the proprietary medicines section of the London Chamber of Commerce. He pointed out the detrimental effect of the Australian Commerce Act on British exporters of medicines and patent providing that the ingredients which comfoods. He protested against the adoption of legislation dictated by an interested sectionnamely, the Government medical advisers. Will the honourable gentleman give us tbe assurance that the Government medical advisers have no pecuniary or personal interest in the manufacture or sale of patent medicines ? the assurance that our medical advisers have no pecuniary interest in the manufacture or sale of patent medicines. the amendment of the Commerce Act to make it tighter? patent medicines are dealt with in two publications issued by the British Medical Association, entitled Secret Remedies and More Secret Remedies. When these patent medicines are brought to Australia we prohibit their importation until many of the extravagant claims made in respect of their virtues when they are sold in other parts of the world have been removed from the bottles and packages. These medicines are not allowed to be imported with all the extravagant advertising matter which is allowed to be attached to them in other places, but, unfortunately, we cannot interfere in regard to anything that may be done after importation, and the advertisements which are published in our newspapers contain many of the statements which are considered objectionable. I am «orry that our lending weekly newspapers are the worse offenders in allowing the publication of these advertisements which would not be allowed to come into the Commonwealth if imported with the articles. The Melbourne Australasian and the Sydney Bulletin are among the worse . newspapers in the Commonwealth for allowing the advertising of patent medicines by statements which are not allowed to be attached to the medicines when imported. The heads of our Quarantine and I have asked for as Commerce brandies who advise the Government in this matter are actuated, I believe, only by the highest motives, their desire being that the people shall get fair value for the stuff that .they purchase. I am not in favour of any relaxation of the provisions of the Commerce Act in the direction which seems to have been suggested by the witnesses appearing before the Empire Trade Commission. If the Commerce Act is amended in respect to this matter, it will be in the direction of pose patent medicines shall be published, together with the iprice of those ingredients, so that the public may know what they are buying. In some cases patent medicines, whose ingredients have cost only id. or Jd., have been sold for 4s. 6d.

That the Bill be now re-committed to a Committee of the whole House for the reconsideration of clause 1 of the First Schedule. In Committee (Recommittal) : ister and . Treasurer) [10.57] -Honorabl e members will recollect that when this Bill was formerly under consideration the question arose as to whether payment ought not to be made in case of accident at an earlier stage than was provided for. I promised to consider the matter, and to ascertain if anything could be done in that direction. Since then, the Attorney-General has drafted an amendment to the schedule which provides that in case of incapacity the result of an accident extending over six days, or one week, payment shall be made for the whole week. In its present form the Bill provides that there must be at least two weeks disablement before compensation can be paid for the first week. I move That in paragraph (a) the words "" if the incapacity lasts less than two weeks no compensation shall be payable in respect of the first week and "" be left out. If these words are omitted clause 4 will then operate, and any person who is incapacitated for a week as the result of an accident will be paid compensation for that period. I have no doubt that in the case of a bona fide accident extending over a few days it would be much cheaper to make an arrangement of the kind proposed than to set the whole machinery of the Bill in motion. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [11.0] -My own opinion is that there should be no limitation of the kind imposed.

68,. Mr Fisher (Wide Bay,"Prime Minbe able to return to work within a week; and, under the circumstances, he ought not to lose compensation. I understand, however, that the Prime Minister thinks that it would be a saving of money to enter into the arrangement suggested rather than put the whole machinery of the Bill into operation, and that he intends to issue instructions to that effect. Mr J. H . CATTS I would rather see a direct provision made in the Bill, but in Parliament we cannot get all we' desire, and, under the circumstances, I have to ac-cept the Prime Minister's decision. I merely wish to say these few words in order that it may not be thought I have forgotten the protest I made previously. There are a great number of men employed at the Fitzroy Dock building destroyers for the Commonwealth under the State Government, who have contracted with the Commonwealth, and I should like to know whether those men will come under the Bill. ister and Treasurer) [11.5] I do not -think so. There can be no question about the ability of the State Government to pay any compensation, and, therefore, the Commonwealth could not suffer any monetary loss. those men already under the Public Service Act of New South Wales. Commonwealth is directly concerned in any way, but even if we were, there is ample recourse against the State. orable member for South Sydney was quite right to ask the question, but I think there is no doubt as to the answer. When clause 6 was under consideration a similar doubt crossed my mind, but I did not think it worthwhile to raise the point, because I .dare say the Government will make some arrangement. The Prime Minister is right to move the amendment he has, though I must say that, in view of clause 4, the Bill is not quite consistent. a man is injured for six days, he will get a week's pay. consistent, but more humanitarian. interjected a moment or two ago I was not seized of the point raised by the honourable member for South Sydney. I see, however, that, according to clause 6, where the Commonwealth contract for the execution of any work, the Commonwealth is liable for compensation, and I ask whether that does not make us liable for injuries caused to workmen employed by the State under contract with the Commonwealth. It is true that the men at Fitzroy Dock may receive compensation now, in the event of injury or accident, but the question is whether the responsibility will not, under clause 6, lie on the Commonwealth. ister and Treasurer) [11.10] -That is a good point to raise, but it is advisable for the Commonwealth to take more statutory power than it needs to employ. I think that the State would see to any cases of accident occurring under such a contract, and there is, I fancy, a reserve power in the Bill regarding contractors. There is power on the part of the Commonwealth to see that the sub-contractor shall place himself in a position to pay compensation, though, of course, failing that, the Commonwealth has to bear the burden. I prefer not to discuss the question of liability as lying between two distinct representatives of the Crown. The arguments we have heard would be all very well if the Bill spoke of sub-contractors, but it deals with contractors. culty can arise. and New South Wales is a sovereign State. sued. However, I will undertake to enter into negotiations with the States on the point, in order to make sure of the position. -This is a provision of which the corresponding section under the Imperial Act, has given rise to considerable doubt. Its object is especially drawn attention to in one of the text-books by Mr Willis in the following wordsEmployment under contractors : Object of the Section -The primary object of the section is to prevent an employer from escaping liability by contracting with some one else to provide labour or to execute work, and to give a workman, employed by a contractor, a double security for his compensation, which, but for this provision, he might lose through the poverty of his direct employer.",19,Commonwealth Workmen S Compensation Bill

83,Mr Groom (Darling Downs) [11.12].,"Referring to the words "" any work undertaken by the principal,"" in the Imperial Act, lie says"" It appears therefore that the expression limits Workmen's Compensation Act how could the application of tlie section to such work as the principal may fairly be said to undertake the execution of or to engage in, in the ordinary course of following his trade or business, and to exclude all work which he cannot reasonably be said to undertake as part of his trade or business."" The principle apparently is that if a workman is injured through an accident in the course of his employment, he has to be paid compensation by the employer who is carrying on the business or undertaking. If such an employer sub-contracts a portion of the undertaking, and a workman is injured, the employer is still liable, but if there be an independent contract, say, for the erection of a factory in which to carry on the undertaking, then he contractor becomes liable. I take it that the Commonwealth is putting itself in a similar position as an employer. If the Commonwealth were carrying on large woollen mills any workman injured through an accident in the course of his employment would be entitled to compensation, and the sub-contracting of a portion of the undertaking would not enable the Commonwealth to escape liability. If the Commonwealth contract for the building of a cruiser, either with a private individual or a State, then that private individual or the State has complete control, and becomes liable for any compensation. It will be seen, therefore, that in the case of Federal works in Sydney, carried out by the State under contract with the Commonwealth, it is the State which, having full control, becomes liable. For instance, we agree with shipping companies to carry our mails; we make a contract with them is exactly the same whether it be made with the Government or with private individuals. that if a man employs another to carry out an independent contract, the independent contractor is to be responsible to the workmen for injuries sustained by them while in his employment. The Commonwealth is taking up that position under this Bill. Whoever directly gives employment to the man in an undertaking must pay him compensation in the event of-his being injured in the course of his employment, and this liability cannot be evaded by sub-contracting. it be held liable for injury sustained by its workmen ? arranged with the Government of a State where there was no Workmen's Compensation Act in force to build a ship for us, it would be fair for us to require as one of the conditions of the contract that the State Government should arrange to compensate any workmen employed by them in the construction of that ship who met with injury in the course of his employment. If we asked a State to carry out any work for us we could request that one of the conditions of the contract be that any of its men injured while carrying out that work should be compensated by it. The Commonwealth could not legislate for the State. My desire is that every State should follow the lines of this legislation I think that the Bill as drafted will carry out fairly well the principle we have in view. Amendment agreed to. Schedule, as further amended, agreed to. Bill reported with a further amendment; reports, by leave, adopted. Bill, by leave, read a third time. Bill returned from Senate without amendment.

It would mean, for instance, that if any State desired to hand over to the Commonwealth its right, title, and interest in all its funcareas in growing cities ana towns-espe tions and undertakings, the Commonwealth would not be able to avail itself of the -offer. It would be impossible for it to pay for them out of revenue, and consequently, although the State enterprises and functions were returning more than would be the interest payable on an ordinary loan, we should be unable to take them over. and to erect upon it a General Post Office and, other buildings, and the policy of the Government is that the improvements made -shall be paid out of the ordinary current revenue of the Commonwealth. ment doing with the old Post-office site? arrangement, to the State, and we shall receive from the State, in respect of our indebtedness for transferred properties, a -credit amounting, I think, speaking from recollection, to double what we are paying for this site. The arrangement will be a -successful one for the Commonwealth, and will be beneficial in enabling us to make provision for the erection of, not only a new post-office, but other Commonwealth offices. The site, which is a most desirable one, is convenient to the railway station. It is proposed to run a street through it, and to erect a General Post Office on the right-hand side of that street, if I remember rightly, coming from the railway station to .the city itself. The area is a very considerable one. ment going to utilize the whole of the space ? buildings, however, will not occupy the whole of it. As I have already mentioned, the site is improved, and it is estimated that even after the new Postal buildings have been erected the property will return 3^ per cent. ' That being so, even if we were unable to do anything with it at the present time, it would be a profitable investment, earning for us more than the interest we allow on Commonwealth investments. It is a property that will be.constantly improving. I think it is a mistake for the Commonwealth not to secure larger areas in the growing cities of Australia to meet the necessities of the future. So far, there has not been sufficient enterprise in Such a. contention, however, is, that respect. I hope the day is not far distant when there will be laid down a policy which will enable the Commonwealth Government to map out certain cially seaport and permanent towns-for future use in connection with our public offices. ask the States, when laying out a town, to set aside areas for Commonwealth buildings, just as they now set aside areas for It is proposed to improve this site, State buildings. for Darling Downs has taken an interest in this matter, and has tried to induce persons laying out townships to set aside for Commonwealth as well as for State purthe Governposes suitable areas of land. I do not think it would be unjust to require, as a condition of title, that such areas should be set aside; but, of course, it would not be possible for the Commonwealth to do anything in that direction. The most urgent duty that rests upon us at present is to see that we secure areas for Commonwealth buildings that may be required now or in the future. It would not be wise to invest a very large sum in such a way, but I think that where property on which a return equal to the interest that we had to pay could be secured, we should make a good bargain. I have mentioned that the improvements made on this land will be constructed out of revenue. There is a sum of money on the Estimates towards those improvements, and I may add that the Federal Capital lands are being dealt with in the same way. In other words, the freehold is being purchased out of money in the hands of the Commonwealth and available for investment, while the improvements are being paid for out of revenue. The policy, I think, is a sound one. adopting the same principle in regard to the Commonwealth offices in London?",21,Designs Bill

But at the same time the Government propose to expend out of revenue £479,000 upon the construction of underground conduits which will practically be everlasting. perishable buildings in Perth, and to build a High Commissioner's office in London, out of loan funds. At the present time there is a building being erected in Melbourne in connection with the post office at a cost' of £108,000. That money is being taken out of revenue. What is the reason for this distinction? Why has not the Prime Minister the pluck to stand up and say that the Labour party's policy of constructing these works out of revenue has failed? Why does he not tell the Labour conferences from year to year that the plan will not work any longer, and that the nonborrowing plank has broken down. tion of public borrowing. was only a bit of irony and political makebelieve, seeing that this Government is the first to inaugurate the policy of constructing public works out of loan moneys. ment in New South Wales borrowed any monev for public works? expended £6,000,000 of loan funds in carrying out public undertakings. They had the biggest "" g o "" of any Government that has ever held office there. Men are being turned away by the hundred, because the money will not hold out. The Prime Minister, however, is in a much happier position, inasmuch as he has £15,000,000 of trust moneys to fall back on. I am not quite sure whether the right honourable gentleman is justified in dipping into those trust moneys, every penny of which is hypothecated for a definite purpose. I could understand the position if he were raising a temporary loan from trust funds, but there is no indication of anything temporary in the transaction. In my opinion, we ought not to inaugurate the policy of raising permanent loans from trust moneys, which themselves do not form a permanent fund. The right honourable gentleman, of course, has a perfect right to make the fullest use of the funds at his disposal, but he has no right to float practically permanent loans out of funds that are constantly fluctuating, and are already hypothecated. The theory of trust investment all over the world is that the securities shall be, in their very nature, permanent, secure, and at the same time liquid; and that is not the case with these investments. It seems to me as though the Prime Minister is sneaking in a loan policy. very little about it. The Prime Minister will not talk very much about this transaction when he gets on to the platform, but would rather that it was conducted with the greatest secrecy.

The public works were initiated ten years before. present Opposition took the first opportunity to get rid of Mr Watson, not because he was doing ill , but because he was doing well. And there is another little incident worth a reference.

Every broad'and general proposal was denounced as dangerous; even the White Australia policy, and the immigration restriction legislation, were denounced in the fiercest and most outrageous language ever used in a Parliament. further. The expenditure on public works during the nine, years of office of honourable members opposite was £4,098,749; whereas, during our three years of office, we have expended, out of revenue, £1.0,002,000. Does the honourable member desire a better answer to his inquiry as to what we are doing? He also spoke' of the difference between a conduit for telephone purposes, which he said was indestructible, and a piece of land in London. the land, but to the buildings. embraced opportunities that offer for the construction of these conduits at a time of financial prosperity. That is my answer to the financial critics who view these matters from afar, and in the light of what they have gathered from very tainted sources. It is suggested by them that the Government are expending millions in excess of the amount spent by other Governments. My reply is that we are constructing permanent works out of revenue. If we were squandering the revenue on services which would not be of more than passing utility there would be something in their criticism. But the fact is that we are expending our money on permanent works, one section of them being, as the honourable member for Parramatta has admitted, practically indestructible.

The Prime Minister has stated that no Government would attempt to pay for defence works out of loan moneys. Does he not know that every Government in the civilized world is doing it to-day? Germany is building ships out of loan funds. That great over-sea nation, I suppose, has as much business ability as have the Prime Minister and his party. Great Britain? works as are proposed here, money has been borrowed from time immemorial. ships ? ing with the construction of concrete buildings in Australia. The Prime Minister has said that no Government would ever dream, of erecting a concrete building out of loan moneys. But Great Britain is doing it today, and every civilized, country in the world has done it from time immemorial. According to the Prime Minister these countries have no sense or business ability. Well, the world will judge between them. The right honourable member pointed out that, during the past three years, the Government have spent £10,000,000 on public works out of revenue. That is quite true. Where did they get the money from ? Surely out of the arrangement which we made with the States nnd which the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General declared provided for too big a return to the States. The Prime Minister wished to return the States less and to retain more. Out of that fund the Government have got all these rolling millions, which, with the land tax, have amounted to £18,000,000 more in three years than any previous Government ever received. strange, indeed, if , out ',£18,000.000 the Government could not find a million or two more than did other Governments for the construction of public works. Why did other Governments spend less on defence? Because my honourable friends opposite who kept them in power said, "" £500,000 must be the limit of the expenditure on the land defences of Australia."" That is what they said to Sir George Turner, and to other Treasurers. They cried, "" You must not spend more. If you do, out you go."" This money, therefore, by their own decree, had to be returned to the States. Now the Prime Minister taunts us for having done what he and his party compelled us to do if we were to remain in office. Let honourable members get this fact into their minds: that while we have been spending more on public works we have been taking more out of the pockets of the people. These rolling millions have not dropped out of the heavens. They have been taken out of the pockets of the taxpayers. Today our public works alone represent an expenditure of 18s. per head of the population. That means that every family today is paying ,£4 ios. annually for the privilege of building these works for future generations. Every working man to-day, who cannot get a house of his own over his head creased the taxation of the Commonwealth ? an irrelevant question. man pay a little bit of it. out that the honourable member is making the poor man pay to the extent of 18 s. per head more per annum, or £ 4 ios. per family. That is where the funds which have been expended upon public works have come from. Yet we have in office a Government which boast of the way in which they have expended money out of revenue. Let my honourable friends tell the working men of Australia that they are annually paying £ 4 ios. per family to construct huge edifices for the benefit of those who may come after. It does not matter to the Government that the working man cannot make ends meet. They compel him to pay 18s. per head, or £ 4 ios. per family, to put up huge buildings It would be in Australia for the benefit of those who of that will succeed us.

Not only did the Prime Minister discuss thefinancesof the world, but he pointed out what a great a.id virtuous Government this is, and how wise and statesmanlike all its actions have been. The Prime Minister, this morning, dissociated himself from any atom of credit for the Notes Bill by saying that he has slavishly followed the conservative financing of Sir Hugh Nelson, in Queensland. Until now, I had thought that this note issue was some novel idea on the part of the present Government; but we find that the Prime Minister is ' treading a wellbeaten track, and will, therefore, be able to lay no claim to any financial pioneering. On the contrary, he has harked back to twenty years ago, and is, as he says, slavishly following the conservative financing of the State of Queensland in the bad old days. ber for Parramatta is fifty years behind the times still. still thirty years in front of the Government, because its chief virtue and credit to-day lies in the fact that the Prime Minister has gone back, even twenty years, to copy the legislation of Sir Hugh Nelson and others.

If the Government stay in office To-day the working a little longer, they will be able to set up as representing the real old Conservatives of Australia, and will justify the criticism over here.

But the answer of the working man will be, "" But see the money you have-taken out of my pocket to build them with."" his pocket 1 man is beginning to realize the situation, as honourable members will find at the ballot box. vote, in unmistakable fashion, that whatever may have been put into his pocket, a great deal has been taken out. My next point is that the Government have had £18,000,000 more revenue in the last three years than any previous Government have had; and, notwithstanding that fact, they are forced to a policy of borrowing for public works. Then, I contend that we should be chary how we borrow and tie up money out of the Trust Funds. to resort to these Funds in a sparing way, and for well-defined purposes; at any rate, there should be nothing done in the direction of expenditure which will tie the money up. as facile as possible of acquirement should they be needed. While the workmen of the community are being asked to provide these increased revenues for the purpose of putting up buildings for future generations, who will certainly give us no thanks-whil e those proud edifices are rearing their heads -the only consolation will be that of saying, during the regime of the Labour Government, each workman paid over £ 1 2 out of his earnings in the three years for the use of somebody after he is dead and gone. The Government are forced, by sheer circumstances, to depart from the policy of no-borrowing. We have the anomaly that, while the building in London is provided for out of loan, a building in Melbourne, to cost _£io8,ooo, is paid for out of revenue, although the earn money, and the building in London will earn nothing directly, although we may hope it will do so indirectly. It is not a good policy to pay for huge, practically everlasting, buildings out of current revenues, which really means out of the pockets of the people. Therefore, I think we ought to congratulate the Government on the fact that they are at last adopting the policy of providing capital expenditure from capital sources, and initiating a course which, if followed logically, will lead them to the good old so-called Conservative financing, the advantages of which they are begining to see after three years of office. This is the second occasion on which the Government have proposed the raising of a loan, and it is rather interesting to note what is the Labour policy in this regard, as gathered from the published platforms The working man will say by his of the party. In New South Wales, in 1909, we find that the policy of the Labour party was the "" Restriction of public borrowing,"" while the fighting platform provided for the cessation of borrowing, except for the redemption of loans, for completing works already authorized, or for reproductive works which would pay in interest from the beginning and provide a 1 per cent, sinking fund. Under such conditions as these, I am afraid we should never have authorized a loan of £1,000,000 for the construction of the transcontinental We ought railway, or for the erection of Commonwealth buildings in London. In Victoria, the Labour platform of 1898, which I believe is still the same, provided for the restriction of public borrowing, except for These Trust Funds should be left the conversion of loans; and the platform of the Commonwealth Labour party of 190*",34,Designs Bill

321,Mr Groom (Darling Downs) [2.41],"declares for the ""Restriction of public borrowing."" Judging from present circumstances, we may take it this vague phrase means borrowing whenever it is necessary to do so-that borrowing is restricted only by the financial necessities of the situation. On the public platform, however, the claim is continually made on behalf of the Labour party that they are against borrowing; and this was an issue raised at the Boothby by-election, in which Ministers, and honourable members opposite, took part. The Government are to be congratulated on taking a step which every other Government in Australia have had to take. face to face with big undertakings, it is impossible to finance them out of current revenue. We must borrow; and it is to be hoped that, after these two Bills have been passed, the Government and their followers will realize that they are as much pledged to borrowing as any other party in the Commonwealth. we borrowing?. Government of New South Wales borrowing? the Commonwealth the £6,000,000 which they have recently expended? Were they borrowing from the Commonwealth when they tried to negotiate a loan on the Continent ? tempt was made on their behalf to borrow on the Continent, and they have certainly gone to England to borrow. The Labour party throughout Australia, whether they be in power in the States or in the Commonwealth, have come to realize that, whether they like it or not, they must resort to a borrowing policy. The followers of the Labour Government are against borrowing, but those of their party who take office and responsibility, and have to face the financial difficulties of the country, have to admit that the policy of borrowing which they condemned in the past is inevitable. object to this Government borrowing from the Trust Funds? has to be considered on its. merits. But when the Government have exhausted the Trust Funds where are they going to borrow? It is estimated that the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway will cost .£4,000,000.

They obtained authority, first of all, to raise £1,000,000 as a first instalment towards the cost of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. The estimated cost of the construction of that line is £4,000,000, but if it is to be constructed in the reckless way that has been indicated during this session no one can say what it will cost. Then they have obtained power to borrow £600,000 as a first instalment towards the cost of the Federal Capital. The building of the Capital will cost far more, and, apparently, is to be provided for by means of a borrowing policy. Then again, they obtained authority to raiee £226,000 to redeem Treasury-bills, which is very natural, and a further sum of £34,000 in connection with the Port Augusta railway. At page 5 of the Estimates, dealing with special appropriations under the heading "" Commonwealth Inscribed Stock,"" there appears an item of ,£60,000 concerning which I should like some explanation.

At the inception of Federation, Sir George Turner desired authority to raise a small loan to place the postal service of Australia on a proper footing. The Inscribed Stock Act which we passed last year was, in effect, simply a re-introduction of the Bill then introduced by Sir George Turner, and which was opposed by some of the Labour party.

When they are in Opposition they will oppose a policy which, Is it their intention to secure as soon as they take office, they are prepared to adopt.

We shall test the matter when the occasion arises.

Some honourable members opposite ask, ""Why should we not pay for some of these things out of revenue?"" I would remind them that we can place upon the community too heavy a burden of taxation. It is not always wise to charge to the present generation the cost of works the benefit of which will extend over many generations. We are still in a pioneering stage.

Not one-half of the great business firms of Australia could have done what they have done without borrowing. The principles that apply in private life apply in the development of national life. We are practically only breaking the soil of our national life. been made out of public borrowing. paying for everything out of revenue, we are placing an unduly heavy burden on the people who are developing Australia.

To charge everything to revenue would be to throw upon the taxpayers a heavier burden than they can bear, and 1 congratulate the Government on having now, a second time, admitted that the policy of the party in the past was wrong, and that Sir George Turner was right in proposing that works like permanent post-offices should be paid for out of loans, to be repaid by the establishment of sinking funds. Government pay the interest on the money it proposes to borrow ? vernment have admitted that they cannot pay for out of revenue all the public works that the country requires. Whether they borrow from the Trust Fund or some other source, the principle is the same. Besides, the Bill does not authorize borrowing from the Trust Fund only. Under it and the Inscribed Stock Act the Government may raise loans in London or in France. At present, it is proposed to borrow from the Trust Fund, because there are a few hundreds of thousands in that fund. We have been told that the expenditure of £1,000,000 on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway has been authorized, but where is the remaining £3,000,000 to come from ? again ! for something to turn up. Why do they not admit that the money will have to be borrowed, just as the Government of New South Wales are borrowing money? not wait long to borrow if there were any Jews willing to lend. only from Jews? Why should a slur be cast on the Jewish people? When Mr Verran was at the head of a Labour Government in South Australia, was he condemned for going to the Jews for money? No. The Labour party then said that it was a wise and sound policy. Australia has been generously treated by the British nation in money matters, and I hope that this Government and the party behind it will now make the admission from the public demning the Governments of the past for having borrowed, and will admit that they are no better than their predecessors in this respect.

I join in the desire to celebrate the conversion of the Labour party to a loan policy. Every civilized country in the world to-day is borowing money for permanent and revenue-producing works, and it has taken twelve years of Federal history to force the Labour party to see the necessity of following, the principle that they might have seen witli their eyes blindfolded if they had only kept them open under the bandage.

The Prime Minister stood here for three-quarters of an hour professedly to explain the inconsistency, but he never touched on it. I am very glad that this loan question has come up again. I have drawn attention to it over a series of years, not only in connection with the Labour Government, but in connection with other Governments who have been spending millions of money on works which were intended, not for the benefit of this generation only, but of subsequent generations, and denuding the Treasury of its revenue moneys in order to pay for permanent works. I drew attention to the matter in 1903, and also in 1909. It is a little hard to come down to real solid facts after the sort of circus performance we had from the honourable member who preceded me. In 1.909 I pointed out that we had spent in the previous year no less than ,£900,000 upon buildings which would not only be permanent, but would improve in value by reason of the added interest and importance given to them as post offices. Then in August of this year, I again referred to the matter, and placed before the House the opinions of an expert outside these walls on the absurdity of continuing the policy of the Labour party. Mr R. M. Johnston, the Government Statistician of Tasmania, published a pamphlet on the subject of loans, in which he saidThe difficulties which now seem to stand in the way as a barrier to the successful discharge of Federal functions and financial obligations are entirely due to a submission to the notions of certain persons possessed with unsound views regarding the science of economies and finance as applied to investments of a profitable and permanent character, especially in relation to State borrowing. The success of the Australian States in the past has undoubtedly been chiefly due to the sacrifices which the earlier pioneers made, from time to time, in making timely provision for the opening up of Australia's vast virgin lands, by means of public loans invested in roads, railways, bridges/ jetties, harbors, & c , in advance of the settler. To any thoughtful person it is obvious that at the initial stage of a Colony's history it would be financially impossible to construct costly works and undertakings of the kind without the aid of borrowed capital. Since the year 1842 the six States of Australia have practically entered into partnership with local and foreign capitalists in the construction of all such important works, and in no other way would it have been possible to have succeeded in making the initial outlay of over ^240,000,000 in a period of about 64 years, or ai the rate of about ^3,750,000 per annum. He concluded with these wordsI f this reasonable and proper method were adopted by the Federal Government, it would at once be freed from all the self-imposed financial embarrassments. With existing sources of revenue it could discharge all its just obligations (old-age pensions, navy, and other defence requirements, subsidy of 31s. 3d. per head of population in aid of State revenue, sinking fund for redemption of debt incurred for new costly works, & c ) , and still have a surplus balance in the hands of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth amounting to nearly ,£9,00,000 each year. There is a sound principle laid down by Mr Johnston, not for the first time, because it is a principle that has been adopted by the Mother Country, by France, by Germany, by the United States, and by every State in Australia since its inception. Yet this Labour party came into power twenty odd years ago with the announcement that they were not going to borrow money. They have kept up the pretence until now. To-day they put up the Honorary Minister, who played the fool, so to speak, for half-an-hour, to divert attention from the fact that the Labour party have absolutely stultified themselves sire that the vulgar and personal utterance of the honourable member shall be withdrawn. statement that the honourable member was "" playing the fool.""

He said that the Labour party had paid for their Navy so far as it has gone, and that they would endeavour to continue to pay for it, all out of revenue. sumed-and, suggest to the public that the Liberal party, when they introduced their naval policy measure, -were going to pay for what was required out of loans. Now, any one who has ever read the measure which the Liberal party introduced into this House, providing for a Navy for the Commonwealth, will know very well that part of its provisions arranged that the capital expenditure should be paid off in fourteen years by a sinking fund.. The Labour party, according to Admiral Henderson, have provided for a scheme which is not to be paid off for twenty-two years. So that the Liberal party, under their scheme, were paying in fourteen years what the Labour party are spreading over twentytwo. Moreover, the Labour party are not paying for the same class of vessels. We know very well that the Labour party introduced a scheme from which all the larger types of vessels were excluded. They were going to spend ,£22,000,000 on vessels that could not leave the waters of Australia; whereas the Liberal party introduced a naval scheme which provided for at least three or four vessels capable of leaving Australian waters and helping in the defence of the Empire. The Acting Leader of the Opposition drew attention, as an observant person would, to the inconsistency of the expenditure from revenue and from loans favoured by the Labour party. We are told that the Government are going to pay for the buildings in Perth out of revenue. But they are going to pay for the buildings in London out of loan money. Passing over the gross inconsistency between the present proposal for loan expenditure and the past policy of the Labour party, what possible justification can there be for differentiating between the method of paying for buildings in London and the method proposed for paying for buildings in Perth? If it is a question of the solidity the £10,000,000 note issue was nothing of the buildings, the Acting Leader of the Opposition has shown that the buildings in London will be of a more permanent character. They will be rent-producing, whereas the Post Office in Perth will not actually produce rent, but will be only for the service of the Commonwealth. No attempt Mr Bruce Smith. has been made to distinguish between the two, or to show why the one building should be put upon a loan basis and the other upon a revenue basis. My own view has always been that where we have purchased a site for a post-office, or have erected But he asone we should recollect that the building I may add, presumed-to will remain for the use of posterity, and that it will increase in value. It gives permanent service; and each generation should pay its share, in the form of interest, on the outlay. But the Labour party do not realize the force of that idea. A farmer, in however small a way he may be, might wish to have a steam plough. The Labour party would say to him, "" Y o u must not borrow money to buy a steam plough, although it will do your work ten or twelve times as fast as you do it now. You must not have a steam plough until you can pay for it out of your revenue."" Consequently, his success would be indefinitely postponed. We are told that the Naval Unit is to be paid for out of revenue, and the Prime Minister, in a fine sort of way, attempted to distinguish between payment for the Naval College and payment foT the ships. I should like to say that his theory runs quite contrary to the practice of all the greater countries of the world. He spoke of the British people as never having paid for ships, or incurred military and naval expenditure, out of loan money. Does not the right honourable member know that, after the Boer War, Great Britain added ,£250,000,000 to her debt? If she added that sum to her debt for carrying on a war, would she not have been justified in adding to her debt by borrowing for building ships? Lord Cromer, one of the most distinguishedfinanciersin the British Empire, the man who restored Egypt to a condition of solvency from one of bankruptcy, actually advocated, three years ago, that no less than £50,000,000 should be borrowed to supply Great Britain with Dreadnoughts. I should like to know what possible consolation Labour members can find in that? The Labour party, as I have said, profess to the public that they are not only opposed to loans, but have never entertained the idea of a loan. I want to reiterate here that more than a loan from the public. It had, moreover, this disadvantage: that it gathered up local moneys instead of inducing the public of Great Britain and elsewhere to put their capital into Australian investments. The Labour party got a loan out of the Trust Funds. -to whom? Funds. Funds represented the people to whom the notes were issued, so that by the honourable member's own showing there was a direct loan from the public at a time when the Labour party were condemning the whole principle of borrowing, and professing to be free from that criminal conduct which characterizes other older communities. The Labour party furthermore have continued a loan of £9,000,000 from the States. We owe the States at the present time in respect of the buildings' we have taken over from them £9,000,000. Have the Labour party made any attempt to pay that out of revenue ? No. They let it stand as a loan, and pay 3! per cent, on it just as if they had actuI desire to say that the first business cm ally borrowed the money from the States. They tried very hard to get 3 I per cent, from the States for advances, while they were allowing the States only 3 per oent. on their other transactions. again, the Labour party are drawing from the States in respect of the Customs and Excise revenue some £2,000,000 or ,£3,000,000 a year more than was previously retained from them. They do not look upon that as a loan. They do not seem to realize that they are denuding the States of that extra revenue which would help them to carry on their affairs. I have only to say that it would be far better for the Labour party to confess at once to the public: that they now realize that a time has come in the history of Australia when money required for permanent and revenue-producing works must be taken out of loan account. They must recognise the general principle that one generation cannot pay for the hundreds of benefits that as a young country we are going to pass down .to subsequent generations. When once that general principle is recognised, we shall put our finances upon a sound basis. As the honourable member for Darling Downs has pointed out, by this system of paying for reproductive permanent works out of revenue, we are depriving ourselves of some millions a year. We are denuding our public services of that amount, and at the same time making the people of the Commonwealth pay an unequal and unjust taxation in order that we may carry on our current works.
