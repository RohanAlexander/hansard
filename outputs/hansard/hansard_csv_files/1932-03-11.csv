Last Night, On The Motion For The Adjourmnent, The Minister For Trade And Customs ( Mr Gullett) Made A Perfervid And Unfair Attack On Me By Stating That I Had Made Misleading State","ments regarding the tobacco-growing industry. That charge lies, not against me, but against the Minister and tbe tobacco company to which he referred. Thc honourable gentleman stated that the company had written to a grower in Western Australia, "" We are not interested in the purchase of Australian-grown leaf,"" and he charged me with having made that passage the basis of an attack on the Government. The company's letter is in the possession.of the Minister, who should know that the complete sentence reads, "" We would advise that, at the present time, we are uot interested in the purchase of Australian-grown leaf."" In view of the company's subsequent statement to the Minister, that letter is misleading; had the company stated that at no time hod it heen interested in Australian-grown leaf, its meaning would hove been clear. The Minister has charged me with attempting to rake up something unfavorable to the Government; but the comment in the letter from my correspondent was very mild. He said personal explanation is to enable a.n honourable member to correct misrepresentations of which he believes himself to have been the victim. member for Porrest is really making a further statement in reply to the Minister for Trade and Customs.

4,Mr Prowse,"I submit that I havemy attitude by the Minister for Trade and Customs. If the company's letter is ambiguous, the fault is not mine. The letter is capable of the interpretation that has been placed upon it, as the Minister would recognize if ne were fair. I merely presented to the House the view expressed by a correspondent on behalf of other growers in Western Australia, and I asked the Government to investigate the matter. Surely a member is not to be attacked by Ministers for merely discharging the duty he owes to his constituents ! The honourable gentleman made another misleadiug statement remind the honourable member that the right of personal explanation is a privilege extended to honourable members to enable them to correct misrepresentation. The honourable member may not abuse that privilege in order to argue a subject. mispresentations by the Minister, and as you, Mr Speaker, have cramped my style, I cannot pursue the matter further. planation. The honourable member for Porrest( Mr Prowse) yesterday read an extract from a letter writtew by a tobacco company to a grower in Western Australia, in which the company stated that "" at the present time"" it was not interested in the purchase of Australian leaf. On the basis of that statement, the honourable member launched an attack on the Government, claiming that the letter was evidence that the Government's tariff policy in regard to tobacco was reducing the price to be paid this year to growers. Se said that the passage quoted by his correspondent indicated the disposition of manufacturers to' lower prices immediately. I explained last night that the company had never yet bought one pound of Australian tobacco, and that the words "" at the present time"" merely indicated that in future the company may be interested in the purchase of Australian leaf. ThatI believe to be the case. The honourable member's attack was without justification; before making such a statement to the House he might have had thc courtesy to refer the matter to my department. certainty and anxiety of tobacco-growers tobacco-growers, and receive at Canberra regarding their future, will the Prime Minister arrange for this House to reassemble immediately after Easter in order to decide what protection the industry shall have? to the House the definite assurance that this industry will be further considered in the light of representations made during the debate on Tuesday last. Inquiries are being made into the circumstances of the industry, and the necessary information will not be available soon enough to enable us to call the House together to deal with the subject immediately after Easter. If this problem is to be considered thoroughly, ample time for investigation must be allowed. lowing letter from the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce:I have the honour, by direction, to confirm telegram despatched you this afternoon, containing resolutions as follow:Cotton -That this chamber records its emphatic protest against the alteration of duties on cotton yarns at the present time owing to the damaging effect which this will have on primary producers engaged in the production of cotton. The direct effect of the change of duty is going to be a reduction in the already meagre returns received by cotton-growers. The industry is a big employer of labour, and for this reason alone deserves special consideration. Disorganization at the present time is most inopportune as the harvesting of the crop has just commenced. of the Opposition has had sufficient parliamentary experience to know that questions are intended to elicit, not to give, information, and that the making of statements by reading lengthy extracts from letters is not in order. If the honourable member desires to base a question upon a letter he must summarize its contents. of Commerce, which is not noted for being a protectionist body, has transmitted a resolution protesting against the reduction of the duty on cotton yarn.

Question not answered. I have received from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House this morning Tor the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent We desire to public importance, viz., "" Unemployment "". Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. moving of the adjournment of the House is an action which an honourable member is privileged to take to direct attention to a subject of great importance and urgency. I do not think that any honourable member will deny that-the problem of unemployment is important and should be treated with urgency. Therefore, I make no apology for asking honourable members to give their attention for some two hours to this problem, which, in my opinion, transcends in gravity and importance every other confronting us. . It is not to be expected, of course, that a debate, whether it last for two hours or two weeks, will solve this problem. We all have responsibilities in this matter. The Government pf the day-lik e other governments-ha s the greatest responsibility, but it is the responsibility of all honourable members to indicate where they stand, and the responsibility of the Opposition to show that it is prepared to support the Government and to encourage it in any sound action that it proposes to alleviate distress and remove unemployment. The States are spending millions of pounds on sustenance. There has been some expenditure on works, but so far as the relief of unemployment is concerned, the expenditure bas been confined practically to sustenance. Something like Â£1,000,000 a month is being expended in that direction. It is true .that it is the duty of a State to provide sustenance, and in that respect I agree with what was said by the Assistant Treasurer the other evening. It is also true, as has been stated in the Governor General's Speech, that the bulk of employment is furnished by private enterprise, and; therefore, it has responsibility in respect of unemployment.

31,Mr Speaker (Hon. G. H. Mackay).,,13,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment
32,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [10.51],"Th enot agree that this Commonwealth has no responsibility. We must play our part and give our quota towards the partial solution of this problem. Those associated with me in this Parliament are concerned because the Government, in making replies to questions, has indicated that practically no action to relieve unemployment is to be taken until after a conference of Premiers has met in May. I regret if I have misunderstood the Prime Minister and the Assistant Attorney-General, but the interpretation that I place on their answers to questions is that certain investigations are being made, a sub-committee appointed, and the matter will be discussed in a general way at the conference to be held in May. If there is no action to'precede that, it is obvious that we shall spite of that, within two months of taking be in the depth of winter before anything is done. It will take some time to formulate'plans and to operate them. The position will be appalling this winter if unemployment continues to increase as it is increasing at present. The figures for the last quarter are not available, but reports that I have received are to the effect that during the last two months unemployment has increased. The position did improve"" during the quarter ending last December, and unemployment decreased from 28.30 per cent. to. 28 per cent. We are likely to revert to the position which obtained last September quarter, towards the end of the winter months. likely to be for this coming winter? It is obvious that, unless something is done,' we shall have a greater percentage of unemployment this winter than we have had before in any year in the history of Australia. I wish to stress two things that this Government should do. One is that it should push on with the conference, and not wait until May, and the second is that it should grapple with the whole problem, or as much of it as is possible. I am not ungenerous enough to suggest that this Government can solve the"" unemployment problem, or that any Commonwealth Government could solve it, but it can play its part towards its solution. I had too much experience of this dreadful nightmare, which hung over my head for the two years of my Prime Ministership, to .ask another Prime Minister or government to do the Mr Scullin. impossible. But surely if the Government has a plan, action could be taken to call the governments together now, and not wait until May. I ask, further, that in the meantime immediate action be taken to reduce unemployment. I shall anticipate the retort, "" You were in office for two years, and what did you do ? "" We did not solve the unemployment problem. No government in the world could have solved the problem in those two years. We took oflice in 1929, when unemployment was not half so great as it is to-day; but, at that time, there was chaos in this country, and the whole financial structure was falling about our has been heads. We were right in the centre of an economic and financial blizzard, and aio one in Australia could see the path that the Government should take. Yet, in office, we made a grant to the States of Â£1,000,000 for the relief of unemployment. It has been said that the money belonged to the States because it came from the roads fund, but that is .not correct. It is true that we used funds that had accumulated for road purposes, but it was money that the States were unable, in ordinary circumstances, to accept, unless they were prepared to find Â£750,000 on their own account. They could not do that. We provided them with Â£1,000,000, and, at the same time, altered the Roads Agreement to prevent even one penny from being deducted from the What is the position moneys allotted to the States. It was a grant from the Commcnwealth to the States. The Prime Minister knows that, because he was a member of the Ministry at the time. That action depleted our cash resources by ""Â£1,000,000, and at that time we were unable to afford it. The grant was made as a palliative, and as some contribution towards the partial solution of this problem. In 1929, just before Christmas, we provided that Â£1,000,000. Some nine months later we made a similar grant, but the States met ih conference and allotted a large portion of it to South Australia, which at that time was suffering more than any other State. That money was used to provide sustenance for the unemployed. Later, we provided Â£500,000, and that meant that we had made a direct grant to the States of Â£2,500,000. Apart from that, we expended Â£250,000 in the Commonwealth public departments, and provided another year's transactions. Â£100,000 for relief work in our own territories. It was not a big contribution, but it was an indication that the last Government at least recognized that the ComBut the States desired additional money monwealth had a responsibility, and did for the purpose of clearing land, ringsomething towards facing it.

Yet we were l if t a number of unemployed permanently in office less than two months when from the ranks of the unemployed. we provided Â£1,000,000 for that purpose. If the Commonwealth Bank requires Surely it is not unreasonable for us to some relief from what it regards ask the present Government to do as the stringent legislation of this Parliaat least what we did when we ment, I assure the Prime Minister that were in office. should be able to do a good deal such relief. We are not asking that wildmore than we did, because the position cat schemes should be put in hand, or of the Commonwealth is more secure now that a policy of uncontrolled inflation than it was twelve months ago, and more shall be pursued; nor do we wish to return money should be available.

Life on a sustenance of a few nhillings a week is a poor thing, for men rind women who have been accustomed to work for their living. V.Tge the Government, therefore, to do something of the kindthat I am suggesting. undoubtedly become valuable to the Commonwealth, for when the depression lifts throughout the world, and the prices of our products increase in the world's markets it would put us in. a far better position to take advantage of the improved conditions. It is of the highest importance that the manhood of our workers should be preserved, and not be allowed to deteriorate, as it will do if present conditions prevail much longer. Thc problem which faces us will not be solved unless we exert every effort to solve it. It is a paradox that to-day we have great tracts of land in this country untitled, labourers'idle and hungry; carpenters who are homeless; bootmakers who have no boots to wear; raw materials which are unsaleable; and skilled labour and machinery which is idle. When it ia suggested that something should be done to remedy this state of affairs we are told that there is no money available for the purpose. What is money but a token: a medium of exchange, or credits? We have been told that credits will be expanded if wealth is produced; that wealth can be produced if markets are available; that good markets will be available if our workless people are employed; and that we could provide more work if more money or credit were available. Wages are down, costs are lower than they have been for a long while, the Government has been changed, and, if electioneering statements can be believed, confidence should be restored. We were told that all that was needed to restore confidence was a change of government. The change of government has occurred. I, therefore, feel justified in asking the Prime Minister to give us actions and not words. If the financiers have greater confidence in this Government than they had in the previous Government, let them -how it by providing additional money for works, and let the Government act. ilr. Sr.uUin. A grave responsibility rests upon this Government. I do not desire to raise any controversial questions in dealing with this vitally important subject. I i could quote from placards, newspaper I articles, and election pamphlets by rhe dozen to indicate that the members of the present Government told the people that Such work would confidence would be j restored and work provided immediately if a. change of government were effected. I shall satisfy myself with quoting from the report of a meeting held by the present Prime Minister, in the Launceston Examiner of the 9th December, 1931. The paragraph to which I direct attention reads as follows:Mr Lyons referred, with impassioned sincerity, to tlie unemployment situation, and. condemned the Labour Government for having failed to do something for the solution of the problem. ""Tliat, above anything, forced ine to leave the party "", said Mr Lyons. Although the honourable gentleman said that the Labour party did nothing to cope with this problem, I have outlined briefly some of the effective steps we took to meet, thc situation at least temporarily. In. addition to those things, we sacrificed Â£14,000,000 in customs revenue in order to protect Australian industries. There is no doubt that the hope was raised in the breasts of the suffering people of this country that if a change of government occurred their troubles would be alleviated. The people have looked with great confidence to this Government to take immediate action to cope with the situation. The time has arrived for the Government to do something. It should not wait until the meeting of the Premiers So there is the vicious circle.

AlthoughI realize that the discussion of .this subject in this chamber for two hours or longer will not lead to the solution of our problembecause nothing that can be done by this Government and Parliament alone can solve it-ye t suggestions which honourable members may make may be helpful to the Government in dealing with the situation. I , therefore, welcome the disthe unfortunate unemployed will have to cussion which the right honourable gentleman has introduced, and I have no fault whatever to find with his speech. Unemployment is confronting the whole nation and every parliament, and should not be regarded as the responsibility of any one government which happens to be in power. No matter what undertakings may, or may not, have been given by political parties on the hustings, we must realize that conditions are operating in Australia that arc tending to emphasize the seriousness of the position, and to increase the urgency of the problem. I also feel it unnecessary to remind honourable members that some of the conditions surrounding this problem are of a nature that we, in Australia, cannot of ourselves rectify. The Government is very much concerned about the seriousness of the position. The most important question which we have to Leader of the Opposition has said that, in reply to questions on the subject, I have indicated that practically no action has been taken by the Government to apply remedies^ and that we are simply waiting for the Premiers Conference to meet in May. I have, however, made it clear that tliere was' no necessity at any ployment is a problem of vital and time for the conference to be held as late primary importance, which would, of as May, for there were other matters, such as the report of the Transport Conference, which would have justified the calling of the conference together at an earlier date. conference to be held in May is the consideration of the financial proposals for the coming year. The Government has, ever since its assumption of office, given close consideration to the subject of unemployment. As I indicated the other day, we have set up a special sub-committee of Cabinet, which has already consulted with the authorities which our predecessors in office consulted. Although we propose to carry this investigation much further, we of the Opposition has pointed to have already reached the point at which we recognize the extreme urgency of the problem. The sub-committee is about to submit to Cabinet certain propositions, which we will put to the Premiers, I hope much earlier than May. At present I shall not be quite definite in my undertaking, but the matter is so urgent and important, particularly in view of the approaching winter months, during which endure much greater privations than iu any other period of the year, that it may be necessary for me to defer the reassembling of Parliament after the Easter recess for a week or two longer tlian was intended at first, in order that a Premiers conference may be called to consider the proposals which we have to make, and other proposals which the State governments may bring forward, with the object of relieving unemployment. deal only with unemployment? that subject; but that subject is, of itself, sufficiently important to justify the calling of a Premiers conference. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that this is the deal with at present. We have given certain undertakings with regard to the balancing of budgets, the resuscitation of industry in Australia, and so on, but our success in carrying them out will depend entirely upon whether we can get our people back to work. Unemitself, justify a conference. The Premiers will also consider the report of the committee which investigated our transport difficulties, and will make a preliminary The chief work of thc investigation into the future financial position of the nation generally. Those matters are closely associated with our unemployment problem, and must be considered side by side. Prior to that conference, and while the Government itself is investigating these problems, we shall be only too pleased to receive suggestions from any section in the House, and from any individual member, whether of this chamber or another place. The right honourable the Leader",16,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment
37,Dr. Maloney,Would that conference,17,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment
38,Mr Lyons,"Perhaps not only with the action that was taken by his Government during and after the time that I was associated with that administration, to relieve unemployment. I am aware that the grants be mentioned ""were made with the best intentions in the world. It may be that this Government will have to take similar action in the near future. But such a course will not provide any solution of our trouble. The position will remain as it was. It is merely temporizing. 1 agree that now, and during the winter months after the important conferences that will be held overseas-fro m which we hope some measure of relief will result to ourselves and to the world generally-w e shall have to give some impetus to industry in an endeavour to obtain financial buoyancy. It is with that object that the Government is convening the Premiers Conference at an early dare. It would be unwise merely to grant sums of money to carry on work which will not finally be of real value to the community. The Leader of the Opposition says that the position is more secure to-day than it was when his Government mad<i those grants. That may be, but this Government has obligations which had not then been imposed on the Scullin Government. At that time we were groping in the dark, and did not know exactly what course to fellow. I admit that the action then taken -was justified, as it at least temporarily relieved the suffering that existed. While the position may be better to-day-and I hope that it is so-the Government now shoulders the obligations imposed upon it by the Premiers plan. On the one hand it has to consider the advisability offinancinga grant to relieve unemployment, and on the other hand it realizes clearly that it has a duty, in accordance with the undertaking that the Leader of the Opposition himself gave, to keep its deficits within pertain bounds. a special loan being raised for a special purpose. be inferred from the right honourable member's speech that the banks were not so generous as they might have been when they refused'to advance an. additional Â£5,000,000 for the works programme Of tliÂ° States and Commonwealth last vear. It may not be generally known that, excluding the Â£7,300,000 that was advanced for the State and Commonwealth works programme, the banks -agreed to provide Â£20,000,000 to cover the deficits and other requirements of the States and of the Commonwealth. At the difficult period of the year prior r.o the Commonwealth and States obtaining the full benefit of their revenues, the banks will have advanced a total of, roughly, Â£33,000,000. I ask honourable members to compare that amount with the total borrowing programmes for works in other years. Had the banks not had the responsibility of finding that huge amount, the bulk of it to cover deficits, they would have been in an excellent position to make further moneys available for works. I am with the Leader of the Opposition when he says that we must not go back to the old period of borrow and burst. I am aware that we could nol at present, borrow money if we desired to do so. Although the Leader of the Opposition declares that the position to-day is more secure than it was, I remind him that the governments arc now borrowing more money to meet deficits than they did in the past to cover their works programme, and that interest has to be paid on every penny that is made available by the banks for this purpose. It will, therefore, be realized how difficult it is for the governments and the banks to meet the situation this year. Without doubt, the orgy of borrowing in which governments of every political brand indulged in the past is one of the greatest causes of the troubles that now confront us. We have all erred, and I hope that we have learned a lesson. If we, in desperation, again started out on the same track, the community would suffer as the result of our action. Whatever we do must receive very careful consideration, and we must lose no time in acting, because the matter is urgent."" Any money that we borrow for the relief of unemployment must be spent on works of a reproductive character, or works that will be of real value when prosperity is restored, otherwise the position will be .worse than it. is now.

39,Mr Scullin,That would not prevent,18,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment
40,Mr Lyons,"Perhaps not. It mightmatter forward. It is a problem which should receive our united attention. Honourable members on this side of the House are co-operating in an effort to save the situation, and we shall be only too pleased to receive practical suggestions from honourable members who sit in any other part of the House. I assure the Leader of the Opposition that no time will be lost in endeavouring to relieve the sufferings of our people. As soon as it is determined, the Government will notify the House when the Premiers Conference will meet. -There is no question but that the most pressing problem in Australia to-day is how to place in profitable occupation the hundreds of thousands of our men and women who are anxious to work, but who cannot find employment. We must be careful not to adopt temporary means of relieving the situation which will eventually make the problem more difficult. There can be no solution of it in the expenditure of more money on unproductive public works, or even by an extension of the system of food relief. By some means we must make it possible for private enterprise to absorb in profitable occupation the great masses of our unemployed. Despite the fact that there has been a great extension of governmental activities in Australia, it is a fact that at least 85 per cent, of the employment that is provided in this country emanates from private sources. It is in that direction that we must look for relief. An examination of the great depression in the 'nineties shows us that the unemployment problem was then solved-as 1 believe it will be on this occasion-by making our land industries profitable; by placing in employment on the land those who were out of work in the cities. The figures for the decade 1890 to 1900 indicate that no fewer than 116,000 persons, who had previously worked in the cities, were placed in profitable employment on the land, and, as a result of the subsequent development, it was possible to absorb additional men and women in the shops and factories in the towns. The ratio of unemployment fell to 3 per cent. To-day it stands at 30 per cent. I am pleased to know the conference of Premiers is to take place at an early date, because, afterall, our difficulcountry districts. If this were done, the ties ean be overcome only by co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. At that gathering an effort should be made to divert the millions of pounds that are now spent on food relief, and other unproductive purposes, to the stimulation of private enterprise, so that more people may be absorbed in employment. There is no question that the country districts, with which I am familiar in the north of New South Wales, could give opportunity to place a further 100,000 persons in satisfactory and permanent employment during the next five years if only half of the money that is now used for the unproductive purposes to which I have referred were made available in the form of loans to farmers. Men on the land would, improve their, properties so that these would double their carrying capacity a.nd increase their production. Immediately, our railways would benefit by additional freights; more commodities would be marketed, and, generally, industry would be stimulated. It would be possible for our galvanized iron industry to develop to the output of 70,000 to 80,000 tons per annum that is contemplated instead of the present 25,000 to 30,000 tons. gentleman has been telling this story for twenty years, and unfortunate people have been dying from privation in the meantime. for another twenty years, if necessary. That is the way in which the problem was solved in the nineties, and it is the way in which our present difficulties may be overcome. I know that short cuts to prosperity and to the millennium will be suggested . by my honourable friends on my right. They have been tried in Russia, and the workmen of that country are now in a worse position than when the experiment began. The method that I suggest has been proved to be satisfactory. It was in the country districts that credits first froze, because of the low prices of products and the inability to market the output. It is in the country that the first thaw must take place. When the Government is consulting with the State Governments on this matter it should ask them to put up practical schemes which will provide permanent employment in men would be paid wages which they'",18,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment

43,Dr. Earle Page,"I shall say itcould spend in any way they liked, instead of, as at present, receiving dole tickets which provide them only with a few stipulated articles. It is necessary that the unemployed should be given an opportunity to work, and I trust that the conference will devise means of doing that. RecentlyI received two letters, which have an important bearing on this subject. The first letter statesWhnt are you doing-over tlwre* pected much better things from yon. 1 expected the same myself. The letter continuesDifficulties are increasing: here daily. More, and still more, breadwinners are being thrown out of work, and for thousands of families the prospect is black indeed. We are. all approaching the coming winter with grave forebodings. In so many cases the little stock of clothing, and other small assets accumulated in better times, liavu been used up; hence the coming winter has developed into a nightmare, especially for mothers and fathers. One great trouble is that the little money these poor people do get by way of dole or CHSinil work will buy so little. Surely something ean be done to reduce the cost of necessaries. Surely these wretched combines that are exploiting the people can be made illegal. Surely the price-fixing monopolists battening on the life-blood of the citizens can be treated as criminals. Surely these bounties, bonuses, subsidies, sugar agreements, control boards, &c, can be abolished. We were expecting great things from the uniting of all parties, but so far matters are going decidedly from bad to worse. . . As sure as tlic sun shines, if something is uot done to unshackle the people, and allow them to work out their own salvation in this land of opportunity, something serious will happen. That letter was written by a lady. The next is from a fairly large employer of labour. Dealing with the unemployment situation, he saysI t is hard to forecast the future commercially, financially, or industrially, and we can onlyhope for tlie best. I am inclined to think that there are many rocks ahead, and, steering our present course, we will surely hit them; just how haTd and whether we can got o(T again is hard to say. I am afraid that our present system will ultimately result in sinking the ship. We seem to have it, wonderful country, a population of cranky people, und tyrants for leaders and politicians.

The poor folk who work have to pay for those who won't, so the sooner the whole thing breaks up the better. I do not intend to dwell on these letters, because they speak for themselves. We have to ask ourselves whether we as leaders are striking at the root of this problem. Are we going the right way to solve it? I doubt that we are. Costs arc being continually piled up; the last. Goveniment did good work in some directions, particularly in reducing our adverse overseas trade balance; but'when it. Wc exreduced Public Service salaries ancl interest rates by 22Â£ per cent., it clapped on a sales tax which increased commodity prices. Wc have to ask ourselves whether we are not placing too high a value on all we have and all we do? We in this House place too much value on 'words, and pay insufficient attention to the need for action. Would it not be better to repeal many of the restrictive laws now on. the statute-book, rather than continue passing still more hampering legislation? .At present, people are shackled, and cannot work out tlieir own salvation. We would not expect any one to win a race who was hobbled. Let the people be freed, and they will get back to work, and pull the country out of it difficulties. We should employ every means at. our disposal so to reduce basic values, and to bring down costs to meet the lessened value of our exDorts on the world's market's. This would enable our people to get back to work on the production of those commodities necessary to meet our overseas obligations. What is the use of piling up more costs and increasing taxation when, staring us in the face, are our overseas obligations, which constitute our real difficulties. It is not legislation that we want to-day, but inspiration for our leaders, aspiration for our people, and nothing will be achieved without a good deal of perspiration as well. I support this motion, and hope thus to focus public attention upon-the policy of this Government, whose Ministers and supporters promised at the general election to relieve unemployment, but whose administrative acts have all, up to Loafing, talking, and date, tended in the opposite direction. Undoubtedly, thousands of electors supported the United Australia party candidates-at. the last election, because they",19,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment
44,Mr Watson (Fremantle) [11.32],',20,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment
45,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [1.1.37].,"believed that the party opposite, if re-election, the right honourable gentleman turned to power, would relieve unemployment. it immediately. the election campaign full-page advertisements appeared in the newspapers of New South Wales urging the people to vote for the United Australia party, because that party, if returned, would solve the unemployment problem. I have here a poster, designed in striking fashion, which bears the legend"" Mates help me to get a job."" I heard many honourable members on the other side of the House making election speeches. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Jennings) promised the electors that if his party was successful, those in the unemployment camps at La Perouse and Maroubra would be found work, as would also the unemployed at Redfern, where conditions are extraordinarily bad. Similar promises were made at Coogee and Bondi, which are residential rather than industrial suburbs, and at Marrickville, in the Lang division, and throughout the Barton division. We on this side of the House now demand that the Government shall honour the promises then made, and we propose to expose the trickery indulged States of America with a view in by honourable members opposite in order to win the support of the electors. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), speaking before the election, stated that he could solve the unemployment problem immediately. As a member of a previous Government, he had for over more than twelve months every opportunity of studyin Australia by 13 per cent., in Canada ing the problem in all its aspects. I reby 25 per cent., in the Irish Eree States member accompanying him on one occasion to hear a deputation of postal workers from Melbourne. Unemployment was there discussed, and the honourable gentleman said that a position might arise in which it would be necessary to take over the whole resources of the country to feed the people. The honourable gentleman; therefore, was in a position, at the time of the elections, to know the facts, and knowing them, he promised the electors ""that if he were placed in power he would immediately solve this problem. . On the strength of that promise he solved by the conferences held he received a great deal of support. Speaking at .Peterboroughbeforetbe asked: "".Why does not the present Ministry go out and raise on the open market the money necessary for the services of the Commonwealth and the relief of unemployment?"" He went on to say that the Scullin Government could not raise money on the open market, because the people did not trust it. The suggestion was, of course, that if the Scullin Government were removed, a government led by the honourable member would be able to go on the open market, obtain money, and immediately solve the unemployment problem. Now the Prime Minister says that unemployment is the result of world conditions. That was not the statement made during the election campaign. As a matter of fact, much of the blame for unemployment was then laid at the door of the Premier of New South Wales( Mr Lang). It was alleged that he was responsible for hundreds of thousands of persons being out of work. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) made a pertinent suggestion to the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) when he asked that gentleman to get into touch with President Hoover of the United to learning whether Mr Lang was responsible for the unemployment of 8,000,000 persons in the United States of America. According to some honorable members opposite, Mr Lang is to blame for the 'fact that in 1931 unemployment in Great.Britain increased by 7 per cent.., by 18 per cent., in Germany by 34 per cent., in Italy by 32 per cent, and in the United States of America by 5 per cent. Of course, unemployment is a world, problem. We have always maintained that, though honourable members opposite have been reluctant to admit it. The Government claimed at the last election that it could devise means to correct thosituation: hut unemployment is world, wide, .and the world's financial system has everywhere broken down. I venture, therefore, to say that the problem will not here and -e^ewhere, unless the financial system .of ""the world undergoes, a-.radical!",20,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment
46,Mr Holloway,They promised lo do,21,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment
47,Mr Beasley,"That is so. Duringchange. The last Government held no fewer than half a dozen conferences with the Premiers and others. It appointed all kinds of committees, and the last committee, for instance, made a suggestion for the revival of the paper pulp industry in Tasmania. This proposal sliould be of particular interest to the Prime Minister, seechamber regarding promises made during ing that he represents a Tasmanian electorate. Other proposals put forward for the absorption of the unemployed related to re-afforestation, irrigation works, and similar undertakings. But what has been the final result? All those proposals had to be referred to another authority before anything at all could be done. I predict that the same result r.vll follow the forthpen. I say to the Government, however, coming conference with the Premiers on the unemployment problem. Any honourable member could in half an hour devise schemes for providing employment for thousands which would afford relief if he were permitted to give effect to them. But in finally determining what works shall be done we have to turn our attention to the provision of the necessary credit, and this matter is controlled by an authority over which Parliament has no control. What is the use of a Parliament if it cannot determine the question whether the people shall live or die, which, after all, is the issue which the unemployment problem raises. If this Parliament truly represents the people it should be able to deal definitely with this vital subject. ber's time has expired. hope to advance one or two suggestions which may be of service to the Government, and in accord with the views of the Prime Minister. A certain amount of agreement has already been reached by members in this chamber as to the grave responsibility resting on the Government, the supreme importance of the problem which faces us, and the united efforts necessary to make any impression upon it. As was indicated by the last speaker, this is a world problem. If the present depression has served any useful purpose, that has been done in leading the people of Australia to realize that they live in the world, and not to themselves. The mere fact that the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) recognizes this surely suggests that in any action taken we should adjust our ideas to world conditions, because failure to do so is largely a contributing cause of our present condition. I deny the general impeachment of honourable members on this side of the the election campaign. So far as I am concerned, I promised nobody a job, but I did say that with the restoration of confidence which we believed would follow the necessary political change that we recommended, there was a hope of alleviating the unemployment position. I am not without hope that that will yet hapthat the implication in the policy speech of the Prime Minister, which was the sole directionary basis on which I contested the seat which I won, was that a change of Government would bring about a substantial improvement, by restoring confidence, and that good results might be expected to follow. If confidence is to be restored more definitely than some of us think it has been up to the present time, T consider that the Government must takp positive action in regard to vested or private interests which have the capacity to assist in the solution of this problem. The Government alone cannot solve it, nor can private enterprise, acting on its own account; but the Government, with the cooperation of private enterprise, surely can make some impression on the problem. If they cannot, we are in a hopeless pass. I therefore urge the Government to take the strongest possible action, and say to private enterprise, "" What are you going to do about it?"" Private enterprise always has undertakings in operation, and others in contemplation, and it is for it to show that under the changed conditions of to-day, compared with last year, it is prepared to do its utmost to extend the field of employment, relying on the Government for the utmost assistance in that direction. I picture the Government, in this matter, as a kind of self-starter, and if it can prove a selfstarter to the big interests in which our principal hope lies, it will have done a good work. In my opinion, the paper pulp industry offers prospects of making a large contribution to the solution of the unemploy-",21,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment

49,Mr Hutchin (Denison) [11.47],"Iment problem, and the Government should do its utmost, in a sensible way, to act as a self-starter to the industry. Its success would benefit, not only Tasmania, but also other States, because a large quantity of the equipment that would be required would have to be purchased in other States. But in endeavouring to set an undertaking of that character going-anc l I am speaking of an industry with whicb in a measure I have been associated-regard must be had to world conditions. It must be realized that whereas some little t time ago, newsprint was fetching Â£20 a ton, it is now worth only Â£14 per ton. We cannot expect industry to thrive or even to exist with a 44-hour week, with extended holidays for employees, and all kinds, of restrictions such as those which became fashionable in Australia at a time when, by reason of the high price of our export commodities, and lavish borrowing by various governments, the abnormal conditions created expensive tastes. If industry is to succeed in the near future, regard must be paid to world conditions, and prospective employers ancl employees must come together in a common-sense way, with a full recognition of the economic circumstances of Australia. I have no desire to indulge in recriminashould enable oil to be produced on an tions; but lot me indicate one or two fields which might well be investigated, and, in which, if common sense were shown, employment might be widely increased. The honourable member, for Hunter( Mr James) frequently refers in this chamber to the possibilities of extracting power fuel from oil shale. I suppose that one of ' the sorriest sights attendant on unemployment may be seen in his elector-ate. nessed that spectacle myself; it is a tragedy. who can take a fair view of the matter that the present position of the coal mining industry in Australia is attributable to three factors. One is the fight that the industry has had to make against other competitive industries which have provided the services which coal usually furnishes; the second factor is the lack of vision on the part of employers in the coal.industry of Australia; and the. third is.the->lack of, other, qualities in ithe emshould forget about qjtiarrqls in the Arbiployees in the industry. I put it to the honourable member for Huuter lhat if the coal industry is to absorb some Â®f its unemployed-and he knows how desirable that is, and how unwilling the coal miners are to take up other lines of work -the industry must realize that we live in the world. It is of no use coming to this Parliament for an export bounty of Ss. per ton on coal. That cannot be given, nor should anything of the kind be done until the coal industry is prepared to recognize world conditions. The shale oil industry is one with which I am familiar, and I know the Newnes field fairly well. The shale-oil industry, born during the period of the late war, struggled on more or less interruptedly until 1924, when it finally collapsed owing to the fact that shale which should have been put into the retorts at 12s. or 12s. 6d per ton, cost 53s. per ton. The plant at Newnes, therefore, went out of use, and lay rusting on the hillside. I visited the field, and looked over the proposition with a party that hoped to revive the industry, which I believe has every prospect of ultimate success. The richness of its resources cannot be doubted. It can be made technically efficient, and the advance made since 192-4 in the treatment of shale economic basis. But, again, it must be realized that we live in the world, ancl must recognize world conditions. With shale being put into the bins at 53s. per ton, or at any figure like that, there is no prospect of the shale industry absorbing its unemployed. During good times, we saddled ourselves with all sorts of conditions which told heavily as factors in the costs of I have witproduction. While those costs could be passed on, the wheels of industry could It will be agreed by anybody be kept moving, owing to the high prices obtained for our export products, and the ability of governments to.borrow. Butto-day the position has totally changed. I suggest that honourable members opposite, who have influence with industrial organizations, should use it in the direction of making a contribution towards the alleviation of the unemployment problem in the manner that I have indicated-; that, employers and employees tration Oourt, and, jby agreement, come to mutually satisfactory working arrangements as to the hours, rates of pay, &c, that are within the capacity of their in*dus tries. ber's time has expired. I support the motion ably submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr morning, that on tlie 31st January last. Scullin), and I agree with all honourable gentlemen who have said that a grave responsibility rests on the shoulders of this Government. Since the inception of federation, no Liberal, Nationalist or Tory government has been elected with such a large support from the unemployed workers of Australia as that received by the Lyons Administration, and, consequently, a great deal is expected of it. If people are looking for more than they can get from this Government, it is the fault of its present leader and his campaign directors, because of the extravagant promises made by them as to the results that would follow their return to power. capital out of it. cends party politics. It is well to bear in mind certain assurances given to the people, before we determine at whose door lies the blame for the present position of this country. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) said that millions of pounds were being made available by thc banks to-day to meet government deficits. Much of that money is being expended ou doles to-day. The recipients do not want charity; tney want employment, and are looking to the Government to cooperate with private enterprise in providing jobs for them. The Prime Minister said that he will welcome suggestions from any section of the House. I advise him to get into touch with those departments that will play an important part in Australian development during the next few years. The Development Eranch is capable of making very helpf u l suggestions. We cannot absorb at once the 200,000 persons who for years were engaged on public work, while past administrations were borrowing overseas at the rate of Â£40,000,000 per annum. Xoan expenditure on unproductive public -works has come to an end, and the workers who have been displaced must be absorbed in primary and secondary industries. I warn the Government against the free trade tendencies of some supporters, who urge that the best way to restore people to employment is to pull down the protective tariff wall raised by the last. Government. I received a telegram this, 30,769 persons were unemployed in' Queensland-30,76 9 of a total population of about 1,000,000! It can be taken for granted that there are many thousands more who would not have reported. The primary industries of that State are cajiable of develo2Dment, but those engaged in them are in a highly nervous state of apprehension as to the future, because the present Government has robbed them of the protection given by the Scullin Ministry; I refer particularly to the growing of tobacco and cotton. Cotton cultivation gives seasonal employment to 6,000 people, whilst the tobacco-growers throughout Australia number between 6,000 and 7,000. Persons who were formerly on the labour market are clearing land, erecting fences and curing barns, and cultivating the soil; instead of living on doles they are producing wealth, and are self-supporting. Unfortunately, their industry is in serious jeopardy, because thc present Government has whittled down the protection which assured the growers a market for their product. discuss the tariff schedule generally, but so far as the Standing Orders will permit, I am responding to the Prime Minister's invitation to honourable members to make helpful suggestions. In the cotton-growing industiy in Queensland, additional areas are being prepared, but the farmers are unable to get advances from the zVgricultural Bank for further cropping, because it lacks funds. Probably the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the Commonwealth Bank, could make additional moneys available to the Agricultural Bank on reasonable terms and conditions to enable the growers to develop their properties and increase their production. The demand by the spinners is now for 20,000 bales of Australian lint as compared with only 1,500 bales when the Scullin Ministry assumed office.",22,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment

So rapidly has this industry developed that in some -districts there is no unemployment, but it , ""too, is endangered by the attitude of the Ministry. The Development Branch -of tbe Prime Minister's Department reported to the Bruce-Page and Scullin Governments that a good deal of employment could be provided in ring-barking, and otherwise improving pastoral properties to increase their carrying capacity. Unfortunately, the last Government could not make funds available for the purpose. The gentlemen who now occupy the tieasury bench stated on the hustings that with a change of government confidence would be restored, and the ""banks would make available more money. Ministers now have the opportunity to prove their prediction. The extraction of oil from coal and shale and national afforestation are other problems that should be tackled by the Administration. Of course these schemes will require money, but that surely will be forthcoming if the Government's pre-election assurances were genuine. The people were told that the banks could not .make money available last year, because they had no confidence in the Labour Administration, but that with a change of government all would he well. The paper pulp industry also might be helped. Many public works await completion, but are held up through lack of funds. The capital invested in them is dead, but if they are completed they will become revenue producing and provide employment. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Watson) criticized the Scullin Government for its administration of the sales tax, which, be said, had increased the cost of foodstuffs.

I'n other places the land is infested with fern, bosthorn, bracken and other noxious weed, which prevents it from being put into production. I suggest that the landholder should provide the men with food and lodging, and that the Government should pay them wages for two days' work, and that the men should work a further two days for their food and lodging. That would bring this country to greater production, and the money that is now expended in providing sustenance would be used in helping our land-owners to grow products for sale overseas. Surely there is some way of solving this pressing problem. Why .should we stay here discussing the bills that are placed before us? relating to wine. legislation deals with wine or water. I agree with the writer of the letter which was quoted by the honourable member for Premantle ( Mr Watson) that unless we do something for the unemployed, they will do something with us. ber's time has expired. regret that only two members of the GoTernment side are sufficiently interested in this subject to speak upon it, and of the New South Wales members opposite, only two have been present during this discussion. able members Holman) and Lang( Mr Dein). They bave not yet spoken. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has asked for suggestions for relieving unemployment, and it is my intention to place a few before him. My first suggestion is that the Government stop the waste of time which is at present taking place in discussing legislation which is aimed solely at the persecution of the State Government in New South Wales, a government which is endeavouring to relieve the lot of the unfortunate unemployed people of that State. I further' suggest that the Government alter the policy that it has adopted in the Federal Capital Territory, of refusing to provide food-relief for the unemployed. This problem is world-wide, and we are faced with the task of finding a solution of it. Certain works, such as water services and the clearing of land, can be put in hand only when we change our monetary system to allow of the utilization of national credit. We are in a state of national emergency, and nothing but the release of national credit will suffice to meet the position. We had a national emergency at the time of the war, and in that case the national credit of this country was utilized. This is no new precedent. If it is good enough to release national credit for war purposes, which involves the killing of people, it is good enough to release national credit to provide useful reproductive employment so that people may live. Various works could be put in hand, but they are too numerous for me to detail during the time at my disposal. At the recent elections, many promises were made. Every hoarding throughout Australia displayed the words, "" Vote for the United Australia party and the Lyons party, and ensure yourself a job and steady wages"". The only person who has been given a job by this Government is the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Bruce). He is to be paid Â£5,000 a year in salary and perquisites as resident Minister in London. Speaking at the Millions -Club recently, the Prime Minister said that unemployment must be relieved by an attack upon wages and hours of labour. He suggested that the fact that New South Wales had adopted a 44-hour week was unfair to the other States, which had adopted a 48-hour week. I refer to the honorHe also stated that the basic wage was in for Martin( Mr New South Wales Â£4 2s. 6d., and in South Australia Â£3 3s. He said that the basic wage rate was unfair and industry could not stand it. Let me say that an increase in the working hours per week would create more unemployment. Let m& give a simple illustration. An industry employing twelve men under the system of 44 hours a week would, under the system of 48 hours a week, be able to dispense with the services of one man in every twelve men employed, and still not interfere with its ordinary production. What firm would employ twelve men when its work could be carried out by eleven men ? If New South",26,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment

89,Mr James (Hunter) [12.17],"IWales reverted to the 48-hours system, oue mau in every twelve would be retrenched from industry, or eight and a half out of every 100 men employed. Yet that suggestion has been put forward by the Prime Minister as a solution of the problem.' ' There' is no doubt, that proihises on the hustings tickled the ears of a lot of unfortunate people. Some of them have'lost practically all their life's savings, and many have lost their homes, but they are still striving to live, in the hope that the Government will redeem its promises. Another section of the community is tickling the ears of the unemployed by asking them to subscribe to the ungodly doctrine of bloodthirsty revolution known as communism, and it is likely that the unfortunate people may be stampeded into revolution if something is not done by the Government to give iheni relief. Our workless people have been betrayed once again by a lot of spineless political tricksters. I apply those terms not only to this Government but also to the previous Government, which made similar promises on the hustings in 1929. When.it took office, it fell down on enterprise employed 85 per cent, of our its job in just the same way as this Governworkers, so that it is perfectly obvious ment has done. Because of the lamentable inaction of the Scullin Government, I fell out with it, and I shall fall out with this Government unless it makes ^ some attempt to relieve the unemployed. Why should honourable members be permitted to use the unemployed as political propaganda? It is a tragedy for any honourable member to use the sufferings of the unemployed for his own political aggrandisement; he would be cowardly indeed to stoop to such an action, and, after his return to Parliament, callously to desert them. orable member for Denison Hutchin) has suggested that to provide employment, the mining industry should adopt world conditions and .prices. Let nie inform him that other countries, some of which maintain a coolie standard in the mining industry,, have a percentage of unemployment similar to ours."" A reduction in wages and'an increase in hours will not solve the unemployment problem. It can be solved only-by having uniform conditions throughput the world, and by, reducing the hours of labour to Mr James. half of what they are to-day. Under the existing decayed monetary system, we shall always have unemployment with us'. We should utilize the credits'of this country, and commence such works as water conservation, uuiform railway gauges, and the provision of sewerage systems the Government's throughout the country areas. ber's time has expired. glad to take the opportunity which has been made for us by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) to discuss the jjroblem of unemployment. As a candidate of the Emergency Committee of South Australia, I contested the last election.. I made certain statements on the hustings, but on no occasion did I offer a job to any man. WhatI said was that the policy of the United Australia party' was to assist and encourage private enterprise, to enable it to employ the bulk of our workless people. Even in the past, when governments were borrowing ancl spending t.o a great extent, private that, in the circumstances existing to-day, when loan money is unavailable, an additional burden must be thrown on that avenue of employment. It is gratifying to me, as the representative of a primary producing constituency, and as a primary producer, to know that honourable members, generally, realize that the prosperity Qf this country depends mainly on primary industry. That has been contended by advocates of primary industries for many years, but, unfortunately, has not gained much' ground among the popuThe honlace. But, at present, practically every ( Mr section of the community has agreed that it is to the primary industry that we must look for the return of prosperity. Mucb has been said regarding our inability to sell our primary products. .AlthoughI agree that during the last two years many of our products have been sold below the cost of production, yet generally we have been able to get a ready sale for our commodities, and the prices that have been realized overseas have brought additional wealth to this conn tiy. Our exports of. primary products have undoubtedly made, credits -available-.overseas to meet",27,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment
90,Mr Speaker,The honourable mem,28,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment
91,Mr Mcbride (Grey) [12.27],"I amour commitments. It is to our primary industries that we must look for the restoration of the prosperity which is so much desired. I suggest to the Government that in adopting methods of absorbing the unemployed it should grant assistance to those industries which are producing commodities for which there is an assured sale. We have an assured market only for our primary products, and, therefore, everything possible should be done to help the primary-producing industries. Ways and means should be devised for undertaking the intensive cultu :e of primary products. The great difficulty is, of course, the cost of production. While we are able to sell our primary product? overseas, we have to face the fact that it costs us more to produce them, in some cases, than we can get for them. Some people in Australia have not yet realized that we cannot live to ourselves alone,' and that in dealing with primary. products we must consider world conditions. We cannot base our costs on a fictitious standard. I say definitely that the primary producers of Australia have contributed their fair share to the welfare of the nation by reducing the cost of production to the lowest point that is possible for them. Many of our primary producers are now living under conditions very little better than those of the duced a fiduciary notes bill, which the unemployed. It is time that other sections of the community recognized their obligations to the Commonwealth, and made a contribution which would also result in n lowering of the cost of production. If all sections would adopt this policy, everybody would share equitably in the losses which we must face, and they would, at the same time, do something which would enable us, gradually to restore prosperity. I suggest, therefore, that the Government in considering the provision of schemes for absorbing the unemployed should not forget the possibilities of intensive culture in primary production; that it should ensure that only those things are produced which can be sold, and that it should adopt a policy which will equitably spread the loss which must be incurred in bringing production costs down to a profitable figure. I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has introduced this discussion. Honourable members opposite may think that there has not been sufficient time for the Government to determine its policy and programme for the relief of unemployment; but, unfortunately, time has been found to do things which must inevitably result in additional unemployment. It appears as though the energies of the Opposition may need to be directed to the prevention of additional unemployment rather than to the decreasing of the number of people already out of work. The previous Government, during its term of office, made more than Â£1,000,000 a year available for the relief of unemployment. I do not suggest that the problem can be solved by the granting of that degree of assistance; but at least the sufferings of the people were alleviated by our action. In addition to those grants, the Scullin Government also made available 300,000 articles, or 300 tons, of clothing. While I was Minister for Home AffairsI was able also to provide the Victorian Government with a number of cubicles for use in its land settlement sell erne for the unemployed. As a matter of fact, the previous Government did everything possible to relieve unemployment. After having unsuccessfully tried every alternative in order to obtain money to provide work for the people, it intromembers of another place refused to pass. In all sincerity, I urge upon the Government not to refuse to consider the possibility of a fiduciary notes issue as a means of relieving unemployment. The only alternative to that method of obtaining money is for the banks to make money available. They refused to assist the previous Government in that way, and it was only then that the Fiduciary Notes Bill was introduced. It was said during the election campaign that the banks would not trust a Labour government, but would trust an anti-Labour government, and provide it with money for public works. AlthoughI accept the word of honourable members opposite, who have spoken this afternoon, that they did not personally promise that work would be found for the unemployed if a change of government occurred, I notice that no honourable member has had the temerity",28,Unemployment Formal Motion For Adjournment
92,Mr Blakeley (Darling) [12.39],"to suggest that the United Australia party did not make such promises. In the last week of the campaign Â£300 a day was spent in advertising in two Sydney newspapers that if the United Australia party were returned to power jobs would be found for the jobless, and unemployment would cease. But the Government is not pursuing a policy which will have that result. tobacco duties alone will, probably, result appears to me, therefore, that the time in no fewer than 3,000 tobacco-growers being pushed out of that industry. This, in turn, will mean that another 10,000 people who look to that industry as the basis for their employment will be thrown on the unemployment market. The Scullin Government during the two and. a half years it was in office adopted a policy of tariff prohibitions and surcharges which had the effect of reducing our imports by Â£120,000,000. I do not suggest that goods to that value were manufactured and sold in Australia; but I say, unhesitatingly, that our policy compelled many people to buy Australian goods who, in other circumstances, would not have done so. If the tariff schedule which this Government tabled a week or two ago is a fair sample of what we are to expect, many thousands of our fellow citizens will be thrown on the dole. Let me give an illustration of what is trouble. happening. One of the first actions of this Government was to make it impossible for a company which was manufacturing pearl buttons in Australia to continue its. operations, with the result the honourable member has interjected, that 60 persons will be thrown out of i will refer particularly to the Newemployment.

But this Gothe cost of living. vernment has already interfered with the duty on biscuits, with the result that the value of the investment of Peek, Frean and Company Limited's capital here has been nullified. Fifty-eight articles were adversely affected by the first tariff schedule tabled by this Government, and we have been told by the Minister for Trade and Customs that that schedule is only a Its tampering with the small instalment of what is to come. It of the Opposition will be fully occupied in trying to preserve such employment as there is in Australia at the present in our secondary industries; and that we shall have very little time to urge upon the Government the imperative necessity for opening up new avenues of employment. The free trade propensities of this Government are-likely to have a disastrous effect upon the industries of this country and the employment of our people. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [12.42] -Most of us are in accord with the statement that has been made that the unemployment problem is world wide in its incidence. A review of the whole position forces us to realize that the gravity of the position has been increased by the failure of governments to take appropriate action to minimize the conditions that have caused this world-wide Mr E. J. HARRISON -Seeing that South Wales Government.

94,Mr Ward,"Al l governments.the suspension of the sitting has arrived; but as the time allowed by the Standing Orders for this debate will expire in five minutes, the honourable member may continue his speech unless objection is raised. Mr E. J. HARRISON"" -We must not confuse nominal wages with real wages, that is, purchasing power. As employers are quick to realize real wages in a rising market, so employees must be quick to realize real wages in a falling market. While employers have done this, employees have failed to do so in many cases, especially where Labour has control of the State legislatures, which impose restrictions employers, to the great detriment of industry. While these governments interfere with private enterprise, private enterprise cannot give the desired measure of employment to those who are out of work. We must get back to fundamentals, and see that these restrictions are removed, so that private enterprise may be enabled to develop industries and provide additional employment. I suggest that we should evolve a common basic wage and similar hours and conditions for Australia. restore confidence to private enterprise, and allow it to tackle this task in no uncertain manner. The problem is ' a national one. Let us consider it as such. There is a duty upon the Federal Government to take action to restrict State Governments from interfering with industry. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) spoke of government interference with Newnes. That and mauy other industries have failed to develop because of the action of the present Government of New South Wales. It is the avowed intention of that Government to absorb private industry, and to endeavour in every way to expel prosperity and peace from New South Wales. That State, containing as it does two-fifths of the population of Australia, is the most important in the union, and it is inevitable that the Lang legislation will react to the detriment of our unemployed throughout the Commonwealth. I entertain the hope that the problem may be' partially''solved by the Ottawa Conference, which may determine that we shall concentrate upon certain industries that are peculiarly adapted to Australia. That, of course, would relieve our unemployment. I should like for a moment to touch upon the scheme of sustenance farms that already has been dealt with by some honourable members. If available lands were cut into small blocks and our unemployed placed upon them, we should find that, instead of having the manhood of our people destroyed by a system of doles, our country would be rehabilitated financially and morally. These men would develop their holdings as our pioneer fathers did iu the past. They would make sufficient to live upon, and thrust aside the desire causing irritation to for the false conditions of luxury that are so attractively dangled before them by the labour agitators of the country. allowed under the Standing Orders for the discussion of this motion has expired.

The Government has invited honourable members to make suggestions so that they may be considered prior to the Premiers Conference.

This measure affects in a particular way the State of New South Wales, and I should like more time to study the amendments and their effect. There are in all 22 amendments, some of which, it is true, do not appear to be of much consequence, but others may have, so far as. ,In can judge, ; a most far-reaching effect, and if agreed to, might encroach on the liberty of Amendments providing for alterations of that kind cannot be treated lightly by this House. As this matter particularly concerns the people whom I represent, I am not prepared to allow the amendments to be considered before I have had an opportunity of perusing them. If some of them are as drastic in their effect as I believe them to be, honourable members should be permitted to consider them over the as week-end. We have not all the advantage of a legal training, and the precise purport of amendments is not always immediately apparent to laymen. I trust that other honourable members will support me in my request for further time. able members have not yet had an opporEach, tunity to do more than glance at the Sens. d. ate's amendments.

129,Mr Lyons (Wilmot,"Prime MinisterIn Senate's amendments.) Amendment No. 1. Clause 4. i 1. In this act "" Specified revenue"" means such revenue . . . as is specified . . . in a resolution passed by each House of the Parliament in pursuance of this act. Senate's amendment -Leav e out ""as is"" in the definition of ""specified revenue."" Treasurer) [2.15] I move That the amendment be agreed to. Tiiis is purely a drafting amendment, but the next amendment makes an alteration in the definition of "" specified revenue."" The purpose of this alteration is to provide for a situation that is more fully dealt with by an amendment of clause 7. Under the clause as it stood, the proclamation therein provided for applied to the whole of the revenues of a State; but if the amendment is made, the proclamation, notwithstanding that certain revenues are mentioned in the resolution of both Houses, may not include them all. It will not be necessary, if the amendment is made, to enforce the rights of the Commonwealth with respect to them all, but only with regard to those enumerated in the proclamation. -This amendment, we are told, provides that the Commonwealth Government may exercise its rights under the proclamation in such a manner that it need not attach all the revenues that would be required to furnish the sums owing by a State. The Minister,, pointed out that it was competent for this Government to issue a proclamation covering all the revenues of a State. to be authorized by resolutions of the Parliament, ment were made the proclamation need cover only one class of revenue. by the remarks of the Minister. Portions of the revenues of a State are allocated for specific purposes. Thc State Government has obligations to the people of the State. Revenues are required for the maintenance of hospitals, police organizations, transport services, and a dozen and one other services that a State Governcommittee (Consideration of ment is called upou to maintain. Most important at the present time are the revenues for the sustenance of the . . . . unemployed. For instance, thirty unemployed were recently forced to leave the Federal Capital Territory because the Commonwealth Government refused to provide food for them. Therefore, they had to go elsewhere, and part of the revenue of the 1 (Flinders-Assistant State of New South Wales must now be used for their sustenance. I am not prepared to accept the amendment, if it will enable the Commonwealth to attach revenues that are allocated by a State for the purposes to which I have referred. I am sure that no honourable member associated with me would agree to an amendment that would make that possible. It is strange that this amendment was not found necessary in the first place. I understand that the Government has had Sir Harrison Moore here "" in smoke"" for several days, and he has probably been considering the best means of making it easy for the Commonwealth Government to attach certain State revenues in order, as much as possible, to embarrass a State .Government. The State Government might finally decide that certain taxation could be levied for the purpose 1 of meeting its commitments, and this taxation might affect a section in New South Wales which has had a good deal to say about the necessity for that Government discharging its debts. Buti f this amendment were accepted, the Commonwealth Government might be in a position to say that it would not attach revenue derived from the source that I have just indicated, but would attach some other revenue. The other revenue might be revenue intended to provide the wages of railway ancl tramway employees. This possibility has already been indicated by the Loan Council through the right honourable gentleman in charge of this bill. It is reported that he stated that the amounts owing to oversea bondholders could be taken from the wages paid to the men employed in the railway and tramway services, and by that process to meet the commitments of the Government of New South Wales. The maintenance of the services that are necessary for the well-being of the people of a State is a matter of the utmost importance, and the",35,Medical Officers Individuals And The Right Of Free Speech

Government, I claim, is entitled to allocate its revenues as it finds necessary in these strenuous times, and no other authority unacquainted with its difficulties and needs should have power to interwealth to attach the revenues of a State fere with the funds required for the maintenance of State services. The Commonwealth Government should have no right to say by proclamation that certain revenue would be taken and other revenue left.

This amendment merely gives power to the Commonwealth to enforce its rights with respect to such revenues as may be stated in the proclamation, and are necessary to meet the commitments due. Whatever objection opponents of the bill may take to some of the amendments, this alteration of the definition of "" specified revenue"", and that in clause 7 relating to the proclamation of specified revenue, are obviously more favorable to thc States than the original provisions. amendment now under consideration is in effect consequential upon one proposed to The State be made on clause 7. That is the clause to which members of the Opposition most strenuously objected, and the amendment does at least make it less objectionable.

192,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [3.14],"to accept' the assurances given hy honourable gentlemen opposite. realize that the Government's object in forcing this measure through this chamber without adequate consideration is to enable it to get at the throat of the Government and people of that State. I have not had the long parliamentary experience of the right honourable gentleman, and I feel that I should be given time to sit down quietly to consider exactly what these alterations mean. If we do not understand the amendments clearly, we certainly do understand clearly the object of the Government in introducing this bill. I realize that there are some honourable members, including the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) who are anxious to catch the afternoon train to Sydney. My desire is to do the work that I was sent here to perform, and, even if the f u l l discussion of this bill entails our remaining here days on end, I insist that the Minister in charge of the measure shall supply us with explanations that can be understood. Treasurer) [3.16] -The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) made a gross and most offensive reference to myself, but I did not draw your attention to it, Mr Chairman, because I did not think that it was worthwhile my doing so. The honourable member has now said that he does not understand that which I have assured the committee is purely a drafting alteration, that he intends to vote against it and to hold up the business of Parliament. If that is his intention, he will force the Government to show him no consideration. I suggest that I have been reasonably patient during the last hour and a quarter in connection with this measure. The Prime Minister( Mr Bosevear, J. S. Lyons) stated this morning that if the amendment to any clause was of such a character that it would be fair and reasonable to postpone it in order that honourable members might give it their attention, the Government would do so. The Government will abide by that undertaking. In the amendment now before the committee there is no alteration that cannot readily be understood by honourable members, although they may disagree with some of them. The Government must insist upon this measure going through to-day, unless it can be shown We that that procedure is an unfair one. I assure the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) that I want no special consider a^ tion from the Government. I am aware that those whom the honourable gentleman and his party represent in this chamber are not the people represented by the party to which I have the honour to belong.

I want the fullest record of such explanations, so that later, when the validity of this legislation is tested, we shall be able to expose to the world the worth of the opinion of that great constitutional lawyer who is assisting the Government. If the Assistant Minister is just throwing to us half-explanations, he cannot blame us if we draw our own conclusions as to his motives. The amendment seems to be in keeping with the general purpose of the bill to make easier the onslaught on the revenues of a State, so that if the Commonwealth is challenged on one point it can retreat to another. I shall vote against the amendment. Treasurer) [4.3] -The clause provides that the certificate of the Auditor General, having been given, and that amount, or some smaller amount, having been embodied in a resolution of this Parliament, clauses 7 to 13, prescribing the subsequent procedure, shall apply. The amendment has the same effect, but provides that where a smaller amount than the total which the Auditor-General has certified is included in the resolution, the item or items comprised in that amount shall be stated. It in no way resembles the amendment relating to the proclamation, as the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has declared. The Government has no power to vary items after they have been included in the resolution of Parliament. The Prime Minister's promise that amendments of which honourable memI again bers had doubts would be postponed, has been interpreted by the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) in a manner different from my understanding of it. The Government is able to obtain the advice of an eminent legal authority who is now in Canberra, but the members of my party have not that advantage. The honourable member for Martin( Mr Holmau) stated a few days ago that a court had regard not to what Parliament intended, but to the language of the statute. Unless we have an opportunity to obtain legal advice we may allow to pass amendwhat the Government intends. What is the urgent need for dealing to-day with the 22 amendments made by the Senate? If we are allowed to consult our advisers in New South Wales at the week-end we shall be able to vote more intelligently on the amendments on Tuesday.

When the resolution is brought down, I shall be with the honourable member in fighting it, and particularly fighting against any resolution-which specifies more than one source of revenue. I submit to the honourable member that this amendment does not empower the Government to specify any revenues, or even to issue a proclamation. All ""it does is to enable the Government after a resolution has been passed by this House to separate the classes of revenue in different pro clamations. mean that after a resolution has been passed by the Parliament the Governwere financially embarment may for an indefinite period issue proclamations pursuant to it? presume, that the Government will request :, the Parliament to pass a resolution covering more than one class of revenue. If that is done any proclamation that is issued will, if this amendment is not -agreed to, have to cover every class of revenue mentioned in the resolution; but if the amendment is passed, it will cover only the classes of revenue specified in it.

A later amendment on this schedule provides that a proclamation which has been issued against the defaulting State may be withdrawn before the full amount of the default is repaid by the State, provided that the Commonwealth Government is satisfied that the State concerned is making every effort to meet its obligations. This amendment provides that a proclamation may specify only part of the revenues referred to in the resolution. To that extent it reduces the possible severity of the legislation. Motion agreed to. Amendments Nos. 13 and 14. Clause 12Any Minister oi, or officer or person employed by, a State, who(a) receives, directs or permits the receipt of any moneys by or on behalf of a State the payment of which would be a contravention of the provisions of this act; or (6) gives, or offers to give to any person an}' indemnity in respect of the payment to or on behalf of the State of any moneys the payment of which to the State would be a contravention of those provisions, shall be guilty of an offence. Senate's amendments -Afte r "" State"", first occurring, insert "" and any otlier person "". A t the end of the clause add the following sub-clause:""2. Any indemnity the giving of which is an offence against this section shall be absolutely void and of no effect."" T r e as u r e r) [ 4 . 3 4 ] i The purpose of the first amendment is undoubtedly to widen the scope of the clause, which already provides that any Minister of a State, or officer or person, employed by a State, shall, in certain circumstances, be liable to an offence. It is quite possible, however, that some person not employed by a State may advise or cause a State employee or a Miuister of a State to receive money in contravention of this act, or give or offer an indemnity in respect of moneys paid in contravention of the measure. It is only just that such persons should be equally guilty, with a Minister or State employee, who does similar things. I am opposed to this amendment, which shows clearly the lengths to which the members of another place were prepared to go in order to enable the Government to give effect to the. provisions of this bill. As I understand the clause, it will, if agreed to, enable action to be taken against any person who resists the enforcement of this legislation. In this respect it may fairly be compared with a certain measure passed recently by the Irish Free State Parliament. A change of government has, however, nullified that legislation, as a change of government here may soon nullify this measure. It is quite feasible that persons who are State employees feel that they owe allegiance to their State, and may act in such _ a way as to resist the operation of this proposed law. Surely employees of a State are entitled to their own opinions as to the laws of the country in which they live. [Quorum formed.'] It has happened more than once, that parliaments have passed laws which have been a distinct infringement of the liberties of the people. Not many years ago, a New South Wales Government passed a law which a large section of the people regarded as a direct infringement of their liberties, and steps were taken to organize active' resistance to it. Fortunately, a the word change of government occurred about that time, and the proposed action was rendered unnecessary. Freedom of speech and the liberty of the subject have always been jealously guarded rights of the people of British communities; but if (Flinders-Assistant I interpret this clause correctly, it is a I movedirect contravention of those principles. That the amendments be agreed to. It appears to me that if this amendment is agreed to, any person who p""ublicly pror tests against the operation of this -proposed law, or who advises other persons to resist the application of it, will be guilty of an offence. To pass such a law would be 'to bring the power and authority of this Parliament into contempt. Those who are prepared to avoid compliance with this law may establish an organization to resist it. Personally, I have always been against the setting up of such organizations if it can be avoided for I realize that though they may serve an immediate purpose, they may not, after that purpose has been fulfilled, readily accept any further",49,Paibs

224,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [4.35].,"direction that their organizers desire. I have always considered that Parliament should safeguard the right of the people to express themselves freely on public questions, and this Parliament has protected that right hitherto. I again remind the Government that we are passing through an abnormal period. Things are happening in these days which are unprecedented in our history, and actions are being taken which, in ordinary circumstances, would not be contemplated for a moment. While some honourable members may be prepared to go to any lengths, in order to impose the will of this Parliament upon the people of New South Wales, it must be remembered that coercive legislation of this description has always proved to be futile. The Assistant Treasurer, when he was Prime Minister of this country, caused Parliament to pass an act which entirely failed to achieve the objects which he had in mind. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway.) is well aware of the measure to which I refer, because its provisions were put in operation against him. The Government may rest assured that this measure will also prove futile, for the all-sufficient reason that the human factor has been left out of account'. restriction of the recognized rights of citizenship, and I intend to do everything I can to preserve my. right to express such disapproval publicly in the strongest possible terms. It is not properly within the province of this Parliament to take away from our citizens the .right to express their opinions on the laws of this country, and to protest against harsh and unjust legislation. The Government may rest assured that the human factor will make itself felt if ever this law is put into operation, and the result may be very different from what the Government thinks it will be. Treasurer)' [4.43] -The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) .has quite misunderstood both the object of this clause and the object of the amendment. It surely is apparent to him that the words "" and any person,"" which it is now proposed to insert in the clause, will apply'only to those persons who do the acts which are made an offence by the provision of the clause. No attempt is being made to interfere with freedom of speech or the liberty of the subject, in the way suggested by the honourable member. All that is desired is that those who contravene the provisions of the clause shall be liable to punishment. amendment really widens the application of the measure, and because of that I am against it. As the same issues are involved in amendments 13 and 14, I suggest they should be dealt ""with together. I approve of the suggestion. I take it that if a State makes provision to protect its subjects for their loyalty to it this clause will render such action null and void. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) intimated that the provisions of this clause involve the principle of freedom of speech. I should like the Minister in charge of the bill to indicate whether it will be an offence under this legislation for anybody to address the people of New South Wales, and advise them not to allow themselves to be used as the tools of the Commonwealth Government in its attack against the LangI strongly object to any administration. I am particularly interested, because I candidly confess that if the action I have referred to will be an infringement of the law, I shall be one of those guilty of it.

This pmendment is inserted because nothing in this measure is intended to cut across any of the powers of the judiciary, or the enforcement of its judgments. move That the amendment be agreed to. --If I read this clause correctly, it indicates that if there is a measure of doubt concerning the action contemplated by the Federal Government, the clause is for the purpose that that doubt may be overruled when it suits the Government. It seems strange to me that a clause of that nature can be inserted in our legislation. This amendment, gives the Government a let-out if certain aspects of the bill are open to question in their general application. It certainly does not appear to me to do what the Minister indicates that it will do. It merely restricts the powers of the defendants in a case instituted by the Commonwealth. The measure is a maze of legal technicalities, and while I do not profess to have much legal knowledge, I a clause that is so advantageous to the plaintiff, should be inserted in this is attempting to save its face, both coming and going.

The idea seemed to be that his party hopes to change after the expiration of two years, the government in New South Wales, and the present Commonwealth Government does not desire the., provisions of this measure to be used against a State Government of which it approves. But should the present Government be returned, the Commonwealth Government desires to have power to heap up obligations against it, so that it may be embarrassed for an indefinite period. B y inserting the two years limitation, the Government has sought to placate those State Governments which are alleged to be meeting their obligations, but by this dragnet amendment it w ill still retain power to harass the New South Wales Government, even after the expiration of two years.
