Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1223 Wednesday, 2 December 1998 Consideration resumed from 23 November. Second Reading Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.00 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1998 proposes to amend section 20 of the principal act, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991, the ESOS Act. Section 20 of the ESOS Act is a sunset clause which will deactivate the act on 1 January 1999. The government requests an amendment to the sunset clause by extending the date it takes effect from 1 January 1999 to 1 January 2002. This amendment recognises that the ESOS Act: has the strong support of stakeholders in the industry; provides the criterion of 'registered courses' for the issue of student visas to over 100,000 overseas students each year; ensures the quality and reliability of education and training provided to students from overseas; and provides the regulatory framework which protects and enhances the reputation of Australia's fifth largest export industry. It is particularly important at this time of the Asian financial crisis to ensure the stability and legislative protection for this industry. There is greater competition from our competitor nations and a need to maintain confidence in Australia's international education industry. The ESOS Act provides financial and tuition protection and quality assurance for students from overseas who choose to study in Australia. It requires that only registered providers who have met the standards for state or territory accreditation and approval can provide education and training for overseas students. It ensures the quality and integrity of our educational products and protects the students' prepaid fees. The act was introduced in 1991. With its several amendments, it has three main objectives, namely: to ensure that international students in Australia are treated with equity and fairness; to ensure the quality and reliability of Australian education and training for overseas students, which provide a positive basis for promoting Australia's international reputation as a provider of reliable high quality education and training; and to ensure that taxpayers' funds are not required to recompense international students who may have been let down by individual education and training providers. These objectives remain relevant today. The legislation and the amendment bill are supported by industry representatives. They expressed this s-pport in national consultations in 1996, in",131,Pairs
303,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl) Took The Chair At 10.00 A.m.,"1224 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 further consultations with stakeholders in April and May 1998, and to the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee in July this year. That committee considered the amendment bill, and recommended that it be passed without amendment. In 1996 the ESOS Act was amended to extend the sunset clause from 1 January 1997 to 1 January 1999. This followed a review of the act by an independent consultant which indicated universal support for the continuation of the current cooperative approach to industry regulation. The reviewers found strong support for the Commonwealth maintaining a regulatory role in relation to the education export industry. This was because of the international trade, immigration and foreign affairs issues which could not readily be coordinated by the states or territories or by industry bodies. Australia's international education and training industry is our fifth largest export industry, worth an estimated $3.4 billion for Australia in export revenue in 1998. Stakeholders argue that the existing regulation of the industry adds value in the marketplace and they have indicated strong support for retaining the ESOS Act as part of a cooperative Commonwealth, state-territory and industry approach to regulation. In particular, they want to maintain the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students-the register. There are costs to the Commonwealth in maintaining the regulatory framework, including the register. The costs are shared by the Commonwealth and industry through the collection of annual and initial registration charges, introduced in 1997. The regulatory framework, with the Commonwealth's ESOS Act as the key national element, has contributed to the successful maintenance of a stable domestic environment for the education and training services export industry over the past five years. This is evidenced by Australia's highly successful engagement in education exports and the continued strong support which stakeholders assert for the ESOS Act. Stakeholders' support for the ESOS Act recognises that the maintenance and growth of Australia's international education industry depends on the confidence that students overseas have in the quality of the courses they undertake and the protection of the moneys they invest in receiving an Australian education. The international. education and training industry is an important and valuable one for Australia. It is a major contributor to Australia's growth in the export of services, bringing many intangible benefits, including the development of contacts for future trade, and ideas and international perspectives. The confidence of students is fundamental to the credibility and viability of the industry which accounts for over $3 billion in export earnings annually. The industry deserves the support of the existing Commonwealth,. state-territory and industry cooperative framework, and this bill enables the framework to continue until 1 January 2002. This is particularly important in light of the East Asian currency crisis which is creating a highly volatile and uncertain period for export services industries. A three-year extension to the ESOS Act's sunset clause will allow a stable domestic environment to be maintained during a time of economic volatility in major source markets. The extension will also allow time for the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and industry to focus on possible future cooperative regulatory models.

304,Mr Lee (Dobell) (10.07 A.m.),"I begin by wishing you a happy 14th anniversary yesterdayWednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1225 the appropriate material is for a 14th anniversary, but, whatever it is, I hope that you received many of them yesterday. The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1998, is a very important piece of legislation. It extends the sunset clause which limits the operation of the act by three years to the end of 2001. This act, the ESOS Act, is designed to protect overseas students in Australia and the reputation of Australia's education export industry. It is designed to ensure that courses provided to overseas students are of a high standard, that overseas students get what they pay for and that taxpayers' funds are not required to compensate overseas students when Australian education providers fail to meet their commitments. The act achieves this by requiring educational institutions to meet the conditions for listing on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, or CRICOS. The major conditions imposed on providers are that they must operate a notified trust account to ensure refunds are available to students in circumstances where a provider defaults and that they must make tuition guarantee arrangements before enrolling students, including membership of a Tuition Assurance Scheme, to offer alternative placement of students if that provider is no longer able to offer that student a place. The importance of this regime in ensuring confidence in the Australian industry is highlighted in the DETYA findings-that is, some 70 per cent of the surveyed students have said that the levels of protection afforded by the Australian government are a factor of which they are aware. The education export industry is vitally important to our country. In 1997, 151,464 overseas students were studying in Australia, generating revenue fot our country of more than $3.2 billion. Forty per cent of those students were in higher education, 27 per cent in vocational education, 22 per cent in intensive English language courses and 11 per cent in secondary schools. The value of these education exports goes beyond the substantial direct economic contribution they make. Australia's education exports foster an understanding of Australian society, our culture and institutions. If the experience of overseas students is a good one, then we have gone a long way to building strong links with the next generation of leaders, particularly in the Asian region, which is the source of around 77 per cent of Australia's overseas students. In August this year a Labor-initiated inquiry into the operation of the ESOS Act made a number of recommendations. The inquiry was called to address concerns that certain elements of the ESOS Act were not being fully complied with, particularly in relation to the maintenance of notified trust accounts. The committee identified a number of problems. Since 1995, five providers had defaulted under the existing arrangements. In 1996-97, DEETYA found that there were six suspensions and two cancellations for breaches of the act. Four of the six providers had their registration suspended because they did not fully comply with the notified trust account requirements of the ESOS Act. A further 13 providers had their registration suspended because they failed to report by the due date. These findings highlight the need for continued effort in this area to ensure that Australia's standards and reputation are maintained. Therefore, it is very unfortunate that the government has halved the effort by halving the number of DEETY A staff administering the ESOS Act. The Senate committee also heard evidence of certain operators that do not respect the trust fund arrangements and that are gaining access to those funds outside the audited period. 1226 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 The committee made three unanimous recommendations: firstly, that this bill be passed without amendment; secondly, that the issues raised before the committee, which were of great concern, particularly in relation to the registration requirements, be the subject of consultation between the Commonwealth, the state and territory governments and the education export industry-I hope that is happening-and, thirdly, that the Senate re-examine the operation of this legislation and report by August 2000. In line with the first of these recommendations, the opposition supports the passage of this bill to extend the sunset clause and ensure the continued operation of the safeguards put in place by the ESOS Act. I would like to tum now to Australian Education International. In May this year the minister announced the end of the Australian International Education Foundation and the creation of Australian Education International to replace it. The minister's press release also promised $21 million over four years for marketing and promotion of Australia's education export industry. Sadly, two-thirds of the $21 million promised by the minister for the new Australian Education International marketing body has simply been cut from other existing programs. The government is replacing the Australian International Education Foundation, to which it allocated $3 million a year, with the new Australian Education International, to which the government has committed new funding of only $1,016,000 in 1998 and $2.4 million in 1999. The Howard government is clearly failing to recognise the importance of the education export industry, which generates more than $3 billion a year for Australia. The Howard government is also damaging Australia's universities and their reputations through the funding cuts it has imposed in recent years. Massive cuts to operating grants have made it extremely difficult for Australia's universities to maintain their facilities and their research effort. Courses and even campuses have had to be axed. News of this government's attacks on Australia's educational institutions can only have a negative impact on students considering studying in Australia. On top of this, the minister for education, Dr Kemp, has a new secret plan on research funding, which poses another threat to Australia's internationally respected reputation for high quality research. Prominent Australian academics have been horrified by the plan which they say will have a severely detrimental effect on the quality of Australian university research and therefore Australia's education reputation. It will have this detrimental effect by replacing the peer assessment grant process of the Australian Research Council with block grants to universities. Given that today in another chamber the Treasurer is introducing some legislation on the GST, I might be forgiven for making a few remarks about the impact of the GST on Australia's education exports. The negative effects of the GST will not be confined only to Australian students and their families, who will face increased prices for books and software, as well as for basic food, clothing and public transport. The impact of the GST will not be confined only to Australian educational institutions, which will be faced with a nightmare of administration and cashflow problems at the very least. The"" GST will also affect overseas students by increasing their costs and making Australia's education exports less competitive. If the Australian dollar were to reverse its recent fall against the US dollar, the impact of the government's decisions on the competitiveness of Australia's education exports would be very "" serious indeed. In closing, I restate Labor's support for the bill and the protection that it provides to Australia's vitally important education export industry. It is extremely important that Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1227 international students have confidence in the quality and the stability of Australian education and training providers, not only because of the value to Australia in terms of the industry and the dollars earned but also because the industry is already under some strain as a result of the economic downturn throughout Asia. PerhapsI could end on a positive note by extending my congratulations to the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, RMIT, which last night was the winner of the national export award for education. The Deputy Prime Minister was present, I understand, at that award ceremony last night-unlike a different person last week who happens to be able to inhabit the Lodge. RMIT and many other Australian education exporters have every right to be proud of the quality of the courses and training they provide and proud of the long-term bonds that they help form between overseas students, their countries and Australia. my alumni at RMIT. It is a great institution, one that understands that international students add a further boost to the resources available to universities, a boost that has been encouraged by the coalition through both its higher education policies and its support for international students. The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1998 is another proposal carried over from the last parliament. It demonstrates the government's strong commitment to ensuring that the 150,000 students from overseas who choose to study at university, TAFE, private colleges, schools or English language training centres can do so in the certainty that their investment in tuition fees will be protected. International students who come here help Australia generate jobs and export income. The sector is a $3.4 billion earner for Australia; and, as the member for Dobell suggested, the multiplier effect would add to that considerably. Students who come here generally leave Australia not just with a positive view of their educators and fellow students but also with a respect for our institutions-democratic, educational and the like-and the way we treat each other in our wonderfully diverse society. . These intangible benefits are converted in many valuable ways to benefit our country. Former overseas students may hold positions of influence or may choose Australia ahead of other nations as a country with which to do business, one to travel to for holidays and to promote among friends and acquaintances. This has been brought home to me by some interaction I have had with Indonesian students who at various times have been studying at the Chisholm Institute of TAFE' s peninsula campus in Frankston. These students spend money in our community and are very welcome contributors to the Dunkley community in general. They are a very friendly bunch. They enjoy the whole experience of our beaches, shopping communities and restaurants, plus the education they gain. This is why one of the things I have been working on since being elected is to have the Greater Frankston area recognised as an educational precinct-just as Oakland is for San Francisco-as a place where you can' come and enjoy all good things our nation has to offer and the excellent educational opportunities that are there but perhaps not be distracted by some of the things that are occurring in the Melbourne CBD, which research shows does cause some concern for parents of overseas students in particular. I am aware that one of our local institutions has found that such things as the casino and other distractions of that kind do concern parents. My advice to parents thinking of having",150,Representatives Main Commitiee
305,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (10.16 A.m.),"Ijoin with the member for Dobell in congratulating1228 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 their sons and daughters study in Australia is to come down to the Mornington Peninsula. Not only is the member virtuous and pure but so are the educational opportunities and the wonderful lifestyle they will enjoy. This bill extends the sunset clause from 1 January next year to 1 January 2002. It will ensure that education providers to overseas students are listed on, and carry the responsibilities of, the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, known in the education world as CRICOS. This measure ensures that, where a provider goes into administration or otherwise defaults, a refund is available. There is an obligation on the provider to offer alternative arrangements for their students' tuition so that they can complete their placement. I note that arpund 70 per cent of overseas students seem to be well aware of these arrangements. They appear to be well accepted and viewed as matters of confidence and quality in our offering as an international education provider. Initial and annual registration charges for education providers cover some of the cost of maintaining this register. As the Assistant Treasurer noted in his second reading speech in the Senate three weeks ago, maintaining a stable domestic policy environment is important during a period of economic volatility in major source countries for overseas students who are educated in this country. The Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs estimates that the number of overseas students being educated in 1998 has shown a small increase over 1997, to 152,200 this year. This is a remarkable achievement. While I will not deny that currency devaluations may have contributed to increasing the number of students from Europe to an estimated 9,800 this year-up 20 per cent from last year-the Australian currency has appreciated against other Asian currencies and yet enrolments from the region continue to be strong. So it is especially impressive that the number of students from Indonesia is only projected to fall by 1,300 this year to 16,800, that the number of students from Singapore is expected to rise this year by about 750, and that Japanese student numbers are stable. This gives weight to the government's continuing strong case that careful economic management, things like low home loan interest rates-and there was another official rate cut this morning-low inflation, complementary and forward-looking tax reform like that referred to by the member for Dobell, and a good business environment, will continue to make Australia attractive. Concerning that good business environment, we had Malaysian Airlines saying yesterday that, after a reported $US 110 million loss for the last six months, Australia was where the action was and that they would cancelling some flights to Vancouver and introducing additional flights to Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane. That augurs well for the future. I should add also that student numbers from Malaysia are likely to be up almost 500 to 16,200 this year-an outstanding performance. Numbers are fine but growth in the future is what we are looking for. The estimated expenditure by overseas students in 1998-on top of the $3.4 billion, which we have talked about before-is projected to be six per cent higher than in 1997. In 1999 a similar growth rate is expected. In the year 2000 a 10 per cent growth rate is expected and in the first year of the new millennium a 13 per cent growth in spending is forecast. This creates jobs, especially if the coalition continues to manage the economy so that we maintain those attractive characteristics I just spoke of. The Labor senator who said that there will be little growth in overseas student numbers from 1996 should acquaint himself with the international student number projection data. Surely a projected increase from 143,711 students in 1996 to an estimated 181,000 in the year 2001 is nothing to sneeze at. In the Senate, Senator Stott-Despoja queried the government's support Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 1229 for the promotion of the education and training export sector. I doubt that the $21 million over four years to fund Australian Education International can be described as minimal. The member for Dobell in his contribution talked about the number of education provider registrations in recent years that have been cancelled and suspended. I would point to that as an indication of the success of the scheme. I would add also that it is a far smaller number than the crisis in 1991 that triggered this policy reform. Perhaps the trend in the number of people required to administer the scheme reflects not only the number of people who are defaulting but where action needs to be taken because of their performance under the scheme. I agree with a DETY A officer who, in evidence to the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee, argued that there could be a risk to the integrity of Australian education if the CRICOS registry and related accountabilities were allowed to lapse. Fortunately, problems with education providers who cater for overseas students have been out of the news for some time now. The cooperative approach by providers and federal and state governments, and the complementary legislation such as in Victoria, help's us to educate these students and increase the number of jobs available to Australian residents. In winding up, this proposal before the. House is about the quality of courses available to international students and security for participants, both in terms of the course being available to them and the fees they pay up front. It provides a very distinct market advantage and a confidence boost for people looking around for education and considering Australia as an option. It shows a commitment by the government to continue to work with the sector and with other levels of government to make sure that we have a first-class international student education sector in this country. I commend the bill to the House and thank the Government Whip for giving me the opportunity to speak on the subject. Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.25 a.m.)-in reply-I would just like to thank the member for Dunkley and the member for Dobell for taking part in this debate on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1998.

307,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Minister1230 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the government can effectively discharge its fundamental responsibility to prevent the entry and stay in Australia of non-citizens who have a criminal background or have criminal associations. This bill is largely the same as one which was before the last parliament. The government has, however, made two changes from that bill. The first of these extends the time limit for lodging review applications with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the second doubles the time which that tribunal will have to review such applications. In considering this bill, we must remember that the vast majority of non-citizens who come to Australia are in fact law-abiding people. In a world of rapidly increasing people movements, our immigration arrangements must be designed to streamline the entry and stay of all genuine visitors, students, business people and permanent residents. However, a small proportion of non-citizens seeking to enter Australia do have substantial criminal backgrounds or criminal associations. Others commit crimes while they are in Australia. Steps to improve the Department ofImmigration and Multicultural Affairs's ability to detect visa applicants with substantial criminal backgrounds or associations are being taken, including consultation with law enforcement bodies overseas. For these steps to be effective, however, they must be complemented by legislative provisions to ensure that non-citizens with criminal backgrounds or criminal associations can be refused a visa. The provisions must also enable the government to remove those non-citizens who are detained following convictions for crimes committed in Australia. Experience over recent years has shown that the existing legislative provisions are inadequate for this task. This is despite the fact that they were amended as recently as 1992 with the express purpose of improving the government's ability to deal with visa applicants and visa holders with substantial criminal backgrounds. In broad terms, the bill seeks to enhance the government's ability to deal with non-citizens who are not of good character in three ways: · First, decision making in routine cases will be improved by: requiring applicants to show that they are of good character; deeming that certain levels of criminal sentences will lead to an automatic finding that the non-citizen concerned is not of good character; and allowing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to give binding directions to decision makers. · Secondly, in exceptional or emergency circumstances, the minister, acting personally, will be given powers to act decisively on matters of visa refusal, cancellation and the removal of non-citizens; and · Thirdly, information provided by Australian and international law enforcement agencies will be afforded more effective protection so that such agencies can be confident about passing information to immigration decision makers. I will now describe the major provisions of the bill in more detail. The character test The amendments proposed in this bill introduce the concept of a character test. Under this test, the onus will be on visa applicants and visa holders to satisfy decision makers that they can pass the test. This will redress a significant deficiency in the legislation arising from the Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1231 changes made in 1992. Since that time, decision makers have been required to establish that a person is not of good character before they could refuse a visa to an applicant or cancel a visa. This has meant that, whenever there has been doubt about the criminal background or criminal associations of a non-citizen, the doubt has been resolved in the non-citizen's favour. I understand that this was not the intention of the 1992 amendments. This bill takes us back to the situation that existed before 1992 by placing the onus of proof on the visa applicant to demonstrate that he or she is of good character. This means that, where there are real doubts about the criminal background or criminal associations of a visa applicant or visa holder, the objective of protecting the Australian community will take precedence in immigration decision making. Deeming provisions This bill also seeks to establish clear benchmarks for criminal behaviour that would automatically lead to a non-citizen failing the character test. Non-citizens who have been convicted to a single sentence of detention of 12 months or more, or where the length of several sentences aggregates to two years or more, will fail the character test. This will truncate the character assessment process and cover most non-citizens of character concern who come to notice. This Will provide more certainty as to who is able to pass the character test. Binding directions on exercise of the discretion Once it is established that a visa applicant or visa holder does not pass the character test, decision makers will have to decide whether to refuse the application or to cancel the visa. Exercise of this discretion will need to take into account a wide range of factors including the non-citizen's links to Australia, the nature of crimes committed, and any international law obligations This bill will enable the Minister for Iminigration and Multicultural Affairs to give precise written directions on what weight is to be given to each of these factors. These directions must be binding on all decision makers, including merits review tribunals, to ensure a consistency of approach. The written directions will be tabled in parli'ament. Protection of criminal intelligence Criminal intelligence and related information is critical to assessing the criminal background or associations of non-citizen visa applicants and visa holders. At present, it is difficult for the department to use such information in making character decisions because its disclosure might be threatened. Australian and international law enforcement agencies are reluctant to provide sensitive information unless they are sure that both the information and its sources can be protected. Greater protection for such material would complement broader national and international strategies to counter transnational crime and the activities of those associated with it. This bill increases the level of protection for such information. I cannot overstate the importance of this protection to the job of preventing the entry of foreign criminals to Australia. This was highlighted in my most recent discussions with officials of international law enforcement agencies. Merits review The opportunity to appeal character decisions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT, will be retained. However, there is a critical need to reform these arrangements in two 1232 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 main respects: first, in terms of speeding up merits review processes; and, secondly, in terms of ensuring that merits review decisions reflect community standards and expectations. Merits review streamlining and time limits Where a non-citizen who is already in Australia is refused a further visa or has had their visa cancelled on character grounds, it is essential that merits review cannot be used to prolong stay in Australia at taxpayers' expense. The average time currently taken for such cases at merits review is 227 days from the initial notification to a final decision. Many cases take even longer. During this time, the non-citizens involved, many of whom have committed serious crimes, either will be in detention at great cost to taxpayers or will be at liberty in the community. Quite frankly, this must stop. This bill introduces more streamlined procedures for dealing with such cases. It also introduces a strict 84-day time limit for the conduct of merits review cases involving character where the non-citizen is in Australia. We will ensure that all relevant documentation necessary for the AAT to determine the matter will be provided quickly, at the outset of the process. The amendments will establish a new process where the department will be required to provide two copies of the relevant documentation to the applicant at the time of the decision. Then, at the time the appeal is made, the applicant only has to lodge one copy of the documentation with the AAT. The need for strict time limits is consistent with other review processes in the immigration area, where delay can prejudice not only the applicant but, more importantly, the Australian community as a whole. The provision will result in a more streamlined process, with the applicant, the department and the AAT using less time and resources to obtain the necessary documentation. Currently, much effort is devoted to, and delay arises in, pursuing papers and documentation from noncitizens and the department. The strict time limit will prevent non-citizens from further attempts to delay the resolution of their case. It will not be in their interests to do so. Minister's power to intervene or set aside Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions Over the past 12 months or so, the AAT has made a number of character decisions that are clearly at odds with community standards and expectations. The AAT has found a number of non-citizens who have been convicted of very serious crimes to be of good character, and has ruled that they should be granted visas. There was one case where a determination was made where they effectively conducted a rehearing only hearing some of the parties, not all, in a case where a court, on appeal, had said they doubted whether or not the sentence that had been afforded in that particular case was in itself sufficient. It is for this reason that I have taken a considerable interest in the way in which these matters have been dealt with, because those decisions about which I have spoken have alarmed the community, and I might say that the community, when they are aware of these decisions, hold the government and not the AAT responsible. It is essential that the minister, acting personally, have the power to intervene and to set aside such decisions in the national interest. The minister should, however, continue to be required to table the making of any such decisions in the parliament. In other words, the accountability for a minister is to the parliament, and would be if he was making capricious decisions in this area. Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1233 Emergency cases From time to time, there will be emergency cases involving non-citizens who may be a significant threat to the community. These people may be threatening violence or some other act of destruction, or have a prior history of serious crime. In these emergency circumstances, the minister, again acting personally, should have the power to act without notice and have them taken into detention. Once the visa is cancelled, the non-citizen will have a right to make a submission to the minister as to why the cancellation should be revoked. Natural justice will apply in such cases. However, if they cannot satisfy the minister that they pass the charatter test, they should be removed immediately. Parliament should be notified of the making of such decisions but the decisions should not be subject to merits review because of their national significance. The minister is very accountable for his actions to the parliament, his colleagues and the people of Australia. The provision is similar in nature to other provisions already present in the Migration Act. Subdivision F of the Migration Act-that is section 128-provides for cancellation offshore without notice and the right of the ' non-citizen to make a subsequent submission as to why the cancellation or refusal should be revoked. This subdivision was inserted in 1992 by the previous government. . Conclusion In summary, this bill sends a clear and unequivocal message on behalf of the Australian community. The Australian community expects that non-citizens coming to Australia should be of good character. To discharge this expectation, the government must have the ability to act quickly and decisively, wherever necessary, to remove non-citizens who are not of good character. During debate in the House of Representatives before the election, the opposition indicated that they supported the objective that the government provides for in this bill. This bill now incorporates some amendments reflecting discussions between me and the then opposition spokesman. I hope thus for a speedy passage.

I have been there, done that. But, by the same token, I say to the minister: do not think that, by implementing your government's policies, you can simply throw out all the appeal procedures or at least some of the appeal procedures, because we are not going to let you do it. You might get away with it, as you did yesterday with the disallowance rule. You got a certain senator on side and you were able to get away with it, but you will not always be able to get away with it. AllI say to the minister is that this bill will rely on your good graces and on your intelligence to be able to decide whether somebody can come into the country. You can overrule even the AAT. I can understand that and I am quite comfortable with it. I know that you will do everything properly and that you will have a compassionate view and all the rest of it.

We should not be afraid of using the word 'migration'. I migrated. If you look around, I think you will find a lot of other people migrated to this country.

If we think you are doing the wrong thing, we will be out there and we will be opposing you not only in the parliament but in the media and everywhere else. The opposition supports this bill. Multicultural Affairs on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct Bill) 1998, and on the amendments he has made and thank him for being in the chamber for the first part of the debate today. would like to echo the thoughts of the member for Bowman on the contribution that migration has made to this country. In recent days we have seen attacks on migration-perhaps we have had enough migrants and there have been some questions in certain quarters about migration. I think that is a very narrow view from a very small number of people. It has been my experience that when actually faced with an attack on migrants the people who would question the benefit of further migration are the most likely people to stand there in their defence. I have seen this on a number of occasions. It is somehow the theory that upsets people, rather than the actual fact. I have seen on a number of occasions-certainly in my electorate-the support that people will give to recently arrived migrants, to the extent that they will come to my office and say, 'I think this family needs more help. We are concerned. They are around the comer and they are not getting enough help. Isn't it our responsibility to make sure that they settle in?' It is always good to see that. I echo the thoughts of the member of Bowman. This piece of legislation was originally introduced into the 38th Parliament. It has sat in the parliament while the Senate looked at it since October 1987. subject to examination in the Senate. I did have a chance to go back and briefly look at the speeches given in the House of Representatives when the bill was originally brought in and passed through the House of Representatives. At that time, some concern was expressed by the Labor Party opposition. In principle, they approved of the bill, but they had some minor concerns. This was reflected in the early days of the debate in the Senate on the bill, but as",160,Representatnes Main Committee

It was1236 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 time progressed there was a general change of attitude, I think, and general approval of the bill, especially after the minister's amendments, which he has referred to, one of which is the lengthening of the time-from 42 days to 84 days-for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to make a decision. Again, as the minister has mentioned in his speech, this was highly necessary when you consider that the average time that the AAT was taking to make a decision was 227 days. I note that in the earlier bill it was in fact 240 days. The average has come down from 240 to 227 days, but that is nowhere near good enough. That long period of time-let us face it, it is almost a year-allows people who have a criminal background and perhaps criminal intent to stay in the country and to make use of that long time in which the AAT is deliberating on whether the cancellation of the visa should be upheld. This is a sensible move that forces the AAT to move along and it is certainly what the people of this country would expect. Although we are totally supportive of migration in all of its aspects, one thing that will cast aspersions on the migration program is if we allow into the country people who have criminal backgrounds, and whose intention when they stay here is to follow on with the type of criminal activities that they have indulged in. These are people who are not of good character, and is what this bill is all about. Let me address some aspects of the bill. Section 501 introduces the character test, which in itself has quite a few aspects to it, some of which, I suspect, are a little more contentious than others. I do not think anybody would disagree that this section would exclude anybody who has a substantial criminal record or who has had an association with someone else, or with a group or organisation, whom the minister reasonably suspects has been involved in criminal conduct. A person would not pass the character test if: (d) in the event the person were allowed to enter or remain in Australia, there is a significant risk that the person would: (i) engage in criminal conduct in Australia; or (ii) harass, molest, intimidate or stalk another person in Australia; or (iii) vilify a segment of the Australian community; or (iv) incite discord in the Australian community or in a segment of that community; or (v) represent a danger to the Australian community or to a segment of the community, whether by way of being liable to become involved in activities that are disruptive to, or in violence threatening harm to, that community or segment, -r in any other way. For the purposes of the character test, there is a list of items to address when a person has a substantial criminal record. It basically comes down to if a person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see that these are the types of things that are extremely important in guarding our very valuable migration program, and the entry of people into Australia, so that the migration program can maintain its integrity and the high regard in which it is held by the people of this country. I commend the bill to the chamber. Dr THEOPHANOUS (Calwell) (10.43 a.m.)-I also wish to support the comments of the member for Bowman and welcome him to that portfolio. I support his general comments about the need for us to be more supportive of the general immigration program and to point out the benefits of immigration to the Australian community. I hope that we can get a bipartisan position on this matter following what has been a pretty disruptive 2Y2 years with some misrepresentation, especially by the former member for Oxley, on the benefits of immigration. Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1237 As the member for Bowman has indicated, we support the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1998. However, I have a few concerns about the way in which the government is approaching this issue. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration presented a report in June of this year titled Deportation of non-citizen criminals. I was surprised that the member for Hindmarsh did not mention the report because she is the chairperson of·the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. The report deals with many of the same sorts of issues that are in this bill. I point out the following. Firstly, in his second reading speech the minister did not even refer to the report, yet many of the issues which are dealt with in this legislation are also dealt with in the report. This seems to me to be a pretty serious matter, especially since there are two aspects to it. There is the question of refusing a visa to come to Australia to s.omebody who has made an application from overseas and who has a criminal record or has problems in relation to criminal records. But there is also the other question of actually cancelling the visa of a person who is already here. When you bring those issues into it, you bring in directly the issues of deportation; and they are the issues dealt with in this report. I would have thought that there was a correct procedure for the government to follow to deal with this issue. Why was there such a rush to bring the bill in again? Why not first do the proper parliamentary thing and have an official government response t.o the report Deportation of non-citizen criminals? Why not use the material from this report-which is a unanimous report of the bipartisan Joint Standing Committee on Migration-to then have a consistent position as between, on the .one hand, the criteria which we use in judging people when they make an application and, .on the .other hand, the criteria which we use in the cancellation .of visas when peDple have arrived here as nDn-citizens and have broken the law? The issues here in relatiDn to the deportation of nDn-citizen criminals are relevant if we are gDing to have SDme consistency between the set of criteria that are going tD be used when people make an applicatiDn fDr a visa and the set used either when people actually are in Australia and perform a criminal activity here Dr when it is discDvered that they did not tell us the full facts of the matter about their previous criminal activities in the cDuntry from which they came. We have a situation where what we shDuld have dDne in terms of process was, firstly, tD have a gDvernment response tD the report .of the joint standing cDmmittee. SecDndly, the minister shDuld have incorporated in the legislation issues concerning depDrtatiDn as well as issues concerning the judging .of peDple who are making application. But the legislation makes it perfectly clear, and so does the explanatory memDrandum, that this issue dDes not deal merely with cases of people who have made applicatiDn but alsD with peDple who have arrived here and whose visas are to be cancelled by the minister. It seems to me that there is a whDle range .of issues that ought to have been incDrporated, and the recDmmendatiDns of the cDmmittee ought tD have been taken into accDunt, especiaUywhen we are talking about the cancellation .of a visa-with regard tD the delineatiDn .of what cDnstitutes a seriDus offence. If we have somebody arriving in Australia WhD then cDmmits a minor criminal .offence, that is .one thing; but, if we have somebody arriving in Australia who commits major criminal offences, that is a different matter. YDU might think this is a pretty straightforward issue, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the fact of the matter is that defining minor and majDr .offences is actually quite a complicated question. It is an issue which the cDmmittee took up at great length and debated and discussed. I would 1238 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 commend the recommendations of the committee report to the minister when he is exercising his powers in determining whether to cancel a visa. These issues are very important, I believe, to the general thrust. We need consistency between the principles that we apply to people who are making application to come to Australia and those that we apply to people who are already here, when the minister is deciding to actually cancel a visa. The second issue that I wish to raise about the legislation concerns the nature of the character test itself. Of course, we totally agree with most of the provisions and we have no problem with them, because they deal with criminal issues-although, as I said, I think it important, when looking at the defined detail of what should be the relevant criminal issues to be taken up, that we refer to the discussion and the recommendations of this report. There are another couple of very important provisions in this bill. In particular I ref-r to proposed subsection 501(6) which lists why a person would not pass the character test. Subparagraph (d)(iii) says that a person does not pass the character test if they: vilify a segment of the Australian community; and subparagraph (d)(iv) says they do not pass the test if they: incite discord in the Australian community or in a segment of that community; This is a difficult provision because it can be misused. I do not say it will be misused by the current minister for immigration, but let us assume another minister for immigration does not like a particular political perspective being presented to the Australian community. Such a minister would be able to use the subparagraph 'incite discord in the Australian community or in a segment of that community' to exclude someone whose political views he might think are objectionable. cases. We have to be very careful about this. Have a look at the juxtaposition of rationalisations which the minister has used in relation to -the exclusion of Gerry Adams from Australia. Initially we had a situation where we were told that he was a person of bad character. Then we were told that he might have been involved in association with people who had criminal activities. Then we were told that the minister has an absolute discretion to decide this matter, irrespective of what anyone thinks. you wish. The extraordinary thing about this is that we were told initially that Mr Adams was a person of bad character and that he ought to be excluded. Then, 10 and behold, after he had played a very constructive part in the peace process, we were told that Mr Adams is actually a person of good character and is going to be allowed into Australia. That was a remarkable transformation. There is a humorous element to this but there is also a serious element. The serious element has to do with the fact that if we are going to use political criteria in the assessment of this clause we could have difficulties with respect to people being able to come into Australia who have an alternative point of view. Let us take the following example. Suppose a leader of a Muslim community wants to come to Australia to talk about fundamentalist Islam. Do we then say that this person is going to incite discord in the Australian community or in a section of that community? Are we then",161,Representatives Main Committee

319,Dr Theophanous,"Just a minute. You will have an opportunity to speak later on ifWednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1239 going to say that, because someone has a fundamentalist religious view, we do not allow them to come in because they may be of bad character? I know this a hard question but immigration policy involves facing up to hard questions. That is what it involves. It seems to me that we need further clarification of this particular clause. I would like the minister in his summing up to give this chamber a clarification of what the meaning is of that clause and how he intends to put it into operation. I say this not from any particular perspective. I am not at all a supporter of fundamentalist Islam, but at the same ""' time there is the question of religious freedom. There is the question of interfering with people's rights to hear a point of view. I think there is a difference between that and the issue of actually coming into Australia to, as it says in subparagraph (iii), 'vilify a segment of the Australian community' . I agree with that clause. I think that clause is important, because if someone comes in and wishes to spread racism and hate by vilifying a section of the Australian community that is a different thing. That clause I agree with; I think we should in fact be more explicit about what that clause means, but I agree with the general thrust of that particular clause. That clause can deal with such issues as not allowing blatant racists into Australia who are going to come and actually go around vilifying a section of our Australian community. But the question of inciting discord, in terms of the definition of discord when it may be used for political purposes or quasi-political purposes, certainly needs to be further clarified in this legislation. I have raised a couple of issues that I think are very important in considering this bill. They are raised in a constructive fashion, not against the bill but as to how we should deal with the bill and the issues raised by the bill. I hope that the minister will respond to those comments. Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1998, I cannot help but feel that there is a conundrum here. For many of our original European settlers who came to his country, one of the conditions to be allowed into the country was that they had to have a criminal record. Now, of course, we do not. I wonder how Francis Greenwaythat well-known forger who become one of our great architects-feels today! There is a message there also: that many people who do come to this great country of opportunity, once they get here, regardless of their background, perceive the opportunities that exist and grasp them with both hands. Certainly many of them became great Australians. While we support this amendment because it is about the integrity of our immigration program, it is also about the accountability of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. I would like to briefly refer to what was perhaps a small incident to the minister that occurred in the electorate of Paterson 12 months ago, but one that was of major concern to a number of Australians because, as a result of the decision of the minister, those people lost their jobs. That was the result of the minister making a decision about the skilled personnel provision that allowed a number of Korean chicken-sexers to come to Australia. The fact that they are Korean has absolutely nothing to do with it. The organisation that applied to bring these people in claimed that they were skilled, claimed that they were going to train Australians, and then simply used them as a ram to get rid of Australian jobs and force those that had to continue working to save their homes to work for half their original pay and a loss of conditions. That is one of the things that I would ask this minister to revisit. If we are talking about the accountability of the minister, we are talking about accountability to Australian citizens. Our immigration program should not result in a",164,Representatives Main Committee

Yet, as a result of a decision by this minister, a number of Australians that I know quite well have had the quality of their life degenerate considerably. And what do we find? These people were brought here to train Australians, and once they were here it was discovered they could not even communicate in English. Twelve months down the track, while the majority of those people that were allowed into Australia are still here, not one hour's training has taken place and they are still holding down the jobs that were previously held by Australians. I also believe, from talking to the workers there, that there has not been any improvement in the standard of chicken-sexing. There has been no increase in productivity. ' My involvement in this debate is purely to ask the minister to revisit this decision, look at it, and decide if the original approval satisfied the statement that was made when the application was made to bring these people here and whether or not they should be allowed to continue to reside in Australia and hold down the jobs of Australians. I do not believe that they do satisfy their original conditions of entry. I would appreciate a reply from the minister. Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1998. As the member for Hindmarsh noted, along the road the opposition has tended to come behind the vast majority of provisions in this bill, and that, of course, reflects the agreement by the government to a number of amendments. Philosophically, there are very diverse views on this matter. The Australian Catholic Migrant and Refugee Office in their submission to the Senate inquiry articulated one position when, on pages 1 and 2 of that submission, they noted: If there is good reason to believe that serious harm will be done to the common good by allowing a person or persons to enter the nation, then it becomes the duty of the State to protect the common good by preventing that movement. However, our presumption-should be in favour of people's right to freedom of movement and any exception needs to be justified. The onus of proof of bad character should lie with the State. No one should have to prove themselves worthy of a basic human right. PerhapsI might dispute their belief that entry into the country is essentially an immediate human right. However, DIMA, in submission No. 23, page 3, in regards to onus of proof, put forward an alternative position when they said: The result of introducing the character test will be to focus the decision maker's attention on the relevant decision which is whether in all the circumstances of the particular case the non-citizen should be permitted to be the holder of an Australian visa. In reaching this decision, the decision maker will, as a matter of course, consider the range of factors that in many of the submissions should be considered first. Essentially, there is a very wide divergence of views. There is a belief that essentially these changes would put particularly onerous burdens on people in establishing their right to come to this country and that the legislation could be utilised for purposes of political discrimination. The legislation might catch up people who spent time in overseas prisons where there are no legal due processes such as we have in this. country and where people are essentially in gaols for political opposition. We can go around the world. We saw yesterday that people were detained in China for attempting to establish an alternative political party. We note that Burma, Myanmar, is the leading example put forward, where members of the National League for Democracy are gaoled. There are people who come to this debate, particularly NGOs, who will articulate those",165,Representatives Main Committee
321,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid)(11.10 A.m.),"I note the Senate inquiry into the MigrationWednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1241 concerns. We have to put a degree of faith in the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and his long-term commitment to Amnesty International and human rights. We have a person in the job who would, on balance, be responsible in these matters. There are some questions that should be considered in the long-term review of how effective this legislation is. I, for one, would have some difficulties with the insanity provisions. has been acquitted of an offence on the grounds of unsoundness of mind or insanity and who, as a result, has been detained in a facility or institution. The Ethnic Communities Council of New South Wales said that this was regressive in terms of Australian social policy. FECCA noted that it was not limited as to time, and that the detention in that facility could be as short as three months. For the member opposite who interjected in regard to mental stability, if he is talking about mental difficulties in politics, I refer him to a number of works on the former conservative minister for justice in New South Wales who finished up in the Broadmoor mental asylum after a few murders. There is a situation here where the insanity provisions could cause some concern. There is a worry that in certain circumstances the legislation could be used by a person, with less concern for human rights than the current minister has, not to allow people in who had committed political offences. There is the question of rehabilitation of people: how long past are the offences; has the person basically changed their ways? The other thing that I would be concerned about is the question of confidential information. I think some convincing arguments were put in the Senate inquiry. I asked the adviserbecause I had not followed the debate closely-whether the government had accepted those points. Apparently, the government, surprisingly to me, had not acceded to some of the submissions that perhaps the information could be confidential to the tribunal alone and not given out to other parties. I think there could be worries that decisions could be made that should perhaps see further consideration and alternative views rather than being suppressed. In DIMA's argument in chapter 2, point 2.95, the department stressed: Confidential infonnation would not allow for someone to mischievously or maliciously disrupt the processing of an applicapt's visa because infonnation would have been assessed and agreed by a professional law enforcement agency before being passed on to the parliament. It added that the decisionmaker would still have to decide what weight should be given to the infonnation, having regard to other elements of the particular case. I personally do not find that convincing. I think there is a real danger that material that is considered by one person perhaps should not be given the weight that person gives it, and it should have further examination. I support fully the attempt by' the government to expedite these kinds of matters. It is alarming that the 1996-97 AAT annual report shows that the period of time from the receipt of application for review to the actual hearing is 45 weeks. It is very alarming. Unfortunately, it sometimes gives people a perception that they have inherited a right to stay here for a long period by establishing ties. This is one of the constant problems of the Australian immigration policy. The quicker we can process these claims and appeals, the better. In reading about this matter, I was directed to one unfortunate use of the legislation.

There are some interesting quotes in regard to the government's handling of that case. On 10 July, the Australian noted: Under terms of increasing arbitrariness, Ervin has been declared to be a bad character. :, .. Once a bad character, always a bad character, it seems. That, of course, arose from the claims of the former member for Oxley. The Prime Minister went on public radio and said, 'Let me be quite precise that, firstly, he concealed his conviction of plane hijacking and, secondly, he used a different name from the one that was on the outwatch list.' Over the course of the next week or so, that elicited a lot of media coverage. The Sydney Morning Herald, on 12 July 1997, stated: The Prime Minister's kneejerk reaction to the complaints of two far-right organisations about the former Black Panther, Lorenzo Ervin, triggered a week of high farce ending in a humiliating backdown. The article also stated: Vanstone decided Ervin was not of good charact-r under section 501 of the Migration Act, revoking his visa. No document has surfaced in which she explains what she had taken into account in reaching her decisions. She simply circled a series of yes/no propositions for decision at the end of Immigration's brief. And, further on, it said: Overnight, the Government realised it did not have a leg to stand on. To avoid the ignominy of the court ruling against it, the Government consented to an order cancelling Vanstone's decision and paying Ervin's costs. In the Weekend Australian, on 26 July 1997, Dennis Shanahan said: About the same time as ageing US black panther Lorenzo Ervin left Australia yesterday, the Minister for Immigration Philip Ruddock cancelled his visitor visa. Attempts by Acting Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone to have Mr Ervin expelled immediately failed after a court challenge, and Mr Ruddock was recalled from a ministerial visit to Belgrade to deal with the situation. In the Sydney Morning Herald, on 12 July, the editorial said: ... Ms Pauline Hanson who accused him of being ""a known terrorist and gun-runner"". It is, however, a win for Australia's image as a tolerant country, although that victory came at the expense of Australia's reputation as a competent country. The editorial further noted: Mr Howard's determination to ""have something done"" about ""someone with that sort of background"" was an unfortunate overreaction. Mr Ervin is at worse a Grey Panther with a colourful Black Panther past. But that past is well distant from his present activities. The Ervin case raises questions about Mr Howard's judgment when confronted with allegations from Ms Hanson. It is hard to avoid the belief that he panicked. The Age of 12 July, under the heading 'A Pink Panther rerun', said: Leaving a trail of ineptitude fit for characters modelled on Peter Sellers' bumbling Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther films, the Australian Government yesterday withdrew from the pursuit of the former Black Panther Mr Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin. Furthermore, the newspaper noted that: He was jailed on Tuesday and this triggered protests in several countries and flak in the US, where it was pointed out that two former Black Panthers, now congressmen, would be visiting Australia before the Olympic Games. Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1243 That is an instance of some of the overreaction that can occur and some of the difficulties, if we are not careful, with the right to exclude people of bad character. As the newspaper also notes, it can reflect on other parties. People from the Black Panthers are now in the US Congress. Stokely Carmichael's death the other day really indicates how far distant these issues, allegations and offences were. In broad outline, I would agree with the opposition that, on the balance of requirements in this country, we do have a government power to exclude people that are not of good character and that perhaps in the past, because of the onus of proof, there has been too much consideration of the rights of people who are not citizens of this country in regard to access. It has perhaps in reality thwarted swifter decision making and essentially meant that too much consideration was given to their rights. I think that on balance this legislation is in the right direction. I would also take the opportunity to have a slightly different position from the member for Calwell in regard to Gerry Adams's access to this country. I think that both parties in this country have had reasonable grounds, if you do take it that a number of other people have been excluded on the grounds of internal terrorist campaigns, et cetera. I think that the situation has materially changed in the last half-year and that the government have made the decision at the right time. I commend them on that and, as I say, a number of people are excluded for good reason. On balance, this is reasonable legislation. M ... RUDDOCK (Berowra-Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation) (11.22 a.m.)-in reply-I say, firstly, that I appreciate very much the contributions of the honourable members for Bowman, Hindmarsh, Calwell, Paterson and Reid. I thank them for their contributions in this debate. The purpose of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Strengthening of Provisions relating to Character and Conduct) Bill 1998 is clearly to safeguard the Australian community and to enable the government to effectively discharge its duties and responsibilities to the Australian people. The bill is about sending a very clear and unequivocal message that the immigration program is one of integrity. The immigration program is one where character issues are germane. The Australian community should not be feeling that the program is the way in which people who have linkages with organisations which we hear about in disparaging terms-such as triads, mafia and yakuza-are able to enter Australia and pose a risk to the Australian community. It is a very difficult area in which to operate, because a lot of the information you receive about people of character concern is intelligence information. If you are really dealing with somebody who has significant organised criminal links, and where people have been informants about their activities, you cannot readily open to the public gaze the information and the decision making undertaken in cases of that sort. I was listening to the honourable member for Reid putting one side of the argument, which is that people like to know what is alleged against them and to be able to respond to those matters. But we do have situations very often where the information shared with us comes from police informants overseas on the basis that it will not be made public and not be provided to the applicant. The difficulty we face is in providing avenues of appeal. Disclosure can be sought because judges and tribunal members say, 'We expect that information to be before us to be able to make a proper decision in relation to it,' and you may put somebody's life in jeopardy. This bill is to try to deal with those sorts of questions because there needs to be a responsible cooperation between decision makers and the government about how much 1244 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 information can be disclosed and in what circumstances it might be disclosed, so that the courts will be involved in a proper role of protection of the people who have provided information. I want to also take up the last point made by the honourable member for Reid because it was one that I think demonstrates in relation to this bill two propositions that I have been putting forward. You do not always know the facts, and the honourable member for Reid demonstrated that. Lorenzo Ervin had been not just a member of the Black Panther movement. Using a weapon, he had hijacked an aircraft with a large number of people on board, putting their lives at risk. He had been sentenced in the United States to two life sentences for that crime, but claimed that he had been pardoned in relation to that offence. We found later that that information that had been provided was incorrect. And, when he entered Australia and was asked about his prior criminal convictions, he failed to disclose that he had been sentenced to two life sentences. Migration rules have to have integrity. If you work on the basis that, if somebody fails to disclose the information, it is of no consequence, I think, perhaps, you have got a distorted view. Sure, what happened in relation to the Lorenzo matter was a decision made by a minister. Ministers have to have regard to how they are going to be seen when they take decisions. There are consequences. This is the point I made about accountability. You have got to explain your case. You have got to be able to justify it. Sure, Lorenzo was a geriatric Panther. Some people might want to ridicule you for that and that is a matter that you have got to take into account. But I must say I would not be afraid to go out into the community and say that people who have misled me as to their intentions when they have filled out forms and who have failed to disclose very serious criminal convictions are of characte-concern. I think they are. In relation to this bill, there were some other points made during the debate. The honourable member for Calwell was concerned about the Joint Standing Committee on Migration report into criminal deportations. There will be more legislation arisirig from the committee's work. This was dealing with character issues in the broad. It was not dealing with criminal deportation and obviously the report is one we will be responding to. When you bring in a migration bill, of course you are asked to deal with other issues. The honourable member for Paterson was concerned about Korean chicken-sexers. Let me say that I do not regard Korean chicken-sexers to be of character concern but obviously there are issues relating to the entry of people under temporary entry visas for employment in Australia. Those issues had been raised by the former member for Paterson with me. I looked very closely at the circumstances in which Korean chicken-sexers entered into Australia. Any matters of concern that might be ongoing that the member for Paterson thinks ought to be examined, obviously I am quite prepared to ask my officers to further investigate. But I am not about to use the provisions to maintain essentially a closed shop in which people who have experience in a particular field ""and can come here and train Australians in using more advanced and more productive techniques might be denied that opportunity. I think some people were keen to see that happen. I think we have to take a balanced view in these matters. Certainly, when the concerns have been raised with the department, we have investigated fully all of those matters. The honourable member for Calwell also raised issues about some of the more generic terms in relation to character questions. Character deals with criminal records. It deals with people Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1245 who have been associated with terrorist organisations. It also deals with those people who are likely to incite civil disorder and discord in Australia. There have been some difficulties in relation to the implementation of those provisions. We saw that when the decision by former Minister Bolkus in relation to David Irving was challenged in the courts. It is already fairly restrictively construed because of the judicial decisions that have been made there. It is important to protect the Australian community from those with extremist and polarising views. I think it can be addressed in a number of ways. People will have seen my decision in relation to the American Islamic leader, where we counselled him on our multicultural character as a nation and invited him to be constrained in the way in which he commented in Australia, so as not to incite discord. It proved to be a satisfactory way of addressing his entry to Australia. But it is not always going to be. I do not know that Pol Pot was ever convicted of any serious crimes, given the fact that the Khmer Rouge were either in government or rampant in a situation where nobody could be convicted. But let us say he applied for a visa to enter Australia. Do you think the presence of a person of that sort would be conducive to a quiet and quiescent Australian community? in the world. There have been a number of people out of the former Yugoslavia that ministers of governments of your persuasion have excluded on character grounds. Given the concern with the political situation that has existed there, there could be a polarisation of views within the Australian community. Powers like that in the hands of ministers I do not think are unreasonable. I have never complained about it when I have been sitting in the chair opposite and ministers have had to make those sorts of decisions and have had to make that sort of call. I think it goes with the territory. Ultimately, ministers are responsible to the parliament. If you make the wrong call, you are going to be very embarrassed about it, so you do it with a great deal of care. This bill has been designed to put most of the decision making in the hands of officers. It has reconfigured the burden of proof. I think that is important for the reasons I outlined in my second reading speech. The bill has provision for me to be able to give decision makers clear and objective criteria against which they can make decisions, to help them with some advice as to what weight they will put on those matters. I do have a concern that sometimes the rights of a child in Australia of someone who has been selling drugs, for instance, are given greater weight than the rights of the many children of other Australians who are abused by those who are trading in those sorts of products. I do have a view about that, and I do not apologise for it. Certainly, in looking at the statements that are being prepared for decision makers, I intend that the statement will reflect that concern. I think we have gone overboard on the Convention on the Rights of the Child to be concerned only about the rights of children of those people who want to enter Australia, and not the impact that their presence might have on other children, for instance, or the Australian community as a whole. With that guidance, we might find coming from the AAT decisions that are more sensible. I do not want to be bagging the AAT but, when you look at some of the decisions that have been taken, it is hard to come to any view other than that they are remote from current community standards and from the expectations of the Australian community.",167,Representatives Main Committee
324,Mr Sercombe,It would be fairly reckless if he applied now.,171,Representatives Main Committee
325,Mr Ruddock,"It would be. I am using him as an example. He may not be the only one1246 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 I will retain a discretion, as this bill provides. It is a discretion that ought to be in hands of the minister. It reflects the fundamental principle that has operated in this area over time; that is, that the government of the day-rather than unelected, merely appointed, individuals who very often seek to assume powers that the parliament has never intended that they should have-ought to be able to take responsibility for these matters. It is one of the reasons that, in other legislation that I will be inviting the parliament to consider, I am putting very strongly the view that the elected legislature and its delegates ought to have responsibility, and not unelected judges or tribunal members who a-e intent on creative decision making which puts them in the position where they are making the laws. As I said in the House recently, it was not so long ago that my department was faced with a situation where, because of judicial decision making, we were having to allow entry to 20,000 people who would not otherwise have been able to access Australia under any selection criteria that had been developed by the government. Such distortions cannot, in my view, be entertained. It was certainly the view of Robert Ray, when he was a minister and had moved to constrain that particular operation, that the changes should be implemented. He achieved those changes because of the cooperation of an opposition that understood what was involved. I welcome the opposition's cooperation in relation to the bill, but I invite them to consider the long-term interests of being able to run an efficacious migration program, the problems that they had to deal with when they were in office and the sorts of measures that are necessary to deal with them. I invite the opposition to separate themselves out from the advocates, who often have a very significant conflict of interest when they are arguing to us. Some of the advocates who are very vocal on these issues at the moment are the very people who_ are members of law firms which are taking class actions and advertising to some of the most vulnerable people-in journals called the 'Bangladesh News' or some such thing, and in the Fijian and Filipino papers-for people who are unlawful to join in class actions to challenge decisions; and they are making very large amounts of money as a result. Then they come in here and face up to us with a bit of special pleading and say, 'We need to be able to take these matters to the courts'-to get the judges to tum their minds to some particular esoteric point. There are some very cooperative judges in the Federal Court of Australia-not many, but some-who take an expansive view in relation to these matters; and it makes the task of running an efficacious program that can be defended with vigour from the likes of the Hansons of this world very much more difficult. I commend the bill to the House. I am glad we have it. I think it will strengthen our ability to deal with these particular issues. But there is an unfinished agenda.

326,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Quick),"If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail,Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1247 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 November, on motion by Mr Vaile: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr O'CONNOR (Corio) (11.40 a.m.)-The opposition will not be opposing the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998. This particular bill gives effect to the recommendations of the McColl report which suggested a refocusing of rural adjustment assistance in this country. It is part of the government's AAA package that was implemented for Australia's rural sector. There are aspects of that particular package that we in the opposition do not support, but this is a bill which has received broad support from us and the farming community across the length and breadth of this country. The process of structural adjustment in the Australian economy is a process that has intensified over the last two decades. In my own electorate, for example, which is a manufacturing based electorate, we have had significant restructuring in key industries. Textile, clothing and footwear and automotive manufacturing were the two main areas where intensive industry restructuring took place and we have seen considerable job shedding in those particular industries. The processes that were at work in those industries as we refocused those industries to deal with the challenges of the global marketplace have been at work in Australia's rural sector, where over the past two decades we have seen quite monumental structural changes in the rural sector. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, I am sure you would appreciate this, given your history and acquaintance with the rural sector. When I cast my mind back to my own upbringing on a dairy farm in the Western District of Victoria, we milked the cows by hand. The milk went into cans and then the truck came to pick them up to take them to the factory. It was a fairly labour-intensive operation at that stage. Now you see dairy farms with upwards of 1,000, 2,000 and sometimes 3,000 head of cattle being milked and quite enormous gains in production. The application of technologies has seen modern dairy farms quite unrecognisable from the old dairy farms that were in existence as far as the new technologies are concerned. Even the production of hay was a very labour-intensive operation. I can recall the days when we used to stook the hay as well as bale it and pitchfork it onto a truck and then put it in a stack. All of that was quite labour intensive and it provided significant employment for a rural work force who were not owners of capital or the land base. These were farm workers who worked in a variety of areas in the rural sector at the time, be it carting hay, be it relief milking, or be it bagging onions by hand. Even in the potato and onion area, one which I am more familiar with than others, the changed requirement for labour, the application of new technologies, and the advances in transport and packaging and handling, have transformed that industry. And that process of transformation is still fairly intense. Of course, this puts significant demands on farmers who seek to make their living in the rural sector at the moment. Just sweeping with the broad brush here, we have seen the number of farmers decline, the number of farms decline, production increase substantially, and many of the industries refocusing their efforts in the export area. But we have also seen an interesting structural adjustment on farm with the diversification of product that is produced on farms or in particular regions. I happened to take a drive a couple of weeks ago to my home area, which was basically a dairy farming area with some 1248 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 cropping-potatoes and onions mainly, but some hays, lucernes and various other crops. As I drove around it was interesting to see the subtle changes that have occurred in my own local area. On the side of Red Rock we now have vines-there is quite a degree of planting of vines in the area now. There are several small businesses growing flowers quite intensively and making a very good living out of that, and I saw a deer farm where before there had been a dairy farm. Observing the dairy farms that exist there, I cast my mind back to the time when the herds were 30 to 40 head of cattle. Now, the average is around 200 to 300, but some are WOO-head dairies. So there has been significant on-farm adjustment and there has been a reorientation of the rural sector to the export task. What we have here is a piece of legislation which will be of assistance to farmers as they cope with those adjustmehts to the new realities of their market environment. I note the objectives of the legislation are to improve on-farm productivity and to improve the management skills of farmers. This is very important. If we look at an industry like the wool industry that is going through a period of quite significant turmoil at the moment, its rate of on-farm productivity improvement is well below that of mixed farms and dedicated cropping farms. The disparities in the annual increases in productivity are quite staggering wheIl you consider some wool properties compared with, say, cropping properties. There is a real need to educate farmers and retrain farmers in new techniques of production and in other dimensions of their business so that they can become more productive and survive in the very challenging and changing environment that they find themselves in. There is considerable debate in the rural community about the future of the family farm. We know that the family farm at the moment really depends not only on the production on farm but on the capacity of members of the farm to earn off-farm income. This issue of productivity is going to be central to the survival of those family farms in the pew millennium. I note the other objective of the legislation is to improve the management skills of farmers. I am not sure how to put this, Mr Deputy Speaker, but perhaps I can say the 'Achilles heel' of the agricultural sector is the resistance to change that has been apparent over the past decades in some sectors. I know there are some very progressive sectors in agriculture today, but certainly in some areas there has been a reluctance on the part of many farmers to take on new technologies, to seek out training, to explore knowledge about their own markets. I guess the problem that many rural industries have had has been changing the culture of production and getting farmers into the broader race to improve skills and to cope with the challenges of their market environment. Having read through the minister's second reading speech, I would like to canvass some of the activities that will be supported by the legislation. I refer to skill development, farm planning, financial planning, quality assurance matters, performance benchmarking, risk management, marketing and natural resource management. These are part of a lexicon of today's production environment that, I guess, was not there 20 years ago. If you went up to a farmer and said, 'We need to give you some skills to benchmark your performance against others,' he would say, 'I do that. I take a drive around the district and have a look at other farmers' onions and I have a look at mine.' There was, perhaps, no science in the way which producers benchmarked their performances against others in the industry-and, indeed, others in the world. Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1249 Similarly, if you go through any of these terms that describe the activities that are going to be supported by this legislation, farmers would have approached these issues in a very instinctive way in the past, but not, perhaps, in the most rational or scientific way to their own benefit. So that range of activities that has been described really says it all as far as refocusing the Rural Adjustment Scheme, or rural adjustment for the agricultural sector of this economy, is concerned, and I think that it is a worthwhile refocusing at this stage. I might sound a note of warning here. This is not to pour any cold water on the objectives of the government or the activities that are going to be supported in this legislation, but I think there is a very clear emphasis here on education and training. I would support that, but I think there needs to be some care taken in the way these training programs hit the ground for the benefit of farmers. We certainly do not want training for training's sake, or a plethora of training programs that supposedly focus on improving individual skills of farmers but, in fact, dilute the training effort and do not maintain the sort of focus that is required. I think that focus can be maintained with proper structures and providers being funded and, of course, a review process of substance put in place to ensure that proper education and training are being delivered. There has been some concern expressed, for example, by Mr Clay Manners of the Victorian Farmers Federation. He had this to say: ... farmers will be very sceptical about education and training being seen as the panacea. I do not think that farmers would see education and training as being a panacea; the problems that are facing the rural sector are broader than that. But the key to the survival of Australia's farm sector in the new millennium is certainly going to be based very much on the capacity of producers to respond to their marketplace and to produce products for that marketplace. Of course, the acquisition of knowledge about that marketplace, and the tools and incentive to obtain that knowledge, will come from a culture where education and training are respected and seen as worthwhile, and are encouraged by government. So as far as the opposition is concerned, we will be supporting the legislation that has been put before us here. I think it is interesting to note that the effectiveness and strength of this particular program, FarmBis, and the $50 million that is being allocated-which is not an insignificant amount of money-will lie in the partnerships that will be constructed and developed, in an ongoing sense, to deliver the programs and to support the activities that I have just described. It is very important that the training infrastructure in rural and regional areas is sustained and developed for the benefit of those who choose to live in those regions. Of course, the funding that is made available in this program, in cooperation with state governments and other institutions, will ensure that that training infrastructure stays in place and is used effectively for the benefit of the rural sector. We support the general thrust of this Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998. We are from the opposition and we are here to help you! This is one dimension of the AAA package-a small part of that package that we do support. Amendment Bill 1998, I wish to highlight the fact that this bill is part of an overall strategy that addresses many of the problems experienced by the farming sector. These problems have gone on for many years and we have seen government after government simply applying bandaids to them-bandaids to droughts, floods, low commodity prices and those sorts of things. In many cases, the bandaids only entrenched poverty. More often than not, they forced",172,Representatives Main Committee
327,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (11.52 a.m.)-In speaking in favour of the Rural Adjustment1250 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 farmers into a situation where they were always going to have to rely on government assistance. Some of the assistance measures, such as low interest rate loans, simply had the effect of increasing the farmers' debts. Probably-and more importantly-what many of these bandaid measures produced was a culture which has meant a reliance on government every time something went wrong. The government's Agriculture-Advancing Australia package, the AAA package, which was launched in my electorate in Hoskintown in September last year, was a comprehensive program aimed very squarely at changing the culture in the farming sector. It covered a variety of measures, including things like the Farm Family Restart scheme and the Retirement Assistance for Farmers scheme. The Farm Family Restart scheme has improved welfare support to the farm sector and offers adjustment assistance to farmers wishing to leave the industry. It provides a welfare safety net for low income farmers experiencing financial hardship. This particular scheme is available to those who cannot borrow further against their assets and/or who are not ready to sell their farm and apply for welfare support under the normal social security hardship provisions. It also provides family income support payments, re-establishment grants and financial assistance to participate in business assessment and financial counselling. The Retirement Assistance for Farmers scheme, which was allied to this, allows farmers of the age pension age to transfer the legal title of their family farm to a younger generation and be eligible immediately for the age pension. Without this provision, there is normally a five year wait before the pension is given, when assets of more than $10,000 a year are gifted. This particular scheme also applies to veteran pensioners and to those who have transferred legal title of their property in the last five years preceding the introduction of this particular legislation. These two aspects of the AAA package have worked very well in my electorate, particularly the Retirement Assistance for Farmers scheme, as both in the Monaro and in the Bega Valley we have had a great number of farmers-and I often come across these people, many-in their 80s-still working the land with a son or a daughter, on properties which now effectively are struggling to support one family, let alone two. But they really had no choice. The son or the daughter was not in a position to buy the farm and the parents were not in a position to gift it, because, if they had, they would be left with nothing and then would not be able to claim a pension for five years. Many of the tragic circumstances, of which I have seen a number over the last year or so in that very difficult part of the Monaro, and following on from the five-year drought that we had, have been able to be overcome through the government's implementation of the AAA package. I have mentioned these other schemes, which were part of the package, as an introduction to this bill to highlight that it is an integrated package. This bill which covers the Farm Business Improvement Program-or FarmBis-is crucial to the overall success of primary industry adjustment. The other two schemes, the restart and retirement assistance schemes, are primarily to help farmers retire gracefully out of the industry or to start again in a mo-e viable way. The FarmBis program is basically the education and training side of it. This program is a recognition of the changing world. It is a recognition that it is not possible to continue doing things the same old way; a recognition that the average farmer needs to be more involved in the overall management of his or her industry. The FarmBis program is designed to help farmers in all of these areas. The government will be making direct financial Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1251 contributions towards the cost of these types of training activities-as the member for Corio said, something in the order of $50 million. It is not insignificant, but it also is a recognition of the importance that we place on having those skills right and further education and training. The sorts of things that will be included in this program cover quite a variety of areas such as further development of skills, farm business planning, financial planning, financial advice, farm performance benchmarking, quality assurance, risk management, marketing and natural resource management. IfI may I will just pick up on a couple of those. On farm performance benchmarking-as the member for Corio was saying-some years ago 'benchmarking' -which was not a word which you would have found used by the average cocky-probably meant wandering around having a look at a few other fields of wheat or whatever, checking out the sheep or cattle of the other farmers in the district at the shows and those sorts of things. You worked out a bit of a gut feeling benchmark from there. But it has become very scientific. I have to say-that one of the real advantages of this type of program that we are funding is in this area of farm performance benchmarking. In particular, I will just mention the example of a company in my electorate, Michael Boyce and Co., who are accountants in Cooma and who also have offices in other parts of New South Wales, and who have specialised very much in accounting services for rural industry. They have been running this type of benchmarking under their own steam. Because they are dealing with such a wide variety of farmers throughout New South Wales, and increasingly beyond, they have access to an enormous amount of information. They have been able to run this information into a system so that their clients can then access it and do some of this benchmarking. It is based on real scientific work. This was an initiative that they started themselves without government funding, but it is the sort of program that will come into this FarmBis categoryI commend them for that, because it has certainly been absolutely crucial in an electorate like the one I have. It has been particularly crucial in an area like the Monaro, which has undergone very difficult times. Every little bit extra that you can get out of the farm has been worthwhile over the last few years. Another aspect is risk management. I would like to just say a bit more about that too. Increasingly that is going to become a very important aspect for farmers to do in a far more scientific way. But, at the end of the day, there still is a certain amount of gut feeling needed-as in the case of the Monaro, which I go back to-because the difficulty is that a lot of farmers were making the decision of 'Do we join this year?' In a place like the Monaro-prime sheep, prime wool country-it would be inconceivable, you would think, even to think about that but unfortunately many farmers were placed in that position because of the lack of feed and water. They thought, 'Can we really cope with additional stock if we do join?' That was a risk management decision that they had to make. Certainly, training and scientific work that can be done over periods of time will help them make that decision. I was talking only yesterday with some farmers who have a property south of Dalgety. They were probably in some of the worse country during the very difficult drought. I have never seen country like it was earlier this year. It was just devastating for such an excellent property. They had been handfeeding sheep for over 12 months. They had reduced their stocks to about a third. In the wintertime they came to the point of saying, 'We are down on stock. We are going to be down on substantial income next year. Do we take a risk and put in a crop? Do we put in a canola crop and risk that we will get the necessary rains?' They took that risk and fortunately-and I am just delighted for them-we did get the rains in the right -sorts of places. It has been worthwhile and that will give them some additional income, although they are a bit worried about the grasshoppers that are starting to breed right now as well. They are the 1252 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 sorts of really hard, on the ground, risk management decisions that have to be made. If we can help farmers in that way I think that is excellent. The focus of the program is on partnership. The example I just gave of Michael Boyce and Co. is a good example of how the partnership aspect works well for a broad range of farmers. In many cases the program will bring together state agencies, industry bodies, farmers and community groups. Landcare groups, for instance, I am sure will be involved. All will be working together to determine and implement training needs. The program will also be divided between a state component and a national component. The state component will be funded fifty-fifty with the states. This is a recognition that farm development can have different focuses from state to state, between states and nationally. I mentioned earlier that this program recognises the need for farmers to be more involved in the overall management of his or her industry and the management training aspects of the program will be of great assistance in that regard. A good and current example of the need to have farmers more involved beyond the farm gate is the wool industry. It is now recognised that the average wool grower cannot just do a good job in producing top class wool, stand back and watch the bales get trucked out of the gate and then wait for the cheque to arrive. They recognise that they must have a greater say in the promotion and selling of their product, a greater say in the research and development aspects of their product because it is their product, not that of highly paid bureaucrats. It belongs to the farmer. That is why the wool growers voted in large numbers to express no confidence in the way their product has been promoted and sold and how money has been spent on research and development. The federal government, I know, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry here at the table will be moving quickly to give this control and the control of their stockpile back to the wool growers-in my view not a moment too soon. That no confidence motion is a defining moment in the wool industry. Wool growers now need to take their industry by the throat and make sure that they are not the ones being choked in the future. Developing skills necessary to be involved in the further running of the industry is just one of the many potential benefits that will come from the Farm Business Improvement Program, the subject of this Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998. I commend this bill to the House. Farm Business Improvement Program. As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry .said in his second reading speech, the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998 is to make a number of amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 to allow the introduction of the Farm Business Improvement Program known as FarmBis. I am a wholehearted supporter of this initiative because it replaces aspects of the Rural Adjustment Scheme. I am also a wholehearted supporter of the umbrella policy of the Agriculture-Advancing Australia package. The $525 million Agriculture-Advancing Australia package was released in September 1997 after close consultation with industry, rural communities and state and territory governments. Its aim is to help the rural sector maximise its contribution to Australia's economic, social and environmental well-being by boosting its profitability, competitiveness and sustainability. FarmBis is a key feature of this visionary AAA package. FarmBis not only contains benefits for farmers wishing to improve their business management skills in the modern world but also holds benefits for the wider community-particularly in electorates like",175,Representatnes Main Committee
328,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.09 P.m.),"I am more than happy to speak in support of theWednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1253 mine that encompass provincial cities and rural areas, anare heavily dependent on the rural communities. FarmBis is dedicated to helping farmers and their employees, and others directly involved in the sector, such as contractors, improve their management skills. Direct financial contributions will be made towards the program and the training costs in a range of areas. These include skills development, farm business and financial planning and advice, farm performance, benchmarking, quality assurance, risk management, rural leadership development and marketing skills. I was a bit disturbed to hear the shadow minister's concept of benchmarking. I think benchmarking involves a lot more than just going around and having a look at the other guy's onions, as he put it. I think benchmarking today requires a lot greater skill. It involves such things as personal training through the Internet, field days, scientific field days and shed meetings. I think part of the problem with farming was that a lot of farmers flew by the seat of their pants. Today there are a lot of mechanisms in place. I think benchmarking should be seen as a much more sophisticated mechanism-albeit there are plenty of mechanisms around to enhance it-rather than the comme ci, comme ca basis on which we did things in the past. This FarmBis program dovetails perfectly with the Farm Family Restart scheme which provides a welfare net for low income farmers experiencing financial hardship and who cannot borrow further against their assets and/or who are not ready to sell their farm and apply for welfare support under the social security hardship provisions. The Farm Family Restart scheme also provides income support at the same level as unemployment benefits, as well as paying farmers to obtain professional advice about the viability of their business. It is this aspect which dovetails well with FarmBis and provides an opportunity for farmers to gain skills which may be lacking. One of the saddest things for me is that when farmers come to see me I cannot help thinking that if they had had the right skills development they would not be in the position that they are in. I see this a lot after hailstorms and floods, that provision has not been made for insurance and other safeguard mechanisms. While I appreciate that crop insurance is a very expensive field, I cannot help thinking that if farmers had a better opportunity to weigh up the pros and cons of entering into insurance---or at least into some form of partial insurancethey would be better able to cope. If we create a structure in which farmers have access to those skills, and they are readily available and supported by government, as they are through these programs, then I think they will be better able to cope. The Farm Management Deposit Scheme and the retirement assistance scheme for farmers are other components of this AAA package. I am a great believer in these programs, but I must make the comment that I am finding now that the $500,000 limit when passing on the family farm from one family to another-it is not so bad when there are two or three families involved-does have some difficulties in it. Also, where families have set up trusts or family companies and the major breadwinner has been removed from the scene-perhaps by some fatal illness-before the family can get the opportunity to restructure is a difficulty that needs to be addressed to make that program work better. Rural industries and the coalition have worked closely together in the development of the 'Action Plan for Australian Agriculture', which sets a forward agenda for improving the profitability, sustainability and competitiveness of the farm sector. The action plan is underpinned by a shared vision that, within 10 years, Australia will have an outward looking 1254 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 agricultural sector based on profitability, sustain ability and competitive family-farmed businesses. We are recognised in that field as world leaders and we should endeavour to enhance our efficiency, our product quality, our application of innovation, and our ability to supply and respond to market needs. The vision is supported by eight themes, under which a range of actions can be taken by the industry and the government. These themes include increased profitability, with financially self-reliant producers involved in increasingly productive and profitable enterprises; and skills development and leadership, guiding highlyskilled food and fibre industries, with a culture ·of ongoing skills development. That is where FarmBis fits in very well. Other themes are a close relationship with customers, driven by ongoing trade liberalisation, innovative marketing strategies and efficient supply channels able to respond to market demand; increased quality and value of Australian food and fibre products; and enhanced ongoing planning, with producers, industry organisations and government planning for the future and undertaking ongoing analysis and monitoring. A very interesting aspect of this was seen last year, when the Taiwanese pork market collapsed because of foot-and-mouth disease. I was involved with a number of groups of pork producers who wanted to respond to that circumstance. I found it absolutely staggering that they could not get the abattoir capacity in Australia to be able to respond quickly enough. We had Japanese buyers out here, and they actually like Australian pork. They particularly like the lighter quality of Australian pork. I remember attending a function at Monto and seeing how keen they were to take our product. In the end, the only place they could get this additional capacity was at Cannon Hill, which is a state abattoir in Queensland. Even then it was only on a limited basis, and the chilling had to be done on the other side of Brisbane. It staggers me that, when opportunities like that are around, we cannot respond. Enhanced planning is a vital part of a creative package that empowers farmers and their organisations to act in a better way. The package also deals with sustainable natural resource management, reflecting the application of ecologically sound agricultural practices and the maintenance of long-term productive capacity of the natural resource base at local, regional and national levels. I often speak about this in the parliament, but integrated pest management was pioneered in my own area of Bundaberg and it plays a very important part in the use of chemicals and fertilisers. One aspect of integrated pest management is to breed up some benign insect or bug that does not affect the crop, in order to remove those bugs on the crop that may be causing difficulties. In that way, you use very little chemical, if any. It allows you to reduce the use of chemicals to perhaps one-quarter, one-third or one-fifth of what you were using before. We need to be doing a lot more of that. Other themes reflect the need for high levels of innovation, with high investment in, and uptake of, well-focused research and the application of biotechnology to increase the sector's competitiveness. Above all, we need robust, prosperous rural communities with effective social and physical infrastructure, with local industries cooperating to shape their own futures. I do not throw that in as some sort of pious dream. I think all governments have been guilty over recent years of denuding rural communities of services that are important to keep prosperous rural communities effective. Farmers should not have to travel great distances to get to a bank, and they should not have to travel great distances to get appropriate telecommunications linkages and the like. Wednesday,. 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1255 I acknowledge that many farmers in my electorate have already adopted world's best practice in farm business management techniques. In fact, I am proud to say that my electorate boasts some of the best farm managers in Australia. That applies equally in a number of fields, especially sugar, small crops and, in more recent times, aquaculture. It is high time that government was seen to be actively encouraging farmers to get skilled in these areas because it is something that producer organisations have been hammering us about for years. FarmBis will provide a framework to help farmers adopt a positive approach to change across the whole farm sector leading to improvements in productivity, profitability and sustainability in all facets of farm business through improved management skills. This is not to say that farmers are using antiquated management techniques. Farmers in my electorate use computers to monitor soil conditions and to run irrigation and fertiliser programs. As well, they do their accounts on computer and catch up with the latest farm information on the Internet. FarmBis will assist all those involved in the management of farm business to build on their existing skills and improve the performance of their farm business. The exciting part about FarmBis is that it will promote continuous learning by making training more accessible. This $50 million program over three years has received strong support from farmers, which is fitting because the focus of the program is on partnerships. State agencies, industry and local farmer and community groups will contribute to meeting the training needs of the farmers. This program will be further localised with local coordinators to take primary responsibility for further skills development of farmers in their area. Of course, another spin-off from this program will be the fact that local training providers will be in a good position to provide these services. My electorate is blessed with having excellent trainers and I can envisage Bundaberg becoming the training centre for the Wide Bay-Burnett region and Gladstone for the CallidePort Curtis area. In my years before entering parliament I was actively involved with the development of the TAFE agricultural campus in Bundaberg and with the development of the fishing and marine college in Bundaberg. We now have these facilities in place, but there has been a weakness. There has been this lack of funding to drive the link between the farmer and the facility and I see this FarmBis package as being a very important linking mechanism. Ultimately, however, the FarmBis program, the other components of the AAA package and the action plan for Australian agriculture will only achieve real benefits for regional and rural Australia if the coalition government is permitted by a hostile Senate to exercise its mandate in implementing its tax reform package in full. I do not say that flippantly and I do not say that just to nark the opposition; I believe that. The improvements to excise and sales tax are critical for regional Australia. The reforms in excise will mean the tilting of the playing field by $3.5 billion towards regional and rural Australia. If you then take the whole package involving exports as well you are looking at $4.5 billion. That is the sort of thing that farmers and rural communities have wanted for a long time. The sheer cost of getting parts and components to rural areas and getting the product or the semi-finished product out of the region to port and to market has been a very difficult feature. Indeed, there are also all those other things that are important for life in a rural community, right down to the health insurance rebate. We have a structure of public and private hospitals in provincial Queensland. If one sector of that collapses, what we are going to have is that people in rural areas will not be able to get specialist and focused health needs in their own areas but will have to go to capital cities. In the last two or three decades we have been 1256 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 improving that. It all comes back to the coalition being able to get a whole range of measures through. This FarmBis in itself is great. But if we are deprived of the other mechanisms around it to make life attractive in rural and regional areas, it will be a tragedy. On that note, I support the legislation and commend the bill to the House. reply-I would like to thank all members who have participated in the debate on the Rural Adjustment Amendment Bill 1998, which, as far as the farming community in Australia is concerned, is very important as it gives effect to a number of measures that the previous minister responsible for agriculture and the Prime Minister announced with regard to the AAA package. Primarily, as has been identified by the two previous speakers, it provides for the opportunity under the FarmBis program for the governments of Australia, on a partnership basis between the Commonwealth and the states, to provide for further training in the rural community. The agricultural community in Australia is very quickly recognising that not only have we got to be able to produce the best food in the world but our business practices have to be as good as those around the world. We have to continually look for means of improving those, and always be prepared to embrace change and new methods of doing things. This is a way that the government, instead of just providing straight-out assistance for farmers in times of crisis, can help the farming community manage a lot of those risks they face from time to time that are out of their control, such as climatic conditions. We are experiencing a number of those across Australia at the moment: we have seen the severity of frosts in Western Australia and Victoria, some unseasonal rains and some drought conditions, all at the one time but in different parts of Australia. That is just part and parcel of the continent we live on. What our government is aiming to do is to introduce programs to help the farming community better manage for those risks and also introduce better business management skills within their own businesses because, at the end of the day, that will help improve their productivity and profitability and, most importantly, their sustainability. A farming operation is no different to any other business operation throughout this economy-and it has to be viewed that way. So where there are difficulties and challenges and individual risks that only apply to that business activity, they have to be managed. We need to be able to provide the skills to help the farming community work through that area because our economy is commodity based. It is important that we recognise that and we accept that. We have to ensure that we have a viable and sustainable agricultural production unit within our economy well into the future, because it is in the engine room of what we do in this country; it is the basis for a lot of the exports that we send out of this country that bring export income into the country. In supporting and closing the debate on this bill, I would like to thank all those who have made a contribution to this bill. I understand it is getting support from the opposition-that is why it is in this chamber. The agreement on the program framework has been reached as well with the state jurisdictions across Australia, through the ARMcANZ group, so there should be no impediment to the full implementation of this program once it passes through the parliament. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.",178,Representatnes Main Committee
329,Mr Vaile (Lyne,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (12.26 p.m.)-inWednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1257 I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 November, on motion by Dr Wooldridge: That the bill be now read a second time. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (12.30 p.m.)-The opposition supports this Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1998. The legislation contains minor amendments to the legislation for the National Health and Medical Research Council to simplify procedures, and addresses a problem highlighted by a recent court case. The opposition supports the bill and believes that it should be passed promptly. There is a need, however, for a considered and lengthy debate on the current directions of medical research in Australia, but this bill is not the right occasion. Later this week, I understand, the report of the health and medical research strategic review conducted by Peter Wills over the last eight months will be released. From our point of view, this report will give an opportunity for all of us to reassess current policies and priorities for medical research. The government has recently made some major changes to the way that research is funded, including reducing tax concessions to investors. The new commercial arrangements just announced with County Investments take the research sector into unchartered waters which could unseat current partnerships and create new difficulties about intellectual property rights over fundamental medical research. But those issues can wait until we see the report that Peter Wills has conducted, and we will have that debate then. Peter Wills has written publicly of the problem of some of our best and brightest medical researchers leaving our shores for overseas. He cites as reasons for the brain drain of Australian researchers a lack of funding for medical research in Australia, a slower than international standard career path and a lack of career entry positions. This lack of certainty in continuation of funding is also a key problem for those Australians wanting a career path in medical research. While medical research takes only a very small part of our total health budget, the savings that we could expect from successful medical research are enormous. Once again citing Mr Wills, he has pointed out that the cost savings from measures such as the identification of direct avoidable costs in Australian hospitals could be as great as $870 million a year. The opposition looks forward to what we expect to be a thought provoking report from the inquiry and, from our point of view, the release of the report will provide an excellent opportunity for a full discussion of the topic. I trust that the minister will take the opportunity to make a major ministerial statement on this report which will provide all of the parliament with a chance to enter into a decent debate about this very important issue. From Labor's point of view, of course, we are very strongly supportive of the independence of the National Health and Medical Research Council. It was one of the major reasons for creating the NHMRC as a statutory authority, giving it clear statutory independence, back in the early 1990s. I think that all Australians want to know that the NHMRC will provide expert and impartial advice. This bill today will just strengthen it a little bit further and I have no doubt the government shares that view.",182,Representatives Main Commitiee
330,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl},"If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail,1258 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 To Australia's credit, we are a world leader in the field of health and medical researchextraordinary, given the size of our population. Our contribution to critical international medical advances ranges from those early pioneers, such as Howard Florey, to our current greats such as the recent Nobel Prize winner, Peter Doherty. Probably the greatest resources are out there in the vast number of laboratories all around the country which are filled with people at the cutting edge of research. They are the ones with the enthusiasm and creativity of a new generation of graduates. I want to say something personal in relation to an outstanding research institute in my own electorate, the Austin Research Institute. I visited this institute and saw the extraordinary enthusiasm of the young graduates who are at the international cutting edge of medical research. It is one of the most exciting things to be able to witness. As a parliament, the more we can do to encourage the excellence that takes place in institutes such as the Austin, the better. The people at the Austin, and in all the other labs around the country, keep both health and medical research at the forefront. Of course they depend-not entirely, but to a significant degree-on the NHMRC both to set national priorities for research and also to fairly distribute funds on meFit. The NHMRC also plays a very important role in the n-tional public health research agenda and in considering their work, when we come to debate this issue of future research, it will be very important that we support, as far as possible, the public health tasks of the NHMRC as well as the medical research. This morning, we had a meeting of the parliamentary group on AIDS and I think that provided an excellent example of the parliament, across the political spectrum, working together on one of the most important public health issues facing Australia, that is, of course, the AIDS epidemic. The work that has been done by all members of parliament to make sure that the political leadership has been there to address that enormous public health problem needs to be commended-for those who have gone in the past. That work is always led by the excellent research that the NHMRC has funded. In addition, I wanted to mention briefly the enormous potential that medical and health research has to offer Australia in the way of economics. There is no doubt that there are real opportunities for our basic research to be translated into products that will be of enormous benefit to our nation fi nanciall y. As the Minister for Health and Aged Care outlined in his second reading speech, the bill introduces a streamlined, single stage public consultation process that will be followed when the council is issuing guidelines. These changes facilitate a process of advertising the intentions of the council, making available a synopsis of the guidelines and contact points for obtaining copies. The council is required to take account of all submissions before finalisation of that particular guideline. Further minor changes to a committee name and to some of the council's committee operations have also been made in this bill, while it will also extend the council's power to appoint deputy chairs and to have working committees. These are all sound procedural measures in line with the operation of other organisations. As I indicated, it is a machinery bill which the opposition supports. I again emphasise that the opposition looks forward to receiving the review of the medical research inquiry that Peter Wills has done. I understand it will be released this Friday. We particularly look forward to a substantial debate in the parliament when the minister responds to that inquiry. Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1259 Dr NELSON (Bradfield) (12.39 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, before I begin I would like to acknowledge the hard working and diligent clerks who are working with you today. I am very impressed with the way they go about their work. I thank you for them. the NHMRC Act 1992, I would like to join the member for Jagajaga in emphasising the importance of research not only to society but also for our economic welfare. We see so much of our economic and cultural past leaving us every day, whether it is in the form of BHP steelworks and collieries, the timber industry, the pork industry, citrus growers or anything else. Our future actually lies in areas that relate to and are the product of research. The intention of these amendments to the act is to streamline the council's procedures so it might more effectively maintain its role as a national leader in the field of medical and public health research and advice. These amendments introduce a streamlined, single-stage public consultation process that the council will follow when seeking to issue guidelines. Having served on that council myself for four years, thanks to the former minister for health, Mr Brian Howe, I understand the importance of some of these amendments to the council and the community that it serves. The process consists of advertisements notifying the council's intention, a summary or outline of the guidelines and information on where interested parties can obtain a copy of the full draft guidelines. The Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1998 makes it clear that the council must take into account all submissions received before finalising and issuing a guideline. The bill also provides for the council to endorse and issue guidelines developed by other bodies, whilst enabling the council to demand of other bodies the very public consultation that it itself would have engaged in. One of the principal committees, the Medical Research Committee, will be renamed the Research Committee. The provisions also enable principal committees to appoint a deputy chairperson and extend the council's power to delegate to the working committee. One of the things that I wanted to speak to in the context of this bill was Australia's expenditure on health and medical research, but I see that the Minister for Health and Aged Care has arrived to sum up, so I do not want to take up too much of his time. I know he is extremely busy. Australian expenditure on health and medical research has been the subject of some political debate, apart from active consideration in the scientific community, over the last few years. First of all, health research expenditure is narrowly defined by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and is published in health expenditure bulletins and the other general purpose publications that it releases, such as Australia's Health 1998. The Australian Bureau of Statistics provides the backbone for health research estimates. Health research expenditure is narrowly defined. In trying to compare what we spend in Australia with spending in other countries, we need to have a look at how it is defined in other nations. It is defined in Australia specifically for the socioeconomic purposes of health, clinical research, public health research, and research into health and support services. Under the ABS standard for research classification, some other expenditure is attributed to other purposes-for example, the significant expenditure in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals is classified as being for the purposes of manufacturing and not for health specifically. Some pure basic research into health in the medical and health sciences is classified as for the advancement of knowledge.",183,Representatives Main Committee
331,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"I certainly endorse your remarks and, on their behalf,",185,Representatives Main Committee
332,Dr Nelson,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In starting to speak to the amendments to1260 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 In 1994, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare established that the research and development by non-business enterprises for socioeconomic purposes of health was $432 million in 1990. There was another $52 million spent by business enterprises to give a total in 1990 of $484 million. When the other health related research expenditure was included, the totals came to $495 million and $639 million respectively. The narrowly defined health research and development spending is nearer to 80 per cent of the wider health related definition. Over time, national health research spending has increased not only as a share of national health expenditure but also as a share of GDP. In 1990-91, government expenditure was $371 million, which was 1.19 per cent of total health expenditure. In 1994-95, that had increased to 1.49 per cent of total health expenditure and, in 1996-97, to 1.58 per cent of total health expenditure. Health and medical research expenditure as a proportion of GDP, the nation's entire productivity, has increased from 0.09 per cent in 1982-83 to 0.12 per cent in 1993-94 and around 0.15 per cent last financial year. This latter ratio records the larger rise over the period as national health expenditure increased as a proportion of GDP from around 7.7 per cent in 1982-83 to 8.4 per cent in 1995-96. But federal government budget expenditure on health research generally grew as a proportion of federal health expenditure and of GDP until 1991-92. Federal spending on health and medical research, as it is currently defined, peaked at 0.9 per cent of total federal health spending in 1983-84 and has never again passed that level. The two trough periods significantly were with the introduction of Medibank in 1973 under the Whitlam government and the introduction of Medicare in 1983, which, of course, was associated with significant increases in health expenditure generally. Although the forward estimates suggest a fall in both ratios, federal government spending as a proportion of total health expenditure and of GDP, historically the forward estimates have spown a bias of understating actual spending. In this regard, for this and indeed much of this information, I am grateful for a paper produced by Roger IGlham from Access Economics and also for material from John Goss, who heads the Health and Welfare Expenditure Unit at the Institute of Health and Welfare. Actual spending has varied in most years from between 120 per cent and 137 per cent of the first forward estimate of the corresponding year. In other words, the estimates have always-except on two occasions-underestimated what actual spending ended up being. Those two exceptions-in fact, the only exceptions-were in the years 1992-93 and 1994-95 when actual expenditure was below the forward estimates. It is interesting when you reflect on the MPI in which the member for Dobell participated yesterday-he criticised the current Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs and questioned this government's commitment to science and research and furthering knowledgethat, in the area of medical research, the only two years where spending was actually below forward estimates were in the period of the Hawke-Keating governments, in 1992-93 and again in 1994-95. As a proportion of total federal expenditure, federal health and medical research expenditure has increased. In fact, it now stands at a record 0.14 per cent, due in no small way to the efforts of the current minister and member for Casey. It is up from its 1975 low of 0.3 per cent. It is rather interesting that a number of Australians, particularly those in the Labor Party, eulogise Mr Whitlam as a former Prime Minister for his vision. Mr Whitlam did indeed have an inspiring vision for our country, but the problem is he had no plan. We have just finished Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1261 paying off the legacy of his vision. At the end of the Whitlam years, health and medical research expenditure was only 0.03 per cent of total federal expenditure. Federal spending on health and medical research also grew as a proportion of GDP until 1991-92. But it has been flat ever since and it is currently running at about 0.032 per cent. Australia's spending on health research as a ratio of GDP is low in comparison to many OECD countries. In fact,.we rank 12th at 0.09 per cent; the US leads the way at 0.23 per cent. When you look at the countries that are actually ahead us, they are countries that we consider to be, by and large, affluent nations. Again, I think the entire culture of Australia needs to change significantly, particularly in the private sector, in terms of the amount of money that we put into research and development. One of the things that I would like to emphasise before I conclude is the former Labor government's 1993 election promise-and thiis where some things stick in your craw at times here in this place. I am very pleased that I did. In the run-up to the 1993 federal election, the then Labor Prime Minister made a commitment that the government would lift health research spending to two per cent of total health expenditure by the year 2000. At the time of the election, as a proportion of total health spending, the government then was spending 1.4 per cent on health research. The election commitment was to take it to two per cent. In fact the press release that was issued at the time was entitled Labor supports science and technology. It included the following paragraph: We will also continue to support our high quality health and medical research system. Since 1982-83, Commonwealth funding of this important area has more than doubled in real terms. The results, in terms of research which improves the health of all Australians, have been outstanding. Labor will work with medical researchers and the business community to lift research funding to 2.0% of total health expenditure by the year 2000. The National Health and Medical Research Council's Research Strategy will be important in helping the Government achieve this goal. Many of us, including me, interpreted this commitment to mean that the federal government would substantially increase-in fact, roughly double-its own spending on health research which had been running at less than one per cent of federal health outlays. This interpretation was reinforced, for example, in the 1994-95 budget papers, the year after the election, which stated: As a step towards the 1993 election commitment to lift health and medical research funding to 2% of total health expenditure by the year 2000, additional funds of $13.8 million in 1994-95, rising to $30.3 . million by 1997-98, are to be made available to fund new research, with an emphasis on areas of priority such as breast cancer and aboriginal health. I might also emphasise that in the MPI yesterday, when the member for Dobell was attacking the current minister for education, he tried to suggest that it was improper for political interference in determining research priorities. He ought to be reminded that the Labor government, when the member for Fremantle was the health minister, actually picked a disease, a very important disease-that is, breast cancer---out of the scientific ruck and put it into the political arena, with the establishment of the Kathleen Cunningham Foundation and the multicentre research centres across Australia. This is not to say that breast cancer, in any way, is not deserving of significantly more effort, but to do that and then try to accuse this government of politicising research priorities instead of looking at things on a peer review basis is just a little rich.

334,Dr Nelson,"I was campaigning very hard against the Keating government in 1993 and1262 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 2 December 1998 included forwarc;l estimates that implied health research spending would fall away in real terms. Labor simply ntaintained the status quo with regard to its spending on health and medical research. The then government's desperation to wriggle out of the promise was communicated again by the member for Fremantle-at the time, the health minister. She was later to imply that the election commitment was not a commitment to increase federal spending on health and medical research, but a commitment to ensure an increase in national spending on health and medical research, although there was no policy framework to effect any increase in nongovernment spending. Again, this is something which has been addressed by the current government and, indeed, the current minister. She then attempted to demonstrate that the commitment had already been honoured by concocting a mismatched ratio totally devoid of meaning-that is, the Institute of Health and Welfare estimate of health research spending undertaken by the Commonwealth sector expressed as a ratio to federal health spending. In the 1998-99 budget, the coalition, again under the leadership of the current minister, increased spending on health research and lifted the forward estimates-perhaps not enough to reverse the earlier decline as a share of federal health spending. But, in a climate where we have had to embark on a program of fiscal consolidation to not only preserve and quarantine the Commonwealth's commitment to health and medical research, to substantially increase it, is a legacy which the government-indeed, the minister-will undoubtedly be proud of for many years to come. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak to this bill. Clearly, it is something that I strongly support. I seek leave to table a document published by Access Economics in relation to health and medical research. Leave granted. Dr WOOLDRIDGE (Casey-Minister for Health and Aged Care) (12.54 p.m.)-in reply-I want to thank honourable members for their contribution, particularly the member for Bradfield for his thoughtful and well-researched contribution. This is a chance, in a non-controversial bill, the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1998, to talk about the National Health and Medical Research Council, the country's premier scientific and medical body. It is something we look at all the time to provide us with timely evidence based advice on which to make decisions, which is not easy as minister because there are many pressures in the health portfolio, and many people wanting you to make decisions for certain illnesses or conditions. In the bill, we are trying to change administrative and other procedural arrangements that will make the NHMRC work in a slightly more streamlined manner. The most important of these is the manner in which the NHMRC undertakes public consultation, which will still be a very important part of its role, but which has been shown to be very cumbersome. This change will allow it to operate in a little more efficient manner. The NHMRC has been very successful as an organisation in its leadership on clinical guidelines, so much so that other organisations are now developing guidelines for themselves by using its rigorous process. We are also seeing other organisations seeking to have the can actually endorse externally developed guidelines-something that it cannot do at the moment. Administratively, the bill includes a change in name, a broadening of its sphere of responsibility in appointing deputy chairpersons, and an extension of the NHMRC's power Wednesday, 2 December 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 1263 to delegate to include the chairperson of council and working committees appointed by the its position as leader in the fields of health and medical research.
