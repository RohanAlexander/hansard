10,Mr Mccay (Corinella);,"I suppose thatspeech delivered by the Minister of Home Affairs in moving the second reading of the Bill, but, thanks to his courtesy, I had an early opportunity to peruse the offiaction. The draft Constitution Bill precial report of it, and perhaps I may be permitted, without presumption, to express my disappointment with it, for two reasons : redistribution was to take place. It proFirst, because-wit h every respect to the honourable and learned gentleman-h e seems to me to have passed by, rather than to have met, the main legal difficulties connected with this subject; and', secondly, because he refrained from giving the House any information whatever as to what the practical working out of the Government proposals would mean. Both those matters seem to me of great importance, as to which the House had a right to hear from the Minister, and I regret that he did not think fit to deal with them. As a representative of Victoria. I feel that I have a somewhat more special interest in this measure than have the representatives of other States, because Victoria is threatened with a diminished representation as. the result of its operation. As one of the three Victorian Ministers in the last Cabinet, which was concerned in coming to a decision of some importance with regard to redistribution, and was subjected to very severe criticism in consequence of the action it proposed to take, I feel it my duty in discussing this measure to place some of the facts connected with the situation before the merely point out in passing the great difHouse; and I hope that I may be so far favoured as to haw the substance of my remarks placed before the country, in order that the public may know what the facts were which the late Government, and this Government, too,"" have had to deal with in considering the question. I use the word ""facts"" advisedly, in contrast with some of the words of vaguer meaning which have been employed in connection with this matter during the last month or two. calls them this morning. facts. I should like, in the first place, to remind honourable members very briefly of the history of section 24 of the Constitution, under which the Bill is introduced. The Minister of Home Affairs, in quoting what purport to be precedents in the draft Constitution Bill of 1891, the Canadian Constitution, and the Constitution of the United States, appeared to have lost sight of the fundamental difference between those provisions and the section in the Constitution under which we are living,"" and under which he has taken pared by the Convention of 1891 very specifically laid down the periods at which vided that a fresh apportionment of representatives to the States should be made after each census of the people of the Commonwealth, which should be taken at intervals not longer than ten years. The Canadian Constitution, and the Constitution of the United States, in like manner provide for the ascertainment of the population for the purpose of altering representation on a census. But the Convention which framed the Constitution under which we aire now living departed from the form of phraseology used in those Constitutions, and did so deliberately. It provided that the number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of the people, and determined in a . certain manner, involving the ascertainment, not of the number of the people determined by a census, but of the number of the people determined by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. I propose to refer briefly, a little later on, to what may be meant by the words "" the lateststatistics of the Commonwealth,"" and ference in phraseology between our Constitution and those to which the Minister has alluded. ment by this very Bill. we can; but I shall come to that matter later on. Our Constitution uses the words, ""latest statistics of the Commonwealth,"" instead of the word "" census,"" which has. a definite and ascertained meaning. In 1903, a redistribution of seats was proposed in this House, and last year it was still recognised, not only by the Government of the day, but by all parties, that r in view of the great disparity between the actual numbers of electors in the various electorates, and the limits allowed by the Electoral Act, a redistribution of seats was necessary at an early date, and certainly before the next general election. The Electoral Act allows a margin of one-fifth either way, though, as I have stated on previous occasions, I should have preferred a margin of at least one-fourth.",12,Groom

14,Mr Mccay,"I am not at all sure thatKnowing that the electorates, so far from differing only in the: maximum proportion of six to four, differ in some cases in the proportion of more than two to one, Parliament thought that a redistribution must, in fairness, take place. ence is three to one. than two to one. First, the Bartoni Government, and then the Reid-McLean Government, undertook to arrange for a redistribution. pressed for last session by a number of those who sat in opposition to the ReidMcLean Administration. That Government, with the approval of the House, undertook definitely'-as it tmdeVtook a -number of things definitely, though it had not had an opportunity to carry them into effect-to be ready with a redistribution proposal when Parliament met this session. During the recess, in pursuance of their promise, they took steps towards proceeding with the redistribution. The first duty number of members to be returned by each State they had to perform was to ascertain the respective positions of the States. They had to look into legal questions, and into facts, in order to be able to direct the Commissioners of thei various States as to how many electorates each State should be divided into. Through making these inquiries, the late Government became cognizant of certain facts. They became cognizant of the fact that the population of Victoria had not been increasing in the same ratio, so far as the .statisticians' estimates guided us, as the population of the other States-that while the quota to determine the number of members was increasing, the population of Victoria was not increasing in the same ratio, and, consequently, if the statisticians' figures were to be accepted as correct, Victoria's representation was diminishing. Then the Government had to con-sider the question how to deal with this fact. It was pressed by the knowledge that it was bound to be in a reasonable state of preparedness when it met Parliament, and accordingly an Order in Council was passed, and a Gazette notice was published, declaring that the population of the various States, as on 31st December, 1904, consisted of certain numbers, and that those numbers were to be the basis upon which were to Le determined the number of representatives of the States. That action of the late Administration, in declaring these figures by Executive act to be the basis of calculation, was most seriously challenged in many quarters. That Government had not, however, acted without precedent. In the Commonwealth Gazette of 1.3th June, 1903a few months prior to the distribution of the seats under the last distribution schemes, and the presentation to the House of those schemes, whirihi were for the most part rejected, and during the administration of the Barton Government, in which the present Prime Minister was Attorney-General, the This redistribution was present Minister of Trade and Customs was Minister of Home Affairs, and of which the Treasurer was also a memberthe following Order in Council appeared: Official return of the population of the Commonwealth upon which to determine the number of members of the House of Representatives to be returned by each State.

Xo out delay. That referred to all the figures used and to the calculations which were challenged on the ground that certain aliens were wrongly counted in some cases. The whole matter came under consideration, and the then Minister of Home Affairs made the position perfectly clear in the remarks which I am about to quote. He was followed by the present Prime Minister, then Attorney-General, who did not raise any question as to the propriety of the figures, although the then Minister of Home Afmember might call it the worse precedent. fairs dealt with them specifically. At page 2957 the present Minister of Trade and time at the point which the honourable and Customs is reported as having saidThe figures given in it must be regarded not as was more than that to consider. The exisState, but as Commonwealth, figures I am now speaking upon a technical point, which justification for any Administration in purwas brought under my notice by the much-abused electoral officer, Mr Lewis, that sub-section 1 of suing a course which it thought to be section 24 of the Commonwealth Act required that wrong, and the then Government, like the the statistics used should be the statistics of the present one, had to consider the legal posiCommonwealth. I informed hrm that these tion. Section 24 of the Constitution profigures were prepared by a statistician who was acting for the Commonwealth, and that they were vides thattherefore officially compiled for our purposes. No one took exception to that statement. posed At page 2959 he went on to sayI have acted carefully and upon the best advice that could be obtained. I presume that that was the advice of the then Attorney-General. He continuedI have adopted the figures relating to population which were supplied to the Department of Home Affairs by the statisticians of the States. These figures were accepted and were submitted to the Cabinet, and gazetted, and not a word of objection was raised. Further on, the present Minister of Trade and Customs saidI cannot do other than rely upon the figures supplied by the statisticians. On the very figures which are now called mere estimates and guesses, and stated to be absolutely unreliable, the Barton Government proposed a redistribution of seats in this House. take any action-non e was necessary. there was no necessity for any alteration in the number of representatives of the States, but that does not alter the fact that they were adopted as the basis upon which the number of members was to be calculated, and that they were gazetted before the redistribution was entered upon. Does the Minister mean to say that we are not to 1 alteration in the number of representatives was proposed, because the statistics showed that none was required; but the Government did not retain the old number of representatives irrespective of the figures supplied by the statistician's. On the other hand, they accepted the figures, and based their calculations upon them. Therefore, so far as precedent is concerned, the late Administration had the best precedent. learned member has in his mind. There tence of a precedent was not a sufficient The House of Representatives shall be comof members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth, and the number of such members shall be, as nearly as practicable, twicethe number of senators.

The section be-: gins by providing that the number of members chosen -that means at an election1 shall be in proportion to the people of the' States. That is an absolute direction that cannot be altered by this Parliament. But we are told that we can provide a method other than that set forth in the Constitution for determining the number of the people in the States, and the number of members by a mere arithmetical calculation based on the number of people in the States. that until that is done-and that is the present position-the number shall be determined whenever necessary. One has to ask the meaning of the words "" whenever necessary."" Do they mean whenever Parliament thinks necessary ? That is one view taken of this section. I cannot agree with that view. My opinion may not be a solid or a sound one, but that is the conclusion at which I have arrived. I doubt whether, upon the mere! construction of the wordfsi ""whenever necessary,"" they meao anything else, but "" whenever the actual number of the people renders the operation necessary."" That is to say, whenever the numbers of the people vary so as to require variations in the number of representatives. It is urged by Quick and Garran, and it is hinted, although not stated, by the Minister of Home Affairs, that these words "" whenever necessary "" mean whenever it is convenient in the view of the Parliament. I trust that that is the correct view, because otherCommonwealth"" meant the latest, stawise I am afraid the Bill now before us may be challenged as being in contravention of the Constitution. opinion is that the words mean whenever the number of members is not in proportion to the number of people, in accordance with the earlier provision in the section. Therefore, it appears to me-and it appeared to the members of the late Government in the same way-that under a strict interpretation of the Constitution this provision is almost automatic in its operation; that as the population varies the number of members ought to vary also. Parliament can, of course, refrain from performing its duty, but if it discharges its full responsibility it will have to vary the number of members as the number of people in the States vary. If that is what is meant by the section it will prove highly inconvenient. The fixing of periodic dates seems to be the only convenient method of proceeding, and a very strong argument against the view I have been stating may be advanced on the ground that the Constitution could not mean anything so inconvenient as what I have suggested. In order to uphold that objection, however, a Court would have to come to the conclusion that the Constitution did not say what it meant, and did not mean what it said. That is practically the position that Courts sometimes have to assume, in the interpretation of statutes, but it is a position that they take up only as a last reIt is provided sort. Then the Government had to decide what were the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, because, even if the number of people in the States had actually varied, their number could not be determined according to the Constitution if the latest statistics oif the Commonwealth were not ascertainable. I should like to point out, in passing, that it does not suggest that the matter should be determined by Parliament-that it should not be an Executive Act-whic h was the view taken by the Barton 'Government when by Executive act it determined the number of members. The next question is: "" What are the latest statistics of the Commonwealth,"" because if no numbers are ascertained, according to these "" latest statistics ''-it does not matter what are the actual numbers-ther e can be no re-allotment of members. Roughly speaking, I may say that the view put forward by those who criticise the action of the late Government was that the "" latest statistics of the tistics ascertained by the Commonwealth. That, however, is not what, But my own the Constitution says. My own opinion is ' that those words taiean the latest statistics relating to the Commonwealth, and, in proof of my contention, I venture to submit one or two arguments which might not be admissible in a court of law, but which are nevertheless proper arguments to submit in this House. In the first place, the Constitution Bill of 1891, the Canadian Constitution, and the United States Constitution all specifically refer to "" census"" as contrasted with "" statistics"" in this section. In the second place, I find that clause 26 of the Commonwealth Constitution Bill, in the form in which it went to England to be adopted by the Imperial Parliament, instead of setting out the numbers of",15,Groom
31,Mr Mccay.,"members as the)' now appear in our Constitution Act, contained a few words in brackets and ""in italics to the effect that they were to be determined "" according to the -latest returns at the passing of the Act."" There were some interesting references made to this matter in the Convention debates. port of the debates in the Adelaide Convention, I find that Sir Edmund Barton saidThe number of members to be chosen by each from "" statistics."" State shall be as follows :-that is, to be determined according to latest statistical returns at the passing of the Act. Throughout the Convention discussions the right honourable member for Balaclava and aware the present Attorney-General time after my time drew attention to what would happen words in that to a State like Victoria owing to the operamerely one of the tion of this provision.

They were Bill of 1891, in the Canadian Act, and dealing with the present situation as well. also in the United States Constitution. I As to the present, I hold that the staventure to say without any hesitation that tistics of the Commonwealth are not conwhatever the term "" Commonwealth statisfined to the census returns. The variations tics "" in section 24 may mean, it means of language afford a strong argument in something more than the word "" census "" that direction.

Under sub-section n of section 51 of the ConstiFrom the official retution, the Commonwealth is empowered, amongst other subjects, to make laws in regard to ""census and statistics.""

Either the figures are right or wrong, the signature of the Chief Electoral Officer will not make them right. In the remarks which I have quoted in regard to section 26 of the Constitution Mr O'Connor pointed out that the figures might change between the periods of the passing of the B ill by the Convention and its being passed by the Imperial Parliament. As a matter of fact, the Statisticians' "" guesses,"" as they are called, were accepted for the original representation of the States. in the Constitution. some honourable members have quarrelled were those which were used in connection with the first Federal election. judgment, the term, "" statistics of the Commonwealth,"" does not mean statistics ascertained by the Commonwealth, but actual figures of Commonwealth population. relating to the Commonwealth. The word "" of "" is ambiguous-it may mean half-adozen things. I freely admit that it is a question which is open to argument. But presuming that the late Government were wrong in their view, and that a B ill was necessary to validate tbe whole matter, surely it was entitled to assume that the necessary legal authotitv would be given by this Parliament. I take the view, however, that no legal authority is necessary to meet the present situation. The matter was very f u l ly considered, and, rightly or wrongly, we came to that conclusion. I now wish to deal with the facts, as they are at present, relating to the representation of the States, and in this connection I propose to give some figures. I shall give the figures which faced the recent Administration and those which confront the present Government in dealing with the matter. In the first place, I say that, so f a r as this Bil l deals with the immediate necessities of the situation-wit h the redistribution that it proposes shall take place before the next general election-ther e is not a figure or a fact different from the figures and facts which were used by the late Government. The present Administration, in submitting this B ill , and in declaring, in paragraph 2 of clause 3,. that I t evidences a trust in the The first enumeration day shall be appointed as soon as practicable after the commencement of this Act, they are wrong. If they are ( admit that they are going to accept those figures. In effect, they say, "" We aregoing to accept the Statisticians' estimates, with the possibilities of error-indeed, , everything which ouif predecessors proposed to accept."" If we turn to ScheduleA, and look at all the calculations, and' the allowances for unrecorded arrivals and departures, which require to be made, it will be seen that every one of those are allowances actually being made at the present time by the Statistician of every State Government. Indeed, the provisionhas been adopted verbatim from the report of the conference of the Statisticians of the States which met in 1903. They are better figures than those upon which theBarton Government, acted, because thelatter were not uniform. In my uniformity which gave rise to the criticism which was indulged in by honourable members of this House. that. Let the Minister of Home Affairs read the speech delivered by his present colleague, the Minister of Trade and? Customs, and the Gazette notice. , Hedeliberately accepted the Statisticians' figures. If the only thing to which objection was raised in 1903 was. want of uniformity, why was the action of the last Government, in basing their action upon uniformity, challenged? I repeat that the very allowances set out in? the schedule are those upon which all the States Statisticians proceeded, and in accordance with which they ""have revised the whole of their figures since the census of"" 1901. I say at once as a Victorian member tliat I scrutinized the proposals of the late Government with' jealous suspicion.

53,Mr Mccay,"I was referring, not towealth-and by "" effective population,"" I mean the population excluding full-blooded aborigines and aliens disqualified under certain sections of the Commonwealth Constitution Act-accordin g to the estimates of the Statisticians, was 3,951,829. Dividing that total by 72, we get as the quota, 54,886, and the half quota is thus 27.443. Dividing the population of New South Wales, which was estimated at 1,457,246, by the quota, it was found to be entitled to twentysix f u l l members, and to have a balance of 30,210 persons, or 2,767 more than half the quota, so that she was thus entitled to twenty-seven members. I may say, in passing, that the fact that New South Wales was to gain a representative had nothing to do with the fact that Victoria was to lose one. Victoria might lose a representative without New South Wales gaining might Victoria gaining one. Victoria's population of 1,210,304, divided by the quota, gave her twenty-two members, with a balance of 2,812 persons, or 24,631 short of the half quota that would entitle her to a twentythird member. But even if Victoria had had 24,631 more than she was shown by this estimate to have, she still would have been entitled to only twenty-two members, unless the population of the other States had been over-estimated to that extent, because, by adding 24,631 persons to the total population of the Commonwealth, we should thereby increase the quota,: making the remainder, after dividing by the quota, less than half the quota. toria had had the additional 24,631 persons, entitled to more than 22*30 representatives. Assuming that the population of the other States was correct, and that that of Victoria alone was under-estimated, three quired to have, in addition to her estimated These were the facts that faced the late Administration when they dealt with this matter. No member of the late Government rejoiced at the prospect of Victoria losing one of its representatives-I do not think that any one would do so-bu t that was the fact that faced us. What possible errors could creep in to lead us to suppose that the estimate was so far out as has been suggested? The Statisticians of Victoria and New South Wales were wrong in [75] their estimates between 189.1 and 1901-.. But to what extent? The New South' Wales census of 1901 showed that her Statistician had over-estimated her population by 12,000, while the Victorian census of that year showed that the population of this State had been under-estimated by 10,000. If between. April, 1901, and December, 1-904a period of three and a half years-the Statisticians were as far out in their calculations as they were in respect of the whole of the preceding ten years, thepopulation of Victoria would still have been 20,000 less than the number entitling her totwenty-three representatives. We must not forget, however, that during the three and' a half years which I have mentioned, the Statisticians in question had adopted a new allowance, based on the errors disclosed by the preceding census, so that their estimates one, and New South Wales were more likely to be correct. and learned member has not made a mistake. MrM c CAY I certainly have not. The next point which the late Government had to consider was as to the allowances made. It was thought that possibly the errors in regard to the three and a half years period, which I have named, were larger than were ithose for the preceding ten years, and, having regard to that possibility, I took the actual reported departures from Victoria. There' is an allowance for unrecorded departures of 10 per cent, on actual recorded departures by land and 9 per cent, on actual recorded departures by If Vicsea, from Victoria. These were added on to the actual recorded departures, and she would not have been they still further reduce the net population. for recording the arrivals and departures ? in order to have twentymember is aware of the system adopted by members she would have rethe Department of Trade and Customs and the Railway Department. travelling by rail who were not counted. out that the Statisticians of Victoria and New South Wales between them were only 22,000 out in ten years, and if that 22,6.00 had been given to Victoria, it would have not have made any difference to her position.

No Minister, and no member, whatever may be the State he represents, can close his eyes to facts of that kind. I would have acted differently if [ could have fairly done so, but it was impossible. As the late Government have suffered a good deal of adverse criticism in this connection, I trust that, in fairness to us, the facts which I have given to the House will be made public, so that our side of the question, as well as the other side, may be known. So far as this matter is concerned, the present Bill does not in any way alter the facts. On the 31st December last, Oueensland was entitled to nine representatives, with a surplus population of 5,010, which was a long way short of the number required to give her a tenth representative. South Wales count their aliens, while we exclude them from our statistics. credited with her 22,000 excluded: aliens, and the aliens in the other States were not taken into account, shei would still not have a sufficient population to entitle her to a tenth member. 1904, if the 22,671 aliens in Queensland, which are not now taken into account, had been included in her population, she would have been entitled to only nine representatives, and would have had a surplus of 24,846 people, or 2,754 people short of Ihe number entitling her to a tenth representative. date had a population entitling her to six representatives, and a surplus of 40,665 people, or 13,222 more than were required for a seventh representative. Both Western Australia and Tasmania send five representatives to this House under the provisions of the Constitution, though their populations do not entitle them to that representation; but when Western Australia has obtained another 10,000 people, if her population continues to increase at the present rate, she will be entitled to her present representation on her statistics as well as under the Constitution. justification for any alteration in the case of Western Australia. MrM c CAY It is not proposed to make any. On the 31st December, 1904, Victoria was nearer to twenty-three members than to twenty-one, having a population sufficient to entitle her to twenty-two members, and a little more. I also remembered what the tendency of population was, and found that the population of the other States is increasing more rapidly than is that of Victoria. If anything would justify that forecast, the figures for the 31st March and the 30th June of this year do so. They do not cover a long period of time, but the trend is very marked in the six months. On the 31st March of this year the effective population of the Commonwealth was 3,967,388, and the quota 55,1.02, entitling New South Wales to twenty-six representatives, with a surplus of 32,981 people, or a balance in excess of the requirement for a twentyseventh representative of 5,430, which was and New twice as many as the State had three months before. The Victorian population on that date was 1,210,530, which, divided by the quota entitled that State to twenty-bne representatives, with a surplus of 53,388 persons, or an excess over the half quota of 25,837, giving her a total representation of twenty-two representatives. She was 29,465 persons short of the population that would have entitled her to a I admit that. representation of twenty-three members, and only 25,837 in excess of the representation entitling her to twenty-one members. the figures may be different. MrM c CAY I am coming to that. On the 30th June of this year the effective population of the Commonwealth-and all South* Australia on the same the figures with which I have been supplied were supplied to me by the Department of Home Affairs, and obtained by that Department from the Government Statistician of Victoria-wa s 3,982,188. The population of Victoria was 1,211,003, which, divided by the quota of 55,308, entitled Victoria to a representation of twenty-one members, with a surplus of 49,535, or 21,881. over the half quota, so that the State had",21,Groom

64,Mr Tudor,"If we wait until next yearthen 21,881 more than were necessary to give her a representation of twenty-one members, but was short by 33,327 of the population necessary to entitle her to a representation of twenty-three members. Victoria could not have had a representation of twenty-three members on the 30th June of this year, unless she had possessed 33,327 more people than she is estimated to have, and the other States between them had had that number less than they are estimated to have. In other words, the estimates must have been wrong to the extent of 66,654, and it is inconceivable that they could be wrong to that extent. If the figures for the other States were right, and on the 30th June of this year the population of Victoria alone had been und_erestimated, she would have required, owing to the increase of the quota by the increase of her own population, 48,614 persons more than she was estimated to have, to entitle her to a representation of twenty-three members. What can one do in the face of figures like that? How can one say that any estimate, however open to challenge on the ground of inaccuracy, could be wrong to that extent, in view of the fact that in no previous decennial period, as gauged by the census, have the figures been wrong to that extent? As regards Queensland, the position was the same on the 30th June last as it was on the 31st December. Giving her the excluded aliens, she was 2,049 short of the number which would have entitled her to a tenth representative. On the 30th December Victoria, however, was 24,600 short of the number that would have entitled her to a representation of twentythree members, while on the 31st March of this year she was 29,400 short, and on the 30th June 33,300 short, assuming that the other States were over-estimated to the same extent. But assuming that the other States were rightly estimated, and that only Victoria was under-estimated, she was 35,836 short on the 31st December of last year, 42,606 short on the 31st March last, and 48,614 short on the 30th June last.

On the 31st December last, she founded charge in connection with this matter is to be brought against the late A d ministration, tlie only one that could be justified would be that, in the interests of Victoria, they did not hurry matters sufficiently to enable things to be fixed up before her population became too small to entitle the State to a representation of [ 7 5 ] -* change takes place within twelve months, from this date, Victoria will be entitled to a representation of only twenty-one members, because her population is increasing at a smaller rate than are the populations of the ortler States. It is not that it is diminishing. the population of Victoria has been diminishing for the last thirty years, although it has been increasing in the towns. whole, is increasing slowly, but at a lesser rate than are the populations of the other States. The criticisms passed -on the preceding Administration must be admitted, in the face of the facts I have mentioned, to have been unfounded. Apart from the legal question raised, we had no option but to do what was done. We had pledged ourselves to be ready with a scheme of redistribution when we met Parliament again, and, as we believed that the legal position was what we had stated it to be, we had no option to do other than what we did. Neither has this Government the option to do other than what it is doing, if it wishes to act fairly. They provide, first of all, as regards the future for fiveyearly periods, and for the present that, as soon as possible after the passing of the measure, an enumeration day shall be fixed, which is saying, in other words, that the figures which were taken by the last Government will be taken by them. I should have preferred decennial to quinquennial periods for the future, for reasons which are obvious. long. MrM c CAY I am aware that the representatives of other States would quarrel with a proposal to fix decennial periods. There are cases in which the estimates are pretty near the border line. For instance, we are comparatively near the border line in regard to the figures entitling New South Wales to a twenty-seventh had a margin of only .^,767. On the 31st March, it had increased to 5,430, and on the 30th June to 8,311, so that it is tapidly growing. New South Wales is increasing in actual numbers more rapidly than any of the other States.

But, if the present trend of affairs be any guide, I am afraid that she will have .for years to come to face the possibility of a loss of representation. Victoria, when they come to know the facts, will, as fair-minded folk, recognise-as I believe that their representatives in this House will also recognise-that there is no option but to submit to a reduction in the representation of the State. legal against the Bil l by distinguished lawyers, but the Government is concerned with the facts upon which justice is established, and this Government, like any other, has to recognise that the facts are such that they cannot stand against them. Even though the Prime Minister is a Victorian, they have to leave the Constitution to its reasonable operation. I think that, apart from ail legal objections, the Bill should become law, and that it should be promptly brought into operation. If promptly acted, upon it will have the same effect as if the legal question, had not been raised; but if it is not promptly brought into operation, the effect upon Victoria will be worse than ever. -The only difference between myself and the honourable and learned member for Corinella is that he supports the Bil l and abuses the Minister; whereas I support the Minister and abuse the B ill . ing the Minister. learned member commenced by attacking the Minister in respect to his previous Utterances, and he also taunted him with -having followed the lead of the previous Government. At all events, I think the Bill is a mistake, and as my name has been mentioned by the honourable and learned member, I wish to explain why I regard the measure as opposed to the provisions of the Constitution. of the reduction of the number of representatives of Victoria is a very small one. Australia will not lose anything, so long as good representatives are returned from all parts of Australia in reasonable proportion to the population. The position I take up is a simple one, namely, that it was never intended that the proportion of members for each State should be altered upon the estimate of any statist, however eminent. That is the whole position, and the honourable and learned member for Corinella did not, in the course of his able speech, discuss the guestion as to the meaning of the term used in the ConstiI believe the people of tution, "" The latest statistics of the Commonwealth."" If the honourable and learned member's view is right, any Ministry, as soon as it thinks there has been a movement of population, will be justified in bringing down a new Representation B ill . That Certain might happen once a year or once in two objections have been raised or three years, and we should be liable at any time to have a Representation-Bill brought forward to the exclusion of practical business. This measure provides that the Chief Electoral Officer's certificate shall, for the purposes of the Bill, be accepted as evidence as to the number of the people of the Commonwealth. That certificate must be based upon the statements of the Statisticians, and, therefore, in essence we have to rely upon the Statisticians' statements, and to assume that the numbers of the people in the various States are as the Statisticians estimate them. Personally, I have not the least doubt that Victoria has lost a sufficient number of people in proportion to the other States to reduce her representation in this House. I have not the least doubt as to the trend of population in Victoria as compared with the other States. The honourable and learned member for Corinella stated that he had taken into account the trend of population. That is the very thing he had no right to do. His only consideration I do not remember abusshould haw been the actual population, having regard, not to the Statisticians' statements, but to the latest statistics. Therefore, the honourable and learned member has gone quite beyond his duty in looking at the trend of population. He had no right to do that. If the late Government did that they were wrong, as also is the present Government if it has been influenced by fhe same consideration. The more we rely upon the actual simple words of Lhe Constitution, the better we shall be able to I think that the question judge as to the attitude we should assume now and hereafter, because the B ill will be used hereafter as a precedent for making other changes in the representation, when other States will be prejudicially affected.

I say without hesitation that in this case he is going wrong with regard to the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, because Statisticians' guesses are not the latest statistics. An Honorable MEMBER -Does the honourable and learned member suggest that the latest census is referred to? self to the latest census, but to the latest systematic enumeration. batable matter, but, at all events there must be a systematic enumeration. tistical return ? that is necessarilya systematic enumeration. learned member mean an actual count of heads ? of heads in some fashion which may reasonably be called an enumeration, and not a mere estimate. If one looks at section 24 of the Constitution, he will see that it is clear that the number of members chosen in the several States is to be in proportion to the respective numbers of the people. That is all very well, supposing that the number of the people can be ascertained. describes how the number of members is to be ascertained. It proceedsAnd shall, until Parliament otherwise provides, of ingenious guesses. I do not object to be determined whenever necessary in the following mannerI see no difficulty in regard to the meaning of the words "" whenever necessary."" They mean simply whenever it is necessary to determine the number-that the number shall be determined whenever it is necessary. Now let us see how that number is to be determined. The section providesA quota shall be ascertained by dividing the number of the people of the Commonwealth, as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, by twice the number of the senators. At the time the Constitution was framed all the States had a census taken at least once in ten years, and we dealt with the state of affairs as it then existed. The idea was obviously that we should rely upon the census, and that we should not be affected by the trend of population, as the honourable and learned member for Corinella would have it, or by the calculations or estimates of statisticians. It was intended that the number of the people should be ascertained by the latest statistics; as matters stood then, by the last census. learned member mean to say that the draftsman did not understand the difference between ""census"" and ""statistics "" ? the draftsman had in his mind a systematic enumeration, and that if he had intended the numbers to be ascertained by any other means than an enumeration he would have specified it. The draftsman did not know exactly what method of enumeration might be followed in the various States, and therefore he used the term "" latest statistics."". No doubt he had mainly in his mind the last census. If it were at all material the honourable and learned member for Corinella has shown that the population of Victoria has not been advancing in the same ratio as those of the other States. With all respect to the honourable and learned member, I do not think that that has anything fo do with the question. It might on certain occasions justify a certain enumeration, or the taking of a census more frequently than every ten years; but at the same time it has nothing to do with the question of our being guided by the latest statistics. If honourable members will look But the section afterwards at the meaning of the word ""statistics"" in any dictionary, they will find that it means a systematic enumeration, and not a! series the reduction of the number of Victorian representatives, because I think that that is a matter of very little importance. As Victorians, I think we are all well protected by our having representatives from the other States here, who will take care that np injustice is done to us. It is not on that ground that I take objection to the Bill. When I was asked whether the proposed mode of changing the representation was constitutional, I stated that we were bound to abide by the statistics as they appeared in the last actual count. Take the case of China, for instance. There have been grave questions as to the actual population of that country.

Therethe electoral officers that unless they saw fore, I think that the honourable and learned member for Corinella has absolutely missed the point at issue. Having regard to the fact that the best statisticians make serious errors, those who framed our Constitution decided .that "" the latest statistics of the Commonwealth "" should form the basis of the representation of the States, and not the estimates of States Statisticians. An attempt has been made to show that the words ""the latest statistics of the Commonwealth "" mean the latest statistical estimates of the Commonwealth. I attach very little importance to the reduction in the number of Victorian representatives in this House. But I say that hereafter other changes 'will be recommended upon the faith of this procedure. I hold that we are going the wrong way to work. We are asked to break the constitutional prescription by bringing in a number of matters which we have no right to. introduce, such as the supposed trend of population, which might alter to-morrow, as the result of a gold rush, for which contingency provision is made in the Constitution. Sydney) -The able and exhaustive address of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, in which he gave figures which I had intended to use in the debate upon this Bill, renders it unnecessary for me to enter into many considerations that otherwise I would have felt myself justified in debating. ister who was primarily responsible for the proposal which was accepted by the late Cabinet, I endeavoured to approach the matter of the representation of the States with an independent mind, and with an unbiased judgment, such as I am sure any member of this House placed in a similar position would have sought to exhibit. decided that a redistribution of seats should take place, I was asked by the officers of the Department whether the representation of the States was to be taken into account. I replied that, as the Constitution declared that "" whenever necessary "" the representation of the individual States should be taken into account, surely it was necessary if it would ever be necessary-whe n we were adjusting the inequalities between electorate and electorate that we should adjust those between State and State. In regard to the steps which were to be taken to make that adjustment, I instructed reason to depart from the procedure adopted by another Ministry, when the same problem was under consideration, that procedure was to be followed in its entirety. That was done. I saw no reason to depart from it, and the action taken by a previous Ministry was consequently followed by the late Government. To me it is rather strange that some of those who have taken exception to the action of the late Government were members of this Parliament at the time the Barton Administration accepted the statistics furnished by the States Statisticians, gazetted them as .the statistics of the Commonwealth, and determined-as they showed no necessity for altering the representation of the States-that there should be no alteration in that representation. That process was adopted by the Barton Government. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the present Attorney-General were members of this House at the time. Upon that occasion allusion was made to the method which was being adopted, but neither they, nor any other member of. the House, offered one word of objection to the procedure of that Government affected. orable member for Wide Bay has made an interjection which partakes of the nature of As the Mina suggestion. I do not say for a moment that honourable members remained quiet, although a wrong course was being followed, simply because their State representation was not affected. I wouid rather put it the other way, and say that, as their State representation was not affected, their attention was not sufficiently directed to the procedure which was being When it was adopted, and consequently they accepted it without that greater deliberation which they gave to the matter when they saw that rb-ir State's representation was to be decreased. served it but for the fact that I was asked a question.

Is it not surprising-as was put by the honourable and learned member for Corinella-that the Bill which formed the basis of our Clonstitutionthat is, the draft Bill of 1891-actuall y declared that the consideration of the necessity for an alteration in the representation of the States should take place after a census. is larger than the word ""census."" word "" statistics"" has a larger meaning than the word "" census,"" it was adopted in order that something more than census might be adopted for the official returns. The clause in the draft Bill framed by the Convention of 1891, which bears upon this matter, statesA fresh apportionment of the representation of the States shall be made after each census of the people of the Commonwealth, which shall be taken at intervals not longer than ten years, but a fresh apportionment shall not take effect until the next general election. That provision was deliberately abandoned by the Conventions which met prior to the establishment of Federation. The honourable and learned member for. Northern Melbourne had every reason to know that it had been abandoned, because it was abandoned not only in regard to the Constitution Act, but also Tn regard to the first representation of the States in this House. occasion upon which the census returns should have been taken to determine the exact representation of the States, that occasion was when the number of representatives to which the various States were originally entitled in this Parliament was fixed. Surely that was the most important epoch in the history of this question. At that time the 1901 census could easily have been ante-dated. The Commonwealth could have taken the census a year earlier. Instead of that, the Convention deliberately adopted the figures of the Statisticians. census prove that those figures were considerably out in the totals? not affect the representation. The subsequent figures did prove' that there were some, 10,000 or 12,000 persons in one State less than was estimated, and about as many more in another. But to meet the error which the Statisticians saw had crept in during that period, they adopted certain allowances, which have been embodied in the Bill under consideration. \ question of the meaning of the words "" the latest statistics "" ? to show that, so far from determining that the statistics should-be those of a census, the Convention decided that the original representation of the States should be based upon the figures of the Statisticians. go on.

Commonwealth could have arranged that the census should anticipate the fixing of the representation. Here is what Mr O'Connor moved in connection with the fixing of. the original representation of the States:Notwithstanding anything in section 24, the number of members to be chosen by each State at the first election shall be as follows :-To be determined according to the latest statistical returns at the date of the passing of the Act, and in relation to the quota referred to in previoussections.

We find that when they are face to face with the situation that we had confronting us they are prepared to take tlie same statistics. Even census returns are far from being absolutely correct. we can obtain, and why should we not go -for the best? that the census returns are not absolutely correct; that the States having larger areas and more scattered populations invariably suffer. This is proven by the electoral returns.' I have before me some figures, which I prepared for another purpose, that Illustrate the point I am now making. They show what is the actual proportion of the -elective population of each State to the whole population, and I may say, in passing, that I compared them, after the electoral lists had been collected, with the proportion of the electors in each State. I"" shall merely quote the figures relating to four of the States, as showing that it is quite impossible to accept the census returns as fully in the case of the larger States, where the population is scattered, as in the case of the smaller States. In New South Wales, for instance, the proportion of those over twenty-one years of age to the total population was 52 per cent., while the proportion of electors was only 46 per cent., or a difference of 6 per cent. In Victoria, with its circumscribed area and closer settlement, the proportion of those over twenty-one years of age to the total population was 54 per cent., and the proportion of electors' to the total population was 51 per cent., or a difference of only 3 per cent. In Queensland, on the other hand, .the proportion of those over twenty-one years of age to the total population was 52 per cent., whereas the proportion of electors to the, whole population was 44 per cent., a difference of 8 per cent. In Tasmania, again, the proportion of those over twenty-one years of age to the total population was 50 per cent., and the proportion of electors to the total population was 47 per cent., or a difference of 3 per cent. No ; the ""statistical re-exactl y the same as in the case of Victoria. These figures illustrate the effect of concentration; and also prove that a censuswhich is called for in connection with this matter, because it is supposed to be almost absolutely correct-ma y be very far The out in the case of the larger States. I admit, after all, that the census must be. the basis of our calculation; but I hold that, having regard to the movements of our population-to the fact that large numbers are attracted from one State to another by developments such as have occurred in Western Australia-it would be highly undesirable to deal with the question of representation only once in ten years. I agree that the provision in the B ill , providing for a re-arrangement every I repeat five years, is sufficient. As regards the loss of a representative by Victoria, which, as the honourable and learned member for Corinella has said, has nothing whatever to do with the gain of a member by New South Wales, I personally regret, as much as does any representative of this State, the fact that Victoria, for some considerable time, has failed to keep step with the other States in the matter of population.

We know that certain delays may take place, becausccertain regulations are required to be laid before Parliament, and I can foresee that ample means would be available to those who desired to prevent a redistribution of seats from being brought about. The figures presented to us by the honourable and learned member for ' Corinella with regard to the disparity in the number of electors were realty astonishing. If such figures had been submitted by representatives of New South Wales they would have been discredited; but now there can be no doubt as to their correctness, and I hope that the Government, in view of the necessities of the case, will do everything they can to facilitate a redistribution of seats.

He sought to justify the action of the late Government in following the precedent of the Barton Administration-whic h declared the existing statistics of the States to be valid without a Commonwealth Actby showing that a similar mistake was made by delegates to the Convention. What appears to have been contemplated was, that we should follow the American example. that we should put it out of the power of the States to determine what ought to be the basis of representation in this House. The Commonwealth ought to deal with this matter. If we rely upon States statistics, one State may very easily obtain a far bigger representation than that to which it is entitled.

When I was in London, some time ago, I heard Lord Rosebery deliver a speech, in the course of which, in commenting on' certain figures which had been presented, he referred to the various degrees of unreliability by saying, "" There are lies, condemnable lies, and statistics."" WhilstI think that our State statistics are compiled with care, and that they are the result of years of experience, I cannot imagine that our Constitution intended anything else than that there should have been some general compilation of the population of the entire Commonwealth. As far as I can understand, the Constitution does not declare that'the Commonwealth must of necessity accept the statistics of the States in any shape or form. We have the power to do so if we choose, but surely as a general principle it is desirable that there should be some means, of ascertaining, for Commonwealth purposes, what is the population of the Commonwealth -individual States. I think I shall be actWe can only arrive at an accurate knowledge of what our population is, for the purposes of State representation, by taking a census. mit that it is an unimportant matter whether New South Wales gains an additional representative and Victoria loses one.

If we are to. have changes of representation at intervals of less than ten years, we shall have a state of uncertainty which is highly undesirable. The disadvantages of making a change at the present time would overwhelm any of the suggested advantages to be derived from this measure, and I think that we ought to wait until we have the actual census figures before us. I shall not venture to discuss the question of what is the meaning of the words ""the-latest statistics of the Commonwealth,"" as used in the section of the Constitution governing this matter. That is a question that must be left fo the lawyers. All that I have to do is to consider the question from a common sense point of view, and I have arrived at the conclusion that the only satisfactory statistics that we can adopt are those obtained as the result of an elaborate, proper, and systematic enumeration, taken either directly for Commonwealth purposes, or in the ordinary course of events by the ing in the best interests of the Commonwealth, as well as of the State of which I am a representative, in voting against Honourable members adthe second reading of the B ill. to refer briefly to this question, which is one of the gravest importance, and may have a serious bearing on the State of which I have the honour to be a representative. I deeply regret that the honourable member for Dalley should have made a comparison which is dot fair to any State, and is particularly unfair to Victoria. The honourable member said that he viewed with feelings of astonishment the fact that the honourable and learned member for Corinella, although a representative of Victoria, should have been able to summon sufficient courage to make the exhaustive statement that he did regarding the question of representation as adversely affecting this State. I sincerely hope that one's views on this question will not be held' to be entirely coloured and conHJrolJed by the fact that one is a representative of a particular StateI t is well that we should recognise that we are here as the representatives, not of any particular State, but of the whole Commonwealth. It should I feel that, in view of be our desire to do justice to every part of the Commonwealth, and not to secure advantages for one State at the expense of the rest. That is the view which I take in approaching this question. The honourable and learned member for Corinella was enabled to make an elaborate statement be-",35,Groom

In these circumstances the honourable and learned member has been able to. deal more completely with the whole question than an honourable member in ordinary circumstances could hope to do. It seemed to me that he was more anxious«to excuse the act of the late Government anything; there was nothing requiring an excuse. the impression which his speech made on my mind, and am not going to ascribe to the honourable and .learned member any motive that he would not care to have attributed to him. The feeling that was engendered by the statement that he made to the House was that he was more anxious to explain and to excuse the action of the Government of which he was a member the opinion that I formed'.

In section learned member's idea of logic? 24 of the Constitution the expression ""the people of the Commonwealth"" is used, apparently with the intention that the reof a State? presentatives shall be chosen by the electors of the whole Commonwealth. In the same section, however, the words ""the people"" are used in quite a different sense, the intention there being to refer to the whole of the population of the Commonwealth. It is a misfortune that the Constitution is not more explicit with regard to this point. It is also unfortunate that the numbers of those who are to constitute the State representation are to be different from those who are to provide the electoral representation. I am not going to discuss the alleged loss of population, because I do not beljeve that any loss has actually occurred. The fact remains, however, that for some reason or other Victoria has not progressed so rapidly in the matter of population as have the other States. We have some solace in the fact that the latest electoral rolls show that Victoria has not gone back in the matter of her electoral representation. We have now on the rolls for Victoria 2,260 more electors than there were at the time of the election in 1903; but the rolls for New South Wales show that she has 21,071 less than she had at the election in question. I quote thesefiguresin order to give point to the argument that it is to be regretted that ' population, and population alone, should be the governing factor in the matter of representation. To my mind, the framers of the Constitution would have shown greater forethought had they provided that the electoral strength of a State should have some bearing on any alteration so far as its representation in this Chamber was concerned. If the Bill now before us be carried, and the estimates which have been quoted by the honourable and learned member for Corinella be adopted, what will be the position?

If that course is not taken, some difficulty may crop up at the last minute which will prevent a redistribution of seats being made prior to the next general election, and the work we are now doing will thus be entirely lost. it is to be regretted that we are not able to redistribute the electoral divisions upon the basis of the decennial census. When we consider, however, the disparities that exist between the electorates, both in Victoria and other States, we must recognise the necessity for some change before the next election.

I confess that I have been in a very confused state of mind with regard to this question for some time past. Until recently I was disposed to follow those constitutional authorities who have taken up an attitude in opposition to the principles of the measure before us, but in view of the fact that the present Attorney-General has to a great extent backed down from the ,position he formerly took up M i .

Matters must have been pretty well muddled from the first if we have to be dependent for our statistical information entirely upon the decennial census returns. If the seats had been distributed in the first instance upon the basis of the census returns, I should have had no hesitation in continuing to rely upon them, but as they were distributed upon statistical returns such as it is now suggested shall be used, and as the disparities between the electorates are now so serious, I think we should proceed at once to remove the existing anomalies. with considerable force, namely, that whilst the population of Victoria is smaller than tljat of New South Wales, the number of voters in the mother State is proportionately less than in Victoria. However, I do> not regard that as affording anv ground for cavilling at the proposed redistribution of seats, as the Constitution lays it down distinctly that the distribution must be on a population basis, and not on the number of yoters. counted for by the fact that in Victoria bottom of the measure. there are 2 per cent, more persons over the age of twenty-one than in New South Wales. we adopted the latest statistics available to us for the purpose of distributing the seats in the first instance, we cannot reasonably object to adopt a similar course now. I c'annot understand how the returns are worked out. According to the evidence given before the Old-Age Pensions Commission there is in Victoria a much greater number of persons between the ages of sixty and sixty-five than in New South Wales. Why that should be so I do not, know, but that seems to me to throw some doubt upon the accuracy of our statistical information. are taken from the census.

It is a mere question of whether there are more people between sixty and sixty-five years of age in New South Wales than there are in Victoria.

Upon a tormer occasion I objected very strongly to any redistribution, because of the abnormal condition of things which had obtained consequent upon the drought.

That position of affairs, however, is now past. People have returned to their homes, and matters have resumed their normal condition.

In spite of an inclination to lean a little towards my own State, I feel that the figures are against me, and that consequently I must vote in favour of the B ill. my intention to speak at length upon this measure. It is generally admitted that, prior to the first general election for this Parliament, we had not accurate figures as to the population of the various States. That position, to my mind, is about to be accentuated by the deliberate act of this House. statistics of population, we are about to resort to mere estimates. What was condemned as an improper act on the part of the late Government is now about to be regarded as a very proper act. I contend that if it was wrong for the late Government to propose the redistribution of seats upon mere estimates, it is equally wrong for the present Ministry to do so. The last census returns compiled by the States proved that the estimates upon which the first Commonwealth Parliament was elected were to some extent inaccurate; The same condition of affairs obtains to-day. SurelyI quite realize that that in laying down a new procedure it is desirable that we should have a reliable If this B ill were not carbasis! I do not feel disposed to vote against the Bill, knowing that it is absolutely necessary that we should provide first information some machinery to meet .the exigencies of the present situation. I do not find fault with those who say that, under the operation of the measure, it is probable that Victoria will lose a representative in this House. If the figures show that she is not entitled to that representative, I shall offer no objection. If , on the contrary, New South Wales is entitled to an additional representative, I say that her right should not be denied to her. Before proceeding, however, to redistribute the seats, I claim that we should have the most reliable data upon which to act. In Committee, I shall make a determined effort to incorporate that mode of procedure in the B ill . only wish to say a few words, and those not in derogation of the Bill, which I hope to see passed as speedily as possible. I quite agree with the honourable member for Moira, that this measure affords the most complete justification of the action taken by the late Government. Now that the present Ministry are taking precisely the same course as that adopted by their predecessors-now that they are crystallizing into a statute what the Reid-McLean Government did by Executive act, there is no ground for complaint, although the Bill does not take us very much further forward in regard to the work of redistributing the electorates. In itself, the measure seems to me to be incomplete. I should have liked to see the Government carry the matter further, or else incorporate the provisions of this Bill in a section of the Electoral Act, and place it upon the statute-book as such. The measure does Instead of obtaining reliable not in reality declare that there shall be a redistribution of seats, that the electorates shall be recast, so as to more accurately represent the basis of our democracy -namely, the adult vote of the Commonwealth.

For, instance, the honourable member for Grampians seemed to think that in voting for it he was voting for the redistribution of the Victorian electorates. from clause 10, that if the Bill be carried into law, it will have to be followed by a measure for the redistribution of the electorates of the States. will be a proclamation under the Electoral Act. number of members to be chosen in each State is fixed at twenty-two for Victoria, there will have to be a redistribution of electorates in this State. will cover that. that we are not now making provision for would suggest for consideration is this: the redistribution of the electorates of any There is no Commonwealth collection of State.

But I venture to say that they are statistics, even though they may be wrong. Our experience has shown that there are actual .exits and entrances for which no provision has been made, and I prefer figures which are subject to certain allowances for unrecorded arrivals and departures, rather than figures which are compiled upon arbitrary lines. I think that the Minister placed himself upon the horns of a dilemma, because he said in the first place thiat the number of persons to be chosen should be in proportion to the respective numbers of the people, and at the same time he implied that the moment any change of population occurred we must arrange for a change of representation accordingly. struction of the words "" whenever necessary "" might lead to that conclusion. that as it would be only fair to alter the representation as the population changed, he would refrain from ascertaining whether 'there was any alteration in the population except at fixed periods. he says that we should refrain from obtaining knowledge upon that point except at certain dates, and yet we know that the same means of knowledge are available every quarter in the Statisticians' returns. This Bill declares that the number of the representatives of the different States shall change in proportion to the population, but that we shall refrain from ascertaining what changes have taken place in that population except at fixed dates. That is so necessary a working rule that I do not intend to quarrel with it, although I still entertain doubts as to whether it is constitutional. If we deliberately refrain from knowledge, except at the five or ten year periods, we are omitting to add up when changes have taken place so as to ascertain the nature of those changes. I now come to the question of what is the meaning of the words "" whenever necessary."" The honourable and learned member for Angas said, in effect, that they are meaningless-that they mean that the number of members in this House shall be determined whenever it is necessary to determine them. we know that a thing is so, we must take In other steps to find out that it is so. MrM c CAY If that is the interpretation of the words, certainly they are meaningless^ But I have always understood that the Courts do not construe an Act of Parliament so as to render it meaningless, if they .can avoid doing so. With every respect, I submit that those words mean that the number of members shall be determined whenever the changes in our population alter the proportion so as to make it necessary to effect an alteration. I think that the words "" whenever necessary "" refer to the change in population which will cause a change in representation, if the arithmetical ratio is to be preserved. But the words "" until the Parliament otherwise provides"" precede the words "" be determined whenever necessary."" To my mind the words ""until the Parliament otherwise provides "" govern the method of I said that a strict condetermination to be provided, either with or without the wbrds ""''whenever necessary."" Consequently, Parliament can substitute for the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, figures ascertained in any manner that it inky' prescribe. That, however, does not get rid of the obligation on the part of the Parliament to alter the In effect, number of members as the number of the population alters, because the power * of Parliament is limited to a certain arithmetical calculation. I claim that the words ""the number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their people "" are imperative, and are subject to no parliamentary alteration whatever. Parliament cannot declare by legislation that it is not necessary to alter the number of members, when it is necessary under the earlier words of the section. However,. I have raised the point; the difficulty is here, and has to be met. I do not see the necessity for providing for a five years' enumeration. I think that an enumeration every ten vears would be sufficient. I repeat that tfie words "" until the .Parliament otherwise provides "" control sub-clauses i and 2, and therefore the words "" the latest statistics of the Commonwealth."" I think that the figures to which reference has been made are statistics in every reasonable sense of the term. Indeed, everything except the allowances for unrecorded",49,Groom

My doubt all along has been as to the words in the clause which are not controlled by the words, "" until the Parliament otherwise provides."" I do not think that our action is likely to be challenged, and if I were arguing the matter before the High Court, I should be strongly tempted to urge that that tribunal must strain the language of the Constitution, because of the extreme inconvenience which would result from a literal interpretation of it. at all. unconstitutional upon one ground, and I say that in order to defend the measure we have to strain the Constitution. Consequently, I think that the proposal is one which we ought to risk in the interests of the convenience of government. the objection taken to this Bill by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is well-founded. It is true that the certificate of the Electoral Officer is to be evidence, but it is only to be evidence of what the enumeration discloses. The Bill prescribes how the enumeration shall be made, and it only makes it evidence for the purposes of revision. I quite agree that what was intended was that there should be a Commonwealth enumeration of the population. In other words, instead of relying upon the statistics of the States by adopting them in an Act of Parliament, it was intended that we should specifically enumerate the population of the Commonwealth for the purpose of ascertaining the representation to which the States were entitled. At the same time, we have the power to adopt the statistics of the States, if we choose to do so. That is what the Government propose to do, and what I conceive is bad policy. I think that we should follow the American example, by having a Commonwealth enumeration, for the purpose of ascertaining the true share of representation to which the various States are entitled. To continue the present method indefinitely is certainly objectionable. That, however, is what the Bill does. A specific enumeration by the Commonwealth would not involve us in anyextra expense. We are now asked to pass a Bill dealing with census returns and statistics. We can prescribe in this measure that a census shall be taken for the Commonwealth every ten years. The Bill proposes to adopt the statistics of the States which may or may not be correct, instead of relying utpon the enumeration which, according to the spirit of the Constitution, we ought to make. Section 24 of the Constitution is undoubtedly very loosely drafted. Under it we could, if we so chose, abolish the quota system. That system was simply an experiment. It was Mr Justice O'Connor who was responsible for the suggestion. He pressed it on the Convention, and pointed out that under the words, "" until the Parliament otherwise provides,"" if it were found that the .quota system did not work well, it could be abolished. Hence, after declaring that the basis of representation should be the population, we made provision for varying the method of ascertaining the number of members that should represent each State. We provided that each State should have representation on the basis of its population, but how were we to ascertain when that representation was to be varied? It was because of this difficulty that it was provided that the Parliament might abolish the quota system, and that, further, we might declare that the statistics to be relied upon should not be the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. At present the prescription is that the latest statistics of the Commonwealth must be taken. There is nothing, however, to prevent us from declaring that those adopted for this purpose shall not be the latest. We might declare that the earlier statistics-'of the'Commonwealth were those which truly defined the basis of representation. That would be an absurd position to take up, but it would be open to us under the section as it stands. I therefore consider that, although it would be better, if we could afford it, to take a particular enumeration of the people for the purposes of the first distribution, it will be quite competent for us to declare that",50,Groom

That is the only issue. I had a conversation with the Prime Minister, who was good enough to say that the most convenient method to decide the question whether the Committee regarded the estimates of the Statisticians as being the "" latest statistics "" within the meaning of the Constitution would be by dividing on clause 2. I admit that if the clause were struck out it would be inconvenient so far as the machinery of the Bill is concerned, but it is obvious that it will be carried. members, however, who wish to show emphatically that they disapprove of the Government proposal, and it is our desire that the division upon clause 2 should be taken as a test.

I am opposed to that proBill. posal, and will vote against any amendment of the Bill in that direction. seems to me that the Constitution should be strictly adhered to. and that every State orable member's scheme. should receive its true measure of representation, according to the latest statistics. We have a shifting population, and we should be careful to see that each State, as its population increases, or decreases, has its proper representation in this House. We certainly ought not to seek to prevent that by determining that there shall be only a decennial redistribution. If any change of population can be approximately ascertained every five years, as proposed by this Bill, there ought certainly to be a quinquennial redistribution. In my opinion the intention of the Constitution is that the people of the several States shall have their proper representation in this House, and that any movement"" of population shall be taken into account. I shall therefore oppose the amendment. like to know whether the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne proposes that the first enumeration shall be by way of a census, or that there shall not be a redistribution of seats before the next decennial census is taken? -The position may be briefly stated. If there be a redistribution under present conditions it must be on -the basis of the census of 1901, inasmuch as no statistics There are several honourable have been collected since then.

Another of his proposals is to act upon the census of 1901. posal that we should effect a re-adjustment by reverting to the census of 1901 is an extraordinary one.

The honourable and learned member hasi not convinced me. have to admit tliat I am very dense, but I understood the honourable and learned member to argue that it is unconstitutional to take anything but a census. an actual count but a census? The honourable and learned member for Corinella spoke by way of illustration of tallying the [76] persons leaving or entering a room. Would the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne accept such a tally in connection with a count of the people as a census? To go back to the census of 1901 would be to abandon the whole position., by. going back five yeais to make an adjustment meant to meet our present conditions, whereas, if Ave wait for the census of 1911, we shall have to continue to take no recognition of the passing of the Women's Franchise Act, and either not redistribute, or, if we redistribute, take no notice of the relative representation of the States. The other proposal is to take a census in 1906. I have already pointed out the enormous spend £120,000 to arrive at figures which would almost beyond question be practically the same as those which we at present pos sessa course which I do not think the In making the redistribution we people of Australia would like to see taken. and learned member for Northern Melbourne apparently wants to go back to the census of 1901, so that Victoria may continue to have a representation pf twentythree members, to which she is not entitled. You, Mr Chairman, have to-night witnessed a great display of legal gymnastics, in the endeavour of honourable gentlemen to prove that statistics are not statistics, and similar difficult propositions. With regard to the proposal to take a census next year, I endorse what the honourable member for North Svdney has said about the expense, but I would further point out that if it were taken in December, Parliament would then have expired by effluxion of time, and on the results being presented after the general election, it would be contended by the honourable member for Northern Melbourne and others that we could not agree to a redistribution of seats then, because if we did so we should have to hold another general election on the new basis, and the Commonwealth could not afford the expense. The position would be pretty much the same if the census were taken in June next. We know that in connection with the taking of a State census it is generally four or five months before the returns have all been got in, made up, and checked, and we could not expect to learn the result of the Commonwealth census until the end of the year.

The representation of tbe States in this Chamber was originally determined, not upon the census, but upon the estimates of the Statisticians, and when nine months later the census returns were published it was found that the population of New 'South Wales was 2,000 below the estimate, while that of Victoria was from 36,000 to 38,000 in excess of the figures supplied by the' Statisticians. -figures left the representation just as before. ber refers to Coghlan he will find that my -statement is correct. -figures. 4hat the census of 190T showed that the estimates made nine months before by the Statisticians were grievously wrong. In view of this fact, and the fact that the Government Statisticians of New South Wales and Victoria have said that they prefer to work on the census rather than on mere estimates, it will be a huge farce for the Committee to pass the Bill as introduced. It would be unfair to reduce the representation of any State on the mere estimates of Statisticians. Even if it was the fault of the Government of I have before me a the day that action was not taken to alter the representation of New South Wales imsus returns for 1901, that is no reason why any honourable member should have his constituency wiped out on estimates that have proved to be inaccurate. We should have reliable information instead of mere misleading estimates to work upon. The Minister has said that the Government do not desire to expend £120,000 on taking^ a census for this purpose. It is not my wish that that expenditure should be incurred. I should be better pleased if the redistribution were allowed to remain in abeyance until the next decennial census were taken, but I feel that it would be better to have a census taken in 1906-and in that way to secure reliable information-tha n it would To make a redistribution on the be to make a redistribution of seats on estimates that are not to be relied upon.

It is stated thatIn the case of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia, 10 per centum'shall be added to the numbers of people arriving and departing as shown by the information received from the Railway Departments, to allow for unrecorded arrivals and departures by rail and road. I should like to know how that allowance of 10 per cent, has been' arrived at. ThenI notice that in paragraph 5 certain percentages are to be added to the numbers of persons departing by sea to allow for unrecorded departures. In New South Wales and Victoria9 per cent., in Queensland 10 per cent., in South Australia 7 per cent., in Western Australia 5 per cent, and in Tasmania 12*5 per cent, is to be allowed. It appears to me that the variation in the percentages requires some explanation. The figures for Tasmania are so very exact that I presume they must have been based upon reliable information. At the same time, it occurs to me that a larger percentage might very well be allowed in the case of Western Australia, because, although the principal traffic passes through three or four ports, a considerable number of persons arrive and depart from the north-western ports of that State.

Moreover, a number of persons use Esperance as a point of arrival and departure. I should like to have some explanation from the Minister. sure that I understand the f u l l effect. of the amendment proposed by the Minister. It appears to me that if the words "" a f t e r the commencement of this Act "" are inserted after the word ""taken,"" as he proposes, they will have the effect of postponing the second enumeration day until five years after the next census is taken. That would be five years after 1911.

Afte r deliberation and consultation, and after the revision of all their figures for the three years following the census taken in 1901, they worked out the percentages embodied in the B ill . as a fair allowance to make for unrecorded arrivals and departures by land. as arrivals and departures by sea are concerned, the Statisticians worked out the records of the departments, and then made a comparison with the census statements with a view to arrive at an absolutely reliable percentage. to a certain extent like an island, and the returns of population generally can, therefore, be compiled with a fair degree of accuracy.

That is a fixed day. The intentionof the clause is to enable us to fix an enumeration day as early as possible after the passing of the B ill . The next enumeration day would be a census day, and after Still there that, assuming that a decennial census istaken regularly, we should at alternating periods have census and enumeration days, which are not census days. is intended; but I am afraid that the amendment proposed-by the Minister will not have the desired effect. liamentary Draftsman, and take care that the intention is clearly expressed. Committee has decided by an overwhelming majority to accept the enumeration days as. involving a possible readjustment of the representation of the States, I still adhere to the belief that it would have beenr far better to fix census periods for effecting a change of representation. Under existing circumstances, I feel that we must agree' to an enumeration beings All I desire to know is whether it made every fifth year, and to the censusreturns being collected every tenth year. In order that the information thus derived may be as accurate as possible, it seems to me that a special arrangement will require to be made with the States under which the enumeration shall be conducted upon definite lines. It should be specifically set out in the B ill that no changeshall be made in the boundaries of electorates unless there is a sufficient alteration in the number of voters to justify a change in the representation of the various States. My object is to avoid expense. If we makeThey regarded 10 per cent, these changes every ten years, in my judgment, we shall accomplish all that is necesSo far sary. AlthoughI voted in favour of obtaining accurate information, I cannot persist in objections to the recommendations of* the Government. honourable and learned member for CorioWestern Australia is spoke of the reduction in the population? of New South Wales, with a view to showing that no enumeration should be made apart from the actual taking of the census. The same remarks apply to But I ' would point out to him that the reduction in the voting strength of the elecWith retorates there is due to the fact that it is-very much more difficult to collect statistics-in New South Wales than it is in Victoria.

Concerning the question of the percentages to be added to the numbers of persons departing by sea, to allow for unrecorded departures by sea, I take it that the State Statisticians, in conference assembled, found that they had not previously made a fair allowance, and consequently agreed to the percentages which have been embodied in this Bill. In so acting their object was to get as accurate an enumeration as possible. In the case of Western Australia, it seems to me that the allowance of 5 per cent, is rather an advantage than otherwise to that .State.
