The honourable member for Wimmera did more injury, particularly to his -own electorate, than any man sitting in the Corner party when the Tarfiff was -passed through this Chamber. In the list --to which I have referred, there is a large number of items, but I consider it necessary to deal with them in detail so that they may be recorded in Hansard. If honourable members prefer to have them printed, I am prepared not to deal with them all, but I must read some. First of all, I shall deal with anomalies from a departmental point of view, more than from a policy point of view. member any indication of what the honourable member for Yarra, when Minister, intended to do in regard to the anomalies? Sir WILLIA M LYNE Not the slightest. I never asked the honourable member; but, as an act of courtesy, he had the list revised up to this year. Item 7gd of the Tariff is that of matches; and in regard to it the Departmental comment isWording could be altered so as to exclude certain advertising words now used by importers. When this item was before honourable members, there was a long debate on the queshontion of advertising on match-boxes; and a great deal of trouble to the Department, and also to importers, would be obviated if the suggested alteration were made. My desire is to do the fair thing to Protectionists, and also to Free Traders in regard to articles which cannot be manufactured in this country. Tariff session. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -We shall see what chance we have, with a Government who have a majority of only three ! The people are anxious that the rectification of the Tariff sliall not be held in abeyance for five years, if they can prevent it. Items 885 and 89 involve a matter in which the ex-Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Barrier took a great interest. They deal respectively with invalids' diabetic food, and infants' food, as prescribed by Departmental by-laws, and the Department suggests the items should be amalgamated ; but it appears that, under the law, as it stands, that cannot be done. The honourable member for Barrier knows a great deal about this matter, and was very anxious to have it properly arranged in the Tariff; but it will be .remembered that I had a great fight at that time, and had to depend almost entirely on the Departmental oflicers, so that in the hurry of the moment we had not time to deal with every anomaly.

Item 12it, which deals with caps and sewn hats, n.e.i., ought, it is represented, to be altered to refer to ' 'caps sewn,"" because the item at present clashes with item isnd, which embraces hats and bonnets of all descriptions.

100,Sir William Lyne,,23,Tariff Anomalies And Additional Duties
101,[Quorum Mr Henry Willis,"It is not much of""Tariff was passed it employed five men, and now it is employing about sixty-five. 'That shows that it is a substantial industry. I have given the anomalies from the :stand-point of the Department. I come now to a list of the anomalies from the Protectionist and revenue point of view. WhatI have already read was written by the Departmental officers to show where trouble ""is caused in coming to decisions on the ""Tariff. The list of anomalies from the Protectionist and revenue point of view is as follows:Ttems 34 and 104 -Tapioc a Free. Flours, including Tapioca flour from whicli the dearer Tapioca is made 2^d. ancl 2d. Tapioca is used in making office paste. Duties on it are a serious handicap representing 120 per -cent. Duties on paste are 30 per cent, and 25 -per cent. I want it to be clearly understood that, -while all this information comes from the Department, which has looked at the matter as far as possible from the stand-point of Protection and also of revenue, I do -not agree personally with the suggestion made in that regard, because cornflour can be, and is, made here, and tapioca is :grown here. I am, however, giving straightforwardly the whole of the objections -placed in my hands by the Department:Item 91 -Isinglass n.e.i. at 15 per cent, should ""be 20 per cent, and 15 per cent., the same as item 8S0 Oilmen's stores 20 per cent, and 15 -per cent. That refers to the preferential duty of 15 per cent. This is important, because under -one set of conditions the article comes in under a higher percentage than it does under the other, and it is difficult for the Department to know under which percentage it should be placed. The Departmental offi-cers, therefore, want an alteration and a higher duty, because the present duty is not high enough. Item t2ie -Caps. This includes all kinds, whilst the intention was to place the heavier duties on sewn caps only. Motor, college, and similar caps should have been admitted at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. Item 123* -Cotton piece goods 5 per cent, -and free. Generally admitted that these goods -should have been dutiable at 10 per cent, and 5 per cent. There is also another item, which arises, not under the Customs Tariff, but under the Bounties Act. I refer to the question of wool tops, which are now being manufactured at Botany with machinery as exThat surely is a matter to which we should cellent as it is possible to obtain. I have give attention at an early date. I wish to been to the works two or three times. Mr refer back for a moment to the item of Hughes, who started the industry, deserves the greatest praise for what he has done, arid if honourable members went there they would be amazed. I have compared the tops produced there with Bradford tops, and with Vickery's tops and all others made in New South Wales and imported, and I can honestly say that those manufactured at the Botany works are superior to anything I have ever seen. But the trouble is that the manufacturer can receive the bounty only on what he exports. The Department has refused to pay him the .bounty on any that he sells in Australia. They Starch say the law is against it. That seems to be turning things upside down, and I should think we ought to give Mr Hughes every encouragement to supply our own demands first, by giving him a bounty for doing so, before he is given a bounty for exporting his goods. I should'like not only yourself, Mr Speaker, but all honourable members who have the welfare of our industries at heart, to go to Botany to see the manufacture of these tops You would all be amazed at what you would see. Item 125/ -Flannelett e should have been kept at 25 per cent, and 20 per cent, as introduced. It is now 5 per cent, and free. More than ever a competitor with woollen goods made in Australia. the duty should be made 50 per cent. feeling about it. It is a dangerous competitor with our woollen goods in all ways, and the House should take the matter into consideration at the earliest possible opportunity, in order that the present state of affairs may not continue. trade do not support the honourable member's contention. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -They do. Mr Mark Foy brought the matter under my notice years ago, and also a short time ago. He said it was a disgrace to allow flannelette to be imported as it i i IJTW, and that he would very much prefet to sell woollen goods, of which flannelette has now practically taken the place. Item 126 -Kerseys of all kinds are free. I l was intended to limit the exception to Saddlers ""Kerseys, making kersey for apparel and attire dutiable at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, as Woollen piece goods.

[Quorum formed.] interested in this statement of Tariff anomalies. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -S o it would appear, judging by the state of the Ministerial bench. We see on the Government benches honourable members who, although they were once Protectionists, cannot be considered Protectionists at the present timeItems 146 and 152 -Corn shellers, corn buskers, 20 per cent.; maize harvesters free. The names are said to be synonymous. Maize harvesters should be deleted from the item. When these items were before the House, I was unable to understand why maize harvesters could not be manufactured in Australia, since corn-shellers and corn-huskersare produced hereItem 145 -Agricultura l machinery and im-plements n.e.i. 15 per cent, and 12^ per cent. These duties are not sufficient Protection; 20. per cent, as originally proposed would have been, suflicient. I find' that the value of our imports of agricultural machinery from the United States of America, in 1907, was of agricultural machinery imported into (he Commonwealth was £290,276Item i6o« -Steam turbines 5 per cent, anc? for direct coupling or directly coupled to elecgenerators or to pumps, subject to Departthey compete with the ordinary engines made in Australia. Honourable members will recollect that an attempt was made to impose higher duties in respect of these items, but that it was opposed by representatives of Western Australia. There was a strong agitation for the imposition of substantial duties, and it was urged that ironfounders in Ballarat,. Bendigo, and other places, who were manufacturing engines, should not have to compete with these lines, most of which are admitted free of duty. I am informed that the effect of the item has been to throw out of employment a number of men who used to be engaged in foundries where the manufacture of engines was once carried on. Surely that is a substantial argument for an early revision of the Tariff in that regardItem 160 -Generally . The duty of 20 percent, all round (1) gives no preference to the United Kingdom; (2) is not suflicient Protection, and then causes trouble in deciding whether an appliance is dutiable at 20 per cent, under this item or 25 per cent, or 20 per cent, under item 162c, as machines or machinery n.e.i., 25 per cent, and 20 per cent.

There can be no doubt that speedy intervention is necessary in order that the item may be revisedItem 165a -Machinery for carding and comban anomaly? ing wool should be free. Bonus for tops is given, but complicated machinery is necessary which would cost prohibitive price if made in the Commonwealth. That statement, I think,, was made in ignorance of the fact that Mr Hughes, of Botany, is engaged in producing tops. He would be able to extend his works if a bonus were given on tops sold in Australia, as well as on those exported. The item ought to be adjusted as soon as possible. Item 165* and 186 -Wire-nettin g machines, item to which I wish to refer is15 per cent., while wire netting is free. I need scarcely remind honourable members of the attitude which the Government took up in regard to these items. Surelyi f wire netting is free, the machinery used in its manufacture ought also to be free. My contention, however, is that there should be a duty on both items. I am strongly in favour of a duty on wire nettingItem lyoc -South Australian tinsmiths say lhat the admission of aluminium household utensils at 5 per cent, and free will seriously handicap their industry. That is a complaint that ought to be dealt withItem 175 -Screws with nuts, & c , 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. It has been stated by some Victorian manufacturers that the Victorian makers of table ancl music stool screws at whose instigation the duties were imposed, refuse to make the screws at less than double the price they were prior to the duty. Here is a case in which, in the interests of the public generally, action should be taken. I come now toItem 176a -Rotary and progressive rock drills, 5 per cent, and free. These are made in Australia, and should have been dutiable at 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., as other drilling boring machines. That is an item in which the present Postmaster-General took a great deal of interest when the Tariff was before the HouseItem 177 -Generator s for direct couplings for steam engines, 5 per cent, and free. These should have been dutiable at 20 per cent, when 200 horse-power, the same as all other kinds. They can be made in Australia. Item 178* -Gas meters, 5 per cent, and free. The parts only from which meters are used should have been 5 per cent, and free, and the finished meters 25 per cent, ancl 20 per cent. I received many deputations from manufacturers of these articles, who complained in New South Wales and South Australia, that the duty as it stands was practically and probably in the other States. Unless crushing them out of existence and preventing them from carrying on their industry. Surely we should not allow five years to elapse before we take action to rectify such Item 180 -Rails, fishplates, & c , 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. Duties should have been 17^ per cent, and per cent. Old Tariff is± per cent.

If the duty is increased, a great deal of employment will be given, and we shall be able to manufacture locally -colours superior to those now in use.

In 1907, our importations of carbide of calcium were valued at £138,407, and in 1908 at £80,334. timber in 1907 was valued at £1,560,376, and in 1908 at £1,862,796. that a deputation is now with the Minister, asking for an increase in the timber duties, because in Tasmania, and probably in some of the other States, mills have had to be closed.

We cnnnot sit quietly by, and see all this invested money lost, and the opportunity of employing a large number of men pass away. What is, perhaps, the worse feature is that, if these capitalists, who, I understand, are raising £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 more, should lose their money, it will create a bad feeling amongst capitalists in Great -Britain, and probably put a stop to any investment of the kind here for a. long time. This industry should not be allowed to languish simply because a few people are hungry for seats or office in this Parliament, or because they entertain towards the Labour party an antipathy which is both unmerited and suicidal. I have here a memorandum which has been sent to me, and, though I do not endorse every statement made in it , I shall read it . Dr. come from? Sir WILLIAM LYNE sire to mention the name now, but the letter will appear in Hansard. It is from a ladv who understands the question, and she says:1. Women's and Children's Dress Goods -It has now been abundantly proved that these goods are not, and cannot be made here on a paying and commercial basis. The making-up industry which, both in New South Wales and Victoria, had attained large proportions, is. suffering acutely-bein g totally unable to compete with the imported ready-made garments, often the product of severely sweated labour, and with the deluge of job lines, and end of season clearances. The raw material of the Australian manufacturers' industry pays 25 per cent, and 30 per cent, whilst the made-up garments come in at 35 per cent, and 40 per cenV 2. Rock Drills -It is generally admitted that the present want of protection under Which this industry suffers is geographical fiscalism of the worse kind. 3. Laces and Embroideries -Thes e goods are not, and are never likely to be, made in Australia. They are part of the raw material of the whiteworkers' trade, and pay mostly 15 Someper cent., or rather i6£ per cent., So per cent, of laces and 99 per cent, of embroideries coming from Europe. Large manufacturing houses submit something like 10,000 patterns to their customers each half-year, and the industry, like The many others, has stubbornly localized itself. 4. Men's, Women's, and Children's Woven Cotton under-garments -Probably no dutypresses more hardly upon the poorest people Little of the Commonwealth than the present one of 44 per cent, on these goods. There has never been any attempt to make them here, nor is any contemplated. On a woman's singlet, which is sold retail at 6d., there are the wholesale and retail profits to be charged and i£d. in duty. The value the consumer gets is infinitesimal obviously. Workmen's garments of the same quality fare just as badlv, and it must be rememberd that these people do not buv cotton from preference, but because they cannot afford wool. 5. Towels -Admittedl v there is no manuijeoture of towels here, but they are included in Apparel and Attire,"" and 'pav duty accordingly. Towelling by the yard 'comes in free, but the towel of commerce is cheaper and has become so universally recognised a requirement that manufacturers cannot be induced to vary their process, hence this enormous impost on this community. I am inclined to think that that is a mistake, but I read this as expressing the opinion of an expert. able member think that the'sixpenny garments would be any cheaper if the duty were removed ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I cannot sav. I asked a certain person to give an expert opinion in regard to matters of which I not bind myself to the statements made. I do not deConcentrating my attention upon dress goods, as I have been doing, I have not given much consideration to other anomalies, but that the items I have specified may justlv be so classed, I think you will admit. a reduction of duties. Sir WILLIAM LYNE In some cases, but not in others. The other day a deputation waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs in reference to the ""banana industry ; and I read with some degree of shame the helpless and impotent reply of the Minister that nothing could be done. able member make bananas more expensive ? banana-growing is a great "" industry in Queensland.

And geneially, that the producing industry of take into consideration fhe development of Australia may be relieved in every possible way our iron and steel industry. It has been from the unfair competition of cheap coloured labour. To that, as I have already indicated, the Minister's reply was, "" We can do nothing; we are helpless; we are shackled."" That is a most disgraceful reply to come from a Minister. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I desire to show the impotent position in which this Government is placed, owing to the fact that both parties to the fusion have had to give up their principles, and the Protectionist party particularly so. The result is world-and the best men are to be found a policy of d r if t ; and I do not think that in Great Britain. This fusion, or confusion, the country will allow it to continue very long. When we were dealing with the Tariff it was abundantly shown that great efforts were being made at Ipswich to extend a cotton mill, which had already been partially established. have been planted, in order that there may be always some cotton on hand; and it has been proved that cotton can be grown well in Queensland, as I myself saw forty years ago on the Logan. That being so, why should the col ton industry not be protected in the same way as the woollen or any other industry ? Only in connection with one particular part of the work, which I cannot accurately describe, is there the slightest protection. orable member fail to protect the industry ? though I fought very hard, the honourable member and others would not allow me to do so. The Leader of the Opposition knows how hard I fought for the protection of the cotton industry, and how my efforts were defeated by the then Opposition corner party. The question, however, should be revived in the interests of a latent industry, which must lea'd to the manufacture of a widely-used fabric. I have been reminded that there is an immense importation of wattle bark from South Africa and elsewhere in competition with the bark grown in Australia, 5 a good thing to have bark imported for the purpose of making leather? Sir WILLIAM LYNE No t when we have a lot of our own bark going to waste. The honourable member is only talking all things, we ought, at an early date, to decided to start on a small scale with the manufacture of our own small arms; and we have jumped the Protectionist and preferential Jim Crow in going to America instead of Great Britain for the machinery. What surprises me most is that the Australian workmen, who are to take charge of this factory, are to be sent, not to Great Britain, but to America to be educated in I know; but the industry. We should take a lesson from Great Britain, and not only have the best of material for our small and large arms, but also workmen who have been educated under the best men in the Government seem to have thrown to the winds every principle of unity and of preference-ever y British ideal. While it is admitted that articles are manufactured cheaply in America, it is also known that Some 300 acres the better work is to be found in the Mother Country; neither ships nor arms are so well made in the United States. But I suppose the Government are taking their present action in order to show their independence of Great Britain, and that they will have no preference in the future. A t the present time, as I have indicated, the iron and steel industry is not sufficiently protected. For some reason, with which I am not acquainted, the Government refused to pay the bonus on scrap iron, though it W h y did the honis always included in every part of the world where the bonus system prevails, and although it is well known that this material forms the very best class of metal for arms and machinery. Either a private individual or the Government must take steps to develop this industry, in order that we may not be left helpless if supplies are cut off in time of war. -That matter is of such grave importance that I have always held that the Government may have to undertake it, for it must ibe regarded quite apart from any consideration of what is or is not Socialism. The time has come when, this matter should be forced forward. Let us have no waiting and dilly-dallying such",28,Carty Salmon Wher E Does It Knew Nothnig And As I Said Before I Do

However much of a disgrace he may be to that mill in his position, he has not been man enough to answer my letter, or to answer tradesmen who were willing to purchase from him, although every other mill in Australia extended the courtesy of a reply.

To return to the anomaly in regard to dress goods, I would point out that 7,069 human beings, who have a right to our protection, have been practically injured and that their position under the Tariff ought to receive our serious consideration. Every true Protectionist is prepared, I am sure, to give more Protection to the woollen industry; but we must take care that it is not injured by the production of shoddy. Some time ago, I obtained a suit of Australian tweed of which I was very proud. Later on, I proposed to give it away, and, not wishing it to be recognised, when worn by its new owner, I had it dyed. dyeing process revealed the fact that I had purchased a piece of shoddy. I hope that no industry that is protected by the Commonwealth Tariff will engage in the manufacture of shoddy, and that the Government will give us an early opportunity to deal with Tariff anomalies. orable member for Hume did not appear to f u l l y appreciate the anomaly in regard to the duty on towels. anomaly lies in the fact that towels are classed as "" a t t i r e .

The Japanese Tariff is the most up-to-date in the world. The Japanese do not play with 5 per cent., 10 per cent., or 15 per Heaven knows what became of cent, duties; where they think it necessary, they impose duties of ' 2 5 0 per cent. It was in that way that they were-able to deal effectively with the operations of the American Tobacco Combine. That Combine, controlling a capital of millions, and, if the truth be known, probably fighting the English Combine, refused an offer made by the Japanese Government to purchase their business there at a fair price. They had taught the Japanese to smoke cigarettes, and wished to profit by their action. Then the Japanese proposed a small duty of 50 per A duty of 100 per cent, was imposed, and still the Combine smiled. Next a duty I ask the honourable of 150 per cent, was levied, and the Combine realized that the position was becoming serious. They then desired the JapaneseI bow to your rulGovernment to buy th'em out. The Japanese, however, were wise enough, I believe, to say to them: "" No. You would not accept a fair offer. We are now going to manufacture for ourselves."" In 1906 a duty of 250 per cent, was imposed on tobacco; but, under the Japanese Tariff, everything required for a Government monopoly isallowed to come in. free. In this way, Japan rid herself of a monopoly, and the Government is to-day deriving a large income from the tobacco industry.

No one will say that we have not workers able to make clothes good enough for our community. We should put on such duties as would be almost prohibitive, or give a protection of at least 30 per cent. I hope that the Ministry will make a complete answer to the honourable member for Hume. If the Prime Minister will declare that the anomalies of the Tariff shall be rectified, he will get my vote. He will also have the right to claim the vote of every other Labour man. At the next election there will be no Labour candidates standing who will not be Protectionists, because of the new Protection plank in our platform, which is an absolutely justifiable one. Traders on this side, and as the Liberals have wiped them out on the other, because the Conservatives have accepted the 'Protectionist policy, I hope that every member of the next Parliament will recognise the dangers which threaten our manufactures by reason of the power of the trusts and combines which hold the nations in their grasp. For the first time in the history of the world a Continent is being dominated by a people, and I hope that we shall frame such a Tariff, and take such precautions against monopolies and trusts, that we shall be able to manufacture enough to supply, not only what we need ourselves, but the requirements of the world outside as well. We shall not then have a Tariff once every five years. We must follow the example of Japan, which, in 1903, 1904, and 1905, increased its duties until it obtained its present up-to-date Tariff. The Government of the United States of America, too, is constantly rectifying the anomalies whicb occur in its Tariff. It would be well if our Government introduced a system whereby, when an anomaly, or the need for a higher duty, had been discovered by a If they cannot be manufactured in Committee, the mere reading of a motion from the front bench, and the taking of a vote, without debate, would settle the matter. I look forward to the next ten years with trepidation, because I know how strong are the monetary combinations and capitalistic rings. I hope that the! Government will bring in a Bill to remedy all the anomalies in the Tariff. sure that every Protectionist, is disappointed with the speech of the honourable member for Hume. At the close of his remarks he made a strong plea for Free Trade in connection, with dress materials. opinion of some one else. opinion to impress the House that there is an anomaly in the Tariff which should be rectified by having Free Trade in dress materials. Melbourne evidently thought that he did, because, in seconding the motion, he advanced the matter still further. to tax goods which cannot be manufactured in the country? As we have wiped out the Free to Sydney for samples of dress materials manufactured there, and received the sworn declaration that they had been made in the country. tweeds.

I am surprised that the honourable member is not prepared to encourage the making of this cloth. I could understand a proposition such as that which he put forward coming from a Free Trader, but it was a strange one to come from a Protectionist. I , as a Protectionist, am not prepared to help him in rectifying what he calls Tariff anomalies by introducing Free Trade. He chooses now to sit on the Opposition side of the chamber, with those who have always sunk the fiscal"" question, and who were responsible for reductions in duties to which he has objected.

At -any rate, the honourable member for Melbourne, who seconded the motion, endorsed those statements, and congratulated the honourable member for Hume on his attitude in the matter. any one who would do anything to remove the infamies that exist in this Tariff. the rectification of anomalies. I would vote for a duty on cotton socks, to encourage an industry which pays girls here 25s. a week, whereas abroad the wages are from ios. to 12s. per week. .The honourable member for Hume referred to the match-making industry. Since the duty was imposed on matches, a factory has been built in Richmond, at a cost of £14,000, and several hundreds of men are being employed there. Mr Jeffrey, who visited Australia on behalf of the Board of Trade, two or three years ago, reported, on his return to England, that we could not make matches here, because wages were too high, and hours too short. But the result has falsified his statement. The honourable member for Hume also spoke about the wire netting duties. But he is sitting with those who reduced those duties. him ? member get the Free Traders on the Ministerial side to vote with him? to interjections. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports knows that the duty -on wire netting was reduced because of the action taken by the members of his party. The honourable member for Hume asked for higher duties cn rock-boring machinery. But seven members' of tht. Labour party voted, and three paired, against such duties. In Committee, the voting for and against was equal, there being twenty-five on each side, and the Chairman gave his casting vote against the duties. Those who are responsible for what the honourable member terms an anomaly in this instance are those with whom he is sitting. Honourable members of the Labour party reduced the duties on all the items which, according to the honourable member for Hume, should bear higher duties. I am prepared to support the rectification of anomalies on Protectionist lines, but not on Free Trade lines. I am surprised at the attitude taken in regard to dress material and cotton socks by the honourable member for Hume, who says that he has supported Protection all his life. He says that he champions the cause of the women workers of Australia. So do LI have yet to learn that the women of Australia are not patriotic enough to wear Australian clothes-that they are so tied to fashion as to demand some design from France or elsewhere before they will walk down Collins-street or Bourke-street. If we have Australian goods of sound quality, I believe, our women are prepared to wear'them; and the honourable member for Melbourne has done them an injustice. but I do know that Australian women are loyal and patriotic enough to believe in encouraging Australian trade, even if they have to pay a little more for the goods. I am surprised to hear an honourable mem-, ber, who claims to be a Protectionist, advocating the removal of the duty from a dress material because it is a burden on women-workers. There is no honorahle member who would be prepared to inflict any such burden. I listened with a good deal of attention to the honourable member for Hume, who simply read out the list of anomalies, and urged thaf they should be Can he get them to vote with dealt with. I waited patiently to hear the honourable member approach the question the honourable from the Protectionist stand-point, but he did not do so. If the Customs officers do not understand how to interpret items in the Tariff, honourable members on both sides admit that it is our duty to rectify anomalies and really that is all the honourable member has asked for to-dav.

I stand here this afternoon more convinced than ever that, as a Protectionist, I am much safer behind the present Prime Minister than with honourable members opposite. [5-3°]-I thought that, after this motion had been moved and seconded, a member of the Government would have addressed himself to the question, though to express an opinion of that kind may appear rather presumptuous on my part. able member select-the Minister of Defence? thought the Prime Minister the proper person to give some expression of opinion. The honourable member for Batman, who, like myself, is a new member, has learned very quickly to speak ""with his tongue in his cheek."" He claims to be a Protectionist, and I have claimed in the same direction; indeed, I do not think that honourable members could find much weakness in my armour on that side. But I am a Protectionist only from an industrial stand-point, because I would refuse to impose duties simply with a view to revenue. In regard to woollen fabrics, I can back my own opinion against that of the honourable member for Batman or any other honourable member as to the possibility of manufacture within Australia. Both importers and manufacturers know that there are fabrics imported which are not manufactured here, and which there may be no attempt to manufacture for the next few generations. I admit, of course, that a duty on such fabrics may induce people to wear other fabrics that are manufactured here. We are told that if women will be foolish, and wish to follow the fashions of the older world, they ought to pay for the privilege; but that is not my opinion. There are mary items on which we must admit that women have a claim to show their taste in choice. I have heard many men speak discouragingly of women for dressing rather flashly, and so forth, but I have never yet known a man who did not like to see his wife, daughter, or sweetheart make as presentable an appearance as possible. The majority of women are naturally conservative, and we like to see them so in our homes and associations and we must not condemn them too much on that score. I might enumerate many articles which are not produced here, and which are not likely to be produced here for some time. There is, for instance, Italian cloth, in regard to which I drew down the ire of the honourable member for Hume during the discussion of the Tariff, because he thought I was taking a peculiar stand as a Protectionist, when I endeavoured to reduce the duty, knowing as I did that no attempt would be made to produce the fabric here for many generations. In regard to printed flannels, it may be an argument to say that if women wish to use the imported variety, they ought to pay the duty; but, unfortunately, the manufacturers of Australia have never endeavoured to cater in women's materials. The honourable should have member for Denison, who is, I suppose,, the only member besides myself who hashad much experience in this connection,, knows that, in the case of certain fabrics,, no attempt whatever has been made tO' manufacture them in Australia; indeed,, there are fabrics imported into Australia? that are not manufactured in England'.. Every country in the world has some specialty in which it excels; and that, I suppose, will occur in trie case of Australia aselsewhere. As a Protectionist, I again saythat, in view of the fact that certain materials are not manufactured here, and that the necessary and special machinery is not: here, it is only common sense to vote for areduction of the duty in such cases. Weall know that there are anomalies in the Tariff, but the principal anomaly, in my opinion, is that in no case has sufficient duty been imposed to cause manufacture to the extent that ought to result. Protectionists had to rely on the honorable member for Dalley and the Free Trade honourable member for West Sydney to savethe iron duties, when the Opposition corner was filled with thirteen Protectionists, who had been sent here by the manufacturers of Victoria. At the next election themanuf acturers will support those same honourable members, in spite of the fact tfiaf, during the Tariff discussion, they endeavoured to cripple the industries of the State.",35,Castlemaine Woollenco Ltd

155,Mr Mathews,"It is curious thatsupport them at the next election, because they are against the new Protection. fear of new Protection that has made the manufacturers give their support to honourable members opposite, instead of allowing the Protectionist cause to be championed by the honourable member for Hume. I was told' by honourable members opposite, when the Tariff was under discussion, that there is not an atom of generosity in the whole of the manufacturers of Australia; and now those manufacturers are expending all their strength and money to ""down"" the honourable member for Hume. While in most cases I do not regard the 3uties as high enough, there are other comwe could get higher duties on condition that modities upon which the duties could be reduced, because they are not in any sense protective, as no attempt has been made to manufacture the goods here. We endeavoured to have a duty placed upon meters, and I was unfortunate in that case in having to meet the opposition of the honourable member for North Sydney, who is an able advbcate, and greatly respected in this Chamber. Having some knowledge of the subject, he seemed to make it his special business to oppose my proposal. I had the misfortune to have to fight him -on both occasions, and he was responsible for the fact that no duty was imposed on .meters. There is nothing in a meter, or in the parts of it, which could not be manufactured in Australia, and we also know that everything that can possibly be so .treated is now being measured by meters, or will be in the near future. The manufacture of meters will increase rather than diminish, and the meter makers deserve the imposition of a duty on the imported article. Another case is that of traction -engines, which during the Tariff debates the honourable member for Corangamite said we could not manufacture here. He may have believed what he said, but I think I ,proved otherwise, and a certain duty was imposed. The local article is now produced cheaper than the price at which the imported article was sold prior to the imposition of that duty. We find that traction side. It is not denied that, during the con-engines are cheaper here now than ever they were, because the importers had to reduce their prices so as to be able to compete against the locally-manufactured article. They have even gone below it, and, seeing that those who buy traction engines have reBatman can enumerate six or seven Free ceived a benefit from the imposition of the -duty, we ought to be prepared to give the local manufacturer some assistance by imposing a still higher duty, so that he, and not the importer, may get the local market. would not do that until the new Protection was enforced? I said previously, I have been bitten once, and I am not so innocent as I was. There will be no more of these increased duties without new Protection conditions attached. Another commodity which is largely manufactured here is cast-iron pipes. A duty was placed upon them, but it is really so small as to be an anomaly. So we could go through the whole schedule. I feel sure that, even as the House is composed now, we did not insist upon extending Protection to the worker as well. There are in this Chamber representatives of vested interests who would vote for higher duties, so long as we were not nasty enough to insist on the worker getting a share. I wish to see attention given to these anomalies in the Tariff, so that the manufacturers cannot plead their existence as an excuse for not paying better wages to their workmen. Rightly or wrongly, I look to the Prime Minister for support in this direction. I may be asking too much, but I do expect that, whenever the matter is approached by the present Government, if he is still at its head, he will insure the payment of some share of whatever duties are imposed to the men who are working for the capitalistic manufacturers. If that is not conceded, I shall have to consider my position very seriously. I hope the Prime Minister will make a statement to the House to-day upon which we can rely, and which we can regard as expressing the intentions of the Government. I hope he will have strength enough to force the Free Traders who are now on his side to support him in doing away with anomalies. The good old Scriptural text about removing the beam from your own eye before looking for the mote in your brother's eye, can be very well applied to the honourable member for Batman. Of course, he has learnt to be a politician, and he now parades the vices of the other sideration of the last Tariff, a number of members of the Labour party voted against high duties, but our position is not so bad as is that of many honourable members opposite.

159,Mr Mathews,"Decidedly not. Astwenty-seven on the other side, and if I liked to take the old Victorian eleven, I could show him on that side about thirty-five members who are really Free Traders, and who have no intention. of voting for higher duties in which the workmen, as well as the employers, can participate. The honourable member for Wentworth is smiling at the fact that he has obtained some converts to Free Trade on that side. He knows that he has nobbled them. Although during the consideration of the Tariff there were in our party men who would not vote for sufficient duties, and were not pledged to do so, we have now in our policy the plank of new Protection, which will give them an opportunity of casting their votes for higher duties in future than in the past. Those honourable members rightly held the opinion that Protection alone did not benefit the worker. But what shall we say of honourable members opposite? Can the Prime Minister, or any other Minister, convince me that the avowed Free Traders in his party, and the members of the old Victorian corner, have any desire to place higher duties upon commodities with the intention of giving the workers higher wages ? I can assure the honourable member for Batman that we have the best of the argument on this side so far. as Protection is concerned. He, and others who forsook the honourable member for Hume, will, of course, endeavour to make their case good, and to pose as the true Protectionists, but we know that they are only "" shoddy.""

The question of Protection is a sort of King Charles' head to the honourable member, and, having but one idea, in politics, as in other walks of life, he is no doubt apt to take a distorted view of the position. able member for Hume misrepresented the honourable member? while ago. the honourable member that what he proposes to say now by way of personal explanation could be more conveniently and much more properly said during the debate which is now proceeding. I would suggest that the honourable member should not anticipate the debate by making a personal explanation, but should join in the debate after the honourable member for Laanecoorie has spoken. sonal explanation, because it relates to votes which I cast on the last Tariff more than to the motion now before the Chair. honourable member to be misled. If he proceeds to speak now, he will be considered to have spoken in the debate. I hope, therefore, that he will not continue, unless he is prepared to allow his speech to be regarded in that way. take part in the debate. I have gone to the trouble of taking out the figures in connection with the voting on the last Tariff. I find that my votes in favour of the Tariff, as introduced by the Government, in the whole of the divisions substantially exceeded the votes cast'on the average by the wliole of the members of the present Opposition. The average number of votes cast in favour of the Government schedule of duties by the twenty-five members of the Labour party, excluding the Chairman, was 116 per member. The average vote cast by the whole of the present Opposition, i ncluding the honourable member for Hume's party of four, was 132 per member. My votes cast in favour of the Government hope I have heard the last of the misrepresentation of my votes by the honourable member for Hume.

204,Dr. Carty Salmon,"I should likefor Hindmarsh, who was an Honorary Minister in the' late Government, said that they would postpone them for three years. Then, again, the only reference to the question of Protection in the Governor General's speech is that contained in paragraph 17, which deals with the policy of the new Protection. The Fisher Government were careful to perform almost the same acrobatic feat as the honourable member for Hume has just attempted to accomplish, because they declared that the new Protection should apply to both protected and unprotected industries. They were anxious, if possible, to be on both sides of the fence at the same time. wages should be paid in every industry. able member for Kalgoorlie is now very anxious concerning the payment of fair wages, but when the Tariff was mider consideration, it was not so much a question of wages Sir WILLIAM LYNE I rise to a point of order. When I was speaking, sir, you ruled that my motion did not cover the question of new Protection, and I was not allowed to refer to it . That being «so, I wish to know whether the honourable member for Laanecoorie is entitled to discuss that policy. member is dealing with any question that the honourable member for Hume was not allowed to discuss, he is certainly out of order. I ask him to keep within the lines I have laid down. anomalies to which reference has been made to-day would not have been in existence but for votes given by honourable members like the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, whose sole consideration when the Tariff was before us seemed to be, not how the workers would be affected, but how the Chamber of Mines at Kalgoorlie would be affected by a proposed duty. There is another question that we are entitled to ask, and with which the honourable member for Hume may deal when he replies. We are entitled to know whether, when the honourable member was arranging for a Coalition consisting of the remnants of the Deakin Government ancl the Labour party, any agreement was made as to how Tariff anomalies should be dealt with by it . been finally dealt with. titled to ask whether an arrangement was made under which there was to be any action, either in the direction of perpetuating the principle of Protection, or with regard to the rectification of anomalies. It is not my desire to further occupy the time of the House, for I am anxious that we should reach a practical question, with which, I feel sure, we are all anxious to deal in a practical way. But, before I close, I should like to say that, instead of the milk-and-water, half-and-half, shandygaff proposal which the honourable member for Hume has placed on the notice-paper, and which has gone off like a faulty squib, I prefer to accept the. declaration made by the Minister Of Trade and Customs, and published in the presstion ? it.

Observing that the honourable member for Bass was voting, I went over to remind him of his pair. I was then informed by the honourable member for Riverina that the honourable member for Gippsland had instructed him to use that honourable member's vote as he thought fit. Under these instructions he had transferred the pair of the honourable member for Bass to the honourable member for Gippsland. This had the effect of leaving the honourable member for North Sydney unpaired. I may add that I did not make the pair j but the honourable member for North Sydney informed me, before leaving Melbourne, that he had paired with the honourable member for Gippsland, and that the pair would stand good for any division on any matter connected with Government proposals or business.

I am here to say that every act that placed before the country at Gympie. this Government can do to insure the carrying out of the principles of the Old-age. Pensions Act will be done. Whatever financial embarrassment we may meet with, that will be carried out to the letter. Once inaugurated, we shall be able, in the not far distant future perhaps, to give effect not only to the old-age pensions, but the invalid pensions as well. I am sorry I cannot tell you now that the invalid pensions will be brought in immediately. The honourable member then recognised that there were financial difficulties-""financia l embarrassments"" he called them-and he was able to tell the people that he intended to pay old-age pensions immediately, viz., from the ist July last. This was in March last, and the honourable member had nothing then to say about introducing invalid pensions at the present time. I go further, and say that if the honourable member were in my place now, he would not do so. Wide Bay used the word ""immediately,"" and that was last March. intended "" in v a l i d "" pensions to date from the ist July, would he not have been glad that date, so that both parts of the Act might come into operation at the same time ? have been able to find My object is to show that the honourable for a Dreadnought. member was not prepared for financial reasons to bring into force on ist July the invalid pensions which were already the law, and only required a proclamation, and certainly had no idea at that time of enlarging the scope of the old-age pensions to the extent of another £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. He anticipated then that he would have a deficit of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 on last year's transactions, but I am glad to say that he erred on the side of caution. Instead of having a deficit, he was able to place about £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 more to the old-age pensions trust fund If necessary. than had been included in the Estimates. Sir JOHN FORREST I have the The honourable member's ber's estimate, and a gain of £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 in special receipt that was never asked for from the States by any other Government. Sir JOHN FORREST I am not finding fault with the honourable member, because one cannot be absolutely accurate in an estimate. On the other hand, the actual expenditure was £ 6 4 , 2 1 5 less than the honourable member estimated that it would be, so that, altogether, the finances were, in round figures, £ 1 4 7 , 0 0 0 better than he anticipated at that time. By that means the £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 deficit which he anticipated was wiped out, and £ 4 7 , 0 0 0 odd could be placed to the old-age pensions trust account. In looking through the honourable member's Gympie speech, to ascertain what was in his mind at the time, I find that, although he dealt with the two or three months of the financial year then remaining, he made no intimation whatever of how the current year, 1909-10, when old-age pensions would have to ibe paid, was to be",44,Small Arms Factory

In addition to amounts voted, j£8o,ooo has already been advanced this year to the Department for absolutely necessary expenditure. The Department has asked for £220,000. It does not include any provision for bringing the telegraph and telephone services up to date. It has been estimated that ^1,800,000 would be required for this purpose. right honourable member in order in dealing with the financial position of the Commonwealth altogether beyond the particular subject now under discussion ? I do not want to stop him, but, if he is in order, others will also be in order in traversing the whole financial position. That would be an excellent thing, but we should know it. member is quite in order. He is trying to show from his stand-point the position of the finances in relation to the question now before the Committee. I take it that any other honourable member who desires to reply to him will have ample opportunity to do so. the ordinary expenditure on the Postal Department, and another £100,000, the honourable member for Wide Bav anticipated that .£1,800,000 would be required to bring the telegraphic and telephonic services up to date. There was also to be an additional [56] . expenditure of £1,150,000 on naval and military defence, and a number of other items, making the total additional expenditure £2,893,000. The honourable member went on to say that that did not include expenditure upon the Northern Territory, which might amount to £200,000 a year, or for the Trans-Australian railway, or for the Federal Capital. The honourable member apparently had a very great policy of expenditure, but he gave no clue as to how he would find the money. Although that large additional expenditure of close on £3,000,000 a year was contemplated by the honourable member, he did not enlighten us in any way as to how the money was to be found. Up to the end of June, when he left office, he had left no record of the manner in which he proposed to deal with the finances for the current year 1.909-10. I believe the honourable member when in estimated old-age pension's at office realized to the full the burden of responsibility that rested on him. He knew that there would be a difficulty in financing this year. He knew that it would be necessary to provide a large additional amount of money this year for the improvement of the postal and telegraphic services, to place the telephones upon a proper footing, and for old-age pensions. He knew that there would be a difficulty in finding the ways and means for those purposes. He therefore acted as we should desire any other man with a grave responsibility upon him to act. I commend the honourable member for his actions then, but I cannot commend his actions now. Knowing the difficulty of financing the affairs of this country during this year, he nevertheless proposes absolutely reckless propositions, asking first that we should provide another million pounds, and then proposing an amendment which the Treasury officials say will mean an additional burden of £400,000 a year. He does this, knowing full well all the time that he was Treasurer and Prime Minister that he was not able to make any statement as to when the provisions of the Act relating to invalids, whom every one wishes to assist, and whom many think are more deserving than any other section of the community, would be put into force. member took good care that he should not. orable member for Wide Bay had plenty of time to do it if he had wished.

I thank the Attorney-General for accepting my suggestion that those who have been twenty years in the Commonwealth and who are otherwise entitled to a pension shall receive one on the passing of this Bill. I hope that the Minister will withdraw from the untenable and humiliating position which he takes up in declaring that unless the Government get their own way in this matter they will drop the Bill. If they decide to drop the Bill, I hope that they will give up their portfolios, and allow the people and this House to deal with the matter as they think fit. [8.25] I trust that, in a matter involving such a big addition to the outlay caused by the Bill, the Committee will act reasonably. Since the inception of Federation, there has been a majority of honourable members in favour of old-age pensions. system when a motion was moved in the House. one of the matters to which Sir Edmund Barton gave prominence in his Maitland speech was the statement that, whenever the nnances admitted, a scheme of old-age pensions would be brought into force. piration of the Braddon clause. cally mentioned the expiration of the Braddon section. I am glad that the honourable member has made the interjection, because it will give point to my references to a few matters to which I wish to recall the recollection, rather than direct the attention, of honourable members. We have done something for the establishment of a system of old-age pensions before the expiration of the Braddon section. But although for more than eight years all of us, being equally affected by the humanitarian views dominant in modern politics, have recognised the expediency of old-age pensions, no definite step to establish a scheme was taken by a Ministry until a motion was moved by the honourable member for Wide Bay affirming the advisability of providing for, not invalid and old-age pensions, but old-age pensions only. Although the honourable member sometimes credits those opposed to him with being animated by Conservative desires, he will admit that there was no hypocrisy in the acquiescence with or spoken support given to that motion, and that we, as much as the members of the Labour party, recognise the claims of the masses to fair treatment. We recognise that it is the working classes, as a whole, who have sustained from time to time the greater part of the weight of the social edifice, and that, in the speculations and gambling of modern commerce, they share the risks, although they do not scoop the pool. We recognise these facts, perhapsas clearly as do some of those who more loudly prate of their humanitarianism, and more frequently make known their views. stated that unless lie obtained an arrangement with the States this Parliament could not provide for old-age pensions until after the expiration of the Braddon section. every honourable member until the Surplus Revenue Bill was proposed. In the dying v days of last session the honourable member for Wide Bay suddenly sprang a motion on the House affirming the desirableness of instituting a system of old-age pensions, -but he did not blind himself to the fact that special arrangements would have to be made with the States. Actuated by considerations of economy, he confined his proposal to old-age pensions. Mr J. H . CATTS -Why this "" stonewall ""? "" stone-wall."" Had honourable members",48,Small Arms Factory

If we acted as some honourable members suggest, we should all be physically qualified for invalid pensions, as some are already qualified mentally. In dealing with the question of finance, the honourable member for Wide Bay, replying to an interjection of the right honourable member for Swan, saidI presume the honourable gentleman is not acquainted with the trend of policy at the present moment, which indicates that the financial -arrangements of the States and the Commonwealth will be adjusted at a very early date. What was in his mind was the possibility of an arrangement with the States on the subject of finance. Such an arrangement has not yet been come to. out to us. ment has not yet been made, some honourable members have suddenly become impatient. For seven or eight years they were, content to await' the expiration of the Braddon section, but now they will not wait another year or so until we really get some arrangement with the States. The Braddon section will expire at the end of 1910, and even earlier than that we may know what for some time to come will be the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. wish to continue the Braddon section for another five years? stated. licly stated it. over again denied that. Syntax, split hairs as to the meaning of a particular paragraph in the statement of the Prime Minister of the Government programme. An extension of five years was not mentioned, though it was suggested that there might be an adjustment which would extend to five years as a period of experiment, before some final solution was come to. When the original Old-age Pensions Bill was under discussion, the honourable member for Wide Bay was most solicitous about the financial aspect. In his speech on the measure he said nothing about invalid pensions, or about reducing the age at which women should be eligible for pensions from sixty-five to sixty years,, a reduction which many women, no doubt, would be glad to have for the sake of a reputation of youthfulness. Then, in Committee, in speaking of clause r,'5, hepointed out the possibility of doing something by an arrangement with the States which would not dislocate their finances. The honourable member for North Sydney moved that the issue of the proclamation provided for should be subject to parliamentary resolution, and the honourable member for Wide Bay pointed out that there was no danger of the proclamation being issued even by a Ministry in extremis and desirous of kudos, until before the finances justified it. I do not know if he spoke prophetically, but he was aware that it would be safe to leave the matter, even in his own hands. Until he left this side of the chamber, he adhered to that 'sensible view of policy. He pointed out that what we were to do was to be done by an arrangement with the Stales. Again, replying to the right honourable member for Swan, he saidThe right honourable gentleman has furnished the best possible reason against making an alteration of the clause. If there is no dying Government, no danger can arise. There is an advantage in leaving the clause as it is, because at any moment after the B ill has become law the Premiers may rush to the Prime Minister and say that if the Commonwealth Government will put the law into operation, they will agree to subsidize the fund to the extent of the amounts which they are paying for old-age pensions. Throughout he depended for financial assistance-beyon d the appropriation of £750,000 under the Surplus Revenue Acton the co-operation of the States, and, therefore, did nothing in the matter while in office. Let me go a little further back. Honourable members will recollect that about four years ago there was a fusion, or alliance, between two parties who weie in agreement in regard to a very smail residuum of policy. It reminds me of Satan reproving sin to hear honourable members talk against the subordination of political opinions for the time with a view to a consensus on matters on which there is agreement, although such compromises are the basis of parliamentary government.

313,Mr Glynn,"I shall not, like Dr.twenty-seven or twenty-eight planks, in regard to seventeen of which they allowed the utmost latitude of opinion, depending on the comparatively small balance for the purpose of the fusion. It was part of the programme of the party which was then, and is still, influenced, or led by the honourable member for Wide Bay, that a system of old-age pensions should be instituted, when the opportunity offered, on a basis fair and equitable to the States, and to individuals. What did the reference to the States mean? Was there to be a system of old-age pensions based upon the corporate sovereignty of each State? What was meant was old age pensions for individuals on a basis which would be fair to the States financially,, and would recognise the just claims eight or nine weeks, and we have not yet of the individuals who were to get them. In the face of all these facts, is the attitude for the purpose of meeting those overof the Ministry to a proposal suddenly involving a large increase of expenditure at a time when we have to be fairly cautious in regard to the finances, and may for a while be cramped in meeting our ordinary obligations, right or wrong, even judging by the conduct of honourable members opposite ? I think that there can be no doubt as to the answer to that question. The Attorney-General has to-night afforded us a revelation of a trait in his character which has been concealed for many years. AlthoughI could not understand much of what he said, what I did understand was quite interesting. He must disabuse his mind of the supposition that the Committee is a court, and that he has to construe the words of the honourable member for Wide Bay in a sense which will suit the interests of his client. They must lie understood in connection with the circumstances under which they were uttered. The position is this: The Government declines to do a certain thing on the ground that the late Government was not prepared to do it. ment of honourable members opposite. The Attorney-General, when on the Opposition cross benches, said what he would do if he were a Minister. Now, being a Minister, he says, "" If you were here, you would do what I am dojng."" His reason for not doing what we wish to do is that the honourable member for Wide Bay was not in favour of it when the original Bill was before Parliament. The reason put forward by the Treasurer was that the honourable member did not mention the matter at"" Gympie, and evidently had it not in his mind. I do not know any one who less resembles a thought-reader than does the right honourable member for Swan. The tenure of office of the late Government depended on the support of a number of gentlemen on whom they could rely, .as we have seen, not at all securely. The present Treasurer said that we never had a majority, and had no business to be in office. What sort of financial schemecould be brought down by a Government with no majority? We now have a Ministry that we are told is, for the first time,, to establish responsible government by majority; but they have been in oflice some heard even an echo of a financial scheme, whelming difficulties of which we heard so much, although the Prime Minister' said that this was to be a financial session. We have been told that the Government have no money, and tliat they can get no money; and yet their first distinctive act was to offer a sum of £2,000,000 to Great Britain, while they say they cannot get sufficient for the purpose of old-age pensions. I do not know where the Government propose to get the £2,000,000; but to borrow for a defence policy is to make a departure from sound principles of finance on which no British Government would venture. We are told that in a fortnight or so there is to be a Premiers' Conference; and I assume that the financial! relations between the States and the Commonwealth will be considered, and, we hope, adjusted. Old-age pensions is not a newobligation, but one which has rested for years on the shoulders of, at any rate, some of the State Governments. Are we to understand that the State Governments are so mean as to allow the Commonwealth to relieve them of the old-age pension expenditure, and recoup us nothing?. If not, we shall get from the States sufficient to very well finance this scheme. The honourable member for Wide Bay was perfectly right in saying that an arrangement would be made; and, so far from disagreeing with him, the Government propose in a few weeks to have a conference with the State Governments for considering this very question, amongst others. If the late Government had been allowed to bringdown its financial policy we should have",50,Small Arms Factory

The Attorney-Genera] said that we ought to wait until the Braddon section expiresthat we should gain further experience for a few years, and, when we saw where we were, we might bring in old-age pensions to the extent that is now proposed. The honourable gentleman proposes that we should wait another five or seven years, and not do anything in the way of a permanent settlement of the matter. I admit that if I had to choose between this amendment and invalid pensions, I would prefer the invalid pensions. I want them both, for, like the right honourable member for Swan, I want everything I can get. If the right honourable member had to choose between granting this and going out of office, which would he do? That is my position. If I have to choose, I will take the invalid pensions. member would be able to tell the State Premiers, "" There is now this charge imposed upon the Commonwealth, and you must meet it . "" I venture to say they would meet it, and there would be no extra impost placed upon the Commonwealth Government. The Government are calling the Premiers together, for it is idle to say the State Premiers have called the Conference. The Premiers are coming at the suggestion of the Government to listen to what they iave to say. They know that if they cannot come to an agreement with this Government^ the worse will befall them; and, therefore, whatever the Government suggest to them, they will have to adopt. If , then, the Government say, "" We have to find the money for invalid pensions,"" the State Premiers will agree to it, and will find the money. The State of New South Wales already pays invalid pensions, and so, I believe, do Victoria and Queensland. In those circumstances, we cannot suppose that a resolute demand by the Prime Minister would not result in an arrangement between the States; because, after all, it would not be a new impost, three States having already incurred it. It will, therefore, make no difference to them to hand the money over to us to pay. If the principle is bad if we ought not to provide for invalids -le t us argue the question out on that basis.

The Government have come to a stage at which they must bring down some definite proposal. They cannot simply put forward this Bill and say, "" That is all we shall do, and if you do not like to take it, we shall throw it under the table."" That is the Treasurer's attitude at present. If the right honourable gentleman will only tell the Opposition that h'e proposes to deal with the matter in a fair spirit, with the means at his disposal-no t the present means, but the means which, having in view the relations between the States and the Commonwealth, are really at his disposal-w e shall be perfectly satisfied, because we know that he only has to take up a resolute attitude to get the money from the States. The people of this country will never sit down quietly under a position of this kind-that the GoThe right honourable vernment should find £2,000,000 for a Dreadnought, and refuse to find the money necessary for this purpose. It says very little for the right honourable member's responsible Government and his majority, that he takes up his present attitude merely because he is unable to get a majority of honourable members to his way of thinking. If he had a majority, he would not trouble to say two words to us. His pathetic appeal last night was by no means made to exhibit his public spirit. It was made to save his position. He knows that if he could ring the bell now, he would do so, ancl there would not be another word permitted from anybody; ' but he also knows that the numbers will not permit him to do it.

That is the age which the honourable member for Wide Bay is endeavouring to fix by this amendment. From the proclamation provision, which is -only the declaratory stage, to the mandatory stage, is a step which honourable members have now the power to take. I have a right to choose the present time to bring that provision into force. When I hear the cry of "" If the finances will permit,"" I would remind honourable members that from this out, not only in this Parliament, but in -the next, they will be met by that cry on all measures involving the expenditure of money. The excuse will be made time after time that ""financial embarrassment will ensue."" position in which we as a Commonwealth Parliament have placed ourselves. These are powers which the Commonwealth Parliament has to exercise, and the sooner we realize our position the better. The present Ministry, like the Fisher Ministry, desire to obtain the necessary revenue only out of ""Customs and Excise; but that is not the proper source from which to obtain the money to pay old-age pensions.

There an Old-age Pensions Act, costing about £ 7 , 0 00,00 0 per annum has been passed, and it is anticipated that it will cost £25,000,000 per annum before it is in f u l l working order. But do the British Government go to the' Customs and Excise Revenue for the money ? No. They have a special channel of taxation for that purpose. people are already paying taxation to the States. anything like the proportion which the people of the Old Country in similar circumstances are paying. The taxation processes of the Commonwealth are a growing quantity. Twenty years ago, the proportion of taxation per head of the population was very little; but the functions and This is all owing to the wretched powers of the Government were also little. To-day our powers are expanding. If we are not going to put invalid pensions into operation, let us take that part of it out of the Act. On matters of humanity, we cannot afford to fool. Do not leave the payment of pensions to invalids who desire relief, to the chance of a proclamation which might be issued next week, or, on the other hand, might be issued forty years hence. It will be far better to strike out that part of the Act, if there is no intention to put it into force. This very The honourable member for Government, in their principal Act, were responsible for the declaratory part; but they now refuse to adopt the mandatory part. If they plead that financial emba^ rassment will ensue, I reply that old-age pensions, as well as defence expenditure, must distinctly come from direct taxation. The honourable member for West Sydney put forward^ as a party view, the solution that his Government when in power were prepared to impose a land tax; but that tax of theirs, so far as revenue is concerned, was as humbugging as the declaratory section of the Act in this case; because, with the large exemption proposed, the necessary revenue could not be obtained. If I may use the honourable member for West Sydney as an illustration, he is looked upon as It is monstrous to allow such a a landed proprietor. He is a cute little chap, keen and business-like; but I put it to him that the land values taxation proposed by his Government would not have provided the revenue necessary for this purpose.

326,Mr Wilks,"They are not paying-regard to the sentiment and justice of the question, sixty-five years is at any time too advanced an age at which to bring the women of Australia under old-age pension provisions. We do not need statistics to prove that. Our own powers of observation show that the male at seventy is, as a rule, more capable and energetic than the female at sixty-five. If we are going to bring the pensions into operation for women, let us not do it on the day when the undertaker puts his hand on the individual-the day when the recipient will have to be taken away to the cemetery. Let us extend the pension at some period when it will ance in her declining years. This is a humane measure. A few years back, those who advocated old-age pensions were regarded as undermining the responsibility and fibre of the individual; but that day has gone by. We have this paternal work to do; and, on behalf of the women of Australia, who come from ""the broad mass of the working classes,"" I say that we all know from experience that the wife of the worker at the age of sixty is, unfortunately, in 999 cases out of a thousand, an exhausted being. The struggle for existence in Australia for the industrial classes is so keen, their labour is so intermittent, they are so little able to save for a rainy day, that sixty has become an age at which working women are no longer able to compete successfully in the battle of life. It is a matter of indifference to me whether the Deakin Fusion Government or the Fisher Government have charge of the measure. AH I am concerned with is to give the relief to those who should have it, not when it is too late, but when they can have at least five years' enjoyment of it. To any man the idea of his mother being compelled to receive the pension is a pitiful one; but if a man's wife or mother must put forward her hand to receive it, let her receive it at sixty and not at sixty-five. Defence proposals will very soon be brought forward involving large sums of money, and why should we palter with the financial question at the very threshold? Australia, whether she likes it or not, will have to plunge into a large expenditure of money, and amongst her very first needs is a complete system of old-age pensions. But let us not go to Customs and Excise for the whole of the revenue. The Attorney-General spoke of some arrangement being made with the States, and of the expiry of the operation of the Mr Wilis. Braddon Blot. Let that be provided for ira the Bill. I am sure that the Premiers of the States will not refuse to come to some arrangement for providing the necessary funds. No waste of money is involved. These pensions are to be paid to peoplewho have done their duty as citizens, and have helped to develop the country from which the wealthy have derived their riches. Those to wfiom pensions are to be paid have not been wholly unmindful of economy. In many cases it has been impossible for them to practise what is knowrn as thrift. I know of men deeply attached to their families who receive only 39s. per give her some little assistweek. With such a wage is there any room for saving? Surely the wives and mothersof such men, who have borne the heat and burden of the day, should not be expected to wait until they reach the age of sixty-five years for a pension from the Commonwealth. Apart altogether from anv question of sentiment, the justice of this proposal must commend itself to the Com. mittee. It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Wide Bay should have toresort to the tactical method of moving the omission of certain words in order to acnieve the objecthe has in view. An appeal was made to us yesterday to take up a dignified stand, and to be guided by the rules and .forms of the House of CommonsSurely, Mr Chairman, in such circumstances the statement which you made yesterday that, owing to the slovenly way ir* which the Bill had been drafted, you could not give a ruling on a point of order that had been raised, ought to have been sufficient to induce the Treasurer to withdraw the Bill, and to re-introduce it in an intelligible form. Your observation was a striking commentary on the way in which business is being conducted. I find myself compelled to vote for a round-about amend"" ment-a n amendment which, to use anAmericanism, is designed to ""whip thedevil round the stump""-in order that we may provide that pensions shall be payableto women on reaching the age of sixty years. I cannot understand why those who are in favour of the principle of old-age pensions should stop at the hurdle of £1,200,000. Surely we can afford to pay legitimate old-age pensions? If the proposal were to reduce to forty years, the ageat which pensions shall be payable, I should not support it, but, having regard to the hard struggle for life and the strenuous battle that many women have to wage, surely sixty years is not too' low an age to fix. Many wome;i never get beyond that -age.

When the next Premiers' Conference meets, I hope that the representatives of the Commonwealth Government, if they attend it, will remind the State Treasurers, should they make any complaints, of the enormous increases in State expenditure since Federation. Some time ago I presented a statement of the details to the House. Of course, the amounts have since increased, ancl I believe that to-day the State Governments are spending over £4,ooo',ooo per annum more than they were spending before Federation, notwithstanding that the Commonwealth has taken over the very expensive Defence Department, from which no revenue is obtained, the Department of the Postmaster-General, on which there is a loss, and other Departments. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The honourable member is a long way from the amendment. only following the example of honourable members who preceded me. I refer to these matters to emphasize the claim of . the Commonwealth to be reimbursed by the States for its expenditure on okl-age pensions. I hope that the amendment will be agreed to, and thai our legislation will be so perfected that there will be very few, if any, deserving cases in Australia unrelieved by this humanitarian law. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [9.27]. I the discussion had it not been for the extraordinary argument of the honourable member for West Sydney. The Leader of the Opposition holds a position which, like that of a Minister, is not without great responsibilities, and in addition it must be remembered that he occupied the position of Treasurer in the Government immediately preceding that now in power. His attitude in respect to this matter, therefore, having regard to his past dealing with those whom he. was addressactions and words,.cannot be looked upon as quite sincere. I think that we are entitled to conclude that it never entered his mind when Prime Minister, or that of any of his colleagues, to bring forward the proposition which he is now trying to force upon his successors. But by a rather adroit twist of a phrase in the Gympie speech he. has endeavoured to convey the idea that something of this kind was in his mind. Mr W. H . IRVINE I shall quote his exact words, so that honourable members may judge whether my criticism is fair or not. Speaking of the Invalid and Ola-age Pensions Act, he said in that speech thatWhatever financial embarrassment we may meet with, that will be carried out to the letter. Once inaugurated we shall be able, in the not far distant future, to give effect, not only to the old-age pensions, but to the invalid pensions as well. At the time there were two courses which he could follow. He had power fo bring the invalid pension system into operation by proclamation immediately, and, by similar proclamation, he could have done what he is now seeking to force his successors to do. But while he then referred to the ultimate possibility of paying invalid pensions, he did not refer to the possibility that the age at which women would be qualified for pensions might be reduced. pensions he used the word "" immediate."" Mr W. H . IRVINE I have read what he said. He spoke of giving effect ""in the not far distant future,"" not only to old age pensions, but to invalid pensions as well. * night. Mr W. H . IRVINE -No. He said tonight that he would not ask the Committee to institute invalid pensions at the present time. If the thoughts of persons are to be judged by what they say, I ask why did the honourable member refer to invalid penshould not have intervened in sions in his great policy speech, and not say anything about the reduction of age? Now he desires it to be understood that it was in his mind, and in that of his colleagues. on the point. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The Treasurer asked him whether it was in his mind, and he made no reply. I understand that it was not. If he was frankly and fairly ing at Gympie, it was not in his mind. That is to be seen by a subsequent passage. Speaking of future expenditure, he sets out that upon old-age pensions as £1,750,000. Any one reading the speech must conclude that that was his estimate of the expenditure under the administration of the Act, without amendments. old-age pensions, taking no account of invalid persons.

Mr W. IH . IRVINE Then, in the speech of the Governor General, the formal statement of the intentions of the Fisher Government, we find a short statement as to the administration of the Invalid ancl Old-age Pensions Act, without any indication of an intention to bring in an amending measure. It must be remembered that at the time the honourable member for Wide Bay had the power to do what he now professes his desire to do. The Act vests in the Government of the day the power by proclamation, without parliamentary action, to do what he asks the Committee to do by legislation. brings me to the extraordinary argument of the honourable member for West Sydney. Coming from the legal and trusted adviser of the late Prime Minister, it is one»of the most amazing that I have ever heard put forward in support of a position such as that taken up by him. I feel sure that his leader must have shuddered when he heard it. The honourable member for West Sydney said that the Fisher Government did not issue a proclamation because it was dependent on the support of a section on which it could not rely in this particular matter. of the sort. Mr W. H . IRVINE. -The honourable member said that the fact that the Government was supported by a certain section, meaning those who were not members of the Labour partu, rendered it impossible to do this by proclamation. that there were two reasons why we did not bring down a scheme embodying the whole of our policy, the shortness of the session, and the uncertaintv of our majority. Mr W. H . IRVINE accept the honourable member's statement. He admits that one of the reasons why the late Government did not bring down its financial proposals was the uncertainty of its majority. He desires it to be understood that,' had it done so, those financial proposals would have included the proposition which his leader made last night. Then what is the position of the late Government? Although its Ministers had in their minds the reduction of the age at which women could claim old-age pensions, that was not stated among their financial proposals. For what reason? proputting upon my remarks a meaning which does not properly apply to them. I am T h a t is so. sure that he does not wish to do so. Mr W. H . IRVINE I certainly do not. If I understand the honourable' member, he alleged as one of the reasons why the alteration now pressed by the honourable member for Wide Bay was not put forward by the F'isher Government that it could Be brought forward only in connection with its financial proposals, and that they were not laid before us for two reasons, one being the uncertainty of the Government's majority. nothing followed, so far as old-age penThis sions are concerned. What was said at the Hobart Conference was that we required £ 6 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 before we could finance this business. Mr W. H . IRVINE In the collocation in which the honourable member's statement comes, it can only relate to this debate in the way which I say, namely, that effect could not be given to old-age pensions, including lowering the qualifying age of women, because, amongst other reasons, they had an uncertain majority. thing. Mr W. H . IRVINE I take it at I did not say anything that; and I venture to say that a more complete confession of Ministerial ineptitude, arising from the most unworthy motives, was never made in a representative House. Here is a proposal which is now claimed upon all the dictates of humanity to be necessary, and which the honourable member and his leader say-becaus e they are not sincere unless they do say it-is practicable anil desirable, having regard to the existing finances of the country, which also could have been done by them by Ministerial Act, and was not done. Why? BeI am bound to cause they thought that if they did it, the majority would not permit them to continue in office. Mr. HUGHES -That is absolutely incorrect. Mr W. H .

What he said was that the attitude of the late Government, in regard to tiiis, amongst other parts of their policx, was due to the fact that they could not bring forward the necessary financial statement by reason of the uncertainty of their majority. Having regard to the particular matter of which the honourable member was speaking, I maintain that what he said amounts to a confession that, although they had the power, with or without bringing forward a financial statemait. to do this thing which they now claim is demanded by every dictate of humanity, they did not do it , because, amongst other reasons, they were not certain of tlieir majority. vernment did not do it, is it never to be done ? Mr W. H . IRVINE question; we are now to judge the proposal on its merits. Mr W. H . IRVINE pears to the honourable l>e a waste of time when criticism comes from this side. I am not going to take up the time of the Committee longer, except to say that it would be a great deal better if members of the Opposition, especially those who have held high office, were to extend to those who succeed them in those onerous and responsible obligations a little more consideration than is shown in I have accepted the speeches we have heard to-night. I admit that the late Government had not a very long term of office, but it was long enough for them to engage in all ordinary administrative acts. If the late Government had, during all those months, considered this matter at all, and had thought it desirable, in the interests of humanity, to take the step now advocated, they ought not to have allowed any consideration of parliamentary majorities to interfere with their determination. They were invested with a. trust and the power; and the fact that they did not take the step does not W ill the honourable necessarily mean that it is not a proper step to be taken, although it certainly ought to I withdraw any imputashut their mouths to the kind of argument we have listened to to-night. planation, I sliould like to say a few words.

At Gympie, the honourable member explained that he hoped to bring in a measure in the not too-distant future-that lie could have brought it in immediately if he had had the money, because it could be done by proclamation.

It was, therefore, all guess-work as to what amount of liability would be incurred by the Commonwealth in passing the Act, and I take it that we intended to postpone the bringing into operation of the sections relating to women at sixty, and to invalid until we were able to ascertain exactly where we stood financially, and what further provision it would be necessary to make to meet them. four weeks of the main-Act coming into operation, and before we have any idea of the amount of money that will have to be provided, to ask us to give effect to either of the other two provisions.

Apparently the Government do not anticipate any difficulty in finding money for that purpose. I do not object to encouragement being extended to the inventors of airships, but I am certainly opposed to money being expended on matters of no immediate urgency, when our aged citizens are in need. Apparently the Ministry have plenty of money to provide for airships and the presentation of a Dreadnought, but no money to enable poor women who have reached the age of sixty years to draw a Commonwealth pension.

The Government have threatened that, if these humane proposals be embodied in the Bill, they will throw it aside.

I could cite the cases of 1 h a v e some persons who chanced to be bedridden. The Stipendiary Magistrates, who are men in good positions, had not time to go to their homes, and so those persons experienced considerable difficulty in completing the papers.

When the original measure was before the House, I sought to strike out the provision excluding Asiatics, so long as they were otherwise qualified. At that time. I spoke to a very thin House at the close of the session, and I should like to try again to induce honourable members to support my idea. In the matter of old-age pensions, this Parliament has no desire to consider any question of race, colour, or creed. We give pensions because persons are in need, and being British-born or naturalized British subjects, have lived in the country for twenty-five years and paid taxes; and, to my mind, it is a distinct blot on the Act to erect a barrier of this kind simply on account of nationality. to aboriginals? absolutely impracticable. try from them. up to them in another way. It is not a reasonable or rational policy to bar any aged poor person, who is reputable, and otherwise qualified, solely because he happened to be born on the wrong side of the Bosp'horus. Ever since I have been in an Australian Parliament I have always held the view that, while we may maintain the White Australia policy in its fullest sense, we ought to treat with perfect equality those aliens whom we have allowed to come in and to be naturalized. We do not feel degraded because we get our religion from Asia; and it seems to be going rather too far to bar an Asiatic because of his birth-place. I ask the Attorney General whether it is not a fact that, under the section as it stands, Asiatics, although they may have become naturalized, cannot have the benefit of the Act? only that Asiatics, who have become naturalized, shall become entitled to a pension ; and I move That the following words be inserted after the word "" by,"" line 2 :-* ' the omission of -the words in sub-section (1) (c) ' Asiatics, except those born in Australia, o r . ' "" Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [10.51] I object on racial grounds to Asiatics coming here, but when we have admitted them, compelled them to pay taxes, I think it would be most unfair and unChristian to deprive them, if naturalized subjects, of old-age pensions. The scientific basis of old-age pensions is really that of compulsory insurance, seeing that all participants must have paid taxes for many years; and to bar naturalized Asiatics would be rather a mean action for a nation like Australia. To include these persons cannot mean a very large charge on the Treasury, because none are admitted now, and the claimants must have arrived here many years ago, many of them doubtless paying heavy fees on admission. [10.54] -The question of admitting Asiatics to the full privileges of the Old-age Pensions Act is one which would appeal to every honourable member if the pension system were made more comprehensive. But, seeing tliat invalids are not to receive pensions, for the reason that we have not themoney, and, knowing, as we do, that theAsiatic standard of living is much below our own, we should not be justified in giving Asiatics the full benefits of a measureso restricted in its operation regarding our own people. I hold that every Asiatic whohas been naturalized should be permitted' to participate in the advantages conferred by this Bill, but we have not the fundswith which to permit of that being done. I would just as soon vote in favour of granting pensions to invalids as I would support the granting Of them to old men. Thequestion is merely one of finance, inasmuch as we have not the money with which to pay invalid pensions, we should not bejustified in granting pensions to Asiaticswho may have lived in Australia for a lifetime, but who have certainly lived under a-, lower standard of comfort/ Consequently I cannot support the amendment of the honorable member for Boothby. ber support the granting of pensions to invalids ? jection to do so as soon as we"" have thenecessary funds at our command.

But it seems to me that the Government wish to liberalize the provision relating to naturalization quite as much as can be expected. They propose to make it possible for any person who is not now naturalized to become eligible to receive a pension from the ist January next. To my mind that is straining liberality to the breaking point. I contend that any person who has lived here for twenty years, who has not thought it necessary to assume the f u l l duties of citizenship, and who does so now only to secure an old-age pension, is deserving of very scant consideration at our hands. .L am sorry that I cannot support the proposal which has been outlined by the honourable member for Boothby. It must be recollected that there are a .great' number of Asiatics in the Commonwealth who can never become eligible to receive a pension, unless the Naturalization Act be amended. To enable a few of these Asiatics to qualify for an old-age pension would only excite a large amount of disaffection amongst their brethren who cannot so qualify. I -can readily imagine one of the disaffected saying, "" Here is a man receiving an old age pension. I am as old as he is, and have been resident in Australia for a longer period. Why should I not get a pension?"" The honourable member for Cook argued that, because Asiatics have been admitted to the f u l l rights of cit'zenship, they ought to 'be treated just as liberally as is anybody else. But I would point out to him that very few Asiatics have been admitted to the rights of citizenship. In my own State there are none who have been so admitted. 'There, we even decline to allow them a vote. 'Consequently, the honourable member's argument in that connection was quite worthless. I am' sorry that I cannot support the -proposal outlined by the honourable member for Boothby, because I am entirely opposed to the principle which it embodies. support the amendment of the honourable member for Boothby. I do not consider that any citizen of Australia should lose any rights that he has had under State law. We have conserved fo the civil servants their rights, but under this BiH we are trying apparently to deprive some citizens who happen to be Asiatics of privileges to which they are justly entitled. That seems an unjust thing to do. The honourable member for Robertson has said that the real objection to my amendment is a financial one. The chances are, however, that it would not involve an expenditure of more than a few pounds per annum. The greater part of the Asiatics in this country are not now naturalized. Therefore, they cannot participate in the advantages conferred by this legislation. WhatI object to is putting within the four corners of an Act of Parliament a barrier on account of nationality. of Parliament. for special purposes. In .some .of the States, however, all naturalized persons have the right to vote. My objection to the Bill as drafted is that those who are citizens of Australia, and are otherwise qualified* to comply with the conditions laid down-person s against whom nothing.can be urged whatever-ough t not to be deprived of old-age pensions on the ground of nationality. Surely this Parliament ought to be above mere race prejudice? I challenge any one to justify debarring a man from receiving an old-age pension merely because he happened to be born in Asia. It is humbugging the question to saythat there is an objection to my amendment on financial grounds. As to the standard of comfort, to whicli the honourable member for Roberston has referred, he knows very well that it varies even amongst Asiatics.

The barrier against naturalizing Asiatics has been imposed in its proper place, under the Naturalization Act.

[11.1.1] -There is a great deal of force in what the honourable member for Boothby has said. persons would be affected by his amendment, because there is a provision in the Naturalization Act of 1901 which debars natives of Asia from naturalization. Of course, those born in India, which is in the British Dominions, are British subjects, but Asiatics not born in India are not capable of naturalization in this country. The subject was raised on a previous occasion, and some members of the present Government then urged the view now taken by the honourable member for Boothby.

However, this provision will make assurance doubly sure. I do not think that a man or woman who, after living in Australia for twenty years, goes to Germany or some other foreign place, and lives there for a similar period, should be entitled to a pension; but it seems to me that the amendment will empower such persons to obtain such pensions.

I think it was only for want of time that more consideration was not given to the suggestion that that disability should be removed. honourable member for Hume is mistaken as to the effect of the amendment. All it does is to allow residence in New Guinea, or any other dependency of the Commonwealth, to count as residence on the mainland. You, Mr Chairman, know that many persons have gone from your constituency and that which I represent to open up New Guinea.

Persons who have lived all their lives in a Territory will not be eligible. that that is fair. Persons born in Papua of British parents should be entitled to pensions on meeting with severe accidents, just as they would be entitled had they been born on the mainland.

It is not quite fair to treat any white persons in Papua differently from persons on the mainland in this regard. I understand that some white persons whose ages range from seven to fifteen years are living in the Territory. Suppose that they become ill and cross to. Queensland at any time, why should they not enjoy the same conditions as are extended to other persons in Queensland ? Sir JOHN those cases. Sir WILLIAM LYNE cases of those pejrsons who went from Australia to Papua, but not the cases of those who were born in the Territory. The time is not far distant when the Commonwealth will have to provide a considerable sum for the development of Papua by means of railways, roads, and works of various kinds. When we undertake that obligation it will be nonsense to talk about dividing the money raised there and on the mainland. Again, the Northern Territory of South Australia when transferred to the Commonwealth will be a Territory ancl not a State. Probably we will acquire the control of other islands, for instance, the New Hebrides. residents of all Territories ought to be treated, as nearly as possible, in the same way as the residents of the Commonwealth. I ask the Attorney-General to look into the matter. Flinders Island there is a number of half castes who were born there and live practically under the same conditions as the white residents, and who, I think, are entitled to the same privileges as the residents of Australia. I desire to know from the Attorney-General whether those half castes are covered by these clauses. -My first idea was to ask the Committee to adopt the policy which the honourable member for Robertson advocated just now, and that is, that our Territories, particularly Papua, should lie considered as part of the Commonwealth. But I admit that what I mainly wanted to achieve is met by the provision which the Attorney-General has drafted. As regards white persons who are born in Papua and remain there for twenty-five years, the Legislative CounI t is a matter about fifty cil can always pass an ordinance on their behalf, though we might have to find the I want money for the pensions, if we allowed the ordinance. It will be remembered that the domestic legislation of Great Britain did not extend to Australia, nor do I see that it is essential that our legislation should apply to Papua. All we ask is that the residence of white Australians in Papua for a number of years shall not invalidate their claim to a pension on their return to the mainland. The Attorney-General has met that position, and I do not think it is necessary to go any further; the proposal meets the representations made to me when It covers the I desire to ascertain from the Attorney General the position of Lord Howe Island. South Wales. Commonwealth so far as representation in this House is concerned'. This is rather an important point, because it is inhabited by a number of old persons who, I think, should be included in the provisions of this measure. a.m.] -The honourable member for Boothby omitted to say that a Papua ordinance can have no effect upon the finances of Australia until it has been allowed by the The white Governor General in Council. Suppose the Legislative Council of the Territory were to pass an ordinance to the effect that its white residents should enjoy the f u l l privileges, of citizens of the Commonwealth under this measure. It would certainly be disallowed if the present Government were in office. Possibly when the white residents of the Territory represented to the late Minister of External Affairs .that they wished to participate in all the privileges granted in the Old-age Pensions Act of this Parliament, they were not familiar with the part dealing with invalid pensions. Suppose that any persons born of white parents in Australia were to live in the Territory for sixteen years and then become invalids. Eveni f the Government proclaimed that part of the Act those persons could not participate in the benefits it confers. In my opinion, it is incumbent upon the Government to see that the children of Australian citizens shall, on their return from Papua, be entitled to participate in those benefits, because the passing of an ordinance by the Legislative Council could not confer upon them the",72,Paibs

[12.Z0 a.m.] -The amendment of the Attorney-General declares that persons born in Australia, who may reside for a period in twenty years, be compelled to come to the Papua, and who afterwards return to the Commonwealth, shall be eligible to receive a pension.

His residence in Australia would not be destroyed by absence in Papua might be paid in Papua? reasonable thing. I presume that the same rule would apply to persons resident in Australia who had been absent for a period in Norfolk Island. ment which I made just now. At this late hour one's intellect is probably a little clouded, and that explains my error. A man must be resident in Australia on the date of making his claim for a pension so that he would have to return from Papua or Norfolk Island to make it, who have grown old in Norfolk Island, men who were born there, who have traded with us all their lives, who have identified themselves with Australia in every way, and yet they will be debarred from receiving a pension. Is the Attorney-General prepared to enlarge the scope of his amendment so as to make it include those persons as well as residents of Papua, among those who would be eligible to receive a pension under the provisions relating to invalid pensions [12.25 a.m.] I do not understand the full scope of the amendment. Let us assume that a person has been resident in Australia for fifteen years, at the end of which period he permanently settles in Papua. At the end of five years, had he remained in Australia he would be entitled to receive a pension. Will he not be eligible to receive that pension under the circumstances which I have outlined ? he can claim it. like the scope of the amendment to be extended. Why should a man who has been a resident of Australian territory for mainland to draw his pension, if he prefers to reside in Papua or Norfolk Island? It ought not to make the slightest difference to us in what part of our Territory he resides. I am entirely in agreement with the honourable member for Robertson in thinking that an old-age pensioner should be permitted to reside where he pleases.

Suppose that the owner of a house wished to enlarge his property, and that his architect said to him, like a silly as, "" We shall have to pull down the whole building^ and start afresh."" That is similar to the position to which we are now reduced. If any of our Australian people choose to live at Papua or Thursday Island, why should we seek to debar them by providing that they can draw an old-age pension only if they make the claim on the mainland? A resident in Australian territory should enjoy the rights of Commonwealth citizenship. I would even extend the benefits of this_ measure to Australian citizens who, for any reason, might prefer to live in New Zealand. Indeed, I should r>e favorable to a leciprocal understanding with Great Britain. If an English old age pensioner chose to come to Australia, why should not Great Britain pay his pension here"", and why should we not have as:imilar_ arrangement to pay the pensions of Australian citizens in Great Britain? If the honourable member for Hindmarsh moves an amendment in that direction, and pushes it to a division, I shall vote with him. It appears to me that what is necessary is a short amendment providing that, for the purposes of this measure, the Territories of the Commonwealth shall be counted as part of the Commonwealth. Certainly, Papua is under the control of the Commonwealth Government. TVe ought to be able to pay old-age pensions to Australian citizens residing there, just as easily as we pay them to citizens actually resident in Australia. Norfolk Island will soon be under Commonwealth control also. The residents of the Island should be treated exactly in the same way. I earnestly trust that, for the purposes of this measure, all our Territories will be treated as part of the Commonwealth. No very great number of pensions would be involved. If it were possible to take the course I have suggested, that would meet the whole case. I should like to hear the Attorney-General on the matter. ral) [12.35 a.m.] I should not like to deal now with the suggestions which have been made, because they may involve more than some honourable members think. I take the case put by the honorI t seems strange that an able member for Hindmarsh, of a man who, after residing fifteen years in Australia, resides for five years in a Territory. It is proposed that he should be entitled to a pension at the expense of the Commonwealth. There might be a good deal of reason in that, if , in an exceptional case, such a man wished to remain for the rest of his life in the Territory. But I ask honourable members to consider the case of a man who resides for one year in the Commonwealth, and nineteen years in the Territory. They will admit that we could not deal with both cases in the same provision. I ask that these matters should be left in abeyance for the present, and I may be able to submit a carefully framed clause, to cover something more than is at present proposed, by way of amendment.

Surely those who are now members would like to give full effect to the beneficent measure on the statute-book. I hope that the Committee will treat the amendment as a non-party one.

That was in March; and his words, therefore, have no meaning, if we are to take them literally, seeing that the Pensions Bill was not to operate for at least three months after the date of the speech. tion earlier by proclamation. member intended to make a distinction between the invalid portion and the general portion of the Act? the fact to be faced that the honourable member meant at that time, not the introduction of invalid pensions immediately, but their introduction at some period subsequent to the date at which the general portion of the Act should begin to operate. I take it that the honourable member had in his mind some proposal to increase the financial resources of the Government. bers who know what I had in my mind; and an amendment of the Act was mentioned in the Governor's speech. tion I find in the Governor General's speech is in paragraph 5, as follows:Notwithstanding these decreases in revenue, by careful economy in administration, a larger sum than the amount estimated has been placed to the trust fund to pay old-age pensions.

Since the Gympie speech was delivered ""spring"" in the revenue which would justify these new enterprises which the honourable member for Wide Bay himself declared at Gympie were from a financial stand-point impracticable. almost apologized to his sympathizers, because he could not immediately bring the invalid pensions What has happened since to alter the situation from a financial point of view? We have not the money with which to pay these invalid pensions, and we say so frankly. The honourable member says that he could finance them, but he has not suggested where the money canbe found. All that we can get from him is a reference to the precious Land TaxB ill which duced. anything about the Australia knows that all those values have to be assessed before a penny of tax can be levied upon them. Under these circumstances anybody who will argue that within the next twelve months we can get a penny of taxation from that source is simply playing fast and loose with the facts of the situation.

They know that what I say is corus in launching out into rect, and, therefore, it is just as well to speak plainly. In the House of Commons, on his shoulders of financing the measure The honourable member which he was introducing, was compelled to waive all these proposals aside. He did waive them resolutely aside, and put into operation. the Bill through in the form in which he originally intended it should go through. We have, to accept the same responsibility in connection with this measure. We say that we have not the money with which to finance the additions to the Bill which my honourable friends suggest.

Had we not better get this measure in proper working order before proceeding to load it? I would remind my honourable friends that there are two ways of killing a measure. One is by overloading it, and the other by mutilating it. They are taking the former of these courses, which may be just as fatal to the smooth working of the Act as if they turned upon it and rent it.

I am answering the contention of the honourable member's colleague that nothing new or additional is being attempted by our Act.. infinitely more generous than are those contained in any State measure of the kind. In New South Wales the amount payable under this heading will be increased from £510,000 to more than £600,000. Victoria there will be an increase of considerably more than a hundred per cent, in the total amount payable. The same thing will happen, to a lesser extent, in Queensland. So that there is a very substantial increase in the amount which will be payable under the Act as it stands, as compared with the amount which was previously paid by the States. I shall not be surprised if , when the measure is in working order, the total disbursements amount to close upon £2,000,000. Indeed, I shall not be surprised if they exceed £2,000,000 after it has been operative a little time. Therefore, I ask whether we had not better get the measure into working order, with a. view to. seeing if it develops any defects before proceeding either to overload or mutilate it? I venture to say that all friends of the Act will take that view. In doing so, they will be better friends of the measure than they would be if they started either to maul it out of recognition or to overload it. Legislative Council argument. the precise argument that was advanced by the gentleman whom honourable members opposite are always alluding to as a great Radical Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain. He waved aside all the proposals of the Labour members in the House of Commons, and asked the House, in the interests of the aged poor, to help him through with his measure, as it was framed by the Government. The responsibility of financing the Act must rest with the Government, and it is in shouldering that responsibility, as we undoubtedly must do, that the Government ask the House to wait for better times and more favorable circumstances before making the large increase in expenditure which the amendment contemplates. have been engaged upon this Bill since about 8 o'clock last evening, and, judging by the arguments used by Ministers, and especially by the Treasurer, the only case they have, is that some other Government did or did not do such and such a thing. I say that its provisions are Surely the Ministry is not so destitute of ideas of its own that Ministers have to fall back upon what some other Government was going to do. There is a very good reason why we should take the full reIn sponsibility, and should provide for invalid pensions at once. Surely, Ministers do not mean to say that provision was made for invalid pensions in the original Act simply for political purposes, and as a placard. If the intention was that the provision should be a reality, I venture to say that this is the proper time to put our intention into operation. means. to meet the State Premiers in a week or two.

I say that we should regular old provide for invalid pensions in this Bill. If that is not to be done, let us remove the sections relating to the subject from the original Act, and get rid of all hypocrisy. Honourable members opposite who have spoken in the constituencies on this subject have taken credit for what the Act provides. They have emphasized the fact that it deals with more than old-age pensions. They have claimed that it proposes to grant invalid pensions.

I hope that Ministers will give the State Premiers clearly to understand what Commonwealth obligations really involve, and, if they do, I believe that the Premiers will be willing to forego so much of their share of the Customs and Excise revenue as will enable us to pay the invalid pensions, and to meet our other financial obligations. should not have risen but for some remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition. When the Prime Minister stated that the Government desired to get on with the Old age Pensions Bill, the Leader of the Opposition said that they were responsible for the delay in passing it, and that if his Gotion of embarrassing the Ministry. vernment had remained in power the Bill would have been passed. Are we to understand that the Bill which I have in my hand is the measure to which the honourable member referred? If so, let me say that there is not a single line in it providing for the proclamation of the date for the payment of invalid pensions, or for reducing the age qualification for old-age pensions. On Monday last, I waited on the Treasurer in connection with the payment of invalid pensions. I asked the right honoraction. able gentleman what was the estimated cost involved. He told me that there were no figures in the Department showing what the cost would be, and that no inquiries had been made on the subject. So far as s he could learn, the late Treasurer had done nothing towards making provision for the payment of invalid pensions. The right honourable gentleman went further, and said that he believed that invalid pensions should be paid, and would set about inquiries at once to discover what the cost would be, in order that he might be in a position to state, in delivering his Budget, when it would be possible to pay them. I say that it was a definite course to pursue. The Leader of the Opposition says that it was the intention of the Labour Administration to pay invalid pensions at some distant date. honourable gentleman knows full well that the financial position was such that he would have been unable to pay invalid pensions. But, in order that he might retain his position on the Treasury bench, he hesitated', though he had an opportunity to do so, to say when invalid pensions would be paid. The pension which should be paiil before all others is the invalid pension. I have come to the conclusion that the proposals for the reduction of the age qualification, and for the payment of invalid pensions, which have been submitted from the other side, have been put forward with the object of embarrassing the Ministry. member's excuse for not voting for them? of the age, and I am prepared to support a proposal for the payment of invalid pensions on the ist of January.

The honourable member for Batman has just said that he went to the Treasurer and asked him about certain things, that the Treasurer told him about them, and further stated that no estimateshad been made, and that it was his intention to do so and so.

As regards the honourable member for Batman's statement that he has ascertained from the Treasurer what he intends to do, that information would have come a great deal better from the Treasurer in this Chamber, when he was asked to explain the Government policy, instead of being told to the House in a roundabout conversation which took place when the honourable member for Batman interviewed the Treasurer and informed him that he was in favour of this enlightened proposal. The honourable member apparently was able by his eloquence to induce trie Treasurer to open his heart and reveal his intention to do this, and to do it much earlier than the late Government would have done it if they had remained in office. The sympathies of the Government have been moved in that direction in accordance with the brilliant idea, expressed by the honourable member for Batman. the honourable member as I said in the House. member for Batman credit for voting as 0 It only proves that he believes.

In his last sentences he said, "" L e t us not They get their estimates very attempt to get too much in this B ill . Let us not go to extremes, ancl so endanger the position that we already hold.

When can The Treasurer Ave hope to get better financial times in Australia than the present? When are we likely to have another run of seasons such as we have had during the last few years? When will the financial resources of the people be stronger? We cannot hope for a very great improvement in that direction. If we strike some bad years, when it will be difficult to raise the necessary taxation for this purpose, the honourable member, according to that argument, would say, "" Now that we have bad times we cannot do it. Let us wait until we get better times again,"" ancl nothing would be done. He also said that in the House of Commons 01d age PensionsB ill , was forced to re: ject proposals that came from the Labour party because the Government would not have been able to finance them.

AllI have to say in that connection is that if he can successfully shelter himself behind that standing order, the sooner it is rescinded the better. I have a very vivid recollection of the opposition offered by the Minister of Defence to the Surplus Revenue Bill. He is the very last man who should have attacked the honourable member for Wide Bay, seeing that he himself ""stonewalled"" the first attempt made to provide the means with which to pay old-age pensions. The men who to-day refuse to provide additional revenue with which to pay invalid pensions are no more censurable than are those who fought that Bill. For the Government to urge that they cannot obtain the necessary funds with which to give effect to measures of urgency is exceedingly paltry, especially in view of the fact that, so far, they have not attempted to obtain revenue from any source other than the Customs House. ago, the honourable member for North back the enemy.

If he has a scheme for the payment of old-age pensions, why does he not bring it forward? age pensions scheme. scheme of which the Government ought to be thoroughly ashamed. They ought to be ashamed of the fact that they cannot provide sufficient monev to adequately meet the claims of the poor. The payment of ios. a week is altogether insufficient. . So far, honourable members have not complained of that, because they wish to relieve the wants of the cripples as well as of the aged. Where the proposals of the Government accord with my views, I shall give them mv support. guilty of factious opposition; but when they refuse to make this Bill an effective one, I say it is high time that they were sent to the country. [2.40 a.m.] I wish the Government would agree to the amendment proposed, which is a very simple one. They need not give effect to it until it suits them to do so. It is not money that they require, but merely credit. The trouble is that we have no machinery in the Commonwealth for utilizingcredit, which is the new factor in the progress of civilization. I may remind honourable members that, on 2nd August, 1901,. I suggested a means of securing the necessary revenue with which to pay old-age pensions. I pointed out the desirablenessof levying an absentee tax, and a progressive land tax. I also stated, in reply to the then Prime Minister, Mr Barton, that if we were threatened with an invasion by Japanese, we would scarcely sit down and say that we could not finance an army until the expiration of the Braddon section of the Constitution. I suggested that we would be more likely to at once devise ways and That, in the opinion of this House, it is dein the interests of the deserving agedpoor, that the Government should, without unCOOK -The honourable necessary delay, formulate a national scheme for the payment of old-age pensions, and that thismotion, when carried, be an instruction to the honourable the Attorney-General to draw up the necessary measure. Then, on 3rd October, of tlie same year, I asked the Prime Minister, Mr Barton, the following question :I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, if he will be able to set apart a day next week for the discussion of the motion I have on the notice-paper dealing with old-age pensions ? To which Mr Barton repliedI cannot at the present moment give ar* answer to the honourable member's question, but I shall be glad to do so if he will place it upon the business-paper to-morrow. In passing, I may mention that I am a great believer in the idea that a critic should be constructive as well as destructive. I once saw a mule in Texas kick down a whole crockery shop.

That the CommiUee dissent from the Chairman's ruling. I am taking an extreme course. May I be permitted to explain why? opinion that the proposed omission makes no charge of any kind upon the revenue. The repeal of that section will merely permit persons who are inmates of certain institutions to become successful applicants for pensions. In this connection, I desire to draw attention to the difference between the wording of section 45 and section 47. The latter readsI f a successful claimant of a pension is an placed upon it. inmate of a benevolent asylum or other charitable institution, the pension shall become payable as from a date not more than twenty-eight days prior to the pensioner being discharged from or leaving the asylum or institution, but no payment on account of pension shall be made to him so long as he is an inmate of the nsylum or institution. The former clearly contemplates that a person must be a pensioner before he becomes an inmate of either of the institutions therein set out. On the other hand, section 47 declares that if at the time of making his claim he is an inmate of any such institution, he cannot receive a pension. He can become a successful claimant, but only from a date not more than twenty-eight days prior to his discharge. If , however, an inmate of one of these institutions chooses to leave it, and if he becomes a successful claimant to a pension, he can then return to the institution, and continue to draw his pension without let or hindrance. It is only if he is an inmate at the time he makes his claim, that he is barred from receiving the pension. There is not a word in the section which, in the circumstances I have outlined, would enable the Government to refuse to pay his pension. under the operation of section 45? distinctly confined to asylums"" for the insane and to hospitals. cordance with the regulations. a regulation can be framed which is not in conformity with the Act. and it is obvious that if a pensioner returned to one of those institutions he would be an inmate of it. true that he cannot become a successful claimant whilst he is an inmate, but there is nothing to prevent him from leaving the institution, becoming a successful applicant, and subsequently returning to it. No proI am of vision in this Bill, or in the principal Act, would permit the Treasurer to stop the payment of his pension under such circumstances. The clause under consideration is an incentive to a petty form of deception. upon it by fhe honourable member would reduce it to an absurdity, and no Court of Justice would accept that interpretation so long as a reasonable construction could be clause is an absurdity.

The moment that provision was repealed the persons dealt with in section 47 would become entitled to pensions, and, in the circumstances, I think that the Chairman's ruling must be admitted to be correct. pension on leaving the institution. contends that they could get a pension on leaving the institution, and could then go back to it again. Assuming that that construction is correct, if they did not leave it they would be a greater burden than if they did, and we are not to assume that they would leave the institution. Are we to decide whether or not this is a money B ill , and would involve an increase of the burdens on the public by a mere supposititious case such as the honourable member for Adelaide has put? I do not care what construction of the section is adopted, its repeal would involve an additional burden on the public. -Section 47 is itself as ambiguous as some of the arguments that have been heard in connection with this amendment. For instance, a pension is payable to a man up to twenty-eight days prior to the time he is discharged from a benevolent asylum or charitable institution, yet, in trie same section, it is stipulated that he can get no pension while he is an ' inmate of the institution. If a person is twenty-eight days in a charitable institution, surely he is an inmate of the institution during that period? How is the Chairman of Committees to decide that the repeal of this section would involve an increased charge on the people ? Has he been supplied with any statistics as to the number of people in these institutions who are entitled to pensions for twenty-eight days prior to rheir discharge? Has he any idea of the number of people who would be qualified to receive pensions and are not inmates of these institutions? And, if he does not possess this information, how is he to say that the amendment will involve an increased charge on the people? With all clue respect, I contend that the decision of the Chairman of Committees is an arbitrary one, and it should not be upheld. I mean to say that it is arbitrary inasmuch as it has been given without any assigned reason. If we had any figures before us to volve increased expenditure, we should have to yield to the logic of facts; but it is mere guesswork for any one to say that the repeal of that section would increase the charge on the public. Perhaps the mover of the motion to disagree with the Chairman's ruling might agree to withdraw it temporarily, in order that I may move an amendment affecting section 45. I make the request because I presume that, after we have dealt with an amendment affecting section 47, I should be precluded from doing what I desire to do. my motion.

Motion (by posedThat this Bill be now read a third time. As there has been some criticism of the administration of the principal Act, I feel bound to express the opinion that the Government will administer both the Act and the amending legislation in the most sympathetic spirit. It should be made known as widely as possible that every officer acting under this law has been instructed to carry out his duties with proper regard for the feelings of pensioners and claimants for pensions. It is necessary to prevent undeserving persons from taking advantage of the provisions of the Act ; but inquiry should be made as to the possibility of withdrawing some of the questions which are now asked. I am sure that it is the desire of every honourable member, and of Ministers a| well, that there shall be no harsh treatment, and that every assistance shall be given to those who need it. I would like to add that, in my opinion, if a magistrate goes out of his way to insult a citizen of Australia who is applying for an old-age pension, he should not have the privilege of dealing with any-case of the kind again.
