Wednesday, 13 September 2006 ----Vietnamese Cultural Heritage Centre Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (9.30 am)-Last weekend I attended the opening of a new Vietnamese Cultural Heritage Centre in Sunshine, established by the Victorian Chapter of the Vietnamese Community in Australia for the benefit of the community. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Vietnamese community, especially Phong Nguyen, the President of the VCA, and the committee members for their commitment to this project. It has taken four years to bring this project to fruition. I know that the centre will contribute significantly to the community and will provide space and facilities that complement all of the great work that the community group already does. I also want to record in parliament my public thanks to all those volunteers, donors and other community members who gave their time, their skills and their money to support this project. The centre will initially host two new community programs-the Vietnamese martial arts program and the Vision Aged Care Vietnamese Group. It is planned that the aged care group will prepare entertainment and learning activities for a children’s playgroup, which will provide unique opportunities for intergenerational interaction. I am sure that, with room to grow in this new centre, the VCA will soon expand the services and activities that they provide-for example, the centre’s kitchen may soon host an employment program of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations for a Vietnamese cooking and catering service. I certainly hope the department will support this program at the appropriate time. Sunday’s event was an occasion to mark the official opening of the centre and gave people a preview of what more can come as the council seals the roads and as other development continues in the area. But it was also an occasion that the Vietnamese community took to mark the coming retirement of the state member for Footscray, Mr Bruce Mildenhall, who was honoured for his service to the community. He spoke in a very heartfelt way about how the partnership between him and the Vietnamese community had been one of the most rewarding parts of his 24 years in public life. Just as importantly, Mr Quang Luu, former head of SBS Radio and of Vietnamese background himself, was honoured for his many years of great work for the community. The community spoke of the special pride that they have had for the roles he has held over the past years. In the last 30 years the Vietnamese community as a whole has made an extraordinarily valuable contribution to Australian society in business, the arts and civic life and particularly to my electorate of Gellibrand, where over six per cent of the population is of Vietnamese background. I think it is important to acknowledge the contributions that Australia’s first wave of non-European refugees has made. The recent 30th anniversary of Vietnamese migration to Australia was a significant milestone for the community to mark. They have faced significant challenges but have successfully overcome these barriers to become integral members of the Australian community. It is particularly through the support and advocacy of organisations such as the VCA and the new Cultural Heritage Centre, which play an important part in this, that this has been able to happen successfully.

244,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley) Took The Chair At 9.30 Am.,"Gilmore Electorate Employment Africa Visit School Captains proposed by the government for shifting people from areas of high unemployment to areas of employment. Shoalhaven, in the electorate of Gilmore, is one of the areas that has been mentioned in this regard because, unfortunately, we have lost some 530 jobs in the past six or seven months through no fault of anybody specifically. To shift our people from a high unemployment area to other areas is a very good bonus. There are a lot of people in the area who are interested in working but, unfortunately, there are no jobs available for them, so this proposal is very important for our electorate. I am very thankful to the minister for proposing this pilot program. The other issue I would like to discuss is school captains. I know that most members would be in touch with their school captains. We are meeting with our school captains next week and it is very important that we do so. It is a very rewarding exercise because we can learn what the schoolchildren are thinking about in their schools. It is very important for us to hear their concerns and to try to address them. We do this on a regular basis. I have also invited the state member to come along so we can discuss those issues of concern. There is another area I would like to address. I would like to say thank you to the parliament for allowing me to go to Africa. I have just come back from Africa. There are 21 women in our electorate who actually built a school 500 kilometres out of Nairobi, almost in the desert. Some 50 children started and there are now 370 children going to this school. Those 21 people went with me. They asked me to help them to open the school. I cannot begin to tell you how proud I was to do that and to see the facilities that these children now have. They are now able to attend a school, which they could not do before. Those people who have been to Africa will probably know-and I notice that the member for Fowler is nodding her head; she has been there-that visiting Africa brings you back to earth. It lets you see how good we have it here in Australia. I cannot begin to tell you of the areas that I saw. I saw the slum areas and the orphanages for young children who, since birth, have been on HIV-AIDS programs and will continue to be until they actually pass on from this world. It was rewarding that I was able to attend. I thank the parliament for allowing me to go to that. Australian Made Products ralled up from $193 billion to $494 billion. That is a 155 per cent increase. That is $24,000 for every man, woman and child. It is equivalent to 52 per cent of our gross domestic product. Australia’s imports exceeded exports by $16.7 billion over the last year. Annual interest in Australia’s foreign debt has jumped 40 per cent in the last year to $21.8 billion lost to our country. The current Treasurer said in 1995 that high foreign debt puts a premium on Australian borrowing that flows through and every Australian pays for the consequences. The consequences are increasing interest rates. The consequences can be seen in the number of people’s own homes being repossessed throughout Australia, doubling within New South Wales between 2003 and 2005. Other people have been subjected to even higher interest rates since. MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Statements By Members

The Australian Made campaign has commissioned research that reports that 45 per cent of surveyed customers prefer to buy Australian made products and over 30 per cent deliberately look for products demonstrating the Australian Made logo. Eighty per cent of Australian consumers appear to be aware that a label consisting of the words ‘Product of Australia’, ‘Produce of Australia’ or ‘Produced in Australia’ identify more substantial Australian content than Australian Made. But the specific requirements of each label certainly are not well known. The amendment to the Trade Practices Act in 1998 allows goods to wear the Australian Made label or a variation if the goods have been substantially transformed in Australia-that is, they have undergone a fundamental change-and 50 per cent or more of the costs of producing or manufacturing the goods are attributed to processes in Australia. The ‘Product of Australia’ label requires that each significant ingredient or component must be sourced from Australia and virtually all production or manufacturing processes must have occurred within Australia. How each of these classifications works in practice falls to the trade practices court. Anecdotal explanations from previous cases, even those within the legislation’s explanatory memorandum, give more certainty. Most Australians may never digest the subtleties of the law. I think Australians have the right to know where their products come from, where they are made and if they are made here in this country. Fears exist that rules have been compromised to allow wide use with limited meaning. Fears also exist that advertising is included within the production costs, further decreasing the local input to the product. I certainly hope that the trade practices commission and the ACCC can allay such fears and reinforce the good work they do in policing the law with education campaigns so that people can purchase with confidence in the knowledge that, by purchasing a good labelled ‘Product of Australia’, the consumer is doing their best for our country.

ISI also ranks JCU research papers in the categories of plant and animal science and geosciences in the top 10 of Australian universities for the most highly cited papers. The very high ranking of CSIRO was further indication of the likely future impact of the Australian tropical science and innovation precinct which is to be based at James Cook University in Townsville. This is largely a partnership between JCU and CSIRO, and the JCU rankings on the ISI list show what a powerhouse for research that this precinct will be on the national and the world stage. While JCU is both a regional and middle sized university in the Australian context, it is holding its own and in some cases surpassing the long established and much larger metropolitan universities. Well done, JCU. Australian Values what are referred to as Australian values. Some have called for such values to be taught in our schools and signed off by persons entering Australia. But what are the values to be enshrined as Australian? I must admit I have not seen any statements I could fully agree to. So without mentioning the words ‘mateship’, ‘digger’, ‘vegemite’ or ‘fair go’, I have put together my own statement of Australian values and I invite my fellow Australians to accept or reject them as they see fit. Here is my statement of Australian values. Australia is a society which by law and custom respects and shows tolerance to the political, social and religious beliefs of all its citizens and residents. Australia is a democracy with its government freely elected by the people and governed according to the rule of law. The official language of Australia is English. Australians respect the rights of individuals to pursue happiness in their own ways, provided they do not injure or unreasonably offend others. In respecting the diversity of their population, the people of Australia expect all within their borders to treat each other as equals regardless of race, gender, marital status, sexual preference or disability. Australia supports its families in the nurture and education of children and seeks to improve the skills, intellectual development and cultural enrichment of all its people. Australians come together in communities, in corporations, in workplaces, in social, sporting and cultural organisations and as a nation to promote their mutual benefit, advancement and protection in the face of adversity. Australians care for their natural environment and hold in trust their heritage for future generations. Australia provides care and support for the social security of its aged, disabled, infirm and economically disadvantaged citizens and residents. As a nation Australia is proud of the achievements of its citizens-proud of its multicultural and inclusive society and confident of its future. Those are my Australian values. I welcome the comments and the criticism of my fellow members of parliament and all my fellow Australians.

249,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (9.44 Am),"I rise to talk of the four RSL clubs in my electorate ofNorth Beach RSL sub-branch has been successful in its submission to the Australian government for funding that will greatly benefit its 400 members. It will especially benefit those who are isolated from the rest of the local community, whether through a lack of confidence or issues of physical or mental health. The North Beach RSL will receive Veteran and Community Grants scheme funding for a laptop computer and a printer. These items will allow its volunteers to produce a regular newsletter containing all the latest actions of the sub-branch as well as vital information for veterans and their families. The North Beach RSL newsletter will be distributed by hand, another enormous commitment by its volunteers. Close to 400 veterans will benefit from this newsletter delivery. Sadly, many veterans live quite isolated lives, and their lives are enormously changed by the human contact that occurs through regular visits to their homes by other veterans and volunteers. This encourages their participation in the North Beach sub-branch and the many activities that it undertakes. This funding gives local veterans a voice, just as all of our veterans should be given a respected and meaningful voice within their local communities and Australian society as a whole. We should never forget the great sacrifices of our veterans in the defence of our nation and their continuing role in our communities. The Howard government recognises this and, as a result, the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs made the announcement to the RSL national congress yesterday that there would be an extra $400 million over the next five years to ensure that gold and white card holders will continue to enjoy access to free health care. Veterans and war widows with gold or white cards can now confidently access the services of healthcare professionals that they know and trust without having to pay anything themselves. Any veterans requiring a hospital stay can now access the services of large surgical hospitals, regional facilities and small local hospitals close to family and friends. I heartily commend the minister for this program, which will benefit 300,000 veterans across Australia as well as many within my electorate of Stirling. The RSL sub-branches in Stirling, Nollamara, North Beach, Osborne Park and Scarborough, do vital work assisting our veterans. These RSL units ensure that we continue to recognise the role of our veterans and that the veterans can fully participate in Australia’s important commemoration and remembrance ceremonies. They also allow for members to engage in the education of our younger generations, and I congratulate them for everything they do. (Time expired) Australia Post Agency Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (9.47 am)-I have made representations on several occasions, both to Australia Post and to Minister Coonan, seeking approval for an Australia Post agency to be established at the newsagency of one of my constituents, in Farmborough Road, Unanderra. To date my representations have been unsuccessful and the request has been refused. I am hoping that yet another petition signed within a short time frame by more than 1,000 local residents might lead to a reconsideration of this decision by the government and Australia Post, and I intend to formally table the petition in the House. The arguments in support of the proposal advanced by Mr Harper include the need for such a service, as indicated by the large number of signatures on the petition from the local residents. He points out too that the postal agency would be of great benefit to many elderly resiMAIN COMMITTEE dents who live nearby and do not have transport. It would service a growing number of retirement villages and nursing homes in the area. The service would also be available to workers at the Unanderra industrial area, following the closure of the mail exchange in Glastonbury Avenue. Population increases in the surrounding neighbourhoods of Unanderra, Farmborough Heights, Coachwood Estate, Mount Kembla Heights and Highview Estate mean that the demand for postal services has outgrown the one available local postal service. I find it very hard to understand why Australia Post has responded by saying a new post office is not warranted. That is certainly not the view of local residents. The government made an election commitment in 2004 that it would ensure that the needs of elderly and disabled Australians and those living in regional and rural Australia would be taken into account. Why then are the needs and wishes of local residents, many of whom are elderly and without access to transport, being ignored by Australia Post? I urge the minister and Australia Post to respond to the request of the petitioners and approve an Australia Post agency at Mr Harper’s newsagency on Farmborough Road, Unanderra. Canning Electorate: Pinjarra Bypass in my electorate. Pinjarra is a town where there is an enormous amount of growth going on, particularly the expansion of the Alcoa mining activities in that region, the expansion of the Wagerup refinery and also the Boddington goldmine, which is coming on stream. It puts thousands of trucks a day through the centre of the Pinjarra town. I have, as a result, had a delegation from the Pinjarra shire, led by Neil Leach, and the Peel Development Commission, led by Maree De Lacey, asking that I support their application for AusLink strategic funds to help build a bypass, which would go from Greenlands Road around Pinjarra to save the congestion through the middle of this town. In fact, there are a number of towns in my area that have looked for bypasses. Byford is another one and so is the town of Waroona, but Pinjarra at the moment is quite vital in that the traffic is choking the middle of the town. I supported their application, as I supported an application for Ranford Road, which is in the shire of both Gosnells and Armadale in my electorate. That was supported by the shires and, to a small extent, by the state government. I am confident that that funding, because of the way it has been supported, will come for Ranford Road. However, in an absolutely bizarre turn of events, when I inquired as to the prospects of the Pinjarra bypass I was told that the feedback from the federal department was that they had not recommended it as a high priority. I asked why. When the state government were asked if they would support it in matching funding through the AusLink strategic road funding program, they said, ‘Yes, we’re happy to support it but the funds will have to come from the Perth to Bunbury highway funds that the state government are putting into.’ This is just absolute chicanery by the state ministerA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 9.52 am to 10.14 am They are saying: ‘Pull the money out of the Perth to Bunbury highway. We are not going to put any additional new money into this bypass.’ As a result, the much needed vital bypass in Pinjarra will not go ahead and, because of the stunt of the state minister, Alannah MacTiernan, MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Statements By Members

(Time expired) National Express ters responsible for corporate governance to properly monitor foreign nationals and multinationals so that they can no longer hide behind voluntary administration as a method of stripping hard working Australians of their life’s work. A recent example of the failings of the Australian court is that of Bob Bosnjak who, along with his father, Simon, and brothers John and Jim, built up one of Australia’s biggest and most successful bus companies: Westbus/Bosnjak Holdings. After having been first swindled of much of his share in Bosnjak Holdings and going through lengthy court proceedings to have an order made against Jim Bosnjak for an account of profits for his dishonest dealings with the National Bus Co., Bob Bosnjak has now been swindled out of any practical redress by National Express. After Bosnjak Holdings was put into voluntary administration, National Express made it a condition of standing behind ordinary trade creditors that it and all its directors be indemnified against any claim Bosnjak Holdings might have against it and its directors, effectively leaving Bob Bosnjak out in the cold with little means of redress. National Express has gone on to secure three transport franchises in Victoria-namely, VLine, M-tram and M-train-and has also bought Jim Bosnjak’s share of the National Bus Co., allowing National Express to effectively treat Bosnjak Holdings as a wholly owned subsidiary without regard to Bob Bosnjak who currently has further legal action under way in relation to this matter. However, the reckless corporate behaviour of National Express continues further by the fact that it saddled Bosnjak Holdings with a debt it could not survive, effectively running it into the ground, resulting once again in voluntary administration and the subsequent sale of Bosnjak Holdings assets to a Singaporean Cabcharge Jointventure. I therefore say that National Express, so far as I am concerned, has swindled Bob Bosnjak of his life’s work and of the legacy left to him and Jim by their father, Simon. This should have been without any doubt an example of a great migrant success story but the antics of National Express have ensured that not only was Bosnjak Holdings managed abysmally whilst under voluntary administration but it was effectively run into the ground and destroyed and then had its assets sold to another foreign company, leaving Bob Bosnjak with literally nothing. That National Express and its directors can destroy an Australian company then hide behind voluntary administration is a travesty of justice. This is an example that requires Australian government action. It is a lack of corporate governance and this matter needs to be fully investigated and attended to. It is about time successful migrants and other Australians who build successful companies were protected from foreign multinationals who come in to destroy their life’s work and effectively swindle them out of their just entitlements and rewards for their life’s work.

251,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.15 Am,"I call on the Treasurer and the minisSmall Business Ms GAMBARO (Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary (Foreign Affairs)) (10.18 am)-TodayI would like to speak on the work the Howard government has done to support small business. Small businesses are a very active part of the economy of the Petrie electorate, as they are across Australia, and they provide a most incredible source of jobs, economic growth and innovation. Even the largest companies have started with spirited vision and realised their ambition and dreams. I want to speak about one of those incredible companies. I recently had the great pleasure of visiting Paul Gripske of Roy Gripske and Sons, which is a small engineering parts specialist which is based at Narangba. With the assistance of an Australian government grant through the Commercial Ready Program, Paul was able to use the dollar-for-dollar funding to transform his prototype of a world first. It is an outdoor vacuum cleaner, which will be a sellable product pretty soon. The Powerup Vac attachment converts a conventional outdoor blower machine into a vacuum unit that can suck up rubbish such as cans and bottles. It might sound a little uninteresting, but the applications are just amazing, particularly after major sporting events, major carnivals, State of Origin matches et cetera. The first of these outdoor vacuum cleaners will be available on the shelves by mid-2007. Those entrepreneurial developments are incredible and should always be encouraged to grow. The feedback I get from businesses over the year is always about red tape and the way they operate their enterprises. The government has recognised that and made some real changes, particularly for small business. Recently and more broadly, the Australian government presented a final response on the Banks task force report Rethinking regulation. This was the report of the Taskforce on Reducing the Regulatory Burden on Business. The government agreed to 158 of the 178 recommendations, which cover a whole variety of sectors. The strengthened Office of Best Practice Regulation will act as a gatekeeper to stop red tape reaching the statute books in the first place. The federal government is working in other ways with state and territory governments to harmonise conveyancing laws et cetera to cut down red tape. On a local government level we have provided $50 million worth of regulation reduction incentives to reduce compliance. Petrie’s 3,000 businesses will be able to continue their very valuable work unhindered by the enormous burden of accounting red tape, and simplified accounting methods will be developed. These businesses will be able to do what they are best at-developing innovation and employing many more Queenslanders. 193 the time for members’ statements has concluded. BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 August, on motion by Ms Ley: That this bill be now read a second time. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Statements By Members
252,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),"Order! In accordance with standing orderCattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment Bill 2006, but with some reservations, which I will outline to the chamber. The bill amends the National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Act to enable the funds currently held in the National Cattle Disease Eradication Account-an account held and operated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry-to be transferred to the Cattle Disease Contingency Fund, an account held by Cattle Disease Contingency Fund Pty Ltd. The owners of this new company are the Cattle Council of Australia, the Australian Lot Feeders Association and Animal Health Australia. Since 2002, cattle industry levy moneys have been paid into this account. The National Cattle Disease Eradication Account was set up in 1991 to hold and distribute funds for programs aimed at eliminating brucellosis and tuberculosis from the Australian cattle and buffalo populations. That was a successful initiative of the then Labor government. It is pleasing to see that the original objectives of that scheme, which at the time met with some opposition from some industry operators and farmers, have been fulfilled and we have managed to eradicate those diseases from our herds. The current balance in the account is approximately $13.5 million. The Cattle Disease Contingency Fund Pty Ltd, as trustee, is permitted to use the funds in the Cattle Disease Contingency Fund for a number of specific purposes, including prevention and control of endemic or exotic cattle diseases, research and other animal health activities likely to benefit the Australian cattle industry. I note that the proposal has received support from industry groups and Labor will not be opposing it, but I point out on the floor of the Main Committee our concerns with what would seem to be the privatisation of many of the functions of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This has the potential at the end of the day to reduce Commonwealth scrutiny over these matters and accountability for the use of the funds. I have observed this trend over the 10 years this government has been in office-accountability mechanisms have not been as stringent as we would expect. Many bodies are at arm’s length from this parliament, which makes it increasingly difficult for the parliament to exercise scrutiny over their funds. This money was collected from levy payers for a specific purpose, and now, with the agreement of industry groups, it is about to be used for other closely related purposes. As I said, we are not going to oppose the legislation, but we do point out that this is part of a trend that has occurred over the past 10 years of these sorts of bodies being put at arm’s length from the parliament to reduce the scrutiny of them and the accountability for their funds. We can see how, when ministers put firewalls around particular issues, all of this can go wrong. The AWB is a classic example of this. We certainly do not want a situation where funds that belong to producers in this industry are misused in any shape or form. I certainly hope that the minister has his eye on this whole accountability issue. From an opposition’s point of view, we have found it very difficult at times to get appropriate information on the activities of many of these bodies through the estimates committee process of the Senate. As members would know, that is a very important way in which oppositions and industry groups get to scrutinise some of these proposals and how they are operating. It provides a forum for industry groups when they have complaints about these sorts of matters. We know that in the beef industry and livestock industries generally there is a lot of concern among producers on these issues. In the past this has led to the formation of different MAIN COMMITTEE",173,National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment
253,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (10.21 Am),"The opposition will support the Nationalorganisations to represent producers. There has been significant controversy over the live export trade and aspects of that industry. I note that the Lot Feeders Association will be a party to the company that is being set up under this legislation. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, as somebody who has been intimately involved with the beef industry in your electorate and in your past political life and the one in this parliament, the legislation deals with a very significant industry that is most important to Australia’s economic fortunes and the futures of regional communities throughout Australia. Each year Australia produces just over two million tonnes of beef. That is an estimate provided by the ABS in 2005-06. The gross value of Australian cattle and calf production, including live cattle exports, is approximately $7.4 billion. That is ABARE’s figure for 2005-06. There were in excess of 74,000 properties with cattle, according to a June 2005 estimate, holding 27.78 million cattle and calves and 12.9 million beef cows and heifers. Domestic expenditure on beef is estimated to be in the region of $6.4 billion and, as members would know, it is a significant export earner for Australia. In 2005-06 we exported 65 per cent of our beef production, with a total value of approximately $4.5 billion. I have given a thumbnail sketch of the industry, but it is a big player in economic terms in regional Australia and as far as the national economy is concerned. We must do whatever we can to protect it, to protect its integrity and to ensure that the diseases that ravage livestock are contained and do not have an adverse economic impact on the industry. A lot of research is done in many places on a whole range of pests and diseases that affect production in this industry. We could speak at quite considerable length about those exotic pests and diseases, but there are two that have caused devastation in other economies and had enormous adverse economic impacts. I refer here to the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the United Kingdom. I was recently in the United Kingdom-I think perhaps I might have been there at the time you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were there-speaking to various rural groups about the impacts of foot-and-mouth disease and how we might better prepare for the prospect of a disease outbreak. Foot-and-mouth disease had a devastating effect on British beef exports and on the domestic industry in that country. Of course, there have been some estimates of the impact that it might have here in Australia. In a publication by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry there was a review of the new technologies and the potential impact of new technologies on Australia’s foot-and-mouth disease planning and policies. In that report, the estimates of the effect of even a small-scale outbreak were the immediate closure of many of Australia’s major export markets for livestock and livestock products and an estimated minimum loss to the national economy of between $2 billion and $3 billion in GDP rising to between $8 billion and $13 billion 12 months after the outbreak. This is an enormous impact that would occur if we in Australia had an outbreak similar to the one experienced in the United Kingdom. The United States, with the BSE outbreak and the failure of the systems there to be able to effectively trace where that outbreak occurred, has been excluded from the Japanese market, and of course Australia has been fortunate enough to be able to partially fill that gap and increase its exports into that market. That has strengthened the export market for Australian beef and provided in some very difficult times extra income and a certain bottom under the international prices received for Australian meat exports. MAIN COMMITTEE I note here in the chamber the presence of the honourable member for Grey, who has an intimate knowledge of the beef industry and knows how important it is to South Australia and many producers in his state. I think that honourable members from both sides of the Houseit does not matter what their political complexion is-understand very clearly how important these industries are to regional communities. They are important not only in the production end but in the value adding up the chain where jobs are provided in the meat and livestock industries. They are critical jobs to regional areas. If we do not have them, the communities dry up even faster in an economic sense. So it is very important that we keep on top of exotic pests and diseases. Past Labor governments have certainly turned their minds to this and to the substance of this bill, which concerns two diseases, tuberculosis and brucellosis, and their eradication in our herds. But, as we know, you have success on that front and other potentially more devastating diseases are waiting in the wings. I hope that these funds will be spent wisely and I note the involvement of key industry groups in that process. I have confidence that those groups will spend this money wisely, but I urge them to keep in mind that these moneys were raised for one purpose and are now going to be used for a different one and there is a heavy responsibility not only to growers but also to the taxpayers of Australia and to this parliament. The taxpayers of Australia support the meat industry in a variety of ways, and I think it is important that we have proper accountability for allocated funds. While I am on the issue of exotic pests and diseases, it disturbed me greatly when I heard on AM this morning Professor Max Whitten and Dr Jim Cullen, two eminent scientific specialists in Australia in pests and diseases, speculating about the impact of the shortage of scientists appropriately trained in the quarantine area. We have had plenty of debates about this in this place. I will be followed in this debate by the member for Lingiari, and the comments I make are particularly pertinent to his electorate. There has been a massive increase in illegal fishing incursions to our north. Failed government policy has seen an extraordinary number of incursions, with some of these illegal fishers setting up base camps on Australian soil. They have been apprehended with animals on board their vessels and in their camps. Anybody who knows anything about the Northern Territory cattle industry would know that it is not just about cattle but about feral pigs and other animals. If a disease like foot and mouth were introduced and took hold, it would decimate a very important industry in the Northern Territory and would certainly affect the whole Australian meat industry. So here we have two eminent scientists commenting on the shortage of scientists, particularly in the area of exotic pest and disease analysis and prevention. They made some scathing comments about the situation today compared with 10 years ago. They are reported to have said that, 10 years ago, there were three times more technical scientific specialists than there are today and that the system today is overloaded with administrative staff. These eminent people were commenting on a deficiency in an organisation which is at the front line in our fight against exotic pests and diseases, including foot and mouth, BSC and a range of other diseases that affect the livestock industry. A very sombre warning has been sounded and I congratulate these scientists for coming out into the open on this matter. I have been saying for many years that, unless you get the infrastructure right, you cannot get on top of these problems when they occur. MAIN COMMITTEE The opposition have been arguing-and we are supported by the New South Wales farmers on this-that we ought to have a thorough inquiry, review and overhaul of Australia’s quarantine arrangements. We are in a new era of global trade. We are in an era of bioterror. We are in an era of massive illegal fishing and there are difficulties in defending our coastline. We are in an era where many of our critical rural industries face the prospect of significant outbreaks of exotic pests and diseases. For many of those industries it is not a question of if; it is a question of when. When these incidents occur, you have to minimise the damage. There must be research into not only the exotic pests and diseases but how we should respond. I note that in the chamber with me today is the member for Lingiari. I have made some comment on the Northern Territory cattle industry and the importance of getting on top of the exotic pest and disease situation. Productivity in the cattle industry in his electorate is dependent on the ability of producers to keep on top of particular exotic pests, which have the potential to decimate that industry. In conclusion, the opposition will be supporting the legislation, but we sound a note of concern and warning about the lack of accountability for funds that has occurred in some organisations over the life of this government when bodies at arm’s length to government have been set up. The entities that are involved in this new company are reputable ones, but I just sound a note of caution to the parliament that there are what we thought were quite reputable organisations now under the pump for a massive misuse of funds. We must be eternally vigilant in this regard. Our responsibility as members of this parliament is to ensure that accountancy and transparency arrangements are there so that the Australian taxpayer, producers and the general community are able to scrutinise these funds. 133,000 farming establishments derive their main income from beef cattle farming. The National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment Bill 2006 will materially affect an important part of the process that supports a large slice of our rural industry-particularly our opportunity to export product from rural areas. Beef cattle farming is providing great opportunities and has traditionally provided great opportunities for Australia to export. Last financial year, there was $13.5 million within the fund that we are talking about. It raises a considerable amount of money to be used to protect our rural industries and we need to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility within our system to arrange protection in ways that will be effective. We should not put it in straitjackets or implement guidelines that limit its effectiveness. We heard from the member for Corio opposite about some of the new threats that are appearing all the time that could potentially cause a danger to our very important beef cattle industries. I would just remark a little bit on the evolution of the cattle industry in Australia. I do not know how many members know it, but cattle first arrived in Australia in 1788 on the First Fleet-there were six of them. By 1800, we had 1,044 head of cattle in Australia. By 1850, there were nearly 1.9 million head of cattle. In 1900, that had grown to 8.6 million. By 1950, we had 9.7 million and in 2002 we saw the peak in the cattle herd at 24.7 million head of cattle. The drought that we have been suffering that has been causing all the pain and anguish in rural areas has caused numbers to tail off a bit since then. There are up to 24.7 million head of cattle in Australia, providing great support for communities in all kinds of different regional areas in our country and also providing export inMAIN COMMITTEE",174,National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment
254,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (10.41 Am),"About a quarter of Australia’scome. In 2003-04, for example, exports of beef earned Australia $3.9 billion, which is 3.5 per cent of the total of our merchandise exports. Live cattle exports earned an additional $460 million. We are among the top producers of beef, with the 10th largest herd in the world. We are also the world’s largest exporter of beef, with 25 per cent of the total of our beef production being traded. We had 36,200 beef cattle farms in 2002-03, accounting for 27 per cent of Australia’s agricultural establishments. It is important that we look at ways of providing additional support. We have seen growth in the cattle herd over the years on the average farm. In 1979 the average cattle herd on a farm would have been 218. Two decades later it reached as high as 301. That does reflect the growth and the trend within our rural industries towards greater, bigger and more substantial enterprises, and also towards greater efficiency and a more competitive industry which builds very strongly for the future of our country. The National Cattle Disease Eradication Account is used to fund initiatives in the eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis. The original brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign started back in the late eighties. It has been successful. Since then we have seen a number of programs, such as the Tuberculosis Freedom Assurance Plan and the Tuberculosis Freedom Assurance Plan 2, to monitor effectiveness. They ensure that the achievements of the eradication program for brucellosis and tuberculosis have been effective and long-lasting and that we do not see any resurgence of either of those two deadly diseases within our cattle herds. I thought I should say just how effective that has been. The last case of TB was found in Tasmania in 1972, in Victoria in 1991, in New South Wales in 1995, in South Australia in 1996, in Western Australia in 1998, in Queensland in 2000, and in the Northern Territory in 1999 in cattle and in 2002 in buffalo. I remember they spent an awful lot of effort trying to completely wipe out the buffalo herd in the Northern Territory, but I think that, as the member for Lingiari will probably tell us, there are still some out there. It is still important that we continue to maintain a watch on what is going on. I thought I might move from that discussion of the program to the importance now of providing greater flexibility. The purpose of this bill is to enable funds to be available for transfer-and I spoke before about $13.5 million in the last financial year being available in that fund-into a fund for a broader attack on cattle diseases through the Cattle Disease Contingency Fund. I think that, on the face of it, is quite clearly very much a desirable outcome. There are plenty of other threats out there for the cattle industries and it is very important that we enable that flexibility to exist. The scope of the Cattle Disease Contingency Fund is much wider and it will be used for the prevention, eradication and control of diseases as well as for research. I want to come to that in the short bit of time that remains to me. I would like to inform the House that there are significant changes occurring in my electorate that will contribute manifestly to this program. In the electorate of Blair we have the University of Queensland Gatton campus. Recently the University of Queensland, a very strong and reputable university with a significant worldwide reputation in veterinary achievements, announced that they are going to be transferring their vet school from St Lucia, in the leafy suburbs in the western part of Brisbane, to Gatton. This will enable students to have much more direct exposure to the heavy animal industries and to the wide range of rural pursuits MAIN COMMITTEE that are engaged in in Queensland, particularly in areas like beef cattle. This will give the students greater awareness of the risks of these diseases. It is also significant that, once this revised school is established at the Gatton campus of the University of Queensland, we will have a much greater focus on those diseases and on those other diseases that threaten the future of our cattle herd. Students undertaking study there, as opposed to students who in the past studied at St Lucia, will be much more focused on those heavy animal industries and much more prepared and able to support our endeavours in the beef cattle industry than I think they could ever have been being trained within the built-up area of Brisbane. That is a good thing. I want to point out the cost of transferring that incredibly difficult learning process. It is the most complex learning process. They say that doctors have to study only one type of organism, whereas vets have to study a huge number of different animals and all the complexities that go with them. So it is a very complex undertaking. That transfer is not going to be free. For example, funds from sources such as the one that we are discussing today should be brought into play to ensure that those students have the best facilities. About $80 million is required to re-establish the facility at Gatton. To be honest about it, the university has been pursuing the Commonwealth for something like a $25 million contribution towards that. It may be that the stakeholders within this fund, the Cattle Disease Contingency Fund, will find it a worthwhile investment to help with the establishment of that facility, because the more we can train vets with a focus on the rural industries as opposed to dogs and cats in the cities, the better off we will be, the greater the future will be for our nation and the greater strength there will be within our rural industries. Blair, who has just spoken, for cutting the time of his contribution to enable me to speak on this legislation. The National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment Bill 2006 amends the National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Act to enable funds held in the National Cattle Disease Eradication Account-an account held and operated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry-to be transferred to the Cattle Disease Contingency Fund, or CDCF, an account held by Cattle Disease Contingency Fund Pty Ltd. Since 1991-and this date is important to note when I come to the discussion about the campaign on tuberculosis and brucellosis shortly-the cattle and buffalo industries have been contributing through levies to the National Cattle Disease Eradication Account. That money was raised for initiatives to combat brucellosis and tuberculosis. The most recent initiative was the Tuberculosis Freedom Assurance Program, or TFAP. I am aware of this program simply because of its impact upon the Northern Territory cattle and buffalo industries. We should be in no doubt about the trauma placed on many producers as a result of this campaign, which was developed in the early nineties to eradicate brucellosis and tuberculosis from cattle and buffalo in Australia. This had a dramatic impact upon the cattle and buffalo numbers over a period of time. Whilst moneys were being paid out to the buffalo and cattle industries, many producers were left short. In some cases, smaller owneroperators found it very difficult to sustain their operations in the cattle industry as a result of the costs incurred. They did not believe that they had received adequate compensation for the eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis from their herds, and such eradication often meant the destruction of large herds of cattle. MAIN COMMITTEE",177,National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment
255,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (10.51 Am),"I want to thank my colleague the member forOne particular property that I am aware of, Nutwood Downs in the Northern Territory, is owned by the Dunbars. They had a significant cost to bear as a result of this campaign. I think they, like others in the industry, found it very difficult over a period of time to sustain their activities in the industry as a result of the costs that were incurred. Be that as it may, they are still in the industry. They are still producing very fine cattle off their property, as are other cattle producers in the Northern Territory. But the buffalo industry is very different. The impact on the buffalo industry was very dramatic to the point where the number of commercial buffalo producers was reduced substantially as a result of this campaign. The Tuberculosis Freedom Assurance Program finishes on 31 December. At the request of the cattle and buffalo industries, the remaining funds, approximately $13½ million, will be transferred to the more broadly focused Cattle Disease Contingency Fund-a trust fund established to fund such programs. The Cattle Disease Contingency Fund Pty Ltd is a private company jointly owned by the Cattle Council of Australia, the Australian Lot Feeders Association and Animal Health Australia, itself a private company owned by industry and state, territory and Commonwealth governments. Since 2002, cattle industry levy moneys have been paid into this account. The member for Corio, the shadow minister, raised governance issues which we have some concerns about in relation to this program. We know that moneys which were collected for a specific purpose will now, with the agreement of industry groups, be used for other closely related purposes. We support this legislation. I do so because I am very much aware of the importance of the cattle industry to the Northern Territory economy. The peak body for the cattle industry in the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory Cattlemen’s Association, represents around 98 per cent of the Northern Territory cattle herd, from small family operations to large corporate organisations. I have some figures from the association. Their members managed a land mass in excess of 620,000 square kilometres in 2005 and produce 532,000 high-quality cattle each year. Over 212,000 head of cattle are delivered directly to the port of Darwin for export to the Asia-Pacific region, and a further 320,000 head of cattle are transported and sold to all states and territories in Australia. We know that this is of tremendous importance to the Northern Territory economy. The pastoral industry generates over $330 million directly and another $180 million indirectly for the Territory economy. But there are animal health issues which remain a concern for the cattle industry. The biggest animal health concern for producers in the Northern Territory is botulism. Producers in the Alice Springs region are also concerned about lice, and Top End producers are concerned about buffalo fly. The most common disease that producers vaccinate for is botulism, with a smaller number of producers in the Top End, Katherine and the Barkley region vaccinating for vibriosis. Based on producer estimates-and I am relying here on information from the Department of Primary Industry, Fisheries and Mines in the Northern Territory-carrying capacities across the Northern Territory are expected to rise through increases in station infrastructure. Estimated increases are 29 per cent by 2009 and 54 per cent by 2014, with the largest increases in carrying capacity relative to area being in the Top End due to planned improved pasture development on already cleared land. There are other pests, of course, which concern the cattle industry. Animals such as wild dogs and pigs have a very substantial impact on the industry. Wild dogs were named as the feral animal receiving the greatest amount of control because of the impact they were having. MAIN COMMITTEE The average cost of control of feral animals in the Northern Territory in 2004 was $4,928 for each property. We know the importance of this industry to the Northern Territory and Australian economies. What we need to appreciate is that we cannot allow that industry to be devastated in the way it could potentially have been as a result of the brucellosis and tuberculosis infestation that occurred in the late eighties. While there was an infestation, we reached an agreement for our producers to be able to export to the United States market-if my memory serves me correctly-and we needed to ensure that our herd was clean. As a result, we embarked upon a massive program for the cattle industry right across the Australian community. Just as we are concerned about brucellosis and tuberculosis, we need to be aware that there are other exotic diseases which could potentially decimate the Australian cattle industry. We need to be very aware of that. We need to be supporting producers and producer organisations and we need to be supporting government agencies who are involved in assisting in managing those threats. I want to commend to the chamber the work which is being done by all sections of the cattle industry in the Northern Territory and also the work which is being done by the relevant department in the Northern Territory government, the Department of Primary Industry, Fisheries and Mines. National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment Bill 2006. Having been involved in the very early stages of the development of the program and involved at a personal level in the sense of having cattle involved in this scheme in those very early days, it is a great pleasure to see that the scheme has been so successful that we are winding up the residual levies and putting them into a fund that will be used for research and for the benefit of the cattle industry in the future. The bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign is possibly one of the most successful campaigns of its type anywhere in the world. We have to give great credit to the industry itself. It led this campaign with the cooperation of state, territory and federal governments, departments of agriculture, field workers, veterinarians and staff on cattle properties right across Australia. Obviously public health is of paramount importance to the food industry in Australia and of course the cattle industry wanted to make sure that they were able to meet the increasing need to give the countries importing our beef guarantees that our beef going into their markets is free of diseases that could have a public health risk attached to them. There was a huge challenge in implementing this program. I think the experience that it built on was the eradication of pleuropneumonia from the beef industry. That was eradicated from the beef industry by about 1967. It was running post the Second World War. We built on that experience to implement the program for the eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis from the beef industry in Australia. I mentioned a moment ago that this was a huge challenge to the beef industry. This was because we were dealing not only with small holdings in Southern Australia that were probably going to find it very easy to manage this scheme but also with large pastoral areas in Northern Australia. You have to make sure you are able to test all the cattle in these large pastoral areas. That means you have to muster them in, contain them, inoculate them and read the reaction to that inoculation in very large herds. You also have to deal with the wild buffalo population, MAIN COMMITTEE",179,National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment
256,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (11.00 Am),"I rise with great pleasure to speak on thewhich also could be a carrier of the disease. These animals are roaming wild in northern parts of Australia. The other problem was feral pigs. So it was probably the most ambitious eradication program that has ever been conducted in Australia. The great success, as I said a moment ago, should be seen as a great benefit to the industry and we should commend the leadership of the industry in wanting to make sure that they persevered with what was going to be an incredibly difficult campaign. The funding for this program came with a levy attached to it which was funded by 50 per cent of the cost being borne by the producers, 20 per cent at least by the federal government and 30 per cent by the state and territory governments. The residual funds that are in this fund now will be transferred to a more permanent fund that will enable the cattle industry to use them perhaps for further exotic disease research and also, importantly, for the benefit of the beef industry more generally. Brucellosis was eradicated in Australia in 1989 but to eradicate tuberculosis from the beef industry was going to be far more difficult. The complexity of where cattle run in Australia and the difficulties in Northern Australia meant that this area was going to be dealt with last. As difficult as it was to implement the program it was nonetheless successful and in 1997 Australia was declared free of tuberculosis. The importance of the beef industry to our regional communities cannot be understated. The beef industry and its exports-whether in processed or live cattle form-contribute enormously to our export wealth. But it is also the jobs that the beef industry creates at a local level which are important to regional economies and rural communities. That is underpinned by the ability of Australian cattle producers and meat exporters to be able to export our beef or live cattle into other markets with confidence. To now be able to give that guarantee-that our cattle and beef are going to be free of brucellosis and tuberculosis-gives us an advantage in many ways over other countries that cannot give that guarantee to importing countries. The beef industry have moved ahead again with the desire to ensure that they are able to identify at a consumer level the cattle and meat produced by them. That led to the introduction of the National Livestock Identification Scheme, commonly known as NLIS. There was a very difficult debate within the industry as to who would fund it and whether it would be successful, and there have been teething problems with the roll-out of that scheme across Australia. The National Livestock Identification Scheme ensures that cattle can be traced from their property of origin from the moment they leave a property to go through to feedlots or into the meat processing chain. That is important because, if we have exported beef to the United States, we are able now to identify the source of the meat, the history, and trace its progress from paddock to plate. That gives Australian producers another marketing edge: an ability to guarantee that, if there is a problem, we are able to trace at very short notice the source of contamination or possible disease. God pray it will not happen but, if it does, we are able to trace it quickly and efficiently. If quarantine is required-if an exotic disease has emerged and has arrived on a property by accident-then a particular area or property can be quarantined and dealt with very quickly. We have only to look at the experience of the United States with mad cow disease to understand just how important traceability is today. A number of years ago the beef industry in the United States identified two or three cows that had entered the food chain or had been identiMAIN COMMITTEE fied with mad cow disease. The problem for the beef producers of the United States was that they were not able to guarantee that cattle which could have mad cow disease had not entered the food chain. Importing countries such as Japan then immediately put a ban on the importation of beef from America. That has been a huge advantage to Australia because we have been able to guarantee that our beef on the market in Japan is able to be traced to its source and that this traceability extends to being able to trace its history from property to property and from feedlot to processor to a retail outlet. You have only to look at what has happened in the United States and how they have been kept out of a very valuable market-the Japanese market-to understand that the traceability of animals today is an important issue for us. We have a competitive advantage because of the introduction of the National Livestock Identification Scheme. I am pleased that this federal government injected some $20 million into that scheme to help with the set-up of the infrastructure required for the reading of cattle at saleyards. Some state governments assisted with the subsidy on ear tags, which have an electronic chip in them, and production costs. Unfortunately, our Queensland government failed to a large extent to support our cattle producers in Queensland in relation to the cost of those ear tags. But that is a debate we have had and the beef industry in Queensland will always hold the state Labor government accountable for their failure to support a scheme that was going to guarantee the export status of beef from Australia. In Queensland the beef industry is our second largest export by value, which gives you some idea of the importance of it to Queensland. It is the second largest export by valuesecond only to coal-out of Queensland. It underpins jobs in regional areas, meat works and export shipping terminals, and it is an example of why the livestock identification scheme was so important as part of the brucellosis and tuberculosis identification scheme in being able to identify cattle and individual properties. The principle used, dating back to the eradication of pleuro in Australia and then followed with brucellosis and tuberculosis, was about identification of cattle and properties so that if cattle were identified as part of that scheme they were able to be traced and dealt with accordingly with regard to the eradication of those diseases. I want to conclude by saying that, having been involved personally as a beef producer in the early days of the scheme, happily our own cattle did not read positive in any way to brucellosis or tuberculosis. But having been involved at an industry level and having watched with great interest the challenges that the beef industry right across Australia had to eradicate this disease, I commend the industry. I commend all those who have been involved in it from government, at a departmental level, from producer organisations and the producers themselves, because not only are we winding up this scheme in terms of the levies but that levy will go on to great use for the benefit of the beef industry in a contingency fund. I commend the bill to the chamber. Ms LEY (Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (11.13 am)-I thank members who have contributed to the National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment Bill 2006-the members for Corio, Blair, Lingiari and Maranoa. The conclusion of the Tuberculosis Freedom Assurance Program, TFAP, at the end of this year will mark a significant milestone. Successive campaigns over a number of years have resulted in both brucellosis and tuberculosis being considered to be eradicated in Australia. However, ongoing vigilance will still be required for these and a number of other diseases. MAIN COMMITTEE The National Cattle Disease Eradication Account, NCDEA, has played an important role by holding the moneys used to fund the tuberculosis program and previous initiatives. These funds have been contributed by the cattle and buffalo industries through charges on export of cattle and buffalo and levies on cattle transactions and slaughter of cattle. I stress that funds held in the NCDEA have been derived solely from industry levies and charges and the interest on those moneys. In anticipation of the completion of the Tuberculosis Freedom Assurance Program, the cattle and buffalo industries have requested that residual funds in the National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account be transferred into the more broadly focused Cattle Disease Contingency Fund. This legislation is required to enable the transfer to take place. The cattle and buffalo industries are very aware that, although the threats posed by brucellosis and TB have been reduced, other diseases could have a significant impact on their herds. Transfer of purposes related to cattle health and diseases while still retaining the ability to fund any future activities related to bovine tuberculosis or brucellosis. There are a number of safeguards to protect the use of the funds. These include the fact that the Cattle Disease Contingency Fund is a trust fund. The CDCF was established in 2002 by the Cattle Council of Australia, the Australian Lot Feeders Association and Animal Health Australia in recognition of the ongoing importance of biosecurity matters. The provisions of a trust deed that these bodies have signed outline the financial accountability of the trustee and specifies the use to which fund moneys can be put. Hopefully we can therefore allay concerns the opposition has expressed that this move will reduce the scrutiny and accountability in the use of the funds. That clearly will not be the case. While the legislation allows the transfer of NCDEA funds to the CDCF, I can assure you that this will not occur unless the trustee can demonstrate that full accountability for these funds will be maintained. I anticipate that this will be achieved through an agreement between the trustee and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, which currently administers the NCDEA. The bill enables any funds in excess of what will be required in the future for brucellosis and TB programs to be used in the ongoing work of building a strong biosecurity framework for the Australian buffalo and cattle industries. It has the full support of these industries and will foster their ability to play an active role in maintaining Australia’s animal health status. In conclusion, I congratulate the cattle and buffalo industry on its management of disease risk in its herds and its proactive approach on this issue. It is recognition that the focus has shifted now from diseases which are largely of the past to those of the future, which we obviously have less knowledge about, but we need to maintain security and obviously sufficient funds in accounts should a disease risk occur. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 September, on motion by Mrs De-Anne Kelly: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Bevis moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its failure to provide necessary maritime security and protect Australians, including: (1) its careless and widespread use of single and continuing voyage permits for foreign vessels with foreign crew who do not undergo appropriate security checks; (2) permitting foreign flag of convenience ships to carry dangerous goods on coastal shipping routes; and (3) failing to; (a) ensure ships provide details of crew and cargo 48 hours before arrival; (b) x-ray or inspect 90 per cent of containers; (c) establish and properly fund an Australian coastguard; and (d) establish a Department of Homeland Security to better coordinate security in Australia”. duced last year by the Commonwealth Department of the Environment and Heritage, called Great Southern Land, which examines the maritime exploration of Australia. There is an interesting section on the early protection of Australian sea routes, which outlines how the colonies initially felt comfortable under the protective shield of the British Army and the Royal Navy. It continues: However, as the colonies developed their own economies, and as the demands of the empire changed, Britain began to demand joint funding of defence, then withdrew land forces altogether in 1870, and cut back on its naval presence. In response, the colonies started to build their own tiny navies. The protection of the major coaling stations located on the distant shipping routes at Thursday Island in Torres Strait and at Albany in King George Sound was a defence issue that concerned all colonies, and in 1890 they agreed to co-fund defensive fortifications at these places. Britain offered to provide the ordnance to arm them. We do indeed have a rich maritime tradition. Indeed, our nation’s social history is positively linked with the ocean, from the arrival of the first Australians and the European excursions to our shores to the influx of new Australians by boat from Greece, Vietnam, the United Kingdom and eastern Europe. Unfortunately, the oceans and seas around Australia may also be the source of our most imminent threat. We have a vast coastline, and preventing terrorism in our region requires enhanced cooperation with our neighbours on maritime security. As the Leader of the Opposition has previously stated: Australia is a maritime nation in a maritime region; the world’s largest island, next to the world’s largest archipelago. Increasingly, the problem of terrorism in south-east Asia is a maritime problem. From Jemaah Islamiyah’s bases in the southern Philippines, to the growing menace of piracy in the Malacca MAIN COMMITTEE",181,National Cattle Disease Eradication Account Amendment
257,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (11.18 Am),"I have recently been reading a fascinating book proStraits, and through the traditional smuggling and piracy routes throughout the region, the threat is growing. Since the attack on the French oil tanker the MV Limburg in Yemen in October 2000, the terrorist attacks of 11 September and the Bali bombings of 2002 and 2005, awareness about terrorism has increased. It is recognised that the maritime sector could be a target of terrorism or indeed a vehicle for terrorism. In the view of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, the stakes are extremely high as any important break time in the maritime transport system would fundamentally cripple the world economy. The OECD has previously stated that the government and transport authorities must act to tighten security of the freight container industry in order to reduce the possibility of terrorist attack. More than 80 per cent of goods traded worldwide are transported by sea, much of them in containers. This involves thousands of container vessels and more than 250 million container movements every year. In Western Australia one of the main container terminals used by rail and eventually sea is in my electorate, in Belmont at Kewdale. They move something like one million containers a year. When you consider the possible threat of terrorism in this industry, you realise how big the issue is and how big the problem is. Of course, the vulnerability of cargo containers has been the focus of international policy since the attacks of September 11 in 2001. Although security on ships and at ports has been strengthened in recent years, little has been done to address inland security risks relating to cargo containers. The OECD report notes that security measures should not unduly slow down or block the flow of goods nationally or internationally. In fact, countries have many options. They can increase security and actually facilitate the free flow of trade. Better coordination between transport authorities, Customs officials and police forces can help. The report also advises governments to work closely with transport authorities when designing and implementing security measures. As I said, some good measures have been implemented in this regard and this side of the House supports this bill, but we condemn the government for not going far enough. We condemn the government for its failure to conduct security checks on foreign crews, to ensure foreign ships provide manifestos of crew and cargo before arriving at an Australian port and, most critically, to create a department of homeland security and establish an Australian coastguard to patrol our coastline. The dangers posed to the maritime industry in our region are revealed by the fact that insurance premiums are going through the roof. I refer to a recent report in the New York Times on 24 August. It says: Malaysian commandos captured a freighter after a 17-hour sea chase in the Strait of Malacca, maritime authorities said Wednesday, an event that has sharpened a debate between insurers and shipowners over premiums on voyages throughout the waterway. The commander of Malaysia’s maritime police said that special operations commandos and marine police had recovered a vessel early Tuesday that had disappeared nearly three years ago after being reported as hijacked. After the ship initially sailed on in defiance of orders to stop, the crew of 20 Chinese sailors surrendered without a fight when commandos boarded the freighter from police vessels, he said. The incident comes as many insurers have begun charging extra premiums for ship passengers throughout the strait, one of the world’s busiest seaways, in response to fears of a possible terrorist attack. MAIN COMMITTEE While the recovered ship was linked to piracy, not terrorism, the strength of radical Islamic groups in Southeast Asia is increasingly worrying insurers. Neil Roberts, a technical manager at Lloyds Market Association in London, which helped prepare a list of risky regions that included the strait, said insurers wanted to be financially ready in case an attack occurred. ‘They’re preparing to fund a loss, they’re building up a reserve to fund a loss, if and when that occurs,’ he said. Bombings in Indonesia over the last several years-in Bali and at the Australian Embassy and a Marriott hotel in Jakarta-have focused attention on the country’s radical groups. The risk to insurers has been that terrorists might ally themselves with the many seasoned pirates in Indonesia who conduct attacks on commercial vessels for profit, robbing crew members and sometimes kidnapping them as well. The Joint War Committee, which represents the London marine insurance industry and includes members of both the Lloyds Market Association and the International Underwriting Association, issued a new list of risky regions around the world in June. The main changes were to remove a dozen countries from the list, mainly in the Middle East and West Africa, and to add the Strait of Malacca, the southern Gulf of Thailand and parts of the southern Philippines. Labor supports the general thrust of the bill, because Labor has been calling for urgent maritime security reform for some time. But, unfortunately, as I have said, it does not go far enough. More reforms are urgently needed to improve Australian maritime security. The concern remains that there is essentially no consistency in the federal government’s approach. Australia desperately needs a coordinated, consistent approach to all levels of transport and maritime security. In April 2005, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute published the document Future unknown: the terrorist threat to Australian maritime security. The report states: The basic problem in defence planning is determining how much defence is enough. Similarly, there’s a challenge in providing security against the threat of maritime terrorism: finding the right balance between assessments of risk on the one hand and realistic costs on the other. And there must also be contingency arrangements to deal with higher levels of threat within the assessed warning time. The OTS and ASIO have assessed that there’s a terrorist threat to our shipping and ports, but it’s clear that our resources are quite inadequate to deal with higher levels of threat that could arise with only a short warning. The additional resources committed by the Australian Government have largely gone towards enhancing the infrastructure of its own agencies. Industry and state and local authorities are being expected to provide much of the capacity to deal with and prevent higher levels of threat, while also meeting their basic protection requirements. This is an unsatisfactory approach. Assuming that the Commonwealth accepts its own risk assessments, it must then be prepared to accept a greater part of the financial burden in countering the threat. The report continues: ... there seems to be little testing of maritime security risk assessments and maritime counter-terrorism measures. They’re simply asserted by the Commonwealth, and the private sector and state authorities are expected to comply. This situation is unsatisfactory. There’s a need for greater transparency of the process to avoid excessive burdens being placed on industry and state governments. I agree. Not only do we need greater transparency; we need a change of government to a government with the likes of the member for Brisbane, who understands what is required to best MAIN COMMITTEE protect Australia’s maritime interests and ensure that those vessels entering Australia are not infiltrated with cargo or crew in the pay of Jemaah Islamiah or al-Qaeda. Under Labor’s plan, a department of homeland security would be organised around two core responsibilities: border protection and protecting against terrorism attack within the border. Australia has a mainland border of some 36,000 kilometres. This figure is considerably higher if you include our various islands; although, I am not sure whether, under the current government, we include those islands in our calculations any longer. This is a government that has, of course, a Brisbane-line view of Australia’s security. Only Labor has a plan for Australia’s maritime and border security and integrity. I commend Labor’s view to the chamber. portant bill, the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Maritime Security Guards and Other Measures) Bill 2005, which is an amendment to the substantive bill debated in the House last week. That bill sought to introduce a maritime security framework for Australian ports and shipping and it also dealt with some aspects of foreign shipping in Australian waters. That security framework was subsequently extended to oil and gas facilities in offshore waters by the Maritime Transport Security Amendment Act. As I have said, this bill amends the 2003 act. Primarily, it increases the statutory powers of maritime security guards. Maritime security guards are similar to aviation security guards, with broadly similar qualifications and responsibilities. BeforeI go further into some of the important parts of the bill before us today, I indicate my support for the shadow minister’s amendment to this bill. I would rather outline that amendment now because I think it is significant. As the member for Swan said, whilst we agree that something had to be done-there had to be a response by the government with respect to these very important security matters-we do not think the government has gone far enough. On this side we find that the government fails to match its rhetoric with proper, comprehensive responses to security threats. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would understand that, as would Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, who is about to take the chair. He also understands, as he just said in the debate, that this amendment moved by the shadow minister is very significant in that it highlights the deficiencies in Commonwealth law being proposed today. The first concern raised by the shadow minister that I agree with is that, whilst we support the bill, we believe the government has failed to provide necessary security and protect Australians through its careless and widespread use of single and continuing voyage permits for foreign vessels with foreign crew who do not undergo appropriate security checks. We also believe that there has been a failure to provide the necessary maritime security by permitting foreign flag of convenience ships to carry dangerous goods on coastal shipping routes and, further, a failure to ensure ships provide details for crew and cargo 48 hours before arrival, a failure to X-ray or inspect 90 per cent of containers, a failure to establish and properly fund an Australian coastguard-something that has been a Labor commitment for many a year-and a failure to establish a department of homeland security to better coordinate security in Australia. These deficiencies in the bill are not so significant that we will vote against it, because, as we say, there will be a negligible improvement as a result of this bill being enacted, but we do think that the government must attend to some of the issues we have raised and we think it is tardy of the government, to say the least, not to incorporate some of the recommendations made by Labor in this area. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Maritime Transport And Offshore Facilities Security Amendment Maritime Security Guards And Other Measures
258,Mr Brendan O’connor (Gorton) (11.28 Am),"I am happy to speak to this very imCanI just return to the substance of the bill. This amendment provides maritime security guards with limited move-on powers, including the power to request certain information from a person found in a maritime security zone, and makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to clarify intent. With the purpose of clarifying and increasing the powers to maritime security guards, this bill contains the following provisions: a maritime security guard may request that a person found within a maritime security zone provide identification and reason for being in the zone ... Clearly here the government has identified a concern as to the possible occupation of a person entering a particular area who is unknown to the security guard. I think this example is one where, when the law-makers consider the balance between national security on one hand and individual freedom on the other, the government rightly has indicated that there is a need to make certain assumptions about the presence of particular people in these areas and has placed the onus on those people to explain why they are there and to identify themselves. Further: a maritime security guard may request a person found in a maritime security zone without authorisation to move out of the zone, and if that request is not complied with, remove the person from the zone; and a maritime security guard may remove, or have removed, vehicles and vessels found in maritime security zones without authorisation. Labor is repeatedly on the record as lobbying for specialised security guards at our ports across the country. We believe that those security guards must have defined powers. The maritime environment requires specialised people to ensure that the security we have in place is sufficient. Terrorist threats and organised crime pose real dangers to this country and we believe it is up to the government to ensure that it enacts real measures to combat terrorism. As I said earlier, and as other speakers on this side have raised in this debate, we consider that the Howard government-on occasions at least-is completely ignorant of the terrorism threat by sea. As you, Deputy Speaker Wilkie, said in your contribution to this debate, they talk tough about security but when you examine their so-called policies they are more often than not all form and no substance in attending to the concerns that we have. Particularly in northern parts of Australia, but really in all the large ports, there have been a number of security breaches. Just five years on from the awful events in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, there has been a focus on the potential destruction that can arise from a hijacked plane. It is understandable that the public’s memory of that awful event on 11 September 2001 would have them consider that the greatest threat to our national security in terms of transport would be by plane and have them focus on the way in which we regulate and monitor air transport. But we have to remember that there has been awful devastation, loss of human life and tragic injury caused by explosions occurring on trains and buses in Spain and London. Labor considers that serious threats exist and that we need to secure the way in which ships come into our harbours and into our ports. We know that there are certain explosive chemicals that can wreak havoc if they enter our ports-or indeed the ports of other sovereign nationsunchecked and undiscovered because of the failure to regulate security. We support the government in moving in this direction, but it is wanting; it falls short of a proper response to security at ports across our country. MAIN COMMITTEE I would also like to allude to Labor’s task force on transport and maritime security, which was chaired by the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, this year. Its other members included Steve Gibbons, the member for Bendigo; Dick Adams, the member for Lyons; the chief opposition whip, Roger Price; and senators Glen Sterle and Ruth Webber. That task force enlightened me insofar as the report drafted uncovered some real problems with the failure to secure our ports in the areas that they visited in producing this report. Just to show that Labor not only speaks about these issues but investigates the way in which they should be attended to, that task force visited Perth and spoke to the Western Australian Minister for Fisheries and the Western Australian Fishery Industry Council. It visited Broome in Western Australia and spoke to a whole host of witnesses. While it is likely that most people’s preoccupation with security goes to the potential threat of terrorism, there are some real breaches of our security-and indeed breaches of our laws-in the incursions by foreign fishing vessels which the government seems to blithely ignore. So little of this nation’s resources is being provided to securing our fishing waters, protecting our fishing industry and protecting our borders in relation to fishing by preventing the incursions of those unlawful fishing boats into our waters. I think that, in going to Broome and One Arm Point in Western Australia and to the Northern Territory, speaking to a whole host of witnesses-people and organisations-and discussing not only the security concerns in relation to the potential terrorism threat but also the ongoing threat to our fishing industry and the security breaches that arise from those breaches, the task force showed that we do more than the government does in relation to these matters. The report also shows that. It is also shown by the fact that, whilst we have a series of advisers who sit and listen to the words of both government and opposition members of this place-which I understand is not only their right but their obligation-and yet again I speak on this matter and following me will be the member for Holt and preceding me was your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, we find that the government talks about national security by media release but does not enter into the debate in this place about matters that it says are important to this nation. The government does not think that it is important enough for it to debate some of the amendments that we put together and propose to the government and when we say, in a bipartisan matter, that we believe that we can help improve the bill. Here we are, supporting the substantive provisions of this bill and suggesting in good faith amendments that we think would improve the bill, and in this continuing debate today not one member of the government is responding to these matters. But, of course, what you will have from time to time is the Prime Minister calling a media conference and saying ‘national security’ four times and then closing his doors as he goes back into his office. If government members are genuinely concerned about security matters, why is it that they are never here to discuss them? Why is it that in this place, in this chamber, they fail to respond to the concerns that we have? Surely, if we cannot find some bipartisan positions on national security, what could we find a bipartisan position on? The shadow minister has moved his amendments in good faith. The amendments do not criticise the proposals that would amend the changes, in so far as how they have been outlined, but say that we think it can go further. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you said in the debate, we think they can go further in securing the citizens of this country in a manner that they deserve and, indeed, expect of the government. MAIN COMMITTEE I am disappointed that the government is mute today in relation to this very important area of national policy, particularly following the fifth anniversary of the awful events of 11 September 2001. One would have thought that the government would be sensitive to the concerns of the community, would treat this place with the respect that it deserves, would treat the matter that is being debated now with the respect that it deserves and would engage with the opposition on these matters. I would like to finish by saying once again that we support the bill. It does not go far enough. We ask the government to, in good faith, consider the amendments moved by the shadow minister, the member for Brisbane, because they strengthen this bill, engage the parliament and treat this place and this matter with due respect. port and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Maritime Security Guards and Other Measures) Bill 2005. I welcome the contribution of my colleague the member for Gorton on this matter. I emphasise at the start that there is some concern about the importance of this bill and the fact that there have been so few speakers on the government side who want to make a contribution when the most important priority of a government is to ensure the security of its citizens, particularly as we stare at this bill in the shadow of the events that occurred in New York and Washington five years ago. What happened there was an attack upon a target that was not intended to be hit, and intelligence agencies and governments at the time did not anticipate that an attack of this nature would take place. Some threads ran through some of the intelligence agencies. Consequently, in light of the fact that the strategy of groups like alQaeda and Jemaah Islamiah is to attack the weakest link, the government and we as an opposition, in trying to assist the government, must do everything to highlight measures that we think could be more effective in improving national security. I emphasise again, in the shadow of September 11, five years ago, that we must do everything that we can to protect our citizens. That is our highest national priority. The amendments to this bill that we have introduced we believe would actually strengthen the legislation. To provide a bit of a framework, I operate as the deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and that is a committee that on virtually every occasion in matters of national security has delivered a report with bipartisan support, particularly with the oversight of intelligence agencies. It has dealt with a lot of very controversial issues-ASIO’s questioning and detention powers, for example, and the proscription of terrorist organisations. On every occasion bar one there has been a completely unanimous report. That says that, when they have the opportunity, people of goodwill on both sides can, in the national interest, put their own political interests aside and act for the national good. We believe this bill has deficiencies. We believe that the government, in the way in which it is attacking national security, particularly in areas like maritime security, is not doing enough. So the measures that were put forward in the second reading amendment, which I support wholeheartedly, are suggested improvements to security. I would like to detail those to the chamber at this time. We on this side are obviously not declining giving this bill a second reading, but we condemn the government for its failure to provide the necessary maritime security and protect Australians, which, as I said, should be our highest priority. We are concerned about its careless and widespread use of single and continuing voyage permits for foreign vessels with foreign crew who do not undergo appropriate security checks. We worry about permitting forMAIN COMMITTEE",188,Maritime Transport And Offshore Facilities Security Amendment Maritime Security Guards And Other Measures
259,Mr Byrne (Holt) (11.43 Am),"I have pleasure today in addressing the Maritime Transeign flag-of-convenience ships to carry dangerous goods on coastal shipping routes. We worry about the government’s failure to ensure that ships provide details of crew and cargo 48 hours before arrival, its failure to X-ray or inspect 90 per cent of containers, its failure to establish and properly fund an Australian coastguard-which we believe is appropriate and would do the job, as has been demonstrated by the American coastguard-and its failure to establish, like the Americans, a department of homeland security to better coordinate security in Australia. It is interesting that, when I spoke on another bill of a similar nature in the House last week, the minister responsible, in talking about the US Department of Homeland Security, basically said that it did not work very well, because of Hurricane Katrina. We acknowledge that the system that the US has created is not perfect, but its intent-to create a unified force in the struggle against terrorism-and its implementation by one of our major allies should send a very clear signal to the Australian government. We on this side believe that the only reason that the idea of a department of homeland security has not been adopted is that we put it forward. As I have said before, if a committee that consists of both Labor and Liberal Party members can come up with bipartisan recommendations which the government takes seriously and if it has a proven track record of improving legislation that has been put before it, I find it quite unbelievable-given what I believe can transpire and given the threat level to Australia-that the government can disregard a sensible suggestion in the national interest. I want to talk about the specific provision that we are looking at that would be enacted by this legislation. It follows the 2003 Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act, which introduced a maritime security framework for Australian ports and Australian shipping and also dealt with some aspects of foreign shipping in Australian waters. That security framework was subsequently extended to oil and gas facilities in offshore Australian waters by the Maritime Transport Security Amendment Act 2005. This bill clearly amends the 2003 act, but what we are debating today is a bill that primarily increases the statutory powers of maritime security guards. Maritime security guards are similar in lots of ways to aviation security guards, with broadly similar qualifications and responsibilities. Maritime security guards are required to have a certificate II in security operations, or equivalent training, as the appropriate qualification level. The Maritime Transport Security Regulations 2003 require the guard to have a working knowledge of the act and these regulations. Section 162 of the act already deals with the prescribed training and qualification requirements for maritime security guards. It says: (1) A maritime security guard is a person who: (a) satisfies the training and qualification requirements and any other requirements prescribed in the regulations for maritime security guards; and (b) is on duty at a security regulated port, on a security regulated ship or on a security regulated offshore facility; and (c) is not a law enforcement officer. (2) The regulations must prescribe the following for maritime security guards: (a) training and qualification requirements; (b) requirements in relation to the form, issue and use of identity cards. MAIN COMMITTEE (3) The regulations may prescribe the following for maritime security guards: (a) requirements in relation to uniforms; (b) any other requirements. The Maritime Transport Security Regulations 2003 stipulate: (a) the person: (i) must hold at least a Certificate II in Security Operations that is in force; or (ii) must hold a certificate or qualification that is in force and that is equivalent to at least a Certificate II in Security Operations (for example, a Certificate II in Security (Guarding)); or (iii) must have undergone training and acquired experience while working as a security guard that is sufficient to satisfy the requirements for obtaining a security guard license in the state or territory where the person intends to work as a maritime security guard (the relevant state or territory); (b) the person must hold a licence to work as a security guard, being a licence that was issued or recognised by the relevant state or territory and that is in force; (c) the person must have a working knowledge of the Act and these Regulations, including knowledge about how to restrain and detain persons in accordance with section 163 of the Act. So what powers will a maritime security guard now have under this bill? The bill provides maritime security guards with limited move-on powers, including the power to request certain information from a person found in a maritime security zone, and makes a number of miscellaneous amendments to clarify intent. With the purpose of clarifying and increasing the powers of maritime security guards, this bill contains the following provisions: a maritime security guard may request that a person found within a maritime security zone provide identification and a reason for being in the zone; a maritime security guard may request a person found in a maritime security zone without authorisation to move out of the zone and, if that request is not complied with, remove the person from the zone; and a maritime security guard may remove or have removed vehicles and vessels found in maritime security zones without authorisation. These are all very well sounding and well intentioned amendments. But my question to the House-and I would reflect that there are a number of concerns held within the industry-is whether the training and qualifications of the guards that would enforce these new powers is appropriate. In fact, these people are quasi law enforcement officers, with powers to move on and powers to use reasonable force in certain circumstances. Yet to exercise these significant powers all they are required to have is a certificate II. This level of training is defined by the Australian Standard Classification of Education as follows: Certificate I and II level provides a knowledge and skills base ranging from basic knowledge in a narrow range of areas to basic operational knowledge in a moderate range of areas. My view and the view on this side of the chamber is that we should have specialised law enforcement officers to administer this particular act, because we believe that the most appropriate people to be exercising these powers are qualified law enforcement officers. Certainly, my experience in terms of understanding the security threat in this country is that these people are qualified enough. There has been some level of concern about security guards being used, and yet we know that security guards can in fact police these particular matters. I believe that is a concern. MAIN COMMITTEE The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee was quite critical of the government for proceeding with the legislation before appropriate regulations had been drafted and circulated to all industry participants and all governments, and clearly that is a concern that should be recognised by the parliament. Australians are entitled to question, at the end of the day, whether the security of our ports should be based on a network of private security guards, as the current legislation anticipates. For instance, in their submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill, the Association of Australian Ports and Marine Authorities said: Port authorities and facilities generally employ contractors as security guards. In relation to the level of training provided to those security guards, they said: It is … nowhere near the level of that provided to law enforcement officers, yet, MSGsmaritime security guardsare expected to carry out the duties set out in the Bill. As a previous speaker said in the other chamber: ... security guard will perhaps one day be guarding a council shopping centre and on another day be required to exercise these very important and now significant powers with respect to the policing of our ports. I question whether that is appropriate. We have a network of Australian Protective Services officers which is supervised by the Federal Police at our airports. Given the level of threat-and we know that there is threat to our ports and to our maritime lines-I do not understand why the same measures are not being employed in this area. I have yet to basically understand why that is the case. We have lobbied repeatedly for specialised police at Australia’s ports because, as I have just said, the maritime environment requires specialised people who understand it. That is a concern. The Department of Transport and Regional Services has said in a Senate committee that, when it considers the approval of a single voyage permit, no additional checks are made to look at particular seafarers-that is, the department does not care about the security background of the crews of the foreign ships. The failure of the government in dealing with these matters is, in itself, alarming. As well as careless and widespread use of single voyage permits for foreign crews, most of the containers that arrive in Australia are not scrutinised or checked. The Howard government seem comfortable with their approach of allowing 90 per cent of the containers entering Australia to go unopened and without being X-rayed. Yet, it is interesting that Hong Kong, one of our major trading ports and one of the major ports in the world, is trialling a system where 100 per cent of their containers will be X-rayed. In fact, the Americans are considering doing the same thing. Some time ago, parliament approved arrangements whereby all vessels coming to Australia were to advise the authorities of their cargo and crew 48 hours before they arrived in port. However, only 67 per cent of the containers that arrived in Australia between 13 January 2005 and May 2005 complied with that provision. This effectively means that one-third of all ships that came to Australia during that period did not comply with the requirement, yet the government has done nothing to rectify this. Unfortunately, our corner of the world happens to be one of the worse places in the world for piracy. The greatest incidence of piracy in the world occurs in the waterways to our immeMAIN COMMITTEE diate north-west around Indonesia, Malaysia and the Strait of Malacca. As a matter of interest, two ships a week report pirate activities-that is, they were subject to piracy in the last year. Other countries have recognised this problem. The other place that rivals our corner of the world for piracy is off the coast of Africa. The response of the international community is to work with African countries to set up a coastguard for these nations so that they can deal with this threat. My question again to those on the other side is: why don’t we have a coastguard? There is only one group of people to blame for the failure to implement a properly trained and adequately resourced coastguard, and that is the government. We have again called in a bipartisan way for a coastguard, because we know from looking at overseas experience that coastguards work. No-one should underestimate the threat that maritime security poses to our country. My colleague the member for Melbourne Ports, who is not with us today, has detailed to me some of his private concerns about some of the security breaches that he has seen around the Melbourne port area. If those security breaches had been taken advantage of, major damage could have been caused. We also know that, in terms of the methods used by terrorist organisations, particularly Jemaah Islamiah, that ammonium nitrate is the weapon of choice, because it is very readily available. I am glad to see that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has come into the chamber to discuss this matter. Just for the minister’s edification, we on this side believe that we need one coordinated department to oversee all of these security matters so that we can strengthen our security environment. I support the bill and, in particular, the second reading amendment. I urge the government to do one thing: accept the amendment that we have put forward on a bipartisan basis. We can look at the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security as a model. It is a bipartisan committee that looks at national security issues and classified information, and it arrives at recommendations that it believes are in the national interest. I ask the minister to take the advice that has been provided by this side of the House in the same spirit as those members of the government on the joint intelligence committee and accept the recommendations, strengthen our national security and make our country safer. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.59 am)-My contribution to the debate will be very brief given that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has arrived to sum up. I understand that there are other pressures at the moment, so I will very quickly go over the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Maritime Security Guards and Other Measures) Bill 2005. I will then reflect on the amendment moved by the shadow minister, which I support. This bill amends the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 to define the powers of maritime security guards. This bill will provide maritime guards with limited powers to request a person found within a maritime security zone to provide identification and reasons for being in the zone, to request a person found in the zone without authorisation to move out of the zone and, if that request is not complied with, to remove that person. This bill is one of a series of bills that have looked at improving maritime security. We on this side of the parliament are very supportive of improvements to maritime security. It is a matter of great importance and should be a priority for the government. The opposition also recognise that maritime security is a specialist area and needs guards that are specialists in MAIN COMMITTEE that area. I do not believe that the Howard government has taken maritime security seriously. I believe that its approach to maritime security is flawed and these limited measures in this piece of legislation and measures in other pieces of legislation, including an amendment that went through the parliament last week, are not tight enough. The shadow minister moved an amendment in relation to the use of single voyage permits and continuing voyage permits. I have raised this issue a number of times in the parliament because I am very passionate about the use of these permits. These permits create a situation whereby foreign crews are not subject to the same level of security as Australian crews. You cannot even be assured that the papers that are being presented for those people are accurate. The government has really let the Australian people down in their monitoring of continuing voyage permits and single voyage permits. I can relate to the House, as I have on a number of occasions, my visit to one of these flags of convenience ships that have been granted a CVP and are cruising the coast of Australia. This ship sailed under a Maltese flag, it had a Greek captain and the crew were Burmese. To say that the crew were very nervous of the group that I was with when we visited the ship and that they appeared intimidated and frightened by the captain is an understatement. Those crews are not subject to the same scrutiny as our Australian crews. They do not have to have the maritime security cards that Australian crews do. They do not have to have the same cards or level of identification and security checks that Australian crews and Australian maritime workers have. I do not think it is good enough. The rules that apply for Australians should apply for foreign crews as well. The government has been very careless in its use of CVPs and SVPs, as was highlighted in the amendment moved by the shadow minister, the member for Brisbane. We on this side of the House are very aware of the fact that to a large extent this is being driven by the fact that the government is consumed with a hatred of the MUA. Rather than looking at what is best for Australia, the government, since coming to power, has been more consumed with its hatred of the MUA and trying to get rid of the MUA from the face of the Australian shipping industry. The other issue is the fact that many of these flag of convenience ships, with foreign crew who are not subject to the same scrutiny as our Australian crew, are carrying quite dangerous materials. My predecessor in this parliament was Peter Morris, who was chair of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. He preceded the current chair, the member for Hinkler, who also is a man very committed to this area. When the committee prepared the Ships of shame report, it highlighted the issues that surround those foreign crews. A follow-up international study conducted by a previous coalition minister, Mr Sharp, and Peter Morris produced a report titled Ships, slaves and competition. Once again, that reinforced the facts about the identification of the crews on foreign ships, the conditions they live under and their position of powerlessness. That position has not changed since that period, as the crews sail around the world on the rust buckets that this government continues to issue with single voyage permits. It is not good enough. Until this government addresses that issue, it is not taking maritime security seriously. There is also the fact that the number of containers that are X-rayed is not sufficient. We do not think that is up to standard. The government needs to look at and embrace the Labor Party’s policy of establishing an Australian coastguard. I am very supportive of the amendMAIN COMMITTEE ment moved by the shadow minister in relation to a department of homeland security. We should look at enforcing procedures and laws similar to those in the US in relation to the coastguard and in Hong Kong in relation to the scrutiny of containers. I am very supportive of the amendment moved by the shadow minister. I encourage the minister to accept the amendment and include it as part of the legislation. gin by thanking the honourable members who have made a contribution to the debate on the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Maritime Security Guards and Other Measures) Bill 2005. Naturally the government will not be supporting the amendment but I thank the opposition for their indication of a willingness to support the substance of the bill. Honourable members have raised a number of issues and I acknowledge the work of the honourable member for Shortland’s predecessor in his Ships of shame report, which certainly highlighted areas of concern, although it needs to be acknowledged that that report did not deal so much with security issues. Ms Hall-But there are security issues associated with the issues he raised-that is my point. vessels and the quality of the vessels themselves. The opposition has, on a number of occasions in this and previous debates, endeavoured to present the view that somehow or other foreign seafarers are in some kind of privileged position regarding their rights in Australia compared with Australian crew. It is simply not true to say, as the honourable member for Shortland has suggested, that foreign seamen can wander around in secure zones at seaports in a way that Australian seamen cannot. Everyone going into a secure zone is required to have a card or be escorted. Ms HallMr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The minister is misrepresenting what I said. At no time did I say that foreign seamen were wandering around in secured areas. I said that their presence and the lack of scrutiny of their credentials prior to their ships berthing in Australia and circumnavigating Australia was the issue rather than the issue of them walking around secured areas. secure areas at ports will be required to have a maritime security identification card or alternatively they will have to be accompanied by somebody who does; that will apply irrespective of their nationality. I need to also point out that vessels coming into Australia are assessed for their security risk and there are checks of those on board the vessels. The security risk assessment takes account of all the relevant information about the ship, including its cargo, irrespective of which flag it flies and that assessment is independent of the Customs cargo manifest reporting requirements. I am pleased to be able to report to the Main Committee that overseas vessels coming to Australia have been overwhelmingly compliant with those requirements.

264,The Deputy Speaker,I thought so too.,197,Maritime Transport And Offshore Facilities Security Amendment Maritime Security Guards And Other Measures
265,Mr Truss,"and I welcome her latest statement. The reality is that everyone going intocent of ships were not complying with the law. My advice is that in the last year 100 per cent of ships have complied. There were some in the previous year-half a dozen or so-that did not and appropriate measures were taken to deal with those vessels. But the reality is that ships have been compliant with the crew reporting requirements and I think that that system, whilst it naturally took a little time to be settled into place, is now working well. The honourable member for Holt raised some questions about whether it was appropriate to give powers to maritime security guards and suggested that it would be better if there were specialised law enforcement officers at the ports. The Australian government decided to give maritime security guards the move-on powers to enable them to deal with incursions into maritime security zones promptly in facilities which are sometimes distant from the nearest police presence. The powers are balanced with safeguards to limit any capacity to abuse that power. For instance, when requesting information from a person a maritime security guard must identify himself or herself, tell the person that they are authorised to request the information and advise the person that non-compliance is an offence. It is reasonable to give maritime security guards these new powers to prevent unlawful access to maritime security zones at Australian ports, port facilities and on board ships. Their powers are limited and where more substantial action is required clearly police or other appropriately empowered people will be required to be called upon. So there is a role for police but we think that there are some responsibilities which can be effectively done by maritime security guards, and this legislation is putting in place arrangements to ensure that that kind of service can be provided in this way. The bill strengthens the maritime transport and offshore facilities act by empowering maritime security guards to respond to unauthorised incursions into maritime security zones by persons, vehicles or vessels; authorising maritime security guards to seek information from persons found in maritime security zones, while placing safeguards on the exercise of these information-seeking powers; providing an appropriate offence regime to encourage compliance with maritime security guards’ requests; and providing new arrangements for directing a regulated Australian ship to operate at a higher security level when it is in waters identified as high risk. The need for the additional powers for maritime security guards to remove unauthorised persons, vehicles and vessels from maritime security zones was identified during the government’s comprehensive assessment of Australia’s maritime security policy settings in 2004, and has been agreed by key industry leaders. Further consultation undertaken by my department with the maritime industry security companies, state and territory police, maritime unions and relevant Australian government agencies helped to refine and strengthen the framework for the move-on powers. The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee has conducted an inquiry into the bill. In its report, tabled on 5 September 2005, it accepted the need for the bill and has recommended that it be passed. The regulations to accompany the bill are currently being developed in consultation with the industry, unions and security guard providers. The government looks forward to the passage of this bill to enable the maritime industry to draw upon these powers as soon as possible to enhance the safeguarding of Australian ports and ships. I thank those members who have made constructive contributions to the debate. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. MAIN COMMITTEE now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Brisbane has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Debate resumed from 11 September, on motion by Mr Lloyd: That the House: (1) recognises that local government is part of the governance of Australia, serving communities through locally elected councils; (2) values the rich diversity of councils around Australia, reflecting the varied communities they serve; (3) acknowledges the role of local government in governance, advocacy, the provision of infrastructure, service delivery, planning, community development and regulation; (4) acknowledges the importance of cooperating with and consulting with local government on the priorities of their local communities; (5) acknowledges the significant Australian Government funding that is provided to local government to spend on locally determined priorities, such as roads and other local government services; and (6) commends local government elected officials who give their time to serve their communities. upon which Mr Albanese moved by way of amendment: That paragraph (1) be omitted and the following paragraph substituted: “(1) supports a referendum to extend constitutional recognition to local government in recognition of the essential role it plays in the governance of Australia.”. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (12.18 pm)-I welcome the motion before the chamber today and the amendment that has been moved by the opposition. I was privileged to be part of producing the rather lengthy report that forms the basis of the motion before the parliament today. It is long overdue; the report was tabled in October 2003. I suppose it is a case of better late than never. While the motion before the chamber does mirror what is in the report’s recommendations, it does not go far enough. It certainly does not recognise the complete value that local government adds to our community. When doing the report we adopted, I suppose, a pragmatic view that, yes, constitutional recognition by way of referendum was preferable but, as it was not really within our power as parliamentarians to deliver that, what we could deliver was the motion before parliament today. Local government often feels like the third wheel: ignored by everybody. As one witness in Perth put it most aptly, ‘Local government is the shag on the rock overlooked by everybody.’ We got him to repeat it again because we thought getting that into Hansard was pretty cute. It really did sum it up. Out there in the land of government services, local government was seen as just rates, roads and rubbish. Of course, they are far more than that. One of the difficulties of dealing with this report and going across the country-and you only need to look at the number of submissions we received-was that I think the vast majorMAIN COMMITTEE",197,Maritime Transport And Offshore Facilities Security Amendment Maritime Security Guards And Other Measures
266,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Mcmullan),"The original question was that this bill beity of local government councils at the time of the report, and there were 721, put in submissions. We made a valiant effort to meet with as many of them as we possibly could. I can attest to that because I kept getting on planes that kept getting smaller, and the pilots kept looking younger. We endeavoured to meet with those people out there-the people who have a lot of that face-to-face interface with their communities in delivering services. A big difficulty is: what is local government? What does it actually deliver? Each local government is so incredibly different. You only need to look at the size of the geographical area that some local governments cover. In Perth, some are as big as Victoria and some, like Peppermint Grove, are literally one block. The inconsistencies in the size of areas represented by local governments makes it difficult to actually regulate what they do. Some councils are responsible for airports, some councils are responsible for ports, some councils are responsible for transport and some councils are responsible for sewerage. Other councils have gone into massive service delivery. In my neck of the woods, my two major councils both have retirement villages and nursing homes. They own them, run them and provide the services. In Victoria, councils have taken on a great deal of aged care servicing, so nowadays it is viewed as council’s responsibility. They are actually getting funding from the Commonwealth to provide that service. They are the service deliverer. But they are now seen by the community as the people responsible for that. If something falls over, the council gets blamed. This really is iniquitous because they are just providing the service model. One of the difficulties was actually going around and saying to local governments: ‘What is your job? What should you do?’ Fundamentally, they kept saying, ‘We need to do whatever the community asks.’ That is all well and good if you can fund it and support it. One of the great difficulties is that rates can keep going up and people can keep getting hurt by them. Councils can look for other revenue bases like fines and fees. I can certainly attest that both of the councils in my neck of the woods are getting in a lot of fines-and I am paying the majority of them! So we are out there subsidising the other method of creating revenue for these councils, but it is unsustainable. There needs to be a far more sustainable basis of funding for these local governments so they can provide the vital services their communities demand. But local councils also need to get to the stage of saying, ‘No, this is not our responsibility.’ Just because the state or the federal government puts out a funding model and says, ‘Look, you can tender for this,’ should it be the responsibility of local government to apply for those funding dollars? What happens is that a lot of those funding dollars are offered on the basis of a two-year program. At the end of two years the program is over and there is no more funding, but the local community says, ‘No, that service must continue.’ So what does local government do? It picks up and continues funding that and has to find a revenue base to do that. It is unsustainable. So a lot more recognition has to go into what the role of local government is. During the inquiry we decided that that was virtually impossible for us to quantify and answer, but we did conclude in the final chapter of this report that a way forward was to have a sensible discussion and for all levels of government to ask: ‘What are our basic roles and responsibilities? Where is there overlap?’ It has been estimated by an academic who provided research into the report that about $20 billion is wasted in duplication through the three levels of government. We can have the debate about whether we are overgoverned and whether we should get rid of a tier of governMAIN COMMITTEE ment, although that is probably a long way off. But, at the same time, there is massive duplication. If you have someone who comes into your electorate office and says, ‘I’m looking for assistance with child care,’ you can actually go to three levels of government to find them that assistance with child care. If someone comes and looks for assistance with aged care, you can again go to three levels. A lot of it is duplication. A lot of it is waste. We need to finetune that-we need to sit down and actually work that out. We recommended that the council of ministers come together with an appropriate representative from local government. One of the difficulties in this report was finding out who actually speaks on behalf of local government. Their peak bodies would say, ‘We can only come if we’ve had a motion; we don’t really speak on behalf of them.’ But getting representation for what is now 700 local government authorities to come and actually provide a voice is virtually impossible. A greater sense of who is speaking on behalf of these groups needs to be achieved within local governments so that they can come with a clear voice. The Australian Local Government Association do a good job, but they are limited again in what they can say on behalf of local government. So we need to ascertain who speaks on their behalf. Towards the end of the report which forms the basis of the motion today-in chapter 7, which we titled ‘The way forward’-there is a good quote from an official from DOTARS. He said: The FAGs act is really structured on the basis that local government is a creature of the states. It does not provide a direct relationship in that sense ... To move away from that requires the Commonwealth to take a quite different view of local government, its relationship with it and its governance. That is a debate which really has only just started-it is probably a starting point which the committee’s report will provide some guidance to government on. Yes, it has, and this report does go some way to doing that, but the first step is for the federal government to recognise local government-to say, ‘Yes, local government is a valid part of the governance within our country,’ to give it credence and to then sit down at the table and talk to local government, because the federal government requires a great deal of service delivery through local government. A lot of the reports, submissions and information provided to the hearings were very complimentary of the Roads to Recovery program. When we first started out on this adventure, the member for O’Connor was the minister and he moved that we go down the track of doing this report-and I commend him for it. At the time it was probably a bit of a political swipe at the states, because it was about cost shifting from the states to local government, but we discovered that cost shifting is not just from state government but also from the federal government. There is also a bit of cost shifting back from local government onto both state and federal levels, but it is virtually impossible to quantify that. As the CEO from one of the councils that fall under my area said: ‘Cost shifting happens. Let’s draw a line in the sand. Let’s not worry about trying to redress it. Let’s move on. Let’s work out how we can go forward in a better model of funding, with a better system of distribution of grants to local government so we no longer have this cost-shifting problem. Let’s not have this blame game or this situation where, at the end of the day, the ratepayers are picking up the tab because the only way local government has of finding the shortfall is to increase people’s rates.’ MAIN COMMITTEE There has been a great deal of discussion from the Prime Minister recently about opening up land and ensuring that more land is available for first home owners to purchase homes. In those discussions, the impact that would have on existing infrastructure has not been looked at. It does not look at any of these massive growth corridors. The member for Holt can testify to this probably much better than I can, because my suburb is very well settled, but there was no thought of how you would deal with the services in this urban sprawl-the water problems, the road problems and the sewerage problems. If you build a new suburb, you have to build a new school, child-care facilities and things like that, and the impost falls to local government. There has been no discussion about how local government could pick up those things. The federal government-in its talk, which was a beat-up rather than about taking responsibility for interest rates-had not looked at its responsibility to and its relationship with local government. It is local government that will bear the brunt and, at the end of the day, it will be the ratepayers. I can tell you from various discussions that developers do not want to pick up these costs. It is the ratepayers who will bear them. It is also about our environment and our way of life. In previous Labor governments there were ministers who were passionate about urban sprawl and good design. People such as Brian Howe and Tom Uren did some great work, but that has all gone by the bye. We never see that any more. We never talk about good urban planning, good design and good development; we just have political grabs that suit the purpose of the day. But we need to think about these things. Federal government needs to have a much better relationship with local government so it can put these things in place. Certainly, environmental issues fall very heavily on local government-for example, water conservation. One of the great difficulties that was discussed throughout this report was the system of FAGs and the distribution of funding from the Commonwealth via the Grants Commission to the states. There was a lot of confusion about how it worked, who monitored it and who supported it. The report says that we should go back to basics and reassess how that money is distributed, because some councils have a great revenue base and some rely solely on their FAGs. We need to redress that and to work it out. At the hearings, one councillor from the Maroondah City Council put it this way: At the moment each municipality plays the game of ‘trying to maximise your grant’ at the expense of other councils playing the same game in a scenario where none of them fully understand the rules of that game. This is a recipe for a waste of effort and perennial frustration. And that came through time and time again: the complete, perennial frustration about how grants worked, how they were allocated and who worked it out. The federal government, by recognising local government in this way, now has the responsibility for going back and assessing how those grants are delivered, who actually is responsible for them and how they all work. Some councils are missing out and other councils are doing well. When you have the Brisbane City Council in the same funding pool as a tiny regional council in Queensland, competing for the same set of funds and not knowing what the rules of engagement are, it is very complicated. And it is those smaller councils that are obviously missing out. At the same time, one of the greatest frustrations I have is representing a suburban electorate-where the majority of people live. Often my constituents are very frustrated that there is no such thing as a ‘burbs’ grant. There are rural and regional grants that go on out there, and MAIN COMMITTEE sometimes my constituents get very annoyed that they pay all these rates for all these things but are never recognised as living in an area of need. And sometimes there are areas of need within those suburbs that need to be recognised. Certainly, one of the difficulties is, as I said, quantifying what local government does. One of my local councils run a very effective small business incubator. It is a model that other councils recognise and look at. But is that the role of local government? They have decided that it is. There was a void there that state and federal governments were not filling. They run this very successful small business incubator that has now produced some great small businesses in our area which have been able to move out into their own premises. We need to go back to basics and say, ‘What is it that the levels of government do?’ so that we are not having this duplication and this constant moving about on where to go and what to do. As one of the other councils put it, councils are also stepping back from accepting infrastructure grants because they also need to determine what their roles and responsibilities are. I will quote again the Mayor of the Bega Valley Shire Council. He said: We basically said as a council, ‘It is fine to get the funding for some new infrastructure-a new toilet block or a new boardwalk or whatever-being matched fifty-fifty, but do we really need that or are we better using that $100,000 or $200,000, or whatever the matching figure is, to do something that the community really needs, like fixing the roads or upgrading some old timber bridges?’ We made a conscious decision to reduce the matching grant funding and use it for only stuff we really need rather than stuff that looks nice and maybe has a nice community feel. And that is one of the hard decisions that local government needs to come to. I always say to councils in my electorate that they have a much harder job than I have. They do it part time, they get paid nothing and they are generally the ones abused at local functions-whereas we can swan around and get away without facing that absolute abuse. Most people know who their local councillor is, because when the rubbish has not been picked up they are the person who gets the blame. They are the ones that really take it on the chin. I think councils need to decide what their main game is, instead of accepting funding that they cannot use or that they accept and then need to continue. I commend the motion and the amendment moved by the opposition to the chamber. (Time expired) that lacks the sorts of initiatives I would have appreciated as a result of the inquiry, the so called Hawker committee, that the member for Chisholm spoke about at some length. I congratulate her and the members of that committee on their diligence in taking that inquiry upon themselves and reporting as they did to government. The greatest deficiency, not in their efforts but in the report, is that local government did not make a case for the clearly defined responsibilities and services they thought they would be best placed to provide to the Australian community, and whence the financial resources to do those tasks might come. Notwithstanding that an intergovernmental agreement has been reached, as recommended by the committee, it seems to be a fairly fluffy arrangement from my perspective. The minister advises us that the agreement addresses cost shifting by obtaining in-principle agreement from governments that, when a responsibility is devolved to local government, local government is consulted and the financial and other impacts on local government are taken into account. There is nothing wrong with that. For instance, when state governments MAIN COMMITTEE",199,Local Government
267,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (12.33 Pm),"This is an important statement but, I must say, onepass legislation that says that health surveyors will go out and monitor some new piece of state legislation, that can be costed, presumably, if we are lucky. The reality is of course that cost shifting has evolved simply by default. State governments in particular have had a habit of just not doing things. There has been debate in this chamber about it. I note that the member for Lalor this morning put a case that the Australian government should have total responsibility for health services. I wonder how that might change the fact that, of my 50 local authorities, 90 per cent are obliged to have a very significant budget commitment to keeping a doctor in town. We say that local government has moved on from roads, rates and rubbish, but that was the fundamental responsibility that was accepted when people said that local government was a creature of the states. They evolved as service organisations of great width and had primarily only one source of money: the rates they levied on their ratepayers. Then of course they got moneys from state governments in certain areas, and the minister’s speech gave us clear evidence of the volatility of those sorts of grants. They go up by 80 per cent and then crash by 60 per cent; how a local authority can budget in those circumstances, I do not know. By comparison, the Whitlam government-and let me give credit to them-introduced the FAG Scheme, as we know it. I had the privilege, I guess, of being a state grants commissioner during my 16 years in local government prior to coming to this place. I was one of the first grants commissioners. Careful consideration is constitutionally necessary when the Australian government makes an allocation of funding. The Commonwealth Grants Commission decides how the money will be distributed to each state under the formula, and then a state grants commissioner decides how it will be granted to each local authority. When it came to R2R we as a government quite wisely went around that system and created a formula, and we have distributed the funds accordingly. Local government consistently reports to me. I did a stint as a local government minister when I commissioned the report and everybody said how pleased they were with the simplicity of managing those funds. That was as important to them as the money itself. Many complained about the complexity involved in servicing state grants for roads. I think that one councillor said to me that they had two full time staff doing the paperwork relevant to state grants for roads and, in fact, they had nobody specifically allocated to dealing with R2R. Historically, the Commonwealth has also managed to load responsibilities onto local government not so much by default but by generosity. We have some wonderful schemes. We might give a sports operator a three-year funding package or some other package, at the end of which we say: ‘There you are. You have had your money.’ By this time the community has got to like this particular service, whatever it might be, and so it devolves to local government to continue its operation. Whereas state governments have cost-shifted to local government by default-and I do not see anything in this new intergovernmental agreement that prevents that-the Australian government sometimes, by generosity, has done the same thing. This thing is going nowhere. Let me say at this point in time, for practical reasons: I do not support the opposition amendment proposing that we have another referendum on constitutional recognition of local government. I always thought the question was meaningless anyway. They virtually told local government that they exist, and I do not think that is the question. There is an established precedent now, and the minister’s speech has a mass of references to the amount of funding that is distributed directly to local government by the AustraMAIN COMMITTEE lian government and spasmodically by state governments. The reality is that that is what local government needs. It gets very little constitutional recognition but it has always put its faith in that, when in fact what it needs is money and a clearly defined intergovernmental agreement that identifies the services that local government should provide-in my view, to the exclusion of other providers. Historically, and in most parts of the world, local government is the provider of local education services, local health services and, I might add, local police services. In my life in local government in Western Australia, for almost the entire period, country local government operated the vehicle licensing system. We issued the licences, we kept the money for our roads and we were obliged to employ a traffic inspector. I have to say, social life in country towns was a lot more comfortable in that period, depending a bit on the attitude of the council. Our attitude was that the man was there to control traffic, not to collect fines. We would go for months without the reporting of a prosecution. The town of Carnarvon was somewhat isolated. It was a bit different to my electorate now, where one shire adjoins another, but the reality was that the traffic inspector’s job was to make sure, under the observation of the elected councillors, that the flow of traffic and the behaviour of drivers were of a satisfactory level. Were one to check the accident crash statistics or the death statistics when that system prevailed, in a positive sense, they were probably quite as good as they would be today with three or four police constables carrying on in the way that they are obliged to do to make sure that they get their total prosecutions each week. Those sorts of things are typically the responsibility of local government in many parts of the world. What is wrong with an intergovernmental agreement clarifying what you look after? If you are paying 70 per cent of the costs of keeping a doctor in town, why not pick up 100 per cent of the responsibility and then be recognised in the funding packages that come from the Commonwealth or the others so that you do it? I make the point using a local example in Western Australia. We have a very large state government hospital called Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. I do not see that as a responsibility of the City of Nedlands in which it is located. WhatI am talking about are local hospitals, local schools and local policing problems. I think that local government should have the responsibility in those areas. As minister I told them so. They certainly did not ask for and they certainly did not get the sorts of recommendations that consequently came out of the committee of inquiry, the Hawker committee. We have all this triplication by the three arms of government. The question is: who would do it better? There is a very interesting situation in a geographically large state like Western Australia: very few people in Western Australia-it does not matter who is the political party in power-vote for the minister for health, the minister for education or the minister for policing, but they know who the shire president or the mayor is and they certainly know how to take revenge on them if they think certain services are not up to an acceptable standard or are not being delivered in the fashion they would prefer. I think this parliament and all governments, whether state or federal, should have an intergovernmental agreement that says: ‘This is my territory. This is what I am responsible for.’ Once that territory is defined, I think there are huge opportunities for local government to be able to do that. Ms Hall-I would like to ask the member a question, if I could. Could the member tell me whether or not he would support as a better working model a system that was basically MAIN COMMITTEE stronger with, instead of the three levels of government, the Commonwealth and then stronger regional bodies? impossible. We have got to remember that the states-or the colonies, as they were-created the federal government and they wrote pretty precise rules. I do not believe that is achievable, as I am concerned about the achievability of constitutional recognition. I would say, ‘Why bother?’ It is an expensive business. Money is the strength of power. There is no limitation on the two Big Brothers of government, if you like, getting together and saying, ‘We think town X would better run its own hospital.’ We used to have hospital boards in my electorate. But let them run it through local government and, instead of talking all the time about how we want to make local government bodies bigger-and I think there are difficulties with that-give them more jobs to do. I said that to one shire clerk or chief executive, whatever he was, in one country town, and he said, ‘I don’t know if we could manage the hospital.’ I asked, ‘How many staff have you got?’ And he said, ‘Sixty.’ I asked, ‘And how many staff has the hospital got?’ And he said, ‘Forty.’ I said: ‘So where is the problem? Your payroll system and everything can deal with that. And, if your councillors or whoever can interview and appoint a chief executive, why can’t they do the same thing with a director of nursing, for instance?’ I am just putting this forward. It is theoretical. I welcome the minister’s statement, but it does not say much. I welcome the report and I have criticised publicly-I wrote letters-local government for not putting their hand up during that inquiry to say, ‘You tell us what we are and give us some responsibilities that around the world local government does very well, and make sure that the funds that are shared by the Australian government in particular be available in a measurable way.’ As I said, there will always be a role for state governments in running major hospitals. But they will not send doctors out to the bush, because they cannot get a Medicare number, so why not let the local government do that and let probably this parliament make funding arrangements that would assist them in that process? Then they can make some regional arrangements if they like; they do so to some degree in other areas. I think local government is wasted. It does not have funding certainty. It needs both responsibility and funding certainty. (Time expired) Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.48 pm)-I would have to agree with the last statements that the member for O’Connor made in relation to funding and certainty. I think that they are big issues for local government. Like the member for O’Connor, I have history in working for local government: I was on Lake Macquarie City Council for a term, for four years, and I experienced many of the problems that have been raised in this debate on the minister’s statement. BeforeI get to the bulk of my contribution to this debate, I would just like to home in on the health issues. The member for O’Connor spoke about some of the initiatives that local councils have taken in the area of health. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, of which I am a member, were in Western Australia earlier this year and we had councils come along and give evidence to the committee. They detailed for us how they had built houses for doctors, dentists and physiotherapists, how they were supplying them with cars and how they were giving them a guaranteed base income just in case they did not manage to earn the required amount. MAIN COMMITTEE",203,Local Government
268,Mr Tuckey,"I accept that question and I think I probably would be supportive of theI was very impressed with the initiatives of these councils; I thought they showed a true dedication to their community. But that also raised some questions in my mind as to why local governments are having the cost of providing health care shifted to them when this is actually a federal government responsibility. The federal government should ensure that these townsthe people who live in these towns, these local government areas-have access to health services that they need. Local government is a very important level of government. People do not realise and respect the contribution that local government makes to the functioning of our nation. It is the level of government that is closest to the people, it is the level of government that is most accessible to the people and it is the level of government that deals with the everyday basic issues that make people’s lives bearable. The member for O’Connor mentioned the three Rs: roads, rates and rubbish. Yes, they have always been the core responsibility of local government. But over the years it has really diversified. Throughout the country you will find that in different states the responsibilities of local government are very different. Quite often local governments are asked to perform these duties and provide these services with inadequate funding. Yes, the main source of income is rates, along with financial assistance grants-which, I might add, have steadily declined as a percentage of the budget since 1996. At that time, 0.9 per cent of FAGs were provided by the Commonwealth; in 2007 it will be a bit over 0.7 per cent, and by 2010, if it continues to go this way, it will be 0.5 per cent. Both federal and state governments-I do not want to leave the states out in my contribution-need to make bigger contributions to local government. They need to recognise the importance of local government and the issues that it deals with on a daily basis. WhilstI was sitting here I quickly jotted down a few of the issues that local governments have to deal with. More and more, welfare is becoming a role of local government. My colleague the member for Holt, in Victoria, noted that local government in that area provides aged care, myriad health services and myriad other welfare type activities. I think it is even a direct providercorrect me if I am wrong-of home and community services. That is very different from New South Wales. In New South Wales local governments are still responsible for providing services for youth and elderly people. All councils support and promote sport and sporting activities; they ensure that there are proper playing fields and that there is access to those playing fields for young people. They are constantly providing facilities in the community for the use of community members: halls, public toilets, you name itthe little things that people tend not to think about. And of course there are libraries. Libraries are one of the real responsibilities. They are very important within the communities that we all represent here in parliament. I should quickly mention initiatives that have been taken in both the local government areas that fall within the Shortland electorate-Wyong shire and Lake Macquarie. They have programs where parents can come along and read to their babies. This is creating a love of books and learning that will follow those children through life. I am sure that also happens in other areas. The role of planning the kind of community that we live in falls to local government. For example, the decision about whether a certain area will be developed, whether an aged-care facility will be built or whether there will be sufficient parks belongs with local government. They are planning issues. In the electorate I represent in this parliament, those planning issues are often the subject of a lot of focus within the community because there is a tension between MAIN COMMITTEE development and the protection of the environment. That is something that local government has to evaluate and study. Once those studies are completed, they have to be put out for community consultation and, when they come back to the council, it makes a decision as to whether or not a particular development will go ahead. That has an enormous impact on the lives of the people living in that community. Recently within my local government area there has been a move towards urban consolidation, so the height level of buildings has been increased from four to six storeys along the waterfront areas of Lake Macquarie. There was concern within the community, and after due process, including consultations, the local government had to make a decision about the type of development that would be permitted. My speech today is not critical of local government; rather it puts on the table the kinds of issues that local government has to contend with. A very sensitive development proposal came across both councils, and the councils rejected that because it was going to lead to wholesale clearing of pristine bushland. As Sydney and Newcastle are very much joined together, it was felt that some green areas were needed, so both councils rejected this development and the developer took the councils to the Land and Environment Court. That is another issue for councils because, when they make these decisions, quite often they are subject to legal action. The councils were successful in their bid to reject that development. All the time, local government is dealing with the tension between development and the need to protect the environment. Councils always need to be very mindful that, if their decision is rejected and the developer takes them to court and they lose, it will cost the ratepayers a lot of money. It is a very important role of local government. Both Wyong Shire and Lake Macquarie are high growth areas. Wyong Shire has had a number of issues associated with water and infrastructure. The councils grapple with those issues. Lake Macquarie City Council has always had responsibility for Lake Macquarie, which is the largest salt water lake in the Southern Hemisphere. Over the years there have been problems with siltation as a result of the development around the lake, as well as a number of other problems-once again, tension between development and the environment. I think that the approach that has been adopted there, where an agreement was reached between the state government, the local council and relevant departments to fund remediation work in Lake Macquarie, could be used as a model for levels of government working together. Generally speaking, at the local government level those people involved are interested in working with federal and state governments and forming an ongoing partnership with them and with local communities. Unfortunately, when it comes to both the Commonwealth and the state, there tends to be a blame game-the silo mentality. I encourage the minister to look at really working in partnership with local councils-not moving a motion like this, which I think is really an attempt to have a go at the states, but truly acknowledging the role that local government plays and the benefit to Australia as a whole of working with local government. I would like to acknowledge the success of the Lake Macquarie City Council in winning an award for Over 55 and Understood. Both local government areas have fairly elderly populations. The Shortland electorate has a high proportion of people over the age of 55. In this project, businesses met with the council to look at ways of recognising the significant contribution of older people and at how businesses can work with older people, embracing them not as a burden to their communities but as an opportunity. They looked at how older people’s conMAIN COMMITTEE tributions could be used as an opportunity and how businesses could link into the opportunity that having an elderly population could provide. This is an important motion, as is the amendment. I support the amendment moved by the member for Grayndler. One of the biggest problems I as a councillor found was that the bureaucracy and the elected body were nearly one. I believe that if local government were to become a true level of government then it would have a different approach. The bureaucracy and the elected body would be separate and there would be proper recognition of the role of local government and the contribution that local government makes to Australia. The question I asked the member for O’Connor really reflects my own position on that matter. I think that Australia would benefit greatly by having stronger regional bodies and a stronger role for local government. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Hartsuyker) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.04 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Defence Force Recruiting Centres (Question No. 3072) Has his (a) office and (b) department undertaken research into the average time taken by Defence Force Recruiting Centres to consider and approve applications by men and women to enlist in the armed services; if so, what does that research indicate. (a) No. (b) According to research undertaken by Defence, the average length of time taken to consider and approve applications was 31 weeks and is now 30 weeks. Sugar Industry Reform Program 2004 (Question No. 3824) Mr Katter asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 8 August 2006: (1) Is he aware of the hardship caused by the tax treatment of those canefarmers who have applied for the re-establishment grant component under the Sugar Industry Reform Programme 2004, opting to stay on the land in an alternative industry; (2) What will he do to alleviate the tax burden on canefarmers exiting the industry through the re-establishment grant; (3) For what reason has the Government decided to tax the re-establishment grant. (1) Unlike other exit programmes administered by the Australian Government, such as Farm Help, the re-establishment grant component of the Sugar Industry Reform Programme 2004 provides assistance to those farmers who may not wish to sell their farm but would still like to exit the sugar industry. As a result, cane growers are also able to access the grant, albeit on a taxable basis, if they exit the sugar industry either by leasing their land or diversifying into another agricultural operation. This is not possible under other exit programmes. Cane growers who sell their farm and leave agriculture altogether can apply for a tax free grant. This is the same treatment that applies to farmers who exit agriculture altogether under the Farm Help programme. However, re-establishment grants for the sugar industry operate with the most flexible assets test of any similar arrangement and provide the highest grant payment of $100,000 compared with $50,000 under the Farm Help programme. (2) Cane growers who sell their farm and leave agriculture altogether can apply for a tax free grant, consistent with the provisions of other exit programmes such as Farm Help. The fact that growers who exit the sugar industry by diversification into another agricultural operation or by leasing their farm can also obtain assistance, albeit on a taxable basis, is a significant additional benefit compared to those farmers who exit other agricultural industries under similar programmes. Re-establishment grants for the sugar industry also operate with the most flexible assets test, and the highest grant payment, of any similar arrangement. The Government is not in a position to provide additional concessions under the programme.",206,Local Government

271,Mr Mcgauran,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Cane growers who sell their farm and leave agriculture altogether can apply for a tax free grant, consistent with the provisions of other exit programmes such as Farm Help. However, the re-establishment grant component of the Sugar Industry Reform Programme 2004 also recognises the importance of helping farmers to move to another agricultural operation and still qualify for a grant. Providing a taxable grant in these cases maintains the objective of the programme and also provides additional assistance for those farmers in the most severe financial difficulties to establish themselves outside the sugar industry. This is consistent with the treatment of grants to individual farmers under other schemes, which are normally taxable unless specified otherwise under relevant legislation. The provision of tax free grants to farmers who exit agriculture altogether also recognises that they are highly unlikely to return to the sugar industry, as may occur with many who exit through leasing or diversification. Superannuation (Question No. 3864) Is it the case that an employee is unable to pursue superannuation entitlements against a company in liquidation as a result of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s determination that such an employee is not the creditor for the purposes of such recovery, but rather the debtor is the Australian Taxation Office; if so, will the Government consider amending or reforming this area of the law. When a company is being liquidated because it is insolvent, proofs of debt are lodged with the liquidator and the task of determining who is a creditor falls to the liquidator of the company, not the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. A liquidator may accept or reject a proof of debt, in whole or in part. A creditor dissatisfied with a decision by a liquidator to reject all or part of a claim may appeal to a court. Ultimately the question of who is a creditor is a question of fact and law to be determined by a court. Where superannuation contributions are owed to an employee, the employee can lodge a proof of debt for the unpaid contributions. Where the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has determined the employer has a superannuation guarantee charge (SGC) liability, the ATO can also lodge a proof of debt in respect of that SGC liability. The Government has announced that it proposes to clarify the status and priority of the SGC in insolvency. Amendments will ensure that SGC attracts the highest priority, along with wages and superannuation, that employee entitlements enjoy under the law. It is expected that the Government will be releasing draft amendments for public comment later in 2006.",210,Questions In Writing
