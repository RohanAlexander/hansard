Without dwelling upon the subject, the position remains that if the Tariff had had to be dealt with this session, it would have been impossible, I believe, for the late Administration to be constituted or for the present Ministry to be formed to carry out that task. We stand here as the trustees of the people of Australia, to see that the decision which they arrived at, and which has been acknowledged by the leaders of the three parties in this House, and which was never repudiated by any honourable member at the time different. The question is a possible torpedo now. to make our position perfectly clear. So long as we occupy the Government benches we shall see that the decision of the electors is honorably respected.

Surely honourable members do not wish to be quite so erratic as to suggest that when the Prime Minister made his statement to the press he was under the inspiration of any member of the Opposition. My honourable friend the late Prime Minister weighs his words, and acknowledges now that they were uttered. I am speaking' at present only of the late Prime Minister's own statement. most public way he stated that the. issue before the House was a vital one; that if the Bill were* not altered-I do not say in any particular way at present in respect of that amendment-the Government would take a certain course. Therefore the House did not make the subject of the crisis; but the Government made it, and when the matter came on the House had made up its mind so clearly that it would not recede from the position it had taken up on a particular amendment that it found it unnecessary to take up any time further than that occupied in expressing its refusal to reconsider the clause. That was the shortest possible way for those who had made up their minds not to alter the clauseopportunities for further usefulness had to express their opinion. supposed that the Prime Minister, when he attached such significance to the position, was really so sure of winning that it did not solution of this House, and I take the full matter what he said. I am sure that my honresponsibility for the course which I orable friend did not take up any such posiadopted. I was not, of course, igtion at the time that he made the amendment vital. He knew that the result might be what it has actually been. Therefore, the fact must stand that the crisis arose through victions, was a small one. I am just as conthe deliberate choice of Ministers themselves. Every member of the House except the Speaker in the chair expressed his opinion upon a vital issue, the significance of which was fully understood. Thirty-six honourable members voted, or paired, with the Government, and 38 voted, or paired, against the Government, so that the full number of 74 members out of 75 deliberately recorded their opinions. Well, the Government acted consistently with the position taken up by the Prime Minister. After the vote,' my honourable friend the Prime Minister considered his position, and. tenunfit to proceed any further with the transdered certain advice to His Excellency the Governor General. The decision' of His Excellency upon that advice is a matter with which we have nothing to do. In exercising the Royal Prerogative His Excelif lency is not responsible to us, but to the Sovereign. Having been sent for by His Excellency I was placed in this position: Mr Reid. The: Prime Minister' having advised the dissolution of the House, if I . considered the dissolution of the House at that time the proper course, and that all opportunities of further usefulness in this House had been destroyed, it would have been my duty to refuse to undertake the task of forming"" an Administration, on the ground that I concurred, with the advice conveyed by the In the Prime Minister, and believed that this House was incapable of further useful work. Rightly or wrongly, however, I took a different view. I remembered that the House had been in existence for only eight or nine months. I remembered also that the subject upon which this difficulty had arisen was not a great question of national politics, but merely involved the difference in the working of a principle which the House had adopted. It was not a matter of principle at all, but a question as to the degree to which a principle which the House had adopted should be carried. Clearly it seemed to me that no useful object would be served by dissolving the House, unless I was satisfied that our It is not to be been exhausted. In assuming the task of forming an Administration I took the view that the time had not arrived for a disnorant of tEe fact that the majority which had voted, as it had the right to vote, in accordance with its own conscious of that fact now as I was then. There was no snatch division. I admit at once that if the thirty-six honourable members who voted with the Government on that occasion are determined to reduce this House into such a condition that there is no further prospect of useful legislation, they are in a position to do so. I admit that in a Chamber of this kind, the difference between thirty-eight and thirtysix members is such that it would be impossible for any Government to carry on useful legislation if a minority so closely approaching equality with the majority had made up their minds that the House was action of public business.

I am prepared to admit that if a very large minority almost approaching equality with the majority are determined to bring about the termination of the existence of this House they can effect their object. Sir able gentleman cannot dictate to the Governor General when he is to dissolve the House. bers will excuse me if I have not made my meaning clear.

I hope that my honourable friend will understand that I feel it my duty at present to state fully and frankly my view of the circumstances which led up to the present change it should continue to exist. in the administration of public affairs. I some little time we were in a desire to say that this, in my opinion, represents something more than a mere change between the occupants of one set of benches and the occupants of another set of benches. It represents something more than the mere shuffling.of the Ministerial cards. I should like my honourable not take much part in the game.

The people of Australia are entitled to a f u l l explanation at the present time from both sides of the House, and I am anxious, therefore, to deal with one or two questions which cannot be decided here, but can only be fought out before the electors. I wish to point out in an unmistakable way the difference between the two parties in this House. I claim th'af in some respects there are points of resemblance. I claim that the coalition which sits on this side of the House is just as democratic and as liberal as are those honourable members who claim the patent.

136,Mr Reid,"As I have been associatedin reference to the Transcontinental Railway, there was a state of feeling, an understanding amongst the Premiers of Australia, which would make the refusal to conduct a survey to ascertain whether the project is reasonably practical, something like a shameless breach of an undertaking. That is my deliberate opinion. I feel very strongly about this matter, because I have been a member of all the conferences of Premiers which have been held from first to last, and I have heard every word that has been spoken between the Ministers. If the House were to refuse the reasonable request for a proper survey, so as to have the proposal thoroughly tested in a practical way, it would be treating the great State of Western Australia in a manner which, I should think, was to be greatly regretted. of Premiers? the honourable member to the Premiers' Conferences.

It will be impossible to properly assume control of these Departments without the fullest consultation with the different State Governments, in order that the change may be brought about gradually, and in a spirit of co-operation. Honourable members know that a large number of questions are still open, as between the States Governments and the Commonwealth. Take, for instance, the question of the! transferred propertiesa matter of the utmost importance, which is riot yet settled. attempt has been made to settle it. but am simply stating that the question has not yet been settled. The basis upon which the valuation is to be made has not yet been decided. That matter may have to be submitted for legal determination. There is also the question of the public debts, and there are a number of subjects in which the interests of the States, and of the Commonwealth are identical, and upon which we shall confer with the States Governments during, the recess, in order to bring about a better understanding. number of subjects upon which we should have uniform legislation, such as banking, insurance, copyright, and quarantine. need not mention these and other matters at present, because' they do not belong to the business of the present session; but there are a number of highly-important subjects for Commonwealth legislation, which must be taken up at the first convenient opportunity. I think I have! made a perfectly full, and candid statement of the course which Ministers intend to take with reference to the public business. honourable gentleman sits down, I wish to ask him a question. ber must know that he cannot ask questions at this stage. He will have an opportunity later. haustive speech of the right honourable gentleman, about the length of which, I am sure, none of us can complain, because when the right honourable gentleman came to the subject, he was commendably brief, I think that the Government might very well agree to allow honourable members a little time for consideration. of the Opposition has a majority of five behind him? 7 M being magnanimous in these matters. the Prime Minister has cast upon members of the Opposition, he is not entitled to any consideration. journment until to-morrow, in order that some consideration may be given to the statement of the Prime Minister, and I , therefore, move That the debate be now adjourned. rather amused at the leniency which is being shown by the leader of the Opposition. Under ordinary circumstances, no doubt, it would have been quite right for the leader of the Opposition to allow the Government another day's graceI might, if I chose to follow the example of the Prime Minister, also add the words, "" and allow them to draw another day's pay."" I shall not, however, be mean enough to make any reference to such a matter. When the Prime Minister talks about our being mere puppets, Then there are a I think it is time for us to proceed to extremes. I do not wish to act contrary to the wishes of the leader of the Opposition, I but I feel very strongly upon this matter. I think that we, at least, have the right to expect courtesy at the hands of the right honourable gentleman. I feel very much inclined to call for a division, and to defeat the Government on the very first day that they have met this House. surprised that the leader of the Opposition should move the adjournment of the debate, because the Prime Minister has right said nothing new. He has told us that we have been in session for six months, and that we have done little' or no business, and yet it is now proposed to waste still further time. The delay which has taken place in carrying out the work of the House has been due to the protracted speeches which have been made when short ones would have sufficed. I have endeavoured to express my views on any subject as concisely as possible. The Prime Minister, in putting the policy of the 1 Government before the House, has not told us of anything that is new, and those who desire to discuss his declaration should at once do so, so that the stigma cast on honourable members that with us "" it is all talk and no business "" may be removed.
