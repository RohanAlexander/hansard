AIR FORCE RECRUITIAG . for A i r give to the House the latest information in relation to recruiting for the A i r Eorce, particularly with respect to the classes which already have long waiting lists, and those classes for which men are required immediately? that recruiting for the A i r Force has been most satisfactory. Recruiting depots have been set up by the recruiting directorate of the Department of A i r , and there has been a voluntary organization, on a Commonwealth-wide basis, with strong committees in every State. This organization has been effected hy a central committee of notable flying people, under the chairmanship of Sir Donald Cameron. I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the splendid work that has been done by Sir Donald Cameron and his committee. It is a continuation of tbe wonderful service which Sir Donald has given to this country in war, in this Parliament, and in other spheres. The flow of recruits into the Air Eorce recruiting depots has not only provided adequate personnel in every sidered to be desirable. From now on, the chief problem in connection with recruitcategories, there are 63 musterings, in only four of which any considerable honourable flow is at present required.

One of the .great difficulties has heen. that men without trades, or tradesmen not urgently required at present, have .been offering in such large numbers that the job of dealing with gate the possibility of still further the men who are wanted has been made difficult, and irritation and disappointment have resulted. 'What is necessary now is that .the public shall be informed o| the classifications that are definitely needed, and the qualifications required of applicants. For that purpose, an experienced newspaperman has been appointed as Director of Public Eelations. His job will he to provide the State committees with day-to-day information of the immediate requirements of the Air Force, iii form suitable for publication, thereby enabling people to know the kind of men that are wanted, as well as those who are not wanted at the moment. His appointment should remove many of the difficulties which have arisen. Mistakes also have undoubtedly been made hecause of lack of experience on the part of the recruiting officers, but the position is improving from day to day. Minister for Air whether it is not possible to expedite the examination of Air Force recruits? complained to me that he had volunteered three months ago to serve in the Air Force, but that he had heard nothing since. He was anxious to know what the authorities were going to do about his application hecause, if they were not going to accept him in that capacity, he would join the Australian Imperial Force. When I made representations on his behalf, I received a letter stating that the man's application had been received, and that he would be called up for an interview in three months' time. though an extreme one, having regard to the length of the delay, is not, unfortunately, unusual. The interviewing of applicants could he expedited quite a lot if it were possible to duplicate the interter for Air whether it is a fact that viewing committees. The present rate of taking in trainees is limited by the medical staff available. The examination of recruits for the Australian Imperial Force is making a heavy demand upon the medical profession. ""We already have engaged 200 medical and dental .officers, and this .number must be increased to 400. I shall investiincreasing the medical staff so that the examination of Air Force recruits, which takes over an hour for each man, may he expedited. I admit that the delays that have taken place have worried me a great deal. I ask honourable members to bring specific cases of this kind under the notice of the recruiting officers in the capital cities. this instance the matter cannot he expedited. It is well, however, to bring such matters under notice in case the application has heen overlooked. It must be realized that the clerical staff has had very little experience, and it is possible that mistakes may be made from time to time. that a large number of recruits is clamouring for enlistment in the Royal Australian Air Force, will the Minister for Air take steps immediately to have Recently, a man enrolled a further 115 trainees, to he stationed at Archerfield, where, at the present time, there is the necessary equipment, although there are only 45 trainees and 44 instructors? being taken into the Air Force according to plan, and as the facilities become available under the expansion of the training organization. I shall look into the position with respect to Archerfield, which will' shortly cease to be used for training purposes. It is not desirable to say exactly what is the intended function of every station, hut if the honourable member wishes I stall tell him for his personal information what are to he the training and operational functions of stations in the vicinity of Brisbane. during the last fortnight men who have offered for enlistment in the Air Force as fitter trainees and fitter transport drivers have been refused enlistment and",11,Censorship

As a matter of fact, in the week immediately following the inspection 282 more men were employed in the annexes which were visited. take advantage of the leave that has been granted to me, but shall content myself by stating facts in rebuttal of the charge which the Minister for Supply and Development ( Sir Frederick Stewart) has levelled against me. annexe at Eveleigh and took part in the inspection. I remained in the annexe for at least fifteen minutes after the inspecthe advice that is tendered to him by tion had been completed, and after the 60 odd gentlemen who comprised the inspection party had actually left the works. Because Eveleigh was the last place of inspection it was not possible for me to make contact with the members of the party again, and, therefore, I could not make the statement to them which the Minister suggested I should have made had I been filled with intense patriotic fervour. after the inspection had been made, I again passed through the annexe, and found that a number of the machines that had been working while the inspection was in progress were no longer working, and that the men had left them. I directed the attention of the foreman to what had happened, and also had the opportunity to bring it under the notice of the Staff Superintendent of Railways, Mr Funnel, who happened to come on the scene at. that, very moment. minutes after the inspection party had left the annexe. The reason why I delayed, if it is necessary to state a reason, was that I had passed over to the other bay of the annexe, and was inquiring why the machines on that side were not working.

If Mr Funnel went back in the Minister's car, the Minister must have delayed somewhere else without my seeing him.

I do I visited the not desire to take any advantage of the situation; I merely appeal to the Minister not to be wholly led by those associated with his department. Let. him remember that those who offer the advice have their own interests to safeguard. No doubt they make reports to the Minister, but those reports might not, contain all the facts. The information given to me was received from the men working in the Avorkshop itself, and those men know that the whole thing on Fifteen minutes the day of the inspection was a set-up. The men were brought over on Friday from other parts of the works to work the machines during the whole of the week-end in the annexe.

If so, will the honourable gentleman consider the prevention of further exports of scrap iron to that country? not say offhand whether or not scrap iron has been loaded for export to Japan, hut I should say that it is quite likely that such is the case. There is a huge surplus of scrap iron in Australia, and as it is not wholly needed here no useful purpose would be served by keeping it in this country. for Supply and Development inform me whether he has any records that show that available scrap iron has been refused to Great Britain while scrap iron has been exported to Japanf have no such records and I am fairly sure that they do not exist. the remainder of the life of this Parliament is about seven months. In view of the portentous character of the events that appear to be imminent within that period, during which neither the Government nor the people will be disposed to discuss general elections, will the Prime Minister state if the Government has considered whether or not an election should be held this year, or that the life of the Parliament should be extended? If the life of the Parliament is to be extended, will it not be necessary for an authorizing act to be passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom? If that be so, will the Government take action to secure the requisite power from the Parliament of the United Kingdom before that Parliament itself becomes more intensely involved in the actual incidents of war, «o that, should this Government and this Parliament, such a decision may be promptly given effect? honourable member is right in thinking that the extension of the life of this Parliament would, in certain circumstances, require an authorizing act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. As to whether such an extension should be sought is a matter which would be greatly affected by the .particular circumstances of any given time. Consequently, the Government has not yet thought it necessary to consider it.

Is the Prime Minister aware of the great hardship that exists in ISTew South Wales among the unemployed by reason of the fact that the Commonwealth Government has permitted certain defence works to be administered by the State Govermcnt under its own regulations? The result of this has been that the unemployed are given only intermittent work and, after finishing on a job, their names are put at. the bottom of the list of registered unemployed.

Will he also undertake that no expeditionary force will bo permitted to leave Australia in the future until it is properly equipped with the necessary mechanized arms? sions to which the reports referred to by the honourable member apply are not coinparable to the units which have been raised in Australia.

Briefly, tbe policy will be to utilize the commercial productive capacity of Australia to the utmost, and to expand government factories or build new ones only in cases in which commercial industry cannot be used or adapted. The foregoing remarks relate particularly to gun ammunition production, but the principle is also being 1 applied, wherever possible, to gun and machine gun production. Another important industry which must be developed, although it does notcome within the usual meaning, of munitions, is the production of the large number of machine tools tliat will be required for making munitions, and for making tools and gauges that are essential to the production of munitions. The facilities for munitions production already available in Australia, together with the new additions which I have just outlined, will not only provide for the adequate defence of Australia, but will also afford invaluable assistance to the Empire effort generally. I commend the bill to the House and predict for it a speedy passage. This biul seeks' the authority of the Par1 liament for an appeal by the Government to the people of Australia for subscription, to a loan of £20,000,000, the money to be: used in the prosecution, of the war. Although £65,394,000 was appropriated recently to cover commitments for war purposes up to the 31st December, 1940, we are now being asked to sanction the raising of an additional £20,000,000, making, a. total of £88,394,000 to the end of this calendar year. In view of the grave international situation, the Opposition does not intend to oppose this measure; but this is an occasion when honourable members may discuss the purposes for which themoney is fo be used, and the results that are likely to accrue from its expenditure. In these critical times-, every one should assist in theraissums of public money in providing foi; ing of loans which the Government believes to be necessary for the conduct of the war. BeforeI conclude, I hope to say something about other means of financing the war. In order to ensure a ready response by the public, I suggest that something more than an appeal by the Treasurer ( Mr Spender) should be made. Other Ministers should make it clear that Australia will get the quickest return possible from the expenditure involved. Both in the press and in the Parliament, serious allegations of inefficiency, delay and waste in regard to the manufacture of munitions have been made, and it would allay a great deal of the anxiety in. the minds of the people if the Government Avould deal explicitly with each of these charges, instead of airily brushing them aside. If these chargesof inefficiency and waste be time, a vigorous overhaul of the departments concerned should be undertaken. That is one reason why the Opposition has urged that, as far as possible, the Parliament should remain in session during the war, so that Ministers may be subjected, to criticism, if necessary, and required to give information regarding war finance, the present state of the country's defences', and what further step3 are possible to bring about greater efficiency in connection with OUF defenceeffort. If the charges be not true, or if they be exaggerated, I submit that a clear and definite statement of the facts should be given the widest publicity by every Minister directly affeeted. If that were done, I believe that the Government would experience less difficulty in raising the money necessary to carry on the war. Some honourable members have had a good deal to say about carelessness and inefficiency on the part of government departments, but Ministers have not dealt with that criticism in the right spirit They have shown intolerance and resentment of criticism. It cannot be said that tlie Opposition has adopted the attitude of a carping critic in regard to the Government's war effort. It istrue that there has been criticism by members on this side, but most of it has been helpful and constructive. I should like Ministers to regard more seriously the criticism offered in this chamber, especially that relating to the expenditure of large the defence of this country. I have here a typical instance of the communications that are being sent to the Government by representative men.

Hasi t any reply to this charge brought on the 19th of June of this year by the workmen of the Newport workshops in Victoria? Hasi t any reply to the charges made by those associated with the workshops in other parts of Australia that plant and machinery are not being utilized to the fullest capacity in the making of arms and munitions? Or is the Government attempting to brush these charges aside, hoping that it can get into recess, and thus avoid parliamentary criticism? In this morning's issue of the Sydney Morning Herald the following appears -:Foitcr-HUGE HADE-'PLANES, From 0-. M. Long, Our War Correspondent, who was with the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium. It would be a pity if the Dominions did not realize the shortage of the British Army's of planes during the battles in magnitude of the effort which Mr Forde. repaired and inadequate weapons to be replaced by effective ones. One reason why the British Army in France was so small was simply that there were not enough weapons. I u the first three months in France1 never saw a medium or a heavy tank, only the light tank of the type used in Australia. I never saw a single medium or heavy British tank in the twelve days from the 10th May to the 21st May. When the war broke out, Britain had one armoured division in England, hut it was not in Belgium when the battle began. One armoured brigade later took part. An armoured division fought in the battle south nf the Sonraie. I have quoted sufficient to show the deplorable state of unpreparedness, and the lack of equipment necessary for the arming of the British Expeditionary Force. If that applies to Great Britain'-and I believe it does-it applies with even greater force to Australia. People are reluctant to criticize the Government for these shortcomings, for fear that they will be met with the gibe that they are merely advertising our weaknesses to the enemy. The time has arrived, however, when the suppression of the truth may lead to greater weaknesses. The very fact that there has been all this criticism, What is the Government and that it has not been replied to adequately by the Government, shows that there must be some ground for it . War to-day is entirely different from what it was in 1914. Mr Hore Belisha, when Secretary of State for War, speaking in the House of Commons on the l l t h October, 1939, s a i d It was a light army that travelled in 1914. Nearly 60 per cent, of the fighting troops were infantry men relying on their rifles and bayonets and two machine guns per battalion. Now only 20 per cent, of the fighting troops were 'nfantrymen, with 60 Bren guns, l f i anti-tank rifles, and other weapons as well, per battalion. It is not now so much a matter of manpower as of equipment, of heavy tanks, statement of what it is doing to supply our requirements in these directions. We know that in that pocket of territory surrounding Dunkirk there were close on 20. 1,000,000 men of the Allied forces, people of the English, French and Belgian, who put up extent of the equipment and a gallant fight, but who. largely because France, or the of lack of equipment, were unable to must, be made defeat, the enemy. We do not want Australia to be in that deplorable position that tiie bank should finance this if we are attacked.

The Opposition will watch very carefully the way in which this money is being expended, and the Government may expect sharp criticism when the Blouse next meets if no attempt has been made to eliminate waste and delay in the production of munitions. I should like the Treasurer to say why the Government has not done anything in regard to the very fine report prepared by Mr Townsend on the subject of shipbuilding in Australia. Surely that matter is bound np with defence. It is, in fact, vital to the continuation .of our war effort.. The Government received the report months ago, but was content to pigeonhole it because it was not then prepared to make a decision. I realize that Ministers are verybusy men. But surely they haveat their command!, at a time like this, whenthey have been given unlimited powers, the services! of the very best brains in Australia.. There is no justification for the unwarranted delay that has taken place in dealing with this very important matter. We are up against an acute shortage of overseas shipping space. What has the Government done in re*s-pect of it? All this is bound up with the matter of Australia's ability to hold out, and) to supply foodstuffs to the people of Great Britain, when, the tempo is quickened by the enemy in an effort to prevent ships from arriving in any part of Australia and the other dominions. The Government has certainly failed completely to expedite the building of ships in Australia. advice of the Opposition been heeded over the last ten years,, the shipbuilding industry would have been established in.

For a long time, I have advocated that the party which sits opposite should join with us and do all that it can to assist us in this great crisis.

154,Mr Gregory,"I insist that therecountry. Every section of tbe community should be compelled to bear its fair snare of the burden at a time like thiB. RecentlyI attended a meeting iu a country town which attracted a splendid audience. One man said, "" I shall give £1,000 free of interest"". Another man said "" I can afford only £100"". A third man offered £250, and a woman said that she would subscribe £10. prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend the country, why should not others be compelled to give all that they have? who invested £5,000 in the last loan, will not be able to contribute to the next loan without causing considerable embarrassment to himself. Some members of the community invest in shares, which return them 7 per cent., 8 per cent., 10 per cent., and sometimes 15 per cent, and 20 per cent., while failing to subscribe to war loans. According to a paragraph that appeared in last Tuesday's Melbourne Argus, Abraham Lincoln, a one time president of the United States of America, speaking in a time of war, saidVoluntarism is the unprincipled dodge of cowardly politicians. It has ground up the choicest seed corn of the nation. It has contion has given to the Government gensumed the young, the generous, tlie patriotic, the intelligent, and the brave, and it has wasted the best moral, social and political elements of the republic and left .the cowards, we shall have to take all the risks of the shirkers and the money-makers to stay at home and procreate their kind. Those who shirk their duty are to be found in many avenues; they occupy high positions, and draw big emoluments. In a question I asked to-day, I suggested that, for the purpose of filling war loans, the Commonwealth Government should withhold 10 per cent, of all salaries and emoluments that it pays, including payments to members of Parliament, and public servants, with special concessions to those who arc in the lower grades, these sums to be placed in freeof-interest war loans. An enormous sum will be required to carry on our war activities. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggested that the Commonwealth Bank should issue nil the credit that is necessary. that a larger use could 'be made of credit, which is a very different thing. was, that much better use could be made of the Commonwealth Bank. I should not like the Commonwealth Bank to issue bonds free of interest, because the time might come when it would need to realize on those bonds. The right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) knows perfectly well that it might need to raise capital to meet its own obligations. Bonds carrying an interest rate of 3 per cent, or 2£ per cent, would be negotiable security, whereas interest-free bonds would not be negotiable. the Opposition did not advocate an interest-free loan. what degree the Commonwealth Bank has released credit, but I should imagine that in short-term loans the issue has been from £90,000,000 to £100,000,000, which is a very large sum to have floating around in a country like Australia. One can realize that the easing of the money market has been due entirely to the issue of credit by the Commonwealth Bank. I am sure that the Treasurer will endorse my statement that that instituerous assistance in connection with shortdated loans. The time may come when inflation; but that time has not yet arrived. The Government should seriously consider the issue of compulsory loans, to which every person would be compelled to subscribe according to his income. It is a crying shame that persons who have huge fortunes should have them invested in enterprises which return them 5 per cent., 6 per cent., or 7 per cent., and have not subscribed 6d. to a war loan. They are shirking their responsibility. There is no question that this request of the Treasurer ( Mr Spender) for the right to raise £20,000,000 for war purposes should be granted instantly. In supporting the bill, I should like to comment on three or four points which I think ought to be borne in mind at the present time.

161,Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [2.56],"I think that I ought to point out to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr That must be our aim during the war, Forde) that his figures in respect of the actual war expenditure out of loan in the last great war were slightly exaggerated. The total war debt was never more than about £300,000,000. the Opposition added the accumulated interest. war debt of Australia is £266,000,000, of which £S0,000,000 is owed to the British Government and carries no interest, leaving about £180,000,000 which is carrying interest. The total has been reduced considerably by the operation, during the last sixteen or seventeen years, of the sinking fund established by the Government of which I was a member in 1923. Upon my entry into Parliament I raised the question as to the way in which the war should be financed. I am glad that the Treasurer proposes to raise, by means of taxation, a substantial proportion of the amount to be expended for war purposes. Especially should he do so if prices should rise to any degree, because that would make very much less than it otherwise would be, the burden ultimately to be borne by the community. On the last occasion, the amount derived from taxation for war purposes represented something like 17 per cent, or 18 per cent, of the total expenditure. On this occasion the percentage ought to be very much higher. However the money be raised, whether by taxation or by loan-and , after all, a loan is simply deferred taxation, because ultimately it has to be repaid to the people from whom it is borrowedI urge that it be raised in such a way that it is expended almost a3 quickly as it is received, and that large denly brought into being or existing balances are not allowed to accumulate in the Federal Treasury, thereby interfering somewhat with the free flow of money for purposes of employment. aspect. by way of loan or taxation is expended the Evans Head Flying School which is immediately on defence works, the result in his electorate and near the southern will be general employment, the people portion of my electorate.

I trust that the Government will pay special heed to this suggestion. Very considerable encouragement would be afforded if , from time to time, the Treasurer could publish particulars of the exact position of the Treasury balances, in order to show that this policy is being followed and that a great deal of money is not being frozen. I believe that the money should not be spent merely, as has been mentioned by the Treasurer and elaborated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on actual war purposes. We should not be careless of the interests of the great producing industries of this country, but should make certain that money is available to place them on an absolutely sure footing. The Government should give as close attention to the establishment in this country of very much greater cold storage facilities as it is giving to the establishment of munitions factories, because, if the export of our products were interrupted, hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of perishable products would rot unless greater storage space was available. to see the cold stores a little way inland, but I am not concerned so much with their location as with their provision. There are sufficient wise men in Australia to decide where they should be. In war-time it is not possible to give to expenditure tbe same meticulous attention that is given in peace-time; because when new departments are suddepartments are expanded and sub-departments created, oversight becomes slackened; but much more could be done than is being done to make certain that the various departments and branches The honourable member for Richmond Work that was",29,Supply Effort Now Being And Of Aeroplanes I Have Yet To Hear Tanks And Guns From This Government An Authoritative

Tenders were called for the other work to be done in seven weeks, but that work cannot be undertaken until the land has been cleared. That sort of thing wastes both time and money. It occurs as the result of the fact that liaison between departments is not perfect. As the result of the war, departments have been split with a resultant change of work for many officers. Some are not so busy as they should be and have capacity to be. The departments should be combed to see that all officers are usefully employed. Later, when the first blaze of enthusiasm has gone and we have spent more and suffered more, it will be more difficult to obtain money from loans. I had the unpleasant task in the decade from 1920 of converting the whole of our debt from the. last war. Debt conversion is difficult. The smaller the amount we have to convert the easier it will be not only for the Treasurer and the Government, but also for the people generally. MT. JOLLY (Lilley) [3.4] I know that the Treasurer ( Mr Spender) cannot give us the exact terms of this loan which is part of the loan programme announced by him some time ago, but will there be a sinking fund for it? urge that there be no extravagant expenditure on defence buildings. The money should be expended on the manufacture of munitions and other war equipment, not on ornate structures. I raise this matter to-day because I have been given to understand that recently when tenders were invited for an important defence building in Brisbane the specifications included provision for the installation of oil-burners. That is unwise because in Queensland there is plenty of wood and coal; oil-buniers are not necessary, especially at a time when our fuel supplies must be dependent on the dollar exchange position. That aspect is only one of many, but it is most important. I support what was said by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) about, the need to make sure that all persons who are able contribute to war loans. I take it that the Treasurer has had a survey made of the funds available for loan purposes, but he should ascertain whether all who can do so are subscribing to loans. There are many people who feel it their duty to subscribe to war loans at a great sacrifice, but there are others who, although subscription to loans would entail no great sacrifice, are refraining. those who could subscribe are doing so. man is right. ""With the honourable member for SwanI agree that it is equitable that the people should share the burden of war loans as they do taxation. In the last war there was active competition between the States and between towns in the matter of loan subscriptions. I should like to see that spirit abroad to-day. of the Australian Labour party-non Oommunist) [3.8] -On this bill, which provides opportunity for us to direct attention to the way in which loan moneys may be utilized, I shall draw direct attention to two matters. The first concerns what is being done to provide from our own resources those raw materials which we cannot now get in required quantities from abroad. I refer particularly to aluminium, which is absolutely essential in the construction of aircraft I It appears that America is the only place outside Australia from which we are likely to obtain supplies of this vital product, but I point out that not only ia the United States of America expanding its own aircraft industry, but also that other neutral countries are also looking to the United States of America for supplies. producer of aluminium. British Government is making demands for the metal which are stronger even than our own. What are we doing in this country to examine our own resources?

These should be tested in order to ascertain what percentage of this raw material can be obtained locally. I am aware that supplies, of it can be obtained here because the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr would be of a general labouring character Blain), has said so several times in this House. In the last few weeks, particularly in the last fortnight, I have received a fair amount of correspondence indicating that tests already made have yielded positive results. Money is needed in order to make further investigations. Local production should be brought to the highest state of production within the shortest space of time in order to supplement our supplies from overseas. The other matter deals with the construction of the proposed dry dock at Sydney. A deputation led by the honourable member for ""Watson( Mr Jennings) recently waited on the Treasurer ( Mr workers. Throughout the last ten years, Spender) to discuss this subject with him. I am aware that it is not particularly the Government to expand our industries, duty of the Treasurer to deal with this work, which is a matter for another department, but I wish to ascertain from him whether the Government has finally decided the methods to be employed in the construction of this dock. ter for the Navy( Mr Archie Cameron) has said that he has under close examination the representations made to me. I expect that a decision will be reached shortly. The points raised at the deputation were to the effect that, if the plant and men of the Sydney Water aud Sewerage Board were used in the construction of the dock, not only would the delay that would be occasioned by the calling for tenders be averted, but also the cost would be kept at the lowest level, because the board would not work on a profit basis. I am pleased to know that it is the intention of the Government to examine the proposal made by the deputation and I hope that a decision will be readied within the next two weeks. The construction of the dock by the Water and Sewerage Board would meet the point raised by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), because the work would be of such a character as to require only a smattering of highly-skilled labour. The rest of the labour would be either semi-skilled or unskilled. Most of the defence expenditure is being used in the production of munitions Avhich requires skilled or nearly skilled workers. The dock work, however, and would go a long way towards meeting the needs of the unskilled men who are workless. On the general question, the matter which crosses my mind is the national debt and whether these loans shall ever be repaid. I am satisfied that they will not be. The huge interest burden that has been piled up on Australia simply on the security of the country as a whole has crippled us. It is because of the general financial policy which has existed in this countiy in the past that we are to-day in a state of general nnpreparedness and slackness, and have a shortage of skilled when we have been ceaselessly urging the provide employment for our people and train skilled artisans, we have been told that finance was not available. That plea was advanced also when we were striving by every means in our power to provide work for the great army of unemployed people in our country. Now that war has overtaken us, the provision of money is regarded as a secondary consideration, as any honourable member would be told if he were to say, from his place in this House, that we had insufficient money to provide for our defence requirements. Of course, I agree that we must provide for the defence of this country, and we are prepared to do everything possible in that regard. It is, nevertheless, timely to argue that if money can be raised for defence in a time of war, it could also be raised for development in a time of peace, when thousands of our men who are willing to work should be provided with jobs on big national undertakings. Our review of the past cannot eradicate from our memory the hardships that our people suffered in the years of the depression, but at least we can learn from what is now happening that there is no need at all for us to permit a recurrence of the experiences of the depression years.",31,Supply Effort Now Being And Of Aeroplanes I Have Yet To Hear Tanks And Guns From This Government An Authoritative

176,Mr Beasley,"That is very good.The two points to which' I . wished mainly to direct attention had relation to raw materials and to the building of the new dock.. I am particularly glad that the situation in that regard will be clarified within the next two weeks; stances I am prepared to allow the matter to remain as it is. [3.19] -The Treasurer ( Mr Spender) should feel gratified that this bill is being amount of the financial accommodation allowed to pass through the House without opposition. Nevertheless, on such an occasion' as this, honourable members are entitled to express their views concerning the methods adopted to both raise and expend public moneys. I cannot help thinking to-day of the change that has occurred in the financial outlook of many honourable members liament nine years.. If tbe war continues for another three or four years-I hope cliat it will not last so long-w e may have, to make much more drastic change;; of our ' financial policy;. the new needs of the people will force governments to encroach upon the private profit-makinginterests. When the Scullin Government was in office. I well remember the Treasurer of the day making representations to the Commonwealth Bank in order to obtain a loan of £18,000^000. That amount was ""small change"" in comparison with the amounts-, that are being raised in these days: The honourable gentleman was told that the money could not be provided in consequence: of the existence of certain legal limitations although we were passing through a terribleperiod of depression. It was said, that the Government had already exceeded the. amount that the bank was authorized to issue on the basis of the existing' gold reserves. times that amount has been made available without any gold backing whatso^ ever. There is no gold backing to-day. This very fact shows how ridiculous it is for honourable members opposite to criticize-,, as they have done, any new suggestions that are put forward by honourable members out this side of the chamber in. order to ease the financial problems of the country. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) urged, in his speech on this bill, that greater use Treasurer expects that the should be made by the Government of its own financial instrument, the Commonwealth Bank, his remarks were met with hostile, interjections. The ignorant character of such interjections will be obvious in a few years time. I have been endeavouring to discover for quite a long time, by the asking, of questions and also by other means, the which the Treasurer has obtained from the Commonwealth Bank,, and the extent to which reliance has been placed upon the resources of the private banking institutions. If we do not use. our own banking instrument to the utmost degree, it seems to me that we. are, in a sense, almost disloyal; for oar failure to do so of this Parindicates, a lack of confidence in the in the last eight or security of the country. Surely we should rely more on the Commonwealth Bank, which is one of the greatest financial institutions of the British Empire, than we do upon privatebanking resources. The failure to adopt such a national ideal and the obstinate practice of regarding the interests of the private bankers as sacrosanct, will yet be proved to be one of the, real causes of our failure, to safeguard our country from defeat. Why cannot we be told the extent to which the Commonwealth Bank has accommodated the Government ?, If there are reasons why this information should not be made public,, some means, should be devised to give us the information confidentially. If that weredone I should not continue to aggravate the: Treasurer by asking for the information.. As things are, our interest bill is growing daily; in spite, of all attempts by the Treasurer to keep the interest rate down to a lower point, than it would be Since then, at least twenty at in normal circumstances.. We ought to be doing everything possible to prevent any increase of ourinterest bill, or our post-war financial burden will become greater than our people can carry. Whether we shall ever be. able to repay the public debt is of course in the lap of the gods. AD of the debts that; were incurred during the last war have aot been paid. The result has been that certain",32,Supply Effort Now Being And Of Aeroplanes I Have Yet To Hear Tanks And Guns From This Government An Authoritative

179,Mr Holloway (Melbourneports),"countries have been hesitant to supply war materials on this occasion. That is not in any sense an exaggeration. Why did Great Britain have to send shiploads of gold abroad, in spite of all dangers at sea, in order to obtain aeroplanes and other equipment? cumstances, there was every justification for the question which the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) asked concerning our ultimate capacity to pay our war debts. We know very well that we repudiated, to a certain degree, some of the indebtedness we incurred during the last war, for we have made only token payments in that respect. The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) said that we did not have to pay the £80,000,000 involved. I remind him that the payment of this indebtedness has only been suspended. Legally, we still owe the money. It will probably still be owing long after we are dead. I again urge that the Treasurer should use the resources of the Commonwealth Bunk to the greatest possible degreeas has the honourable member, and, within my limits, I will endeavour to do everything I can do. that remark. I cannot imagine any Treasurer having a different outlook. During the last eight or nine years, however, the honourable gentleman's predecessors in office have adopted a much more conservative outlook. Every effort has been made in the past to handicap the Commonwealth Bank. The business of the private banks has been regarded as sacrosanct. For many years the fundamental basis of the financial policy of the Government was that the Commonwealth Bank should not be permitted to compete for the available banking business. Treasurer has broken down that policy. down for years. vividly when the policy was in full force. T had an interview some years ago with bhe late Sir Robert Gibson in regard to a request made to the Commonwealth Bank to provide finance to assist the farmers to re-sow their fields. Sir Robert admitted that it was possible to comply with the request, but he said: "" It shall not be done, because it is not the policy of the Government to do that kind of thing It was often said that the Commonwealth Bank must not enter into In all the cirtrade. It may be true that that policy has been varied to some degree but in our opinion it has not been sufficiently varied. Why should we have to pay interest to the private banking institutions on the £20,000,000 now proposed to be raised seeing that the Treasurer could obtain the money through the Commonwealth Bank and pay the interest to that institution? I am not asking that the money shall be made available free of interest. I am asking, however, that the interest payable in respect of it shall go to the Commonwealth Bank, which means that it would come back again into revenue. I do not know whether the practicability of following this course has been overlooked, but in any case the whole situation should be reconsidered. One of my main reasons for rising was to impress upon the Government the need to provide adequate storage facilities for our wheat and other foodstuffs. The right honourable member for Cowper referred to that important subject this morning. This is an urgent matter. It will not be denied that, generally speaking, thousands of bushels of wheat are destroyed in Australia every year by the ravages of mice and weevils. Although we may get through odd years without any loss at all under this heading, we are always in danger of this. I can well remember travelling through many wheat districts of Australia during the last war, and seeing the result of the ravages of mice, and the sad loss incurred by our failure to provide adequate storage facilities. I saw I hope that the present many wheat stacks which had a green growth six inches high on the top of them. All of that wheat practically was destroyed. Moreover, all of our wheat remember sheds had to be fumigated, and the wheat lumpers had to wear masks while they were engaged in their work because of the foul conditions that prevailed. Beautiful wheat, amounting to thousands of tons, was reduced to filthy husks.

There should also be continuous effort on the part of the Cabinet, in association with the major oil companies, to provide storage facilities for large quantities of petrol and lubricating oils. I have made some inquiries on this subject to find what is done elsewhere, and 1 am convinced that our storage facilities for these commodities should be greatly increased. I realize that this would involve expense, and that considerable difficulties would have to be surmounted, but I believe that there are in Australia men big enough to overcome them as they have been overcome in other places. I urge that storage tanks to contain large reserve supplies of petrol and oils should be provided in this country, as in other countries, such as Japan. Unless we do this, we may find ourselves in trouble, notwithstanding the existence of large quantities of machinery and defence equipment. We sometimes hear the men in charge of the major oil companies of Australia described as thieves and vagabonds, or worse. Those terms may not directly be applied to them, but that is what the condemnation amounts to. I do not believe that such remarks are justified, for, in my opinion, the men in charge of the worth-while oil concerns in Australia-thos e who have assets in this country and would lose much should the Allies he overthrown-ar e decent men and no different from other business men in the community. I believe that if they were invited by the Prime Minister to tackle this problem they would be prepared to give much more assistance than is generally realized. I hope that something will be done in this direction because the need is urgent. Let there be a round-table conference between representatives of our government and those controlling this most urgent of all defence requirements. I urge the Treasurer to utilize the machinery provided by the Commonwealth Bank to a greater degree than hitherto. As I have said, I am not greatly concerned with the rate of interest that may be charged, so long as the Unlimited quantities of raw money is expended on useful and necessary work and circulates in the community. I fear that loans raised by existing methods take money away from people who would use it in industry, anu that consequently there is a gradual freezing of business. Because of the enlistment of so many men, and the fact that the places of those men cannot be filled by fresh labour, the community is living on a more restricted income than formerly; there is less spending power in the aggregate among the people, and, therefore, less demand for goods and services. power to-day than there was six months ago. the money is going into one channel and is providing employment in only one direction. dicate that. On the contrary, there are 90,000 more persons employed to-day than there were in August of last year. engaged on war work. Not every man seeking employment can be employed on work of that character. The building of a graving dock would absorb some of the unskilled labour which cannot now be utilized. I believe that if the Government could get more fitters and turners the opportunity to provide employment for many unskilled workers would be increased, but they are not available. To-day most of the money that is expended goes in one direction, with the result that the demand for goods and servioes is becoming less; and, unless we are careful, we shall again experience a depression, because of a shrinkage of the general wages fund of the community, notwithstanding that some persons will be earning more money than ever before. I do not imagine that the Treasurer has overlooked these matters, but I ask him to give to them his most earnest consideration. While there are urgent works to be undertaken, no man should be idle hope that we shall have ample time for the consideration of important matters",34,Supply Effort Now Being And Of Aeroplanes I Have Yet To Hear Tanks And Guns From This Government An Authoritative

I am impressed with the curious relationship of the bill now before us, which has for its object the safeguarding of the unearned increment to the investor, to the measure which recently passed through this chamber, under which the control of the lives and working conditions of the workers ds to be taken over by the Government without qualification, reservation, or secured interest. being taken over property and finance. behalf of the farmers. on their behalf, and should be happy to do so, were it not for the fact that tliat matter can be much more intelligently and thoroughly dealt with by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) himself, whose experience of the subject and loyalty to the farmers have been proved by demonstration in this House on many occasions. The measure before us is Loan Bill (No. 2) 1940, and its principal object is to authorize the Treasurer, under the provisions of the Commonwealth Inscribed Act 19111940, or of any act authorizing the issue of treasury-bills, to borrow moneys up to a total_ of £20,000,000. By reference to the principal act, I notice that such, stock shall bear interest at a rate to be fixed by the order creating the stock, and that interest should be payable half-' yearly on days to be fixed by such order. I notice, further, that the principal moneys secured by any stock, and the interest thereon, shall rank equal and without priority or preference, and shall he a charge on the Consolidated Revenue. These matters are, in their character, elementary; but I cannot but be struck by the care taken to preserve the interests of investors, compared with the utter lack of concern for the interests of the workers. I remember that during the last war, when the Right Honourable W. A. Watt was Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and the course of the war had reached a stage much less disastrous to the interests of the Allies than that which faces us to-day, a bill came before the Parliament to authorize the raising of compulsory loans. I do not think that that proposal went so far as to envisage compulsory loans without interest, hut J take leave to avail myself of the opportunity to point out one or two .things. The Government has now a more absolute power than any government has ever 1 enjoyed since the inauguration of responsible government in Australia. I should suppose that its powers include the power of searching investigation of various financial organizations for the purpose of determining how much interest is derived by persons who have no practical need of it, because their income from other sources is above tlie basic wage.

Much interest, however, is a contribution to luxury and an incentive to idleness. I referred also to the matter of a compulsory loan. I suggest that, the international position being what it is and Imving regard to the fact that this loan is for war purposes, and that the position overseas has deteriorated very seriously, legislation for an interest-free compulsory loan might be considered.

Reference was made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), and by others, notably the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr vernment adopts, in regard to matters of Holloway), to the importance of exploiting in some uniform and logical way the credit of the nation through the Commonwealth Bank. When that was mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Treasurer asked, by interjection, "" How much would you raise ?"" Really, it is pitiful that so fatuous an interjection should come from such a source as the person charged with the serious duties of Commonwealth Treasurer. Of course, the amount that one can raise on the credit of the nation cannot be stated even approximately at a moment's notice dn terms of so many pounds, shillings and pence. It can be stated only in general terms, and it is obvious that the Treasurer has not even the poorest understanding of this subject. It can, as I have said, be stated in general by telegram addressed to each honourable memterms that money can be raised to an indeterminable amount upon the security of the nation. The guide to the degree to which that can be done is the degree to which the security is being improved, in the first place, and the index is the employment of all our employable men, and the value of the services which they are rendering. It is the contention of intelligent persons who have studied this subject that to-day every employable person should be actively employed. If he were so employed at wages adequate to enable him to Vive a decent and normal life, and if all the services were being rendered to the Commonwealth of which the Commonwealth is in urgent need, there would be no unemployment, and there would be vastly increased spending power. Over and above that, there would be an indefinite but a tremendous margin of value still available in the Commonwealth for the purpose of financing our necessary defence. statement of the position, which obviously is not understood by the Treasurer, should be sufficient for the moment. With that, as I have no desire to the delay in imposing the company tax embarrass those gentlemen who seem more will be longer than was expected when the intent upon catching their train than House recently rose. upon discharging the public duties that fall upon them, I shall leave the matter at present. I do not intend to oppose the passage of this bill. My opposition, I realize, would be quite futile. The Gofinance, purely conventional methods. Its revolutionary methods are confined entirely to its treatment of the working class, their standards of life, and their general interests. That being so, we may let the bill pass with these few necessary, not over-long and, I trust, not overtedious observations. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.

I can understand that tbe development which has occurred in respect of the Government's appreciation of the position made it desirable that the House should be called together earlier than was intended, so that the recess was, in fact, of shorter duration than we had expected. It is conceivable that the reces3 upon which we are about to enter may also be much shorter than is expected. During the last session it was the intention of the Government to pass legislation imposing special company taxation. This was not done, the reason given being that the various interests affected desired to make representations to the Government so that their position might be fully That elementary understood. This company tax was part of the general plan of taxation. The other parts of the plan have been carried into effect, and the taxation imposed.

It was the desire of the Prime Minister that these measures should be passed, but if the company tax is passed when Parliament next meets, there will be no delay in the imposition or the collection of the tax, anv more than if it were passed now. when the House last rose, was that Parliament should meet in the first week of -July for a review of the Government's position, and that we should meet in the first week of each successive month thereafter in order that a regular review might be made. I quite appreciate the undesirability of now meeting in the first week of July. I see no reason why we should meet within a fortnight of the close of the financial year, and am quite ready to consent to the passing of the motion. believe that, when this matter was previously considered, the general feeling was that the House should assemble more continuously, especially having regard to the grave uncertainty of the international situation. Point has been given to that argument since it was advanced, by the fact that we were called together suddenly and unexpectedly, and that a very important measure has had to be carried through under the pressure of that instrument which we employ for the abbreviation of discussion. If we agree to this motion, I quite see that we may be called back again before the date fixed. It seems to me, however, that if the House were kept in more regular session, there would be no danger of a repetition of the circumstance of being called together to legislate without discussion. It is this process of legislating without discussion, or with quite inadequate discussion, against which I made my previous protest, which has been justified by subsequent events, and against which I now protest again. As the motion stands, and in the light of the fact that Parliament has been called together during this week for only two days, I suppose that we may submit grudgingly to the proposed recess until the 6th August. But I do say, with re-emphasis of the statement that in my view Parliament should be kept more continuously in session, that the watchdog of this institution is absolutely necessary to safeguard popular rights, and that the very serious invasions of those rights by the Executive have completely jutified everything that I have said on this subject in the past. Question resolved in the affirmative. ter) [4.4] I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-36, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the committee has duly reported to the House the result of its investigations: Repairs and improvements to the wharf at Port Augusta, South Australia. The report of the Public Works Committee indicates that the wharf is in a bad condition, and that it would be unsafe to use it for a further twelve months. The piles and the decking are rotten; they have been eaten by white ants and sea insects. The committee has recommended that the wharf be provided with fresh piles, that it be extended for a further distance of 4 feet into the gulf, and that new timber decking be laid. The estimated cost of the work is approximately £36^500, and it is proposed that these repairs be done by day labour. have read the report of the Public Works Committee, and am a little disappointed that it should have recommended the use of wood instead of concrete. If the Government intends to engage in the construction of a. wharf or any other public utility, it should first consider the enormous cost of wood. According to the Assistant Minister( Mr Nock), the wood of the present structure has been eaten away by insects. The time has arrived for the Government to be practical, by constructing the piers of concrete. I do not agree with the statement of the Public Worlds Committee that concrete piles could not be put down because, having to go through gravel, the",37,Special Adjournment

If wood were driven through a hard substance, it would suffer to a greater degree than concrete. The Government is showing very bad judgment in proposing to have this work carried out on the lines recommended, because in a few years the wooden piles will again have to be replaced. Concrete lasts practically a lifetime, and needs no repairs; consequently, in the final analysis, it is less costly than which could be used for this particular wood. Perhaps some interested party has been instrumental in securing the adoption o.f wood because of timber supplies in South Australia. South Australia. position worse. lasted for 55 years. and marine boards carry out construction works in concrete. It will be found that the new decking and piles will rot. How much money has been spent on the repair of the existing structure? bridges and other works that have been carried out in. concrete, thousands of pounds have been saved. The argument that concrete is unsuitable because horses will have to use the wharf cannot be sustained. A rough surface would overcome that difficulty. The method of construction recommended is out of date. Concrete decking would be far superior, and have a longer life than wood. I hope that when the Government undertakes construction works it will do so by the most up-to-date methods, and at the least cost to the people. ""We have not money to waste on wooden construction when concrete will, last for a lifetime. The members of 'he Public Works Committee should have made themselves better acouainted with the qualities of concrete and the deterioration of wood before coming to this Parliament with a recommendation in favour of wood. port the motion. The Public Works Committee had an opportunity to investigate this matter fully. I am satisfied that the proposed work is absolutely necessary. After an investigation on the spot, the committee came to the conclusion that the wharf should be built. The present structure is very old, and I am glad that the Government has seen fit to approve of the provision of an almost new wharf. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Mahoney) has argued in favour of the use ot concrete. I was very strongly of that opinion, too. In South Australia there is a shortage of wood work, and an abundance of cement. The evidence tendered to the committee, however, was overwhelmingly opposed to my argument, and eventually the committee decided to recommend what is known as a turpentine wharf, which, I believe, will meet the position of South Australia. I hope that it will not be long before this facility is provided. The development of the Port Augusta district is of vital interest to the people. A railway runs on to the wharf, and thus facilities will be provided for the shipment of wool and other products. The Government has acted in a business-like way. If many other works On of this character were referred to the Public Works Committee it would be a good thing for the taxpayers. port the motion. As a member of the Public Works Committee, I inspected the wharf at Port Augusta and took part in the investigation of the proposal to effect repairs and improvements to it. The wharf has stood for 55 years and, when we saw it, had given its maximum service. After examining experts-archi tects and engineers, men who have been long associated with wharf construction work-w e reached the conclusion that there was need to reconstruct the wharf and to drive new piles where required. The weight of evidence was in favour of wooden piles, as against concrete. cheaper than concrete. almost equally serviceable.

As to the relative merits of concrete and wooden piles, I am ready to accept the recommendation of the Public Works Committee in favour of wooden. crete piles. Committee is here to guide us as to the relative merits of materials. Whilst as a layman I should be inclined to the view that concrete piles would make for more permanent construction, the committee must have had sound reasons for recommending wooden piles, because it went thoroughly into the matter. Augusta has a great future. It is eminently suited for the establishment of munitions factories, because, not only does it occupy a central position, but also at Port Augusta we learned that vessels its distance from the open sea is a natural protection. The district has special claims for consideration in any new defence projects. The line through Port Augusta which links our railway system should be extended to Whyalla, because that town should not be dependent solely on the sea route for the transmend this expenditure.

The Public Works Committee went exhaustively into the respective merits of timber and concrete piles. It learned that the life of timber piles is about 40 years and that the cost is less than half that of concrete. The comthe Senate without amendment:mittee was guided in its decision that the piles should be timber by those facte. is it? of jarrah. Although the wharf was built -55 years ago, some of the old piles are still there; some have been renewed. That speaks well for the quality of the Western Australian jarrah. The committee found that although the decking had been renewed, the wharf was unsafe. The new piles will be of turpentine wood from northern New South Wales. Unfortunately the demands that have been made on the jarrah forests for piles have been so great that they are no longer procurable. Hence the decision to use turpentine wood. Had jarrah heen available I have no doubt that it would have been used, because that timber is equal to any timber in the world for piles. Concrete piles are being used in Hobart, Port but that is because the marine life in the Hobart waters limits the life of timber piles to either fifteen or eighteen years.

227,Mr Stacey (Adelaide) [6.19],"Imember suggesting that the money be contributed as a loan or as a gift? it be contributed as a gift, but I will be prepared to fall in with whatever course is acceptable to other members. I fail to see how we can justly ask the people to make contributions towards war funds unless we set an example. gemtleman mean one-tenth of the total net income of members of this Parliament, or only one-tenth of that portion of their income which they derive as members of Parliament? matter very thoroughly and in my opinion honourable members could make a substantial contribution out of the £1,000 a year which they receive. income ? income has been used in the direction which I have indicated, just the same as it was during the last war; and should another loan be floated I would not be in a position to contribute a large sum to it. If honourable members opposite were prepared to contribute the whole of their income, I should be willing to do likewise. At a time such as this I do not believe in voluntary subscription. In passing a measure such as the Loan Bill which was before honourable members to-day, the Government should endeavour to determine, at least to some degree, the sources from which the money is to be obtained. I say to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) that I am prepared, if necessary, to put the whole of my income-it is very small-a t the disposal of the Government. I draw attention to the fact that, in South Australia, the invalid and old-age pensioners have, by means of the 3d. a week which they normally contribute to their funeral expenses, subscribed £1,000 to the Commonwealth war loan. Surely honourable members can also make a sacrifice. The example set by the invalid and old-age pensioners is a lesson to us. If we canreferred to the fact that offers were being not live on £900 it is time we died. have listened with great interest to the fronting Australia and the Empire and discussion that has just taken place on are anxious to play their part. In many [«] the honourable the suggestion that voluntary contributions be made to assist the prosecution of our war effort. In my opinion if the Government is to depend on voluntary contributions or public loans, we shall lose the war. I differ in my view from some honourable members as to the nature and sources of money and its functions. I do not believe in freezing present current funds. I believe that the Government the honourable should write up all the money that it requires through its own financial institutions, and to that extent it should adopt the methods which are used by our enemy to finance its war effort. To-day many of our young men are volunteering for service abroad and are being sent overseas. They are taking every possible personal risk. In many cases those whom they leave behind are in financial difficulties, and are making great sacrifices. Some soldiers have foregone substantial salaries to discharge their duty in the defence of the Empire, and have left their dependants in difficult circumstances. Also, there are many primary producers who are in financial difficulties owing to the deferred payments for wheat, and for the reason which I have just mentioned. Their sons are going away to the war and in some instances aged parents are facing great hardship and financial embarrassment owing to the pressure thai is being brought to bear upon them by creditors, who are exercising their rights under the law to dispossess them. It is high time the Government took some action to protect these people. I hope that the Prime Minister will do what he promised to do on a previous occasion, and give thorough and prompt consideration to this matter. Correspondence which I have received has left no doubt in my mind as to the true position. I hope that honourable members will appreciate the seriousness of the circumstances and will endeavour to see that the required protection is given.

234,Mr Wilson (Wimmera) [6.27],"I people realize the danger which is conareas shire councils, agricultural councils and other public bodies hare offered to do organizing work of' various kinds. In some of the larger towns throughout rural areas there are splendid facilities for giving preliminary training to recruits and for organizing home-defence units. I do not wish to be parochial, but from my electorate communications have been sent repoatcdly to the Minister for the Arinyi n that respect. Offers have been made by the shires of SwanH ill and M i lmore and more taxation. Not only memdura, two very important centres. The Minister for the Army should (take notice of tbe desires of the people and accept their offers. If the people are not given a lead the enthusiasm of to-day will dampen down a lot. On the farms there is a great deal of scrap iron, which, if it is of any use to the contributions, but the Government, with authorities-and I think that it should be-the farmers are willing to deliver it to railway sidings. That should be considered. The question of decentralization of defence activities should be given the consideration to which it is entitled. What has happened in France as the result of centralization of production of munitions in big cities should be a lesson to us. | 0.32] -I . should like to be able to support the suggestion made by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin), for some lead to be given by members of this Parliament to the community in contributions to war loans or gifts to the Commonwealth, but I am afraid that after the explanation of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey) who supported him, the proposal is quite impracticable without the introduction of legislation by the Government. If the Government decided to legislate to put all members and all members of the Public Service on an equal footing, it would set a standard for the whole community which would not be acceptable to the community, whatever some honourable members may think. Members who want to make interest-free loans or gifts to the Commonwealth can do so by sacrificing portion of their income. members will in their own time and in their own way, and according to their financial circumstances, make contributions to the Commonwealth. I do not know that it would be proper for the Parliament to require members to reveal their financial position, and to aay to them "" Y o u should put in so much and if you do not we shall make you "". The repercussions of such a policy would be serious. The people are contributing freely and generously all that they are asked for by the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has told ,us with emphasis that he can promise bers of this Parliament, but also the people outside will have to make a contribution to that. It will be a substantial contribution by members of Parliament, especially those who have other income beside their parliamentary allowance. Those who feel this way can salve their conscience by making voluntary the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), should give consideration to every suggestion making for equality of effort by honourable members. The matter raised by the honourable member for Eichmond( Mr Anthony) I raised myself two or three weeks ago. It was considered by my colleagues to be premature, although all agreed that it was an interesting proposal. I am glad to see that since then what was regarded as a lone-wolf effort has been accepted as having considerable merit. Since then the war situation has worsened and whatever merit there was in the case which I placed before tlie Parliament is much stronger to-day. I content myself with reaffirming the views that I expressed then, by reiterating that, if we want to prolong the life of this Parliament, we need only ask the British Parliament to pass an enabling bill. would run away from the electors. suggestion. To my surprise, when I went out into the electorate expecting a certain amount of carping criticism on the lines suggested by the honourable member, I found absolute unanimity amongst the people that Parliament should not dream Honourable of inflicting general elections upon them at this time of crisis, when they are in a state of great mental stress and certainly have no goodwill towards Parliament.

237,Mr Thompson,"There is no suchlook at ourselves, and our policies in a general way. An election would have to be fought on the one issue of the war. and the people know that. Their only question is what we are doing to play our part in this crisis. If we stayed here a little longer and did not dislocate the country's war effort, the electors would be behind us. If the suggestion made by the honourable member for Richmond is seriously considered by the Government in consultation with the Oppositionwe cannot carry it out without the approval of the Opposition-it will have the support of 90 per cent, of the people. I urge the Government, in the few weeks of the recess, which may possibly be shorter than we expect, to give most serious consideration to the honourable member's proposal, and to evolve a method by which we can test the feeling of both Houses and submit our wishes to the British Parliament for ratification. ment is too busy. under the National Security Act we should do so. better than the honourable member for gest that the honourable member for Wakefield more than any other honourable member would appreciate a release from the burden of having to carry out an individual campaign. Many honourable members who would be certain to be returned at a general election are in favour of this proposal. I do not think that we need consider whether this proposal would give an advantage to members of any political party. At all events it does not cause me any concern. I am convinced that the people would approve of it, and that if it could be submitted to members know, I have always been a them, it would have their unanimous endorsement I therefore urge the Government to give it serious consideration. If there are insuperable constitutional obstacles to its adoption that is the end of the matter. I decline to think, however, that we are the slaves of an instrument of our own creation and that we are powerless to do anything although the Empire may be disintegrating and the henvens may be falling. I refuse to believe that in our present circumstances, the Constitution is unalterable, no matter what, may be the wishes of the Parliament or tbe will of the people. I hopo that, when Parliament reassembles in August, or earlier if circumstances demand an earlier meeting, the Government will bring forward a proposal on the lines which I have indicated. If Parliament does not want it, and if there is not an overwhelming majority . for the project in both Houses, nothing can be done. |'6.43'| I direct attention to the desirability of introducing moratorium legislation in the interests of men who enlist in our fighting services. Some questions on this subject, including one from myself, were asked of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to-day. A large number of these men will suffer a substantial reduction of income, and as a consequence, many may be unable to meet their commitments unless some form of relief is provided. The Prime Minister to-day said that the Government was prepared to give the matter early consideration. I hope that this will be done, because, unless some such relief is promised, those who have enlisted may he subjected to considerable financial risk and others who may be thinking of enlisting may hesitate, because of the knowledge that their income would be so substantially reduced that, in some cases, they would not be able to meet their financial obligations and support their families. I feel sure that any moratorium legislation that may be introduced would have the full support of members of all parties in this Parliament. The other matter to which I would direct attention is the urgent need for an immediate improvement of transport facilities in Australia. As honourable consistent advocate of the standardization of railway gauges; but as a man endowed with some amount of common sense, I realize that expenditure on such .an undertaking at the present juncture could not be contemplated, because the work could not be completed in time to be of military value. I know that the Government has given consideration to the question of providing improved facilities at railway sidings in the various",44,Industry Hom E Defence In Motion So Tliat In The Event Of Such A Moratorium Railway Decision Being Come To It May Be Given

243,Mr Drakeford (Maribyrnong),"States to permit of the more rapid movements of troops and equipment should that be necessary. The Locomotive Enginemen's Union, of which I am honorary president, desires to give every assistweeks in order to stump the country in ance to the Government in connection with this matter. It is suggested that, in addition to providing better facilities at sidings, provision should be made for the reconditioning of engines and rolling stock, so as to avoid unnecessary delay in this essential work. Members of the union are prepared to give the fullest cc-operation to the Government in this matter. I believe the Railways Commissioners have also intimated that they will give every assistance and advice to the Minister for the Army in connection with this matter, but extra siding accommodation may be rendered of little value unless proper reconditioning facilities are provided. On the subject of war finance, I understand that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) and other honourable members have indicated that they believe that the Government should avail itself of the resources of the Commonwealth Bank and national credit. I believe that the fullest possible use should be made of the facilities provided by that institution in order to carry on the war more effectively. I would say more on this subject, but time will not permit. I have not the slightest doubt that if honourable members were called upon to consider the suggestion of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) in respect of interest-free loans to the Government, they would support it to the limit of their resources. The possibility of prolonging the life of this Parliament, a matter first mentioned by the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) and referred to again this afternoon by that honourable gentleman and the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), would, I feel sure, be appreciated by the people of this country. They wish to avoid general elections at a time like this. The Prime Minister would be well advised to give the suggestion careful consideration. If any constitutional difficulty that may exist could be removed in the way that has heen suggested, Commonwealth Ministers would not be obliged to neglect their important administrative duties for a month or six an election campaign.
