I am delighted, therefore, with the spirit which he has just exhibited, and I join in saying that the Minister for Trade and Customs, in piloting the Tariff Bill through the House, has accomplished a titanic work. Whilst Victorian protectionists may be disappointed with the Tariff in its present form, we cannot blame the right honourable gentleman because they have not succeeded in securing the duties for which they fought. He has battled for them in a way that no other man in Australia could have done. The fact that we have not obtained what we consider are fair and reasonable duties even as a compromise between protective and revenue duties, is due to the defection of Victorian members in this House and in the Senate. feel that I ought to say a word or two in appreciation, not only of the work of the Minister for Trade and Customs, but of his colleague, the Treasurer. I do not conceal my feelings in regard to this Tariff. I think that very many serious mistakes have been made, but recognise that, considering the manv great difficulties which the Ministers in charge of the measure have ""had to face, they have accomplished a great work, which will be appreciated by Australia in years to come. view of the compliments which have been paid to the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer, I feel bound to say that whilst we have had a big fight over the Tariff, members upon this side of the Chamber have always received the utmost courtesy at their hands. A t the same time. I do not think that the people of the Commonwealth will thank the Government for having levied such high taxation upon them. A t this stage, however, I realize that it is impossible to secure more concessions from the Government than w have already obtained. A t present we realize that we are in a minority. A t the same time it is our duty to endeavour as far as possible to place the full facts of the case before the electors, so that at no distant date we may be able to prove conclusively that there is a strong majority in favour of an alteration of the present iniquitous Tariff. Honourable members opposite must realize that whilst they have a majority in this House, the free-trade members of this Parliament polled more votes at 44 u the recent elections than did the protectionist members. have raised no objection to references of a complimentary nature from either side of the House, but I cannot permit a general discussion upon the question whether a majority of the electors are of one fiscal belief or the other. I therefore ask the honourable member to confine his remarks, to the question under consideration. permitted honourable members opposite to make complimentary remarks regarding the-. two Ministers who have had charge of the Tariff Bill. I am merely endeavouring to-show that there are other people who are-not anxious that compliments of such a.. character should be paid in connection with"" the passing of this iniquitous Tariff. cannot allow a general discussion as to-whether .the Tariff is iniquitous or otherwise. Indeed, a reference to it by that title, seeing, that it has practically been passed by this.,. House, is one which ought not to be made. to record my protest against the high duties; which have been imposed. The free-trad© party have been successful in securing the remission of taxation aggregating£1,250,000 . We only regret that we cannot secure still further reductions. However, we have donet our best in a constitutional way, and now* that the struggle is at an end, I hope that, that kindly feeling which has hitherto, characterized our rel ations with each other will continue. speak of the work of bhe Minister for Tradeand 'Customs, apart altogether from the par-, ticular fiscal views which we entertain. I "" have had frequent occasion to observe that the work of the right honourable gentleman has been of a stupendous nature. It has not been confined to this House, because it must be recollected that he has to administer a very large and exceedingly important department. In his capacity as the head of that department, I have frequently had occasion to come into contact with him, and I willingly bear testimony to his uniform courtesy, his anxiety to give everv possibly facility for the smoothing over of difficulties, and for bringing about that uniformity which we all desire, and which I believe under his supervision will be speedily attained.",30,Setup

I am disposed to think that there may be a long row to hoe before that end is attained. I am not inclined to be congratulatory in regard to the Tariff until we are absolutely assured of finality, although I hope that we members have studiously refrained from inare veiy near to that consummation. Looking back at the debates which have taken place during the past eleven months, I think that members of the Opposition have every reason to be satisfied with the work that has been accomplished. -On the other hand, honourable members opposite can congratulate themselves upon having two sturdy fighters like the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Trea. surer. I believe that if they had not been . so ably led we should have been successful in securing much more substantial reductions in the duties which have been levied. Mr E. E. M c LEAN (Lang) I think that honourable members upon this side of the Chamber can fairly join in complimenting the two Ministers who have had charge of the Tariff Bill upon the vast amount of work which they have performed. We cheerfully admit that according to their lights they have acted from a high sense of public duty. A t the same time, I think that a word of praise is due in another direction. The members of the Opposition merit some commendation for the loyal way in which they have assisted to make the Tariff more acceptable to the people of Australia than it otherwise would have been. I also think that we might fairly compliment our brother legislators in the Senate who have .accomplished such excellent work by so materially assisting to modify the duties imposed, and thus to make the measure --more satisfactory to all parties. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I feel that though the protectionist side of the House has not secured all that it desired, the Tariff battle, from the point of view -of honourable members opposite, has only just commenced. In due time it will be fought to a finish. I have the greatest respect for the Minister for Trade and Customs, having been a faithful' follower of his in the South Australian Parliament for three years, and I have every reason to highly compliment him upon be discussed upon tliis motion. his work. We must all admit that, like a matchless athlete, a plumed warrior, and bow to your ruling, sir ; but I understood a trained fighter, he has battled in this Chamber for his convictions, and with few exceptions has been a total stranger to defeat. A t the same time. I am delighted to thank our friends upon the Opposition benches. It has been a joyous fight, and to me it has been a source of great pleasure. There has been no acrimony, honourable dulging in mean personalities, and we have had a jolly good time all round. bane) -No w that a settlement has practically been arrived at in regard to the Tariff, I fear that the Postmaster-General wil] find that the revenue of his department will show a considerable decrease. The quantity of correspondence with which some of my friends in this House have had to deal during the past twelve months must have covered reams of note-paper. In deed, in this connection, I think that I have contributed a ream or two myself. Therefore, I am very glad that the final settlement of the Tariff question appears to be only a few. hours distant. That settlement, however, has come just a little too soon for some of my constituents, and of those of the honourable member for Oxley. We have been requested to support the honourable member for Melbourne in his action regarding the administration of the Customs department, and we have not yet had time to expel tlie Minister for Trade and Customs from the Cabinet. Therefore we have been taken somewhat b)' surprise this afternoon. We' were beginning to think that we should make some arrangements for the expulsion of the right honourable gentleman by preferring a formal request to that effect to some of the other members of the Cabinet. But there he sits iu his place apparently more comfortable than he has been during the whole of the Tariff debate. I can plainly see that he is the best abused man in Australia to-day, by certain sections of the commercial and manufacturing community. Personally, no matter whom I please or displease by the observation, I contend that the Minister for Trades and Customs has done well to banish from the minds of his officers the idea that they are to treat with recalcitrant merchants who will not pass honest entries.",31,Setup

A t the same time, I cannot permit anything beyond such remarks to escape notice. I must then call attention to the standing orders. have only to add that I hope we shall not have another Tariff for a few years, or, if we have, that I shall not be a participator in the attendant responsibility. The Tariff during,its course through the House has cost me a great deal of worry and trouble, though I know that very exhausting demands have been made upon Ministers. If the Minister for Trade and Customs had not been a giant, physically and intellectually, and if he had not had much experience in administrative work as a. responsible Minister of the Crown in South Australia, he would not have been able to stand . the ordeal. There is not an honourable member of this House who has not been the recipient of much correspondence and many personal representations in connection with the Tariff, and the Treasurer, and the Minister for Trade and Customs have borne much in a similar way for a long period of time. Tho Ministers have done their duty splendidly, and the result is a Tariff which ought to be satisfactory alike to free traders, moderate protectionists, and fullblast protectionists.
