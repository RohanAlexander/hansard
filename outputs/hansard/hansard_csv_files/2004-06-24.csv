423,The Speaker,"The question is that the Edwards, G.J. Emerson, C.A.Thursday, 24 June 2004 ----Oxley Electorate: St Augustine’s College Family Services: Child Care my disappointment with the Howard government’s approach to child care. In particular, I want to highlight the case of a local school in my electorate of Oxley-St Augustine’s College. St Augustine’s College is a P to 12 school that operates a beforeand after-school day care facility. Sadly, it will not be able to open its doors during the upcoming school holiday period because it has still not received any financial assistance from the federal government. The school made an application for assistance to operate an outside school hours care facility in May 2002, and approval was not given. I wrote to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs about St Augustine’s case in April 2003, requesting that the minister and his department look at providing funding assistance to the school so that it can operate this outside school hours care facility. To date, the school does not get assistance from the Howard government to provide its much needed high-quality services. I can personally attest to the great level of service provided by St Augustine’s, and many people in the local community also appreciate the school’s commitment to providing great services for outside school hours care. These services are in demand in the local community. Without the federal government’s assistance, it cannot operate effectively during the school holidays as families are forced, due to financial considerations, to take their children to another facility which receives federal government assistance through the child care benefits scheme. St Augustine’s have once again written to the department requesting assistance but they were told that it would all be finalised by 1 June this year. This did not happen. After contacting the department again, they were told that all would be finalised by 1 July. It may well be finalised by 1 July, but this will be way too late for St Augustine’s and the upcoming school holiday period, and for all the parents who would use the facility during that time. I also commend the efforts of the school and of the carers at St Augustine’s. I particularly want to mention the child-care facility coordinator, Michelle Rutledge, Principal Leon Capra and all the staff who do a fantastic job at the school. The school is making an extraordinary effort to keep this child-care facility open at the lowest possible cost to parents. This is a direct cost to the school, and parents get no assistance from the government. This centre is being run at a loss to the school to ensure that this vital service is provided to parents. I am calling on the minister and the Howard government to get their act together and provide financial assistance, as was promised, to schools like St Augustine’s so that they can have some certainty and get on with providing a first-rate service for the local community and the parents of the school. Our community needs school communities like that of St Augustine’s, and anything the federal government can do to help them operate should be done. It is really sad that, while there is extra funding for child care, it is not being directed into the areas of highest need. St Augustine’s is a school of need and it needs to have this funding for its childMAIN COMMITTEE",302,Whistleblowers

(Time expired) Ryan Electorate: Riverview to Moggill Bridge chamber today as I give my speech, because I want to alert the people of Ryan, and particularly the electors of Ryan who live in Bellbowrie and in the far western suburbs of the great electorate of Ryan, to a press release that the member put out last week advocating very strongly that a bridge be built from Riverview to Moggill. Let me quote the member for Oxley, because I am sure the good residents of Ryan will be very keen to know where the ALP stands on this. I am sure that they are also going to be calling upon the Labor candidate for Ryan to come clean on her views and tell them whether she supports the member for Oxley or whether she supports the people of Bellbowrie. This is what the member for Oxley said in his press release of Friday, 18 June 2004: A BRIDGE should be built from Riverview to Moggill replacing the antiquated Moggill ferry service as part of the Federal Government’s plans to address traffic congestion in south-east Queensland, the Federal Member for Oxley ... said today. “A bridge from Riverview to Moggill would be great and would go a long way towards addressing the serious traffic problems that plague south-east Queensland,” Mr Ripoll said. I am not sure that the people of Bellbowrie would be very keen to hear that the ALP is supporting the building of a bridge across the Moggill ferry route, because all that is going to do is dramatically increase congestion on Moggill Road. I think that the state government, which is responsible for Moggill Road, has got to get its act together and do something. The state Labor government has been in office in Queensland now since 1989, when Wayne Goss came to office, for all but the two short years of the Borbidge government. It is now 2004 and it is about time that the Queensland Labor government spent money on Moggill Road. Let me go back to the member for Oxley, who, of course, represents the opposition and will continue to represent his district, if he is fortunate enough to be re-elected, in opposition following the next election. I know that the people of Bellbowrie are very keen for the Labor candidate for Ryan to clarify whether she supports the personal views of the member for Oxley that a bridge should be built across the Moggill ferry route, because that is something that is going to absolutely profoundly affect the volume of traffic on an already heavily congested Moggill Road. Suburban traffic in the western suburbs is already at an unbearable level and this proposal by the member for Oxley is not going to add one little bit to solving the problem.

The petitioners call on all members to accept national responsibility for priority in funding to our public schools, because they, like I, want to make sure that our public schools do continue to provide a high quality of education to each and every Australian. I just want to make reference to another petition, which I unfortunately cannot present because it is not in order. I want to make reference to the importance of the issues that the petitioners have raised with me. The petition is titled ‘Ride for refugees’. The petitioners have asked us to support fairer treatment for people arriving in Australia seeking asylum. They are specifically asking that children and families currently in custody be released into the community; that people who have been proven to be refugees be provided with permanent protection, with assistance to return home on a voluntary basis; that the long periods of detention be reduced to a short-term assessment period and that people be released into the community whilst determination of refugee status is reached. I thank the committee for the opportunity to present this petition here today. The petition read as follows– To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House. For over 150 years our country has been served by a comprehensive and inclusive system of public education. Public education has contributed to successful lives and democratic social development in an Australia which is highly skilled and economically strong. It has built our national identity and democratic traditions and given the capacity for active citizenship to the Australian people. All of this has been possible only because the system has enjoyed public confidence and public investment. At this time both are under threat. Public confidence has been undermined by divisive attacks and public investment has been distorted by an unfair system of federal funding which favours an already well-off minority to the detriment of those in genuine need. We therefore call on all Members to condemn these unjust attacks, and to: accept national responsibility to provide priority in funding to public schools to enable them to continue to provide high quality education to all, regardless of wealth, location, ethnicity, religion or special needs; and, replace the current unfair SES funding model with a new Commonwealth and State system which provides enhanced educational resources to schools allocated on the basis of educational need and which ends public funding to wealthy schools which are already well resourced. from 12,720 citizens. Health: Alzheimer’s Disease and Schizophrenia Education: Higher Education Contribution Scheme of education. In relation to health, I want to draw the attention of the chamber to the need for more public health programs, which are supplementing the moneys that are paid into the health system in various ways. It is not just about money, but it is also, if I may say so, about programs. The two that I want to mention are for schizophrenia and for sufferers of Alzheimer’s disease. I am pleased to say that yesterday in this place the Parliamentary Friends of Schizophrenia group was launched. I was privileged to attend that function, at which John McGrath spoke, and he spoke very well about the suffering that people with schizophrenia have and how they are falling through the cracks in our society. MAIN COMMITTEE",304,Statements By Members
427,Mr King (Wentworth) (9.49 A.m.),"I wish to raise two issues: one of health and the otherIn my area, where there are a relatively large number of homeless, especially on the western side of the electorate, those who suffer schizophrenia, according to the reports of the Brown Nurses, whom I work with on some of these issues, are amongst the most prevalent. The two problems are these. Firstly, sufferers of schizophrenia are unable to identify their problem, are often in self-denial, take drugs and alcohol and in this way become worse situated than they were before. Also, many of those who are actually homeless suffer from schizophrenia. I think we need a proper targeted public program, working with state authorities, private organisations and charitable organisations such as the Brown Nurses, to address this problem, which is particularly prevalent in our inner cities, although not only in the inner cities. The other public health program I want to draw attention to relates to Alzheimer’s disease. I am pleased to see that Alzheimer’s Australia has commenced a public screening program to help potential sufferers from Alzheimer’s disease, who ultimately are thrown onto the health system in their 60s suffering dementia and so on, to identify that problem through a public screening process. I would like to see more public support for that particular program because in that way not only will we be helping those people by an alert system but also we will be saving the taxpayers lots of money by addressing the issues before they become a real problem. The second topic I want to raise concerns education. The two points I want to make briefly are these. First, in relation to HECS payments, I think we need a new program for more library allowances for our universities to help students who cannot afford textbooks because of the problems they have meeting their HECS requirements. The second is that we need special programs to promote expert overseas programs such as those for IFAD. Holt Electorate: Order of Australia Awards Dandenong Journal.

It is concerning because of the nomination process. Obviously there were not a lot of nominations in this region, and I have undertaken on behalf of the community in this region to advertise this particular award more fully so that more good honest battlers can apply for it. One thing I need to alert the Order of Australia Council about is that, when you have good, decent people who nominate and nominate frequently, please make sure that they are actually granted the award.

SoI would encourage the Order of Australia committee, when we get a few more nominations, which we will do next year, to use fair criteria to determine who should be eligible for this award. I would like to see people like Carlos Lyola, the coach of the Australian soccer team for kids with intellectual disabilities, Carol Drummond, a director of the Dandenong Community Advisory Bureau, and Lindsay King, who is a fantastic promoter of tourism in the Cranbourne region, given the opportunity to be appropriately recognised.

Employment: Work for the Dole Awards dous event, and I am referring not just to the excellence of the arrangements, the cuisine and the camaraderie but also to the celebration of community and personal achievement. I refer of course to the Prime Minister’s Work for the Dole Awards. The dynamic of the evening was the clearest possible demonstration of the effectiveness of Work for the Dole, not only as an avenue of mutual obligation but also as a mechanism to break the cycle of unemployment, to restore confidence and self-esteem and to focus previously unemployed people on a stimulating and aspirational path of engagement with the work force. Kathy Tomkins, a constituent of mine, is the embodiment of the good things in the Work for the Dole program. Last night she won the 2003 Participant of the Year Award. She reached the high point on the path that 292,000 current and former Work for the Dole participants have embarked on. Kathy has an amazing story to tell, rising from a disadvantaged background and the depths of personal despair to become the best Work for the Dole participant in the nation. Kathy fought and beat her personal demons and has found a steady course for the rest of her life. Kathy began her journey by taking part in the Work for the Dole activity hosted by the Salvation Army Store in Bundaberg and is now a reception and admin assistant at the Salvation Army’s Tom Quinn Centre-the centrepoint of its Bundaberg social programs. Kathy, like the recent participants, took up her training credits earned as part of the program. Those credits helped pay for her certificate II in business studies and she has since undertaken a certificate III course to further her skills. In addition, Kathy gives her time as a guest speaker in schools to share her story on the harmful effects of drug use. Don Cook, the retired manager of the Salvation Army Family Stores and Community Services in Bundaberg, had this to say about Kathy turning her life around: Everyone that had previously met Kathy can hardly believe that it is the same young woman who came into our lives.

Shortland Electorate: Health Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.58 a.m.)-On a number of occasions I have raised in this House my great concern about the doctor shortage on the Central Coast and how this is impacting on the everyday lives of people who live there. TodayI would like to share with the committee the very sad and difficult experience that one woman had when her 91-year-old mother had to move to a high-care residential facility within the electorate. The northern part of the Central Coast-Toukley, Buff Point, Blue Haven, Budgewoi, San Remo, Lake Haven, Chain Valley Bay, Gwandalan and Summerland Point-is particularly poorly serviced by doctors. The lady that I speak of contacted my office in great distress because her 91-year-old mother had to move to one of the local residential facilities because she had had a stroke and had poor mobility, and her doctor, who worked in a one-doctor practice, advised that he would be unable to continue caring for her in that facility. She makes the point in a letter she sent to me-and she also sent a copy of this letter to the health minister-that until that time she thought that it was very exasperating that she had to wait two weeks to see her overworked doctor. But she was absolutely devastated when she found that her mother could not have a doctor visit her in the nursing home. After contacting 33 doctors on the Central Coast, all those doctors advised that they would not visit her in that facility. One practice has 18 doctors in it and not one of those 18 doctors was prepared to go and visit her mother, who is in a nursing home that is only two kilometres at the most from their practice. Many other doctors had their books closed and the few that would accept this lady’s mother as a patient said that she would be required to attend their surgery. This is an impossibility, because her mother is confined to a wheelchair and it is very difficult to get somebody who is confined to a wheelchair into a car, out of a car and into the doctor’s surgery. When she rang my office I made some inquiries and was given the name of a couple of doctors who could possibly assist her. But thank goodness her mother’s own doctor rethought his position and was prepared to travel some distance to visit her in that aged care facility. On the northern part of the Central Coast there is something like one doctor to about 2,500 residents. In some areas it is one doctor to over 8,000 people. It is no wonder that doctors on the Central Coast are unable to take time out of their busy practices to go and visit those people who are in aged care facilities, and who desperately need to see a doctor. In many cases, those aged care facilities will not accept residents unless they have a doctor who will visit MAIN COMMITTEE",307,Statements By Members

There have been occasions where residential facilities have refused to accept residents simply because they did not have a doctor who would visit them in those facilities. The story I have told you is about one person. But it is not an isolated event. This happens all the time. This happens when aged people go to residential care facilities and they cannot get a doctor to visit them there. The other side of the story is that people are waiting two weeks and more to see their doctor in the practice in their area. This is not good enough and I want the health minister to deal with this as a matter of urgency.

It is an outstanding achievement. Diane and Ross Taylor, who were there last night; Kim Holl; Jamie-Lee Sawrey-one of the participants; and Kylie Norris were all as proud as I was when the announcement was made that Food For Thought won the national award for best Work for the Dole activity for 2003. The caring for people category, which this project won, covers a broad range of activities and shows that local action can make a difference to individuals. This particular project was to provide nutritious meals for schoolchildren. It is something that the Work for the Dole participants really relished being part of because they could see the results. The local council had conducted research that showed that local children’s behaviour and academic performance were often related to poor nutrition. The project resulted in noticeable improvements in the children’s behaviour and academic performance. Participants learned skills in purchasing and packing food and making craft items which the local schools used to raise funds. Laura, a student at Rasmussen State School, said: We have a brain break at 10 am. We are allowed to eat fruit and cheese. It makes our brain work. We do a dance after. Kylie Fricker, a mother of a student at Rasmussen school, said: This programme is providing children with an opportunity to learn and develop. Intervention on this level is desperately needed so that the cycle of poverty can be broken. I believe that there have already been some remarkable results. It makes me proud as a local member to understand that people in my community can make such a difference and that, so far away from the golden triangle in the south of the country, we can get a project up that is judged the best overall Work for the Dole activity for 2003. On another matter, the government is currently seeking tenders to license another 23 magnetic resonance imaging machines. Those magnets do a fantastic job in the health system.

Currently the MRI at Townsville Hospital is very busy and there are long waiting times to access that magnet. I very strongly support the MRI at the Mater hospital being publicly funded. It has been there since 1999, doing a marvellous job. Unfortunately the hospital has to charge significant dollars for its use, whereas I believe that it should be a publicly funded machine. I ask the government to look closely at this particular machine, and I hope that it gets chosen as one of the 23 machines that will be funded in the current tender. Roads: Ipswich Motorway wich Motorway proposal and the possibility of an alternate route as the solution, it is essential to ensure that the facts are clear. The biggest claim among the few people who think that the Ipswich Motorway should not be upgraded is that the six lanes are not enough for future needs, and that by the time the motorway was completed it would be at capacity. For simplicity, the upgrade is often referred to as the six-lane Ipswich Motorway upgrade, but a more accurate description would be the Ipswich to Brisbane transport corridor solution plan. Those who had the opportunity to examine the Ipswich Motorway project report in detail would understand that the upgrade is not a simple addition of two lanes. It is a comprehensive and integrated plan. Any suggestion otherwise is incorrect and plainly dishonest. In some parts of the corridor there would be six lanes and in other parts eight. But, more importantly, the upgrade is not just about adding two extra lanes; it is about a complete transport corridor package. It involves the major redesign of intersections, interconnecting roads and links between suburbs, extra service roads, removing bottlenecks, upgrading rail infrastructure, upgrading public transport options and balancing the number of lanes with required traffic flows. The Ipswich Motorway proposal is a thorough and comprehensive plan that will deliver a safe and reliable road network with a life span of 30 years. The Ipswich Motorway project report cost $6 million and examined all requirements by the federal and state governments, with representatives from both fully involved in the full process and planning. The issue of how long it will take to complete can be an emotive matter and used for political purposes. But actually getting the job started is the crucial first step. The upgrade will take many years to complete, but it can be done while traffic continues to flow and must be done to transform the Ipswich Motorway from its substandard and dangerous condition. Every modern road project today is carried out while traffic continues to flow. It can be done effectively with overall traffic flows being quicker and safer due to lower speeds. There is plenty of evidence from past projects, including the M1 to the Gold Coast that traffic can flow efficiently. The preposterous concept that bulldozers turn up on a Monday to rip up the road and everyone has to wait years before they can use the road again is nothing more than a smear and fear campaign from a few who are determined to derail the project. While I have never objected to more roads being funded or built, I do object to an either/or ultimatum. The priority must remain dealing with the core problem and fixing it. If the federal government desperately wants to fund more roads to the north, south or otherwise, they will get no argument from me. The recent use of daily vehicle movements on the Ipswich Motorway-as well as average daily, average weekly and peak daily figures-by the member for Blair to discredit the merit of the upgrade highlights the desperate attempts to MAIN COMMITTEE",309,Adjournment
435,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (10.08 A.m.),"With all the debate about AusLink, the specific Ipsconfuse and delay any progress. Not surprisingly, we now see some urgency by government to do something, so out goes the fast-tracking mantra for an alternate route. The Ipswich Motorway issue is not new. I have been campaigning for it for over six years. In 1994 the Labor government committed funding to begin the process of upgrading the Ipswich Motorway in 1996. This funding and commitment to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway a decade ago was scrapped by the incoming Howard Liberal government. Labor again committed funding to upgrade the motorway in 1998, with the most recent commitment to fully upgrade the corridor as a priority and matter of urgency. In the same period, the Liberal government has made no commitment to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway and has used every political opportunity to delay and dilute its direct responsibility. Disappointingly, the HowardThompson team have finally confirmed the dumping of the Ipswich Motorway as a federal responsibility. Most disturbing and astonishing is Mr Thompson’s insistence on compelling all traffic from the Cunningham and Warrego highways onto his northern route directly into the Logan toll road. This outrageous proposal surely must fail-as have Mr Thompson’s past options A, B, C, D and E. We are now being offered option F, being the two bridge option in lieu of the original five bridge option. People are also being told that the northern route will cross the river only twice into the leafy blue-ribbon suburbs of Moggill and Priors Pocket but will not have an off-ramp. Surely no one believes that the federal government would build a road costing more than $500 million and not provide a simple off-ramp for those needing to travel to Moggill and Kenmore. If the northern alternative is given the green light by the federal government instead of the upgrade to the Ipswich Motorway, there will be very few winners and more precious years will have been wasted waiting for more reports based on one man’s personal views. Mr Thompson should consider the following facts in relation to his recent denigration of the good people at Queensland Main Roads and the Queensland government. First, the federal government had senior representatives from its own department-the Department of Transport and Regional Services-on the steering committee that oversaw the study into the sixlane upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. The study’s parameters were expanded on several occasions at the request of the federal government; and the state government met every single request of the federal government in relation to the report. The final cost of the entire study was $6 million, not $10.6 million as stated by Mr Thompson, and was totally paid for by the Commonwealth government, because they agreed with what was done. The final report includes 25 subsets of studies including, but not limited to concept planning and layout, bicycle plans, public transport access studies, public utility requirements, traffic reports, air quality reports, environmental impact studies, a noise impact study, a social impact study, mining subsidence studies and so on. This report is as comprehensive as one could hope to find. It was completed in early 2002 but has never been actioned or done since, because the federal government has no will. Mr Thompson has been fully briefed, chapter and verse, on the report’s findings, yet he continues to misrepresent all the findings in that report. The recent attack by Mr Thompson on the credibility of the report on the six-lane upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway is his latest trick in a very long list of tricks by the federal government to justify its decision to dump the Ipswich Motorway from its scope of responsibility. The people of south-east Queensland want action, answers and leadership on this issue, not MAIN COMMITTEE this litany of excuses and ill-informed nonsense coming from the member for Blair, Mr Thompson, and the Howard government. Roads: Eden Park FRAN BAILEY (McEwen-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (10.13 a.m.)-I feel like saying ‘correct weight’ at the end of my colleague’s speech. I rise today to bring to the attention of the House a very serious matter that has been raised in my electorate. Last night in the township of Whittlesea, around 120 people gathered to voice their concern at what the local council, the City of Whittlesea, is doing to the ratepayers. In particular, I am referring to the residents of Eden Park. This dispute has had a long history, and it started with the City of Whittlesea arbitrarily deciding, with absolutely no consultation, that they would seal a number of these largely country roads and the residents would pay the cost. The residents were never consulted as to whether they wanted this to happen. The council simply made a decision. We managed to stop them, and before the last state election the City of Whittlesea agreed that they would cease all implementation of this road user charge scheme, and in particular stage 4 of the Eden Park scheme, until there had been a reform of the Local Government Act in Victoria. Residents accepted this at face value. Independent councillor Allan Cann is the only one who really speaks up for the residents of Whittlesea. Council has sent a letter out to every resident in Eden Park telling them that they are going ahead with this scheme. They have broken their promise-they said that they would wait until the local government act had been reformed. In this letter they have had the absolute audacity to say that the resident must vote yes or no but, if a resident does not return the letter-and there are many people there whose first language is not English-that is counted as a yes. That is an interesting way for the democratic process to work. I have never heard of this before and yet this council claims to represent these people. I think that this is an absolute disgrace, and so did all of the 120 people who attended the public meeting in Whittlesea last night. At the meeting they moved three motions: (1) that council delay implementation of its special charge scheme at Eden Park until, at least, the policy on special charge scheme guidelines is released by the state government, (2) that in the interim residents of Eden Park vote no to the Eden Park stage 4 possible road improvements special charge scheme and (3) that a committee be formed to pursue these matters with council and the state government reporting back to the meeting of local residents, known as This entire debacle has simply been a bunch of local councillors trying to ride roughshod over the wishes of local ratepayers. These councillors have forgotten the most basic rule of elected representation: they were elected to represent all of the residents, all of the ratepayers. This council have set their sights on a particular course of action and, come what may, they want to implement this road user charge scheme. This is not good enough. It is simply not on. It is about time that this council realised that the 120 people gathering in Whittlesea last night to protest against this was just the start. This is going to spread. We are not going to allow these councillors to get away with such completely undemocratic practices. They owe it to all the people they represent to call a halt, admit that they are on the wrong path, admit that they have broken a promise that they made before the last state election, admit that they have to MAIN COMMITTEE honour their promise and their responsibility and cease this futile exercise that is damaging so many of their local ratepayers. (Time expired) Howard Government: Funding ciate Professor and Reader in Drama at the School of English, Media Studies and Art History, University of Queensland and Ms Kate Stowell, News Editor of Arts Alive radio, Melbourne. I met Dr Tomkins and Ms Stowell last week as they were delegates to the inaugural Council for Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, CHASS, conference held at Parliament House on 15 and 16 June 2004. As a nineteen-year-old news editor, Ms Stowell has a passion for promoting youth participation in Australia’s media and strongly believes media diversity in Australia is crucial to Australia’s democracy. Ms Stowell is concerned by the Howard government’s failure to provide adequate support for young artists and youth media. Dr Tomkins believes a major issue facing the newly formed Council for Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, particularly for members who are university researchers, is the government’s funding parameters for federally funded research projects. These researchers in humanities, arts and social sciences represent almost half of Australia’s university researchers. The government’s national research priority areas, NRPAs, for research in Australia apply almost exclusively to the sciences and related disciplines, instead of recognising research that broadens the nation’s understanding of its culture and its place in the international sphere. The four NRPAs that were announced by the government in 2003 are (1) an environmentally sustainable Australia, (2) promoting and maintaining good health, (3) frontiers technologies for building and transforming Australian industries and (4) safeguarding Australia. There is almost no room in these categories for the vital research that Australia’s humanities, arts and social sciences researchers conduct. The government originally stated that it would add a humanities and social sciences based priority area in 2004. Instead, the government amended the existing four areas to broaden them slightly. They remain the same. But the priority goals within two of them can possibly be stretched to include research in the humanities, arts and social sciences. These may all be worthy research ventures, but the amendment to the NRPAs does not recognise the nature of a vast proportion of arts and social sciences research in Australia. It is essential to see that the humanities, arts and social sciences are part of everyday life and culture in Australia. They are concerned with how we read our surroundings, what media we use to get our news and how we interpret that news, and what we might read or whether we have seen the latest David Williamson play. The arts are not isolated from the rest of the world. If we believe that arts and social sciences are a vital part of the nation’s well-being then these research parameters need to be modified. The humanities, arts and social sciences sometimes suffer from old-fashioned images of researchers in ivory towers simply doing arcane, abstract or meaningless research. This model is long outmoded. Instead, research in these areas connects integrally to the world around us. After all, the management of culture is as important as the IT management of information. If the government is committed to maintaining and improving facilities for Australian research at international levels, surely it needs to provide parameters that are appropriate to the research that Australia’s humanities, arts and sciences researchers are doing. The research that MAIN COMMITTEE",310,Adjournment
436,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (10.18 A.m.),"I speak on behalf of both Dr Joanne Tomkins, Assothese academics carry out is realistic and pragmatic. It is time that the funding models for which they are eligible were equally realistic and pragmatic. Funding CHASS is one useful step. The Minister for Education, Science and Training announced some ongoing organisational funding for CHASS on 16 June 2004. But providing realistic parameters for the actual research in Australia in the disciplines that comprise the humanities, arts and social sciences is also essential. In concluding, I congratulate Dr Tomkins and Ms Stowell on their hard work and passion for Australian culture and media diversity and their work with the Council for Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. Education: Funding of the teachers union, a teacher from Dubbo College Senior Campus and a parent who had children at Dubbo College Senior Campus. They wanted to discuss Commonwealth funding of state schools and private, or non-government, schools. While we did not agree on everything, we did agree that every Australian should have the opportunity to have the best free education at the school level. I certainly agree with that and the government does too. I would like to see us be able to put maximum funding into government schools. I do believe, as I think the majority in this House believe, that children at private, or non-government, schools also have a right to support from the general community. The issue that recently has been so dishonest-not to put too fine a point upon it-in the recent advertising by the teachers union, as I think the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, showed yesterday, was showing two schools of approximately the same size and saying that one is getting $3 million and the other is getting $1 million or so from the federal government and failing to mention that the total tax dollars going to the government school is seven times greater-$21 million or more. That is a total misrepresentation, and the teachers union does stand condemned for it. Having said that, of course the government want to give every bit of funding to government schools that we can. That reminds me: I am very proud of a program called the Country Areas Program, which is obviously a Commonwealth government program. In country areas of New South Wales, $1.3 million in grants has been given to country schools. I say with a lot of pride that, of that $1.3 million, $750,000 is going to schools in the Parkes electorate-and that is for geographically isolated schools. In the far west of New South Wales, in places like Tibooburra, Menindee, Wilcannia and Broken Hill, the really isolated schools are getting grants out of this program. In the central west of New South Wales, in places like Hillston, Lake Cargelligo and Condobolin, and in the south in places like West Wyalong, Barmedman, Weethalle, Tallimba and Corinella, all the schools are getting funds which they have the opportunity to use on small projects. Regarding the announcement by the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Prime Minister about the enormous amount of funding-up, I think, by $8 billion over the next four years in the next rollout-that the Commonwealth is putting towards primary and secondary school education in Australia, I would have to say I absolutely welcome its being contingent upon flag ceremonies and exercise. I think it is fantastic. I do not believe in everything American, but I do love their nationalism. I am sure Australians have that same nationalism, but we are much quieter about it. Whether or not the flag is your particular favourite is not the issue: it is a symbol of our country and it will give those children a sense of commuMAIN COMMITTEE",313,Cowra In One Months Time

I believe, far and away, that the average parent and the average Australian will be very pleased that we are going to show that kind of commitment, that kind of belief in our nation. On the exercise side, I am an enormous believer in sport. This is not so much about government schools; this is about all schools. By and large in New South Wales, government schools do make sure their students exercise. However, this means not just government schools, not just Catholic schools, but all schools-whether they be private, non-government or whatever they are-will have to ensure that at least two hours of exercise is carried out by those students a week. I hope with all my heart that that exercise revolves around team sports, which are such a wonderful communication tool. They help children to learn to work together, to live together, to be a team-and that is what it is about. I think it is a wonderful program, and I am also very proud of the Country Areas Program, which has done so well for my electorate. (Time expired) Swan Electorate: Harold Hawthorne Senior Citizen’s Centre number of seniors information forums in my electorate. More than 500 people have been to these forums and they have heard from guest speakers from a range of government departments and service providers. I thank Steve Trevisiol from Centrelink, Len Rathmann from the Office for Seniors Interests, Graham Whitworth from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, Carole Martell from the City of Canning, and Mary Band from the Harold Hawthorne Senior Citizens Centre. There are over 20,000 people aged 60 and over, almost a quarter of the population, in my electorate of Swan. Community centres like the Harold Hawthorne centre in Carlisle provide a valuable service to the community. The Harold Hawthorne centre comprises a community care centre and a day centre. The community care centre is specifically designed to enable the elderly, frail and disabled and their carers to remain in the sanctity of their own home. They provide support services like Care Aide, which provides personal care to seniors in their own homes or help with transport to the bank or a doctor’s appointment. They also provide Help Aide, which provides services such as basic housework, washing and ironing. They also do gardening and home maintenance. These programs allow for seniors to remain in the comfort of their own homes. For many, it is the home they have lived in all their married life. It allows for seniors to enjoy the companionship of their neighbours and retain their independence. These services also help the elderly to avoid premature, permanent care in age care facilities like hostels and nursing homes. The Harold Hawthorne community centre also has a day centre. It offers a safe and secure environment for not only seniors but also younger people with disabilities so they can get together on a social basis. Just as importantly, it allows for respite for carers while their patients are at the day centre. But there is more. Besides what I have already mentioned, the seniors gold mine in Carlisle offers a Meals on Wheels service as well as a dining room serving threecourse meals. It also runs a pensioner league and offers a podiatry service. Seniors can also participate in other activities at the centre, like indoor lawn bowls, bingo, billiards and art and craft groups, or they can spend time in the highly popular Internet lounge. I could go on about the myriad range of activities at the Harold Hawthorne centre, but I would like to focus on the people who work there.

I would like to mention in particular the Hon. Dr Cheryl Davenport, who is a member of the Harold Hawthorne centre board of management and convenor of the HACC subcommittee. Cheryl works tirelessly for both staff and clients at the centre. Mick Lee, the mayor of Victoria Park, cofounded the centre with Harold Hawthorne and is a member of the Harold Hawthorne centre board of management. Graeme Prentice is the executive director of the centre and treasurer for the Home and Community Care service. Mary Band is the HACC program coordinator. Mary manages the Home and Community Care and adult day centre. The agency’s rating has risen from a basic to a high standard since Mary took over in August 2002. Client numbers have also increased by over 100 in this time. Mary has given very generously of her time to attend the seniors forums, and I thank her most sincerely for her efforts. Heather Cordy, the day centre coordinator, and Janice McCooke, the client services coordinator have both recently obtained certificates III and IV in community services, aged care. Nancy Seaman is the assessment and review officer, and Kerrie Jones is a senior administrative assistant. Gloria Del Borrello is the office support worker at the Harold Hawthorne centre, and there is also a great team of care aides, home helpers and gardeners/handypersons who are too numerous to mention. Another employee at the Harold Hawthorne centre is Phyllis Brown, the centre’s secretary. Phyllis has had 30 years experience at the centre and does a great job organising events. Another long-term employee at the Harold Hawthorne centre is Lorraine Hazeldean, who looks after the Meals on Wheels service. Lorraine has also worked at the centre for over 30 years. In the Meals on Wheels kitchen there is Belen Paet, the cook, and Jo Jay Phillips, the assistant cook. They are both long-serving employees and the real backbone of the kitchen. They are ably assisted by a great team of hard working kitchen hands. Finally, the crew from the seniors Internet lounge deserve mention. Jim Booker is the coordinator. Jim started at the centre as a volunteer driver. Now, with volunteer mentors Lorraine Major, Thelma Dyer and Dave Masshedar, Jim runs this extremely popular seniors Internet lounge. They are at the lounge every day, supporting the senior students and helping them experience the World Wide Web and the advantages of email.

Budget 2004-05 stration) (10.33 a.m.)-For various technical reasons, partly because I introduced some of the budget bills and because I summed up the budget bills on behalf of the government, I was not able to speak as I often do with respect to the budget itself, so I would like to traverse some of the matters that I would otherwise have covered in a budget speech. The Howard government’s ninth budget is great news for Sunshine Coast residents, offering assistance to families, students and couples, with tax cuts and a boost to people’s retirement savings. The budget, importantly for an area with an ageing population like the Sunshine Coast, includes increased funding for aged care, boosting the number of places available as well as improving the quality care our older residents deserve.

It includes 40 high-care and 60 low-care places for the region. It was opened by the Minister for Ageing. I opened the extension to the Caroline Chisholm aged care facility at Currimundi. The new facilities include 40 high-care and 38 low-care places. This means that the facility, which opened in 1996, can now provide Australian government funded residential care to 118 older members of our Sunshine Coast community, including special care for residents with dementia. Older, frail people and people with disabilities can also receive a variety of types of support to help them remain in their homes. Just recently, the Howard government has helped to establish in the Fisher electorate a Sunshine Coast regional office of Carers Queensland, which is part of a nationwide network. The new office has received $755,000 from the Australian government as part of a joint federal and Queensland government Home and Community Care program. Sunshine Coast families will also benefit through the additional $19.2 billion, to be provided over five years, including a new maternity payment of $3,000 for each newborn child from July 2004, increasing to $4,000 in July 2006 and $5,000 in July 2008. This will be available to all families. Families will also benefit from a huge boost to child-care places to help take the pressure off families attempting to juggle the responsibilities of work and children. An additional 40,000 outside school hours child-care places and an extra 4,000 family day care places will also be provided. Labor argues that there is nothing in the budget for Australians earning less than $51,000 a year, but there is in fact a great deal on offer through the tax cuts in previous budgets, the More Help for Families package, the government’s commitment to help people boost their retirement savings and by increasing the HECS threshold for repayment from $25,348 to $35,000. Tax cuts also mean that the overwhelming majority of taxpayers, who earn between $21,600 and $63,000, will not face any increase in their tax rate as their income increases. The Australian government is also committed to funding the infrastructure important for an area like the Sunshine Coast, which has one of the most rapidly growing populations in the nation. After successfully managing the Australian economy and paying back $70 billion of Labor’s massive public sector debt, the Australian government, in this budget and through its AusLink and Securing Australia’s Energy Future announcements, is providing lasting and permanent dividends, rather than spending taxpayers’ money on interest payments. I have been working with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to ensure that the Sunshine Coast is recognised in the allocation of infrastructure. In fact, I believe infrastructure and ensuring the Sunshine Coast’s road link to Brisbane is so important that, prior to the last election, I identified seeking funding to update the Bruce Highway as one of my core objectives-an objective which I am pleased to say has been very successful. The worse bottleneck-the area between Caboolture and Brisbane-will be upgraded to six lanes, and this means that people will be able to travel to the Sunshine Coast from Brisbane much more quickly, and 80 per cent of people traveling to the Sunshine Coast do so by road. There will also be additional money to upgrade the Bruce Highway north of Caboolture, and this is particularly important. The Sunshine Coast tourism industry will benefit not only from the commitment to upgrade the Bruce Highway to the Sunshine Coast but also through other commitments, including the gifting of the ex HMAS Brisbane to Queensland to be sunk as a dive site off the Sunshine MAIN COMMITTEE Coast. This will bring 15,000 dive tourists a year and create 70 to 100 new jobs, and it will boost our local economy, including the tourism industry. I have been working on this issue for some time. I am pleased that the Premier of Queensland has finally signed the deed of gift and that all of the benefits will flow through to the Sunshine Coast as soon as the ship is sunk. Now that the ship is state government property, I urge the Premier of Queensland to sink the ship off the Sunshine Coast as quickly as possible. I think this is really important because the benefits that will flow through to our local economy will be very substantial. People will come from around the nation and around the world to dive off the Sunshine Coast-which is, of course, the most desirable part of Australia in which to live. People move from Western Australia and the rustbelt areas of southern Australia to the sunbelt because it is a tremendous area. We welcome people. It is a wonderful area which I am privileged to represent in the Australian parliament. I thank the House. Aviation: Qantas Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (10.38 a.m.)-I wish to draw the attention of the House to the continuing and obviously deliberate plan by Qantas management to reduce the company’s cost structure by abandoning their obligations to regional Australia and cutting the number of Australians they employ. It always disappoints me to see the management of a company like Qantas, whose executives receive multimillion dollar salary packages, taking the easy way to increase profits. How easy it is to shut down a number of services and employ cheap overseas labour. Any first year management student could do that. The real challenge for the management of companies like Qantas is to create a bigger company with a bigger network, employing more Australians in more locations, and to do it at a profit. Going for growth does not mean just going for a bigger profit. That is easy, and the corporate world is full of leftover hatchet men from the nineties. Their creed of firing half the staff and closing down half the business is now totally discredited. But we find that Qantas is now set on such a course, and this will inevitably end in tears. I condemn the Qantas decision to move 400 Australian jobs offshore, just as I condemn the Qantas decision to abandon services to the major Queensland centres of Rockhampton and Mackay. By their actions, the management of Qantas has lost the confidence of regional Australia and now, by moving 400 Australian jobs offshore, every Australian would doubt the right of Qantas to use the slogan: ‘Qantas-the Australian way’. As we look at this drive by Qantas management for nothing more than greater shareholder return, we find that the actions of this Howard government are giving Qantas management an excuse for some of their actions. Airservices Australia have recently issued their proposed new charges for providing aviation rescue and firefighting services to airports around Australia. If ever there were a case to make for the Howard government’s policies being the root cause of loss of services to regional Australia, this is it. The current charge on an airline for the provision of rescue and fire services at airports is measured in total cost per tonne landed, and by this measure the cost per tonne landed in Mackay is $9.98, while the cost per tonne landed in Rockhampton is $9.59. These are the two highest charges in Australia. By comparison, the cost per tonne landed in Melbourne is only $1.09, while the cost per tonne landed in Sydney is a mere 69c. There can be no doubt that the MAIN COMMITTEE",316,Cowra In One Months Time

441,Mr Slipper,"My friend is wrong. It is the most desirable part of Australia to live in.fact that Mackay and Rockhampton are the most expensive airports in Australia to land at was a factor in the decision by Qantas management to abandon some services to these two Central Queensland cities. And the situation under the Howard government will only get worse. For the coming financial year-2004-05-the charges for rescue and firefighting services are set to rise, and the increases could only be described as staggering if you want to fly to Rockhampton or Mackay. The proposed new charge for Sydney is 75c per tonne landed, up from 69c. For Melbourne the new charge is $1.21 per tonne landed, up from $1.09. However, if you want to land your aircraft in Mackay it will now cost $19.16 per tonne landed, up from $9.98, while in Rockhampton the new charge will be $19.24 per tonne landed, up from $9.59. This makes the rescue and firefighting charges at Rockhampton the most expensive in Australia and those at Mackay the second most expensive. Quite clearly, the Howard government does not want Rockhampton or Mackay to have air services at all, and there is no hope under this government of the situation improving. A look at the projected charges show that in the year 2008 Sydney will be at 83c per tonne landed while Melbourne will be at $1.29 per tonne landed. However, at Mackay the charge will be $21.06 per tonne landed, while Rockhampton will remain the most expensive in Australia, at $22.42 per tonne landed. I estimate that this will add an additional $20 to the price of an airline ticket out of Rockhampton or Mackay. That is an impost on the bottom line of many of our businesspeople, and it of course affects families and those people travelling for essential family and medical business. Labor’s policy of network charging, on the other hand, would correct this injustice for regional airports around Australia and reduce the cost pressures on airlines like Virgin which want to service regional airports in Australia. Electorate of Canning: Mandurah Bypass nounce the most satisfying achievement in the electorate of Canning since I have been there. Senator Campbell, the roads minister, and I announced in Halls Head in my electorate $150 million for the Mandurah bypass. The Mandurah bypass is a program which has been delivered under the federal government’s new roads program-fully funded in this year’s budgetcalled AusLink. I have been fighting for the Mandurah bypass since I was elected the member for Canning, and it is fantastic to see a project that I have been fighting for on behalf of my constituents, the region in general and Western Australia, as an important piece of transport infrastructure, being delivered. Initially, the state government had corresponded that they would like the federal government to contribute half the cost of the Mandurah bypass, which was to be about $75 million. We went further than that. We offered $150 million to complete the Kwinana Freeway and the Mandurah bypass as a continuous build-in other words, we gave 50 per cent of the total cost of this project to see that the project is built in a timely and seamless manner so that the bottlenecks et cetera that occur in the electorate do not occur again. Interestingly, I realised that my colleague in the neighbouring seat of Brand, Mr Beazley, has been absolutely absent on this matter ever since he became the member for Brand. Strangely, he has not been lobbying like I have. As we know, he was a very senior member of the Labor Party, and he had the opportunity to make strong representations on behalf of the Peel region to get the Mandurah bypass built-and he shares an area where the route of the MAIN COMMITTEE",318,Cowra In One Months Time
442,Mr Randall (Canning) (10.43 A.m.),"It was my privilege on 5 June this year to anroad will be. In an article on 6 August 2003 in the Mandurah Coastal Times, Mr Beazley was quite snide in the way that he said that the federal government needed to give money quickly for these projects and that the road needed to be identified as a road of national importance. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr John Anderson, wrote to the state transport minister, Allanah McTiernan, on 1 March 2002 asking her to put in place the measson urging him to assist in this matter and Mr Anderson replied saying that Minister McTiernan had not responded to him. Mr Anderson’s letter to me was written on 29 June 2003some 16 months later. So some 16 months later, the state transport minister had not even bothered to apply for Roads of National Importance funding. And she has now come out into the public and said that the federal government had held this up for so long because they would not respond with respect to this road. She is saying black is white. She probably thinks that, if she says this often enough, the people of Western Australia might believe that it was the federal government that was not responding and not her. But let us continue with Mr Beazley, who said: If Mr Randall is so close to the top, why hasn’t he been able to persuade his colleagues of the urgency of the Peel deviation by now? I have-I have done it. I am proud to say that I did that in conjunction with others in the area-but not Labor members. The local Labor member for Mandurah, David Templeman, said that this road is 10 years away. He is not pushing to have it completed-nor are the state transport minister and Mr Beazley. Sadly, now that the money has been delivered, the state government are saying: ‘We haven’t got the funds to put into this. The federal government might have given us the $150 million, but we do not have any money.’ But they do have the money. They have received not only the GST allocated to them but also-as Mr Beattie has stated-an extra $230 million out of the GST in this year’s grants. That road could be built immediately with that GST money and they could get on with it. The state transport minister said that the planning is not in place and the design work is not in place-but main roads tell us that is not true; that they could begin work straight away. In fact, we gave them $5 million upfront from this federal grant to get on with things immediately. Strangely, Mr Beazley came out in this week’s Sound Telegraph and said that he is pleased that the project has been delivered and that ‘It’s about time that John Howard stopped spending on the Eastern States’ roads and spent some over here.’ The fact is that, if Mr Beazley had been helping, instead of being the absent member for Brand, we might have had some help in the past. Instead of Mr Beazley sniping and criticising from the side, some help from the member for Brand would help get this road finished. (Time expired) China: Human Rights Zhongwei, were both arrested in Beijing on 1 June and have not been heard of since. Both are aged 72. There are tens of thousands of political prisoners in the Chinese Laogai, the Chinese gulag, but Dr Jiang and Dr Hua are not just two more anonymous victims of Chinese Leninist political system. In April 2003 Dr Jiang, a surgeon with good connections in China’s health system, learned that the SARS epidemic in China was far more serious than the government was admitting. The government claimed there were only 19 cases, while Dr Jiang knew that MAIN COMMITTEE",319,Cowra In One Months Time

444,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (10.48 A.m.),"Dr Jiang Yanyoung and his wife, Dr Huathere were at least 10 times that many. He decided that it was his duty as a doctor and as a citizen to make this information public. He was not the only courageous Chinese doctor to do this, but he was the most prominent. He said at the time: I felt I had to reveal what was happening, not just to save China, but to save the world. Indeed, the international community owes Dr Jiang a debt for the final defeat of the SARS virus. As is now known, the SARS epidemic began in China and was actively covered up by the government of that country. As a result it spread rapidly through China and then into countries such as Vietnam, Singapore and Taiwan. China sought to block dissemination of accurate information about SARS-for example, by preventing the Taiwanese authorities gaining access to the services of the World Health Organisation. Dr Jiang’s courage in speaking out on SARS made him a national hero in China but it also made him a marked opponent of the regime in Beijing. His experience with SARS led him to become more critical of the regime and less willing to accept its version of history. This led him to reassess the events of July 1989, when the government repressed the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. In March this year therefore Dr Jiang, supported by his wife Dr Hua, wrote an open letter to the National People’s Congress, China’s parliament, asking them to reverse their verdict on the events of 1989. After recounting the grim detail of those events and the bloody mayhem, he said that China’s leaders had ‘mobilised all sorts of propaganda to fabricate lies and used high-handed measures to silence the people across the country’. Finally Dr Jiang implored the party to reassess the 1989 student movement by reversing its verdict from ‘counterrevolutionry rebellion’ or ‘political storm’ to ‘patriotic acts that had the support of the overwhelming majority of the people of Beijing and the country’. He said, ‘Our party must address the mistakes it has made.’ He concluded, ‘Anyone whose family members were unjustly killed should voice the same request.’ The arrest of this 72-year-old couple in China again shows that we need to understand that, despite the positive developments in the Chinese economic system, what we have there is a capitalist economy coexisting within a Leninist political system. It has an effect on even incredible heroes of China like these two famous doctors. Orville Schell, celebrated historian of China and dean of the University of California at Berkeley, recently concluded an article about Jiang by saying: Jiang may become a millionaire, wear any clothes he likes, redecorate his living room, even buy a car, but he cannot inform the public about an epidemic or write government officials an honest letter of admonition. Does it matter? That depends on whether one believes that Leninist capitalism is a viable and stable form of government for China over the long term. This issue is of great concern to Australia and goes to the stability of China. The existing conflicted state that China is in-between its economy, which is open to the world, and the kind of political system that arrests two doctors who have done the right thing not just by their own country but by the world-is an indictment of the oppressive political system that prevails there. The Australian government should formally protest the arrest of Dr Jiang and Dr Hua. We should demand their immediate release. We should make it clear to China that the continued arbitrary, cruel and, indeed, illegal arrests of people like these two elderly doctors does nothing but damage China’s reputation and the prospects of good relations with countries like Australia-even under the formalist constitution that they have in China; and I would point to articles 35 and 41 of the Chinese Constitution. If the Australian-Chinese human rights dialogue has any meaning-and I have severe doubts about it being anything except a formalist MAIN COMMITTEE and legalist cover for good relations between the two countries at an economic level-it should raise the issue of these two doctors. Education: Higher Education of concern that I have had for some time, that being the emphasis that is being placed on higher education and university education. Continually in the House we hear of HECS places, HECS costs, the issues of universities and the cost of university for students, but rarely do we hear of the issue of the value of TAFE training, technical training, the trades and services area. I have been concerned for some time that we have lost the sensitivity to understand how our children work in schools. In the past many students have gone into their education and in year 10, or even earlier, they have decided they would like to do a trade. However, now it almost seems as though it is a sin to want to do a trade and to go on and to be a builder, a mechanic, a panel-beater, an electrical engineer, an electrical fitter, or an air conditioning fitter, because people feel very strong pressure to go on to a university degree. It is almost as though now we do not have any respect for people who would like to do a trade. If you looked at how industries and small businesses developed and asked every small business owner that started up perhaps in the last 25 years or earlier, ‘Did you have a university degree? What level of education did you have?’ most of the people who have small businesses and have employed people for a long period of time would say, ‘No, I did not have a university degree,’ and many of them might say, ‘I had very little education at all.’ Small business owners with businesses that have been operational for many years are perhaps not as widely educated as many other people, yet they have provided continuous employment for numerous years to people who may not have had any other option. We now have a sense that we need to have a degree. If we do not have a degree we are considered lesser than somebody who does have a degree. Most of our schools focus on the academic prowess of their students rather than the assets some students might have of being able to do things brilliantly with their hands. It is time that we as a community and we as leaders in the government and in the House of Representatives should start to understand that students’ worth should be valued on things other than how high their academic and UAI scores are. It seems that schools now, both private and public, are focused clearly on an academic objective rather than on recognising the talents and attributes of each student and the very real progress that some students might be making towards going into a trade and employing people. It is worthwhile and it is valuable, yet it almost seems to me now that our students, if they are not academically bright and do not have grades in the 90s, are considered less worthwhile. It is time the leaders of this nation looked to creating a feeling of equity for all students, all children, across Australia. Students should be able to feel that if they want to have a small business and employ people or to do a trade then they are worthwhile. They should not be looked down on by anybody and they should not be considered different and given less time in their educational pursuits than those who look to go to university. Seventy per cent of our children do not go to universities, yet all of the teachers’ time is spent on the 30 per cent who look toward an academic career. Let us give a go to our students who want to enter trades and services, to start to employing people and to create small businesses. Our trades and services are the backbone of rural and regional Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE",320,Cowra In One Months Time
445,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (10.53 A.m.),"I rise this morning in the committee to raise an issueSocial Welfare: Disability Services circumstances of one of my constituents. This highlights the dilemma facing many in our community who have disabilities and their families and others who care for them. A constituent has been in touch with my office about her concerns over her intellectually disabled sister. Until recently the constituent’s sister, Carolyn, and her mother lived together. The mother has unfortunately been diagnosed with dementia, so she is no longer able to care for her daughter and is now in a nursing home. Carolyn is 58 years old. Carolyn is unable to understand why her mother is no longer with her. Added to that is the fact that Carolyn’s mother is not able to communicate with her because of the dementia, so Carolyn is confused and disoriented. In fact, Carolyn has had a breakdown. Carolyn is virtually homeless and is being cared for in the geriatric unit of a major public hospital in Sydney. While she needs specialist care, she is not geriatric. This lack of appropriate accommodation is one of the difficulties faced by ageing carers, and these problems will increase with our ageing population. Carers who are parents of middle-aged children with intellectual and physical disabilities will age and will become increasingly unable to care for their children. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in 1999 there were 162,300 people with profound severe core activity restriction in New South Wales under the age of 54. There are almost as many with moderate core activity restrictions. Of the people in New South Wales with a severe disability, 76,000 were receiving some form of assistance or support from a parent. This support takes the form of assistance with daily tasks such as mobility, communication, health care, transport, self-care, meal preparation and housework and property maintenance. Yet there is little respite or accommodation support available to these people. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in the 2001 report Unmet need for disability services found that as a conservative estimate there were 12,500 people across Australia needing accommodation and respite services. It seems self evident that the government must give urgent consideration to the accommodation support services needed by many in our community. I repeat: the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found that there are 12,500 people with disabilities across Australia who need but do not have access to accommodation, respite care and day care services. The National Disability Advisory Council end of second term report in December 2003 identified priority issues to be considered over coming years. Priority 4.9 refers to the deinstitutionalisation of community housing and support programs and states: A cooperative and integrated approach across governments and portfolios is needed to find practical funding solutions to housing and accommodation support options. Council aims to progress work on issues such as young people with a disability in nursing homes and homelessness and disability. I strongly urge this government to take action on this priority. It is not going to go away. The baby boomer population is ageing and it will no longer be able to care for middle-aged disabled children. Children like Carolyn will find themselves in inappropriate care facilities. Carolyn’s family, like many others facing the same predicament, must ask a series of questions: ‘What will happen to my child when I am no longer here to care for him or her? Where can I go to get support? What sort of future is my child facing? How long will my child need to wait for assistance?’ The questions are seemingly endless and the answers, sadly, are just not available. MAIN COMMITTEE",322,Cowra In One Months Time
446,Mr Melham (Banks) (10.58 A.m.),"I wish to draw the attention of the chamber to theThis government must give urgent priority to the provision of the accommodation support services needed by so many in our community who are currently unable to access these services. The government must give urgent consideration to the provision of respite services needed by the families and carers of the disabled. Further, the government must address the pressing need for the provision of post-school option services needed by those currently unable to access the support they need to engage in activities during the day. Australians with disabilities served by the Commonwealth-State/Territory Disability Agreement are among the most vulnerable in our community. Their disabilities are often lifelong and their support places ongoing strains on their families-strains which are unsustainable. This problem is not going to go away. The government does not have a good record in providing services for the disabled. Given that government is currently throwing around so much money, perhaps some of it could be thrown at those who so desperately need appropriate accommodation and respite support. I did not need a tax cut in the last budget but I got it and many like me got it. The government would have been better placed giving that money to services such as this for disabled people and people who need that sort of care. The vulnerable in our community need assistance from government, not the top end of town. That is the problem with this government: it has its priorities wrong. Flinders Electorate: Bike Paths and Walking Tracks in terms of bike paths and walking tracks on the Mornington Peninsula at Balnarring and Mount Martha within my electorate of Flinders. These are simple, basic things that are an important part of life in the electorate. They help people in the towns of Balnarring, Bittern and Mount Martha to go about their work and, above all else, they assist in providing safety for school students getting to and from school and for people recreating. There is a series of dangerous roads. They are important initiatives which need to be undertaken. I want to outline two initiatives, which are the Balnarring-Bittern bike path and the bike paths leading into and around Mount Martha Primary School. As some members of the House may know, I was fortunate recently to have had the opportunity to walk for 500 kilometres around my electorate to assist in raising funds for juvenile diabetes. During that period I obviously saw the condition of the roads and of all the walkways. It is very clear, firstly, that in the Balnarring-Bittern region there is a desperate and pressing need for the bike track which the local residents have been pushing for, with over 2,000 signatures in support, and I welcome the fact that the council has allocated funds in this last week. In the past I made a promise to them that, if they made such an allocation, the Commonwealth would assist through a Work for the Dole or Green Corps project. Those projects are ready to roll-they are in place-and I urge the Mornington Peninsula Shire, which has done a great job on its bicycle and walking path strategy, to immediately take up this offer. Existing local providers have done the preliminary work. They are ready to put into action work on the Balnarring-Bittern bike path. This is something for the residents of Balnarring and for the kids at the Balnarring Primary School, under Principal Rhonda Stephens, who intend to use these facilities. It is for the children at Bittern and Crib Point primary schools. For those three towns there will be a great benefit. I commend the work that the council has done MAIN COMMITTEE",323,Cowra In One Months Time
447,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (11.03 A.m.),"I am delighted to rise to talk about two key initiativesin allocating funds and I renew the promise that I made to introduce them to local service providers-Green Corps and Work for the Dole-and say, please, take that opportunity now so we can begin building these bike paths. They will be a great addition to the community. The second issue that I want to talk about is in relation to a letter I received just yesterday from Vicki Stephens, who is the president of the Mount Martha school council. Vicki Stephens points out in her letter that parents of children attending Mount Martha Primary School feel their children are in peril when arriving at and leaving their school due to the traffic congestion and lack of parking spaces close to the school. I know this myself because, during the course of my walk, I walked directly to Mount Martha Primary in the lead-up to school hours commencing and had the same challenges as the parents and children. There is a real need there, as part of the Mornington Peninsula Shire strategy, to have Mount Martha Primary School serviced by adequate bike paths and footpaths. At present there are 672 children at the school and this number is expected to grow to 900, so the demand and pressure will only increase. We are about making sure that these things are dealt with before there is a tragedy rather than afterwards, because there is no joy in being wise after the fact. The only value is in solving something now, before it becomes an issue. Having received this letter from Vicki Stephens, I will, firstly, be immediately writing to the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council, as I said I would. Secondly, I am raising it here in the House and, thirdly, I offer again the services of Green Corps and Work for the Dole. So, if there is an allocation from the council for a basic funding provision, we will immediately make these services available to them. This is my town, so I speak not as a parent but as a local resident who lives within two kilometres of the school. There is a real need. I have walked those roads-I have walked them at the time of most danger-and I recognise that for the children and the parents in Mount Martha there is a need to update and upgrade the roads and walking facilities and to provide bicycle paths at Mount Martha Primary. I commend both the Balnarring-Bittern bike track and the upgrade at Mount Martha Primary School to the House. (Time expired) Holt Electorate: Health Services vance to my electorate. I want to paint a picture of the region where my electorate lies. It is an incredible growth corridor. It is within the borders of the City of Casey. It has a population of 210,000, and that population is growing by between 60 and 80 families per week. There are 40,000 children in this area between the ages of zero and 12, which is the highest rate of young people in the state of Victoria. This is an area that has a huge number of young families, and a huge number of young families need the sort of social infrastructure that they deserve to keep their communities going. One would expect, given the huge amounts of money that the federal government has put in through this budget-$52 billion over four years-that the social infrastructure that these families require-bulk-billing, access to doctors, access to Medicare offices-would be readily available. But I regret to inform this place that that is not the case. Over the past three years, from the year 2000 to the end of 2003, the bulk-billing rate in my electorate dropped from approximately 92 per cent to 76 per cent-a drop of roughly 15 per cent. I would like to say that we know that the bulk-billing rate has risen. However, because we cannot get the statistics from the Minister for Health and Ageing, because he is suppressMAIN COMMITTEE",324,Cowra In One Months Time
448,Mr Byrne (Holt) (11.09 A.m.),"I rise today to very briefly discuss a few issues of releing them-democracy in action, coalition style-I cannot actually tell you that. But I can tell you that I have rung the Dandenong District Division of General Practice, given that these statistics are suppressed, to try and ascertain the effects of the government’s measures. At this point in time, what I am being told is that there is no discernible difference. So a huge sum of money has been put into the health budget to allegedly prop up bulk-billing, but in this area where bulk-billing doctors are needed most there has been no discernible increase. If the health minister released the statistics on this perhaps we would have a better idea. However, anecdotally, at this point in time, without the benefit of statistics, I am being told that bulkbilling has not increased-that is, that the rate has not increased from its depth of 76 per cent. In this area, with this population of 210,000 people, you would expect that there would be an abundance of Medicare offices. For example, the City of Monash has three Medicare offices, with a population of 165,000. So one would expect, given that ratio, that there should be four or five Medicare offices in the City of Casey. They have none at this point in time. They are about to have one open next week, but they have had no Medicare offices. The Medicare office which has just been funded and will open next week will be based in the Fountain Gate shopping centre. For many years, this shopping centre was the largest shopping centre in Australia that did not have a Medicare office. We had been lobbying for five years to actually get a Medicare office and had been told by the Health Insurance Commission that it was not justified, as the population growth was not sufficient to enable a Medicare office to be placed in the Fountain Gate shopping centre. Curiously, in a running visit in the suburb of Narre Warren North, the Prime Minister announced funding for the Medicare office-and I am very grateful to the Prime Minister and to the Health Insurance Commission for that. It would have been better if it had been delivered five years ago. However, it may have something to do with the Fountain Gate shopping centre being right on the border of La Trobe, which is a marginal seat that the government needs to hold to maintain government. So the people of the City of Casey know this: they know that they struggled for five years to get a Medicare office and they have just got one; and they know they deserve more than one Medicare office. For example, in the suburb of Cranbourne, that has 30,000 people, roughly 60 families per week are shifting into that particular area and yet they still cannot get a Medicare office. So the City of Casey, population 210,000, just got funding; it just got one Medicare office. The City of Monash has three offices with a population of 165,000. I will touch very briefly on doctor shortages. In the City of Casey, the ratio of patients to doctors is one to 2,000-one doctor to 2,000. The recommended ratio is one to 1,400. We have a severe doctor shortage, yet none of these measures that have been proposed by the government even addresses this particular issue. A lady that has a bulk-billing clinic in Hallam, Dr D’Argent, is urgently seeking doctors and still cannot get a doctor out there. So these budget measures that are supposedly propping up bulk-billing and resolving the doctor shortage issue are doing no such thing. In my time remaining I would also point out that 94 per cent of people in my electorate did not get a tax cut-94 per cent. I think those statistics and my discussion about health show that the people of Holt have been dudded by this budget. Marriage Amendment Bill 2004 speak on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2004 so I want to take this opportunity to put my MAIN COMMITTEE",325,Cowra In One Months Time
449,Mr Bartlett (Macquarie) (11.14 A.m.),"Last week I did not have the opportunity toviews on the record. Marriage and the family are the bedrock of our society. They provide the loving, secure and stable environment necessary for building the self-worth, the esteem and confidence of children from the early formative years through to and including adolescence. They are also important in the essential role of building values, understanding right and wrong, and the development of social skills, responsibility and direction. Yet, sadly, the institution of marriage has been under attack in Australia, as it has been around the world, over recent years. In Australia, there are over 50,000 divorces each year, with the projected divorce rate at 32 per cent of all marriages. Twenty-one per cent of Australian children under 15 years are in single-parent families-this figure was 14 per cent just 15 years ago. Marriage provides structure and stability to our society. The Marriage Act Amendment Bill is necessary to alleviate the growing concerns in Australia at the erosion of the fundamental institutions of marriage and the family. My office has received numerous pieces of correspondence from people in my electorate and other electorates commending the government for this important bill-commending the government for acting decisively, for responding to the needs of Australia and for protecting families and the concept of marriage shared by the vast majority of Australians. The bill contained two key amendments. Firstly, the bill codified and provided formal definition to the understanding of marriage held by the overwhelming majority of Australians. Under this bill, section 46 of the Marriage Act formally defines marriage as: ... the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. This definition has the effect of prohibiting same-sex marriages within Australia and prohibiting Australian legal recognition of foreign same-sex marriages. This definition provides stability to the concept of marriage for all Australians and helps prevent the institution of marriage being eroded-at least in this sense. The concept of marriage held by the majority of Australians, including me, is of an exclusive union between one man and one woman. I believe this is the correct and only definition of marriage. The second key amendment made by this bill is a continuation of the government’s opposition to adoption by same-sex couples. The government has previously expressed its fundamental opposition to the adoption of children by same-sex couples, and this bill reinforces that position. The bill will prevent same-sex couples from adopting children from overseas under international agreements through bilateral and multilateral treaties. The vast majority of Australians support the government’s position that all children have the right to be nurtured, all other things being equal, by a mother and a father. Both mothers and fathers are critically important to the upbringing of children. For a variety of reasons, obviously things do not always work out this way. However, we ought to be doing all we can to start from the premise of what is optimal or what is ideal. The Labor Party’s response to this bill has been very disappointing. In the Senate, the Labor Party have demonstrated their intention to play political games with the Australian people. The opposition parties have had the bill referred to a Senate committee, where it will sit until after the election. The Labor Party is now courting the minority same-sex marriage lobby by promising to conduct a full audit of all Commonwealth laws on the basis of sexuality. With one breath they are trying to placate the majority of Australians by claiming that they support this bill, but with the next breath they are leaving their options open to throw it out. I want to make the point that this legislation is not in any way aimed at discriminating against homoMAIN COMMITTEE sexual couples. Indeed, the government’s other legislation to remove discrimination regarding superannuation makes it very clear that it is not homophobic. The government is committed to equal rights wherever that is possible but, equally, the government is clearly committed to doing all it can to retain the institution of marriage as the bedrock of families in our community. In summary, marriage and families are foundational institutions for Australians. We cannot always prevent families breaking down, but we have to do everything we can, in whichever area we can, to reinforce the basis of marriage for our families. The government is committed to protecting this institution through this important bill, by providing clarity to the definition of marriage and reinforcing restrictions on the adoption of children. I am pleased that this bill has been introduced and supported by this government. Collins, Former Senator Robert (Bob) Lindsay the queue. An honourable member-I am quite happy with that. his thoughts after a good evening. I want to inform the House of an accident that has occurred involving a former colleague of ours here in this place who is a former Hawke and Keating government minister, has been a personal friend of mine for 30 years and is a great Territorian. I am, of course, speaking of Bob Collins. Bob was a senator here from 1987 until I think five years ago. He has been involved in a rather bad car accident. This occurred while he was travelling alone in his vehicle on the Jim Jim Road in Kakadu National Park while heading home to Darwin last Sunday. We are told that Bob swerved to avoid a pig, rolled the car and hit a tree. That is not unusual in the Northern Territory-animals cause accidents, and this is yet another one. Sadly, it has affected Bob. He was able to get out of the vehicle and was evacuated to Darwin, where they assessed the nature of his injuries. After making that assessment, they determined that he was in a serious but stable condition. A decision was then made to fly him to the Royal Adelaide Hospital. So he was flown to Adelaide for quite complicated orthopaedic surgery to his lower body. I understand that an operation took place yesterday. I was informed this morning that he is now in a serious but stable condition. I know that his wife, Rosemary, and his children, Robbie, Elizabeth and Dan, are with him. I am sure that I speak on behalf of all who know him, and certainly those who know him around the parliament, in wishing him a speedy recovery. Our hearts go out to his family in this stressful time. My heart has been warmed by the number of people in the last 24 hours who, having heard about this unfortunate incident, have asked me to pass on their best wishes to Bob and his family and to wish him a speedy recovery. Those wishes have come from people who work in this place-people from the library, car drivers, attendants and colleagues.

451,Mr Snowdon,"He is happy that I have jumped the queue. I think he is trying to collectern Territory but, since leaving the parliament and going back to the Territory, he has fulfilled a number of very important roles. He is currently, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, employed by the South Australian government to do a lot of very good work in the Pitjantjatjara lands to the north of South Australia. I think the South Australian government, the Northern Territory government and all the other people who deal with him professionally would like to see him back at work. That is not going to happen for some time as he goes through this period of recovery. But we say to him: ‘Don’t hasten the recovery just to get back to work; take your time. Make sure your body heals. Get yourself into a frame of mind where you are ready to take up the challenge once again.’ Bob, we wish you a very quick recovery. We want to see you happy and healthy, as you always were, with your beaming face, your great sense of humour and your ability to bring us good will. (Time expired) McPherson Electorate: Gold Coast Rugby League Team will soon be replaced by applause and cheers for the Gold Coast Dolphins if the National Rugby League grants the 16th rugby league licence to the Gold Coast city. Make no mistake, I believe the NRL will grant our city the 16th licence in the not-too-distant future. I have been a director of the Gold Coast NRL bid team for 12 months now, and I was proud to attend the national press conference and the live-to-air taping of The Footy Show two weeks ago at the Gold Coast Arts Centre, where the name, the logo, the mascot and the colours of the Gold Coast team were announced and paraded before a sell-out Gold Coast crowd. The Gold Coast Dolphins, who will wear teal, white and gold, will be represented by Davo the Dolphin. This press conference and live-to-air The Footy Show united the Gold Coast in a way I have never seen before. We sold every ticket for the corporate event prior to The Footy Show and all tickets for The Footy Show within an hour of them going on sale. That is support and commitment from a city that is hungry for its own football team. Some 1,500 people attended The Footy Show with Fatty Vautin and the team, and they all went home clutching a lift-out from the Gold Coast Bulletin which had the name, colours and logo of the team on it. The Gold Coast has had a long association with rugby league, and the city just want to have a team playing in our colours for our city as soon as possible. In 1909 the first rugby league team outside Sydney was formed at Tweed Heads. While it was to be another 80 years before we were to get a national team-in the Gold Coast/Tweed Giants-rugby league was a sport that drew the Gold Coast together. From 1990 to 1998 the Gold Coast team, despite sound management, did not do too well on the field, leaving the NRL with little choice but to exclude a Gold Coast team from a revamped, smaller competition. It was a shame for those living on the coast, as well as those living in the Hunter and in Adelaide, but after years of strife it was the only way rugby league could get kick-started again. Now that uncertainty and the problems are over and it is time for the Gold Coast to again take its rightful place in the national competition. The Dolphins are able to demonstrate strong community support for their submission. They have strong business support, including potential major sponsors and significant support from the rugby league community nationally. In fact a recent poll showed that the vast majority of rugby league players surveyed supported a Gold Coast team. I think they all want to come and live on the Gold Coast! It is very clear that a Gold Coast team has more than enough support to thrive in the world of our National Rugby League competition. MAIN COMMITTEE",328,Cowra In One Months Time
452,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (11.24 A.m.),"On the Gold Coast, the cries of ‘Where’s my team?’Dolphins chairman Paul Broughton said, ‘We’ve proven that our team is ready, willing and able and we can get fans to the game.’ We even have a coach. John Cartwright, a former Kangaroo and State of Origin player who in recent years has been assistant coach of the Roosters and of the New South Wales State of Origin team, has accepted the role of coach of the Dolphins. This is one of the most important appointments the team can make-it is a real coup for the Dolphins. John has said that he is ready for the challenge of coaching an NRL team. It ensures that with John at the helm our team will hit the ground running if we get the green light to play in 2006. The press conference sparked interest from all corners of Australia as the Gold Coast Dolphins web site came online. The web site, www.goldcoastdolphins.com, was one of the most accessed web sites that week. Of course, no team could be launched without a theme songand what a theme song: I’m a Believer. And yes, we are believers. We believe in our city and we believe in our bid. The song will become synonymous with our Gold Coast Dolphins. The thousands of Gold Coasters who packed into Carrara Stadium during the trial matches are believers and the thousands who jumped online to the Dolphins web site are believers. Now all that remains is for the National Rugby League to allow the passionate supporters of a team that does not even exist yet to have an outlet for that passion and give the Gold Coast our own rugby league team. We have the means and we have the passion; now all we need is the team. I warn the member for Sydney and her Roosters, I warn the member for Newcastle and her Knights, and I warn the member for Cook and his Sharks that the Dolphins are coming and they are going to make a big splash on the field in 2006. It is time for the Gold Coast Dolphins to take to the field. Roads: Deer Park Bypass last Saturday week the shadow minister for transport and regional affairs, Martin Ferguson, came to the electorate of Burke and announced that, if elected, a Labor government would fully fund the Deer Park bypass. The Deer Park bypass, for those who do not know, is a very important transport link between Melbourne and Ballarat, and it will certainly improve the efficiency of travel for freight and for personal use. In effect, it will alleviate the enormous congestion that is currently experienced by residents in Caroline Springs, Burnside, Deer Park, Ardeer and parts of Sunshine. It will also alleviate congestion in parts of my electorate that have been suffering from the heavy congestion that has grown over recent years as a result of the fast growth of the area. That region is the fastest growing area of Melbourneindeed of Victoria. The Deer Park bypass, on anyone’s measure, is an urgent necessity, and I am very happy to say that Labor has committed to fully fund it and to commence it in the 2005-06 financial year, if elected-and, of course, that is the big proviso. Unfortunately, the current government has not given a commitment to fund the Deer Park bypass and has chosen to look after Geelong only, at the expense of Ballarat, Bacchus Marsh, Melton and those areas I have already referred to. That is a very big disappointment. So, whilst I can allay the concerns of my constituents by informing them that construction will commence next financial year if Labor is elected, unfortunately, if Labor is not elected, the only commitment that this current government has given with respect to that crucial transport link is that there will be up to $80 million provided-it would appear from the budget MAIN COMMITTEE",329,Cowra In One Months Time
453,Mr Brendan O’connor (Burke) (11.28 A.m.),"I rise to inform the parliament thatdocuments and from recent statements by the Minister for Transport and Regional Servicesno earlier than 2008-09, with no definite decision as to the remainder; that is, the further $250 million required for the construction. In my view, there is no point giving only $80 million without giving any definite time for the balance. Given that much of the $80 million would be spent on the Leakes Road intersection, I think it would leave no more than just over $40 million for what is a $294 million construction. So, effectively, we are nearly a quarter of a billion dollars short in terms of commitments from this government with respect to what I think is the most important transport link in Victoria-certainly for my electorate. I welcome the announcement by the shadow minister, Martin Ferguson, and the commitment by Labor’s leader, the executive and Labor generally. I pay tribute to those constituents who turned out at two public meetings I recently held. One was on 9 June at Sassella Hall in Deer Park, where over 100 people attended on a wet, wintry night. That was a testament to the concern they have that this road has not been built and their concern that, of the major political parties, only Labor has committed to the construction. At a subsequent meeting held last Thursday at the Multimedia Centre in Caroline Springs, about 100 people attended on a wet, cold night to voice their concerns, to make sure their voice was heard loudly by this government, and to say that there is a need to commit to fully fund the Deer Park bypass-as Labor has given a commitment to do-because it is so important. For those people in Caroline Springs, it is a burden every day just trying to get in and out of their area onto the Western Highway-dropping their kids off at school, going to work or going to visit friends or family. It is becoming an increasing burden because of the growth in the area. The fact is that only Labor is committed to this very important transport link. The Howard government has been left wanting. That is another reason that we have to see a change of government at the next election. (Time expired) Agriculture: Fire Blight Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (11.33 a.m.)-On Tuesday some 7,000 men, women and children marched in the streets of Shepparton. In the freezing weather they came together and moved slowly in a funeral procession following the hearses and the grim reapers to the local Shepparton oval. And there, after speeches, a match was put to a huge pile of fruit boxes and, as they burned, people renewed their commitment to fighting as hard as they can an unstoppable disease called fire blight. Those 7,000 people were there to show their support for the growers, cannery workers, drivers, packers, farm suppliers and the individuals and families who depend on the fruit and apple or pome industry for a good life in this great country. They were there to insist that only the best science is used and prevails, so that apples from any fire blighted country are banned or there are such strict and tough conditions put in place that there can never be any chance of the disease breaking through our quarantine barriers. And let us not kid ourselves: this disease, apple and pear fire blight, would wipe out our pear industry and cripple apples as they are grown in this country. Biosecurity Australia itself states that the loss of fruit, higher costs and lost income would see a 55 to 60 per cent permanent decline in apple and pear production in this country. Our dairy farmers know what it is like to lose 50 per cent of their income. We know that you canMAIN COMMITTEE not survive a 55 to 60 per cent drop in your production and associated income. No-one would be left standing. Their effort would be wiped out with such a loss. As well as the disease itself, apple and pear fire blight, there are another 21 quarantinable pests that can hitchhike a ride on fresh New Zealand apples-New Zealand is currently the country which is pushing forward to see their product exported to Australia. Our apple and pear fruit growers are the smartest and best in the country, particularly those in the Goulburn and Murray valleys. The cannery, SPC Ardmona, is an Aussie icon. It depends on pears and the production surrounding it. Our pome fruit industry has worked smart and hard and invested hundreds of millions of dollars over generations to build a clean, green image for the domestic and export markets. Many of our growers arrived as migrants with little more than a single suitcase. Today, they and their families are the backbone of the industry, along with those who came in the 1800s. We are proud of the Goulburn Valley and the Murray Valley and the sweat and tears that have gone into making this area the food bowl of Australia. Most of Australia’s pears grow in the Goulburn Valley. We have so much to lose if this disease gets into the country and gets loose in our orchards. Pears do not survive fire blight. Sure, some apple trees do, but you need to drench them in antibacterial sprays and continuously cut back the black, dead and dying branches. In the USA, the original home of fire blight, the disease adds 30 per cent to the chemical costs alone, not to mention the damage done to their clean, green credentials, to the environment and to human health. This disease could take hold in your garden or in the host woody weeds along the roads on its way to establishing itself in orchards, and you never get rid of it. No country has ever eradicated fire blight. It is the mad cow disease of fruit, but it does not hurt humans; it just kills trees and the communities that grow those trees. We have had a ban on imports of fresh apples from New Zealand for over 80 years. Sadly for them, they got the disease just after the First World War. The local New Zealanders who joined the march in Shepparton the other day-the New Zealanders who are now part of our fruit and dairy community in the region-joined with locals, stood shoulder to shoulder and said, ‘We know what it is like to live with fire blight; don’t let it happen here.’ The rules of international trade, of course, mean that Biosecurity has to process a New Zealand application for removing the apple import ban. New Zealand has asked that the ban be replaced with a set of apple treatments or a protocol that removes the risk of bacteria getting a free ride into our country. That is precisely what the people of Shepparton were asking and do ask of Biosecurity Australia; no more, no less. They ask that Biosecurity Australia correctly and accurately access and acknowledge the risk and then put the world’s toughest set of measures in place to fight the fruit industry’s toughest disease so we can end this debate forever. Our pome fruit industry must have security and protection from disease. It does not want trade protection; it does not ask for that. This is nothing to do with trade. Finally, let me pay tribute to Annie Donaldson, who could not be at the march although she had been one of the key planners. She was in hospital battling a very serious disease. Annie Donaldson’s fight reflects the spirit of the sorts of people who battle in the Goulburn Valley and I ask that, Annie, you battle on; our thoughts are with you. McMillan Electorate: Trafalgar will see and hear absolutely everything. To hear a representative of the apple and pear indusMAIN COMMITTEE",330,Cowra In One Months Time
454,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (11.38 A.m.),"If you are around long enough in political life, youtry and of her electorate stand up in this place as a part of this government and say, ‘I’m against what my government is doing,’ and somehow associate herself with the protesters who have been protesting against the government that she is a part of represents incredibly hypocrisy, incredible gall. What is the slogan of Sharman Stone going to be at the next federal election? ‘Vote for me. I’m a part of a government that wants to bring fire blight into Australia.’ That should be Sharman Stone’s election slogan at the next election: ‘Vote for me. I want to destroy the apple and pear industry in Australia.’ What an amazing cheek to stand up in this place and try and present herself as being different from the government that she is a junior minister in and which has set in train this process that is bringing from New Zealand into Australia these apples and pears that are disease ridden and that are going to break the hearts of the people and break the apple and pear industry in Australia. What an amazing thing to hear. What an incredible thing for her to have said in this place. But I want to speak about something positive today. I had not come in here to make that comment about Sharman Stone, the honourable member opposite; but I could not let that go without remarking on it. It is an incredible thing for her to have said-incredible hypocrisy. I want to talk about a gutsy little country town in my electorate called Trafalgar, where people are very self-reliant, hard working and get things done for themselves. A few years back Trafalgar had, like a lot of country towns, the closure of a number of the bank branches. The National Australia Bank pulled out and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia pulled out, and it really was a big blow to the town when that happened. But people in the town are hard working and they come together at times like this, and they have now successfully put in place a Community Bank branch of the Bendigo Bank. I want to congratulate the town on that great achievement, and I want to congratulate some of the key people who have been the driving force behind this great local initiative. Frank Hernadi, a local stock and station agent, has been one of the key prime movers in all of this. Councillor Bill Harrington, a councillor from the district, a fine representative and a good man, has been working hard on this project as well, as has a local small businessman who runs the local community supermarket, Geoff Hasthorpe. Well done to all the people involved in making the Community Bank branch of the Bendigo Bank in Trafalgar a reality. It is a great achievement. There have been many other people involved, and I do not have time today to mention all of them, but they know who they are. They have really been a part of a great local initiative and a great local success story. We really applaud their efforts and I congratulate them on bringing the town together behind such an important initiative. In relation to another matter, there has been a concerted community effort in the town of Mirboo North for some time to get a community based child-care centre in the township. There has been a lot of good work done by the steering committee over a considerable period of time, and they have been able to secure the use of the Uniting Church hall site in the town as a place for them to base their child-care centre. They have done a lot of good work, and they have had some support from the local South Gippsland Shire Council. In particular, they have been strongly supported by Councillor David Lewis, who is the councillor who covers Mirboo North. I want to congratulate them on their effort. They have approached the federal government for support for a capital grant to build the centre, and at this stage they have been told that the answer is no-that there is no money available from the federal government for this project. It is a good project and it is something which should be supported. They are askMAIN COMMITTEE ing for only a small amount of money for a capital grant. I think that where a community helps itself in the way that Mirboo North always does and where people come together in the way they have through the Mirboo North child-care project steering committee, the government should support it. I call on the Howard government today to not be mean and stingy in relation to this project but to back this important community initiative in Mirboo North. Schools: Funding school funding exercise this week, but I would like to add to my previous contributionsnotably on the MPI, which reveals my core position. Let me make it perfectly clear, as I have in the past: I am not an apologist for either the private or the public system, but I am a fierce advocate of choice and equity in education. This week, two representatives of the Queensland Teachers Union paid me a visit. While not doubting their personal sincerity, it is my firm conviction that the campaign being driven by the Australian Education Union and its state body, the QTU, is misleading, biased and divisive. It does not try to inject fairness or rational debate into the argument; rather it skews the campaign’s attention to the minority funding component, namely the Commonwealth’s. It does not refer to the states contribution to ensure funding for the schools that they are charged to resource. Using Queensland as an example, this is evidenced by funding over the past two years. In the first instance the Commonwealth’s contribution increased by 5.4 per cent but the state’s contribution increased by only 2.4 per cent. If the Queensland government had simply matched the Commonwealth’s contribution in percentage terms, Queensland state schools would have enjoyed another $116 million. In the second of the two years, after a record budget and a $2.3 billion surplus, the Queensland government’s contribution to state schools increased by only 3.9 per cent whereas the Commonwealth’s contribution rose by 4.8 per cent-another $25 million shortfall. In other words, over two years state schools had suffered a $141 million shortfall during a period which returned a record surplus budget. That is neglect. The money could have built new classrooms, renovated run-down state schools-which Labor members are always talking about-air conditioned oppressively hot classrooms and replaced demountable buildings. I am a fierce advocate of all the schools in my electorate. There have been more ministerial visits to my schools since I have been the member than under any previous representation. Education minister Brendan Nelson has even called Bundaberg’s Kepnock State High School one of the finest in Australia. In Gladstone in recent years the comparatively new Tannum Sands State High School received $8.82 million in public funds-more than triple the funds of the three private schools combined. My next target is the Gladstone State High School, which has done all the heavy lifting over the last 30 or so years to make sure its facilities are up with the best. Ultimately, of course, the Commonwealth’s recommendation goes to the state minister, and it will be her choice. My children have attended both education systems so I am familiar with the strengths and the weaknesses of both. We must recognise that taxation, whether it be income tax, GST or state taxes, all comes from the pockets of the average taxpayer in the end. The ultimate test of fairness is seeing where the money ends up after going through the state and federal systems. The 2.25 million students in state schools get $19.9 billion in funding, whereas $6.2 billion goes to 1.1 million children in private schools, which also receive $4.1 billion, or 40 per cent of their total reveMAIN COMMITTEE",332,Cowra In One Months Time
455,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.44 A.m.),"We have all thoroughly debated the private-publicnue, from the fees paid by parents. It is also true that the bulk of federal funding goes to the less wealthy Catholic, Anglican, Christian and Aboriginal community schools-not to the so called rich schools. The general principle is that private school students are paid on a socioeconomic basis according to residential census collection districts. It is not a matter of rich or poor schools; it is a matter of a family’s need based on the socioeconomic profile of its neighbourhood. I put it to the two QTU representatives that to validate their organisation’s argument they should surely argue that the state also support the private schools. I was met with adamant opposition. Ninety-one or 92 per cent of state funding goes to state schools and eight or nine per cent goes to private schools. The AEU has not yet come to the inescapable conclusion that any alteration to this system by the ALP would destroy equity and fairness. (Time expired) Centrelink Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.49 a.m.)-Last FridayI met with three employees of a local minute market on the Central Coast of New South Wales. The store employs six workers, and, out of those six employees, three had problems with Centrelink. I would like to bring these complaints to the attention of the chamber. BeforeI detail the complaints that these three women made to me about their dealings with Centrelink, I have to say that the employer, the owner of the store, arranged for me to visit them at his premises. He was so concerned about the treatment his employees were receiving from Centrelink that he said that they were being harassed by Centrelink. Firstly, I will deal with the case of a lady who works 24 hours a week. Her partner is on Newstart and he is very ill and unable to work. She received a Centrelink debt. Every month she receives correspondence from Centrelink, and sometimes she receives the same correspondence twice a month or every day and then she has to complete the information form. She feels that Centrelink are constantly checking on her, constantly disbelieving the information that she is forwarding to them. Once they have interviewed her, they will turn around and ask her partner exactly the same questions. When she submits the information about her work and her income, sometimes it takes her four hours to get through on the telephone to Centrelink. Her son has recently been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and she has had quite a considerable amount of difficulty being approved for the carer’s allowance. She has been told one thing and then been given different information, and by the time she submits the form it will be a considerable time since she first approached Centrelink. So she has had these ongoing problems. The next employee I would like to deal with is a university student who works eight hours a week. On a number of occasions she has had her Centrelink Youth Allowance payments stopped without warning. Her parents are very low income earners and she receives correspondence saying that her parents have earned too much money, only to receive more information the next day saying that she should be reinstated. The fact that she is only allowed to earn $240 a week she believes is a disincentive for her to work longer hours and she feels that there should be more of a sliding scale and that this should be tied to the CPI and increased from time to time. The other lady I would like to talk about is a supporting mother who works 16 hours a week at the same minute market and has recently received a debt of $6,000. Centrelink just stopped paying her. She gets $210 a week in wages. From the first payment that she received MAIN COMMITTEE from Centrelink after they discovered the debt, Centrelink took $200 out of her payment. My office will be negotiating with Centrelink because this lady is working 16 hours a week for $10. She believes she has always given the correct information to Centrelink and she feels that the fact that Centrelink make a cut in her payment and then notify her does not give her the opportunity to work out the problem or even to understand it. She still does not know where she incurred this debt. To me, these instances say that there is an ongoing problem with Centrelink. They say that the systems are not working. I know the staff are very dedicated and do their utmost to provide a service for people in receipt of Centrelink payments. I call on the government to revise the systems that are not working to ensure that ordinary, average people who rely on Centrelink are not disadvantaged. (Time expired) Agriculture: Industrial Hemp try that is in the cinderella stages of its development in Australia and that has a significant role to play in the future. Over the past 10 years, Ecofibre Industries has developed the necessary industrial hemp varieties for viable commercial cropping purposes. CSIRO research indicates that, by 2050, the world population is expected to double. A new, sustainable source of fibres must be able to be produced if we are to meet the future demand from the rise in population around the world. Australia has the capacity, through this new industry, to meet this growing demand. We have the varieties, the growers and the technology. However, what we need and do not have is the necessary processing infrastructure. That is why I rise in the parliament today. It is important that people understand that ultralow THC industrial hemp is not a drug. Industrial hemp is a fibre commodity capable of addressing the consumption requirements of the modern world. I am pleased to advise the House that bipartisan support led to the establishment of Queensland legislation on commercial cropping of industrial hemp in October 2002. Although some other states have the necessary legislation, it is anticipated that in the near future other states will have legislation establishing all of Australia as a potential growing area for this crop. Ecofibre’s crop over the past few years has been growing in the Darling Downs, south Burnett, Wide Bay and Mackay regions, amongst others across Australia. The raw hemp stalk is presently harvested and exported to France for processing and value adding. This product is then imported back into Australia-at considerable expense and loss of jobs, obviously-to meet our market demand in Australia. It is imperative for the future development of the industry in Australia that sufficient investment capital is secured to construct a fibre-processing mill in regional Queensland. Some of the products that can be produced from hemp are: superior paper pulp fibres, which reduce the need for deforestation; biodegradable plastics; automotive and aerospace components; animal bedding for the horseracing industry; absorbent materials used in oil spill and chemical containment; woven and non-woven textiles; building products and insulation; and, importantly, ethanol. Just about anything produced from crude oil can be manufactured using industrial hemp. MAIN COMMITTEE",334,Cowra In One Months Time
456,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (11.54 A.m.),"I rise to talk about a very important indusAustralia’s signing of the free trade agreement with the United States provides us with an opportunity for millions of dollars of export capacity and opportunity which will create numerous jobs in hemp growing and processing, particularly in regional and rural Australia. Presently, the United States of America imports its hemp from Europe and Canada, as there is legislation preventing the cropping of industrial hemp in the United States of America. Australia is poised to meet the demand of this new and emerging market. Currently, the challenge is to fulfil the capital requirements for the establishment of the first Australian industrial hemp fibre processing mill. My electorate of Maranoa presents such an opportunity, because it is a growing region for industrial hemp. In fact, across the Darling Downs and out through the western Darling Downs hemp could be grown. Growers already have been commercially growing hemp in small, 10-hectare crops near Dalby and in the heart of the Darling Downs. This year we are set to grow some 200 hectares-all of which will have to be exported, sadly, to France if we cannot get a mill to establish this processing and value adding here in Australia. With vision and commitment, Australia has the capacity to become the world’s leading supplier of sustainable, environmentally friendly techniques for fibre production. It will be a new agricultural industry, one that will create jobs in regional Australia. It is environmentally friendly. Hemp can, as I outlined a moment ago, replace many products that are made from crude oil. I recommend to the parliament, and to those who are working on this vital and new industry, that we get behind this and make sure we can get the capital to have a processing plant in Australia to see these jobs in Australia and not in France. (Time expired) Cunningham Electorate: Australian Greens members return to their electorates, it is timely to reflect upon the work of this place, upon the needs of the people of Cunningham, upon those who support the work of members of this place and upon the increasing importance of the Greens in the political landscape of this nation. A lot has been achieved since I was elected on 19 October 2002, and I look forward at the next election to being joined in this House by more Greens and also to the number of Greens senators increasing substantially. The Australian public continues to look to the Greens as the third major force in Australian politics, and the differentiation between us and the major parties continues to be striking. We only have to look at the Prime Minister’s so-called green energy statement last week to realise that the future well-being of this nation does not lie with the Liberal-National coalition. They are too tied to vested interests to develop a broad enough vision which puts at its head the well-being and prosperity of every Australian, not just a few. Likewise, we have seen the opposition under a new leader go into small target mode prior to an election and stand behind the government on major issues. How many backflips have we seen this week? Labor have backflipped on the FTA and there is the disgraceful sell-out of the PBS, increasing the copayment by $4.90 for every script in order to pay for tax cuts for the rich as part of one of their pre-election promises. The differentiation between the Greens and the major parties continues to be stark, and the voters of Australia know this. The Greens are a party of principle, and we have seen a decided abandonment of principle by the opposition in this place in recent months. The government are, however, true to form and the sooner we get rid of them the better. MAIN COMMITTEE",336,Cowra In One Months Time

As every member of this place knows, our staff play a vital role in ensuring that we remain focused on serving the needs of our constituents. I have been privileged to have some wonderful staff working with me over the past 19 months, and I would like to make reference to some of them. They include Ian Miles, my first campaign manager, and my original staff, Nadine Torney, Allison Gibbons and Lorraine Woods, who helped me through the first three hectic months amidst a sharp learning curve. My present and most recent staff include Allan Clark, Carol Berry, Kristian Bolwell, Theresa Huxtable, Sharon Callaghan, Stewart Jackson and Jason Hart, not to mention the many volunteers who have enthusiastically given of their time, such as Sue Sergent. Also of great assistance have been numerous people in the Greens who have provided their time, energy, enthusiasm, commitment and knowledge to help support the historic Cunningham election victory. I would most especially like to mention Senators Bob Brown and Kerry Nettle and former staffer Ben Oquist. The other big element in our lives as members of this place is our families. Their love, help and guidance, usually on a daily basis, are integral in ensuring that we are able to best serve the people of Australia. I want to thank my wife Jeanette, my sons Andrew and Kyle, my mother Roma, my sister Denise, my brother Terry and my many nieces and nephews, all of whom have played a role in support and in areas such as babysitting so that the time constraints inherent in the role of a federal member of parliament do not completely subsume the needs of the family. Countless friends and supporters also play an important role. It is sobering to remember that, as we discuss matters of national and international import in this place, it is to the local electorate-our local community-that we must answer. As I speak, my community, my friends, are going about their normal lives and also fighting to ensure that the quality of life they enjoy is passed down to their children and their children’s children, to ensure that we make the world a better place to live in. For example, the people of the northern Illawarra are once more fighting Wollongong City Council to ensure that the Sandon Point Aboriginal tent embassy and the Sandon Point community picket are not forcibly closed or removed by Wollongong City Council. The fight for Sandon Point-to protect, for example, its nationally significant Aboriginal burial sites and other culturally significant areas-has been going on since the late 1980s. The federal, state and local governments have continually worked against the local community and let them down, but the fight continues and many issues remain unresolved. A jackbooted approach by Wollongong City Council at this point in time will solve nothing. Council is supposed to represent the community, yet with regard to Sandon Point it has been an abject failure. It has merely represented the interests of the developers, who care nought for the cultural and environmental heritage values of the site or the quality of life of the local people. It is issues such as Sandon Point and, for example, the increase to the PBS announced just yesterday which impact harshly on the people of Cunningham and which it is my clear role to address. I am honoured by this opportunity to be the federal member for Cunningham, and I look forward to continuing in that role and working hard with my staff, supporters and the people of Cunningham in the months and years ahead. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Eden-Monaro Electorate: Roads portant pieces of infrastructure is our road system. No matter where you live, roads are certainly a major piece of infrastructure. That is particularly so in an electorate like Eden Monaro, which I represent, because some other forms of transport are not as good as they used to be. For instance, the only train service that we have had into my electorate comes into Queanbeyan and then goes on to Canberra. We do not have a rail service anywhere else in the electorate; the rail service down the coast stops before it gets to Eden-Monaro. Even the train service that comes into Queanbeyan has been cut right back and is nothing like it used to be even nine months ago. The importance of roads is certainly understood by this government, and that is why recently we had the announcement of the AusLink project, which looked at our transport infrastructure across the nation. One part of that transport infrastructure is roads. We have had lots of debate about who is responsible for what. One of the most irritating aspects of being a federal member is the constant debate about who should build what. When I was elected in 1996, I thought that everything was pretty straightforward because of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states early in the 1990s with respect to road funding, which effectively from my point of view said, ‘The federal government looks after certain roads which will be part of a national system, the state government will look after certain roads which are state highways and then local government will look after their local roads.’ The Federal Highway coming into Canberra was the only federal road in my area. The other highways are state highways, and the states are adequately funded through a variety of ways. But that seems to change, particularly when elections come around and people try to get certain things done and start making all sorts of claims. You cannot get away from the fact that in the coastal part of my electorate the Princes Highway, which is a state highway and has been accepted as a state highway by successive state governments of differing political persuasions, has been neglected, particularly in the far part. The state government has been bragging for some time that it is putting $300-odd million into the Princes Highway over 10 years, but when you look at it closely you see that some of that money is federal money and that most of it is being spent around the Wollongong area. In fact over the next 10 years south of Kiama the state government will spend only about $5 million a year on the Princes Highway. That has been a frustrating debate. Interestingly, in regard to AusLink we announced that $20 million out of the Black Spots Roads Program, which is a great program that we have been able to access across Australia, will be applied specifically to the Princes Highway. That means that we will be putting twice as much into the Princes Highway south of Kiama as the New South Wales government is, and it is responsible for the damn thing. Pambula Bridge will get $5 million of that amount. This has been debated for some time. In February this year, because the New South Wales government will not live up to its responsibility, I suggested that the additional $5 million could come out of the regionally strategic aspect of the extended Roads to Recovery program. Taking the money out of the Black Spots Roads Program, as it was announced and as it is budgeted for, is obviously a better solution. In the meantime the Labor Party ran around saying, ‘Yes, we will fund it,’ but nobody has been able to indicate out of what fund that money will come and how it will be paid for. The additional $5 million to ensure that Pambula Bridge is replaced is in the Black Spots Roads MAIN COMMITTEE",337,Cowra In One Months Time
458,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (12.04 p.m.)-Across Australia probably one of the most imProgram part of the budget-it is there and it is ready. The New South Wales government should spend its money and get on with it as fast as possible. It has been putting it off for a couple of years because it did not have the money. It clearly did not have the money, because we have seen it increasing taxes all over the place. But now that it knows that our money is there it will be interesting to see its money and get this thing fixed once and for all. (Time expired) Australian Labor Party: Retiring Members happen to be in the chair, because I want to take a little time to say thank you to the Labor members of parliament who will not be continuing as federal representatives after the coming election. I want to express my appreciation for those people who served here in this federal parliament, including you as the member for Greenway for the past eight years-along with me: I just finished eight years service on 15 June. I thank Janice Crosio, the member for Prospect, who came into this House in 1990 after initially serving a mayoralty in her home city and then going into state parliament, where she became a minister. Here Janice has served on a broad number of committees and is now the Chief Opposition Whip. We also have Leo McLeay, who yesterday celebrated 25 years in the federal parliament, and Laurie Brereton, the member for Kingsford Smith, who was a state member several times over and a state minister who was willing to take really tough decisions-the most difficult of which was the ‘beds to the west’ decision to move hospital facilities to the western part of Sydney. This provided services to where the majority of the population of Sydney was living and would in the future live-people in areas such as Greenway, which is the area the Deputy Speaker represents, as well as other areas. The commonality of all of those members is the fact that they are Labor members, but there also a commonality in their length of service to the Labor movement both inside and outside the House. The member for Greenway has given distinguished and long service to the trade union movement in New South Wales. The member for Watson-previously the member for Grayndler-Leo McLeay, has had a distinguished service within ALP head office. Two of these people had a particular significance for me eight years ago when I came into this place. Two people usher you forward when you present yourself to the Speaker, and Leo McLeay and Janice Crosio were my federal sponsors into this House. They mirror two different traditions within the New South Wales branch: one came through from local council and state government and then to the federal level; the other came in through service directly to the party in its organisational wing as well as in local council, and then into the federal parliament. It has been a great privilege for me during the past eight years. I was a bit of a latecomer, arriving three months after everyone else in 1996. They put me in the departure lounge, so I was sitting just behind Clyde Holding and Barry Jones and right next to me was Bobby Brown, the then member for Charlton. After some time-about 18 months or so-Leo, who was then whip, came to me and said, ‘Would you like to move closer to the action?’ I said I was actually quite comfortable for this parliament to be in the departure lounge, because you can learn an enormous amount, as I had been doing already, from those people who had served so long in the parliament. It was a rare opportunity, day by day in question time, to be MAIN COMMITTEE",339,Cowra In One Months Time
459,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (12.09 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, it is lucky that youable to talk to them and to draw on their experience, and I hoped to use that knowledge to some effect in the years ahead. Longevity in this game is something that does not come to everyone. Many people come through and do not serve very long in the parliament. The distinguished service that Laurie Brereton has given at state level and as the member for Kingsford-Smith, that Janice Crosio has given in the state and federal parliaments and that Leo McLeay has given in serving here for 25 years, reaching what is effectively ministerial level as Speaker during the HawkeKeating government and then serving as Chief Opposition Whip, is pretty hard to do year in year out. But what it has meant for the electorates of all those people is that there has been a continuity of service and a continuity of commitment. And it means that the fundamental connections between the electors and the elected remain very strong. I want to compliment all of those people who have given so much of their lives to the labour movement inside and outside this House and wish them the very best in their retirement. I hope that their spell in the paddock is long. (Time expired) New South Wales: State Budget House last night, and that is the New South Wales state budget of $37.4 billion, which has largely ignored road works in my electorate. Mr Deputy Speaker, you could ask why I as a federal member am raising the subject of New South Wales funded roads in this House. I raise it because this year we have given just under $16 billion of federal money to the New South Wales government, and the people in my electorate of Paterson demand that their money-the tax that they pay both to the New South Wales government and to the federal government-be spent back in their area. For the Dungog road system, Dungog Council received $400,000 for a little bit of road work north of the town of Paterson, although the mayor, Steve Lowe, has raised regularly the fact that there is a requirement for some $15 million worth of investment in roads to bring them up to scratch. The state government took all of the regional roads there and assigned them across to the Dungog Council without adequate funding. So now we have roads which are dangerous and a disincentive to tourists to travel into that region-and it is tourists that bring in the money that helps these towns grow and develop. I was surprised there was no funding for another road, Bucketts Way, because my opponent, the Labor candidate for Paterson, has talked about the need for road funding on Bucketts Way. We contributed $20 million to Bucketts Way over four years. I would have thought that any Labor candidate worth their salt would have got on the phone to Carl Scully or their mate Bob Carr and said, ‘Listen, we’ve got to put some money into this.’ Why should the New South Wales government put money into it? Because it is their responsibility. They should have at least matched the $20 million. How much did we see? Did we see $15 million? No. Did we see $10 million? No. Did we see $5 million? No. Did we see a single dollar? No, not a cent. It shows that my Labor opponent is just hot air and rhetoric, with no substance and no ability to bring any dollars to the table. It does not end there. In the Great Lakes region, you have the Lakes Way, a road which is of significance in accessing the townships of Forster and Tuncurry and going to places like Seal Rocks, Blueys Beach and the like. How much money was in the budget for that road? None-not a single cent. So we see the state Labor government walking away from its reMAIN COMMITTEE",340,Cowra In One Months Time
460,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (12.15 P.m.),"I want to raise an issue which I also raised in thesponsibilities, not providing any money. But I am glad to see that the state Labor government invested money to make Tuncurry ambulance station open 24 hours a day. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may ask why I would like that. It is because, with the number of accidents that occur on this road, we need ambulances 24 hours a day to pick people up, not to drive them to a hospital in Forster or Tuncurry-no, we do not have a public hospital there; we have a private one-but to take them all the way to Taree. That begs the second question: given that my opponent has been talking about the need for improved health services in the Forster-Tuncurry area, why was there no money to start the construction of a hospital in the Foster-Tuncurry region? The reality is Labor is full of rhetoric and very little substance. The people in my electorate pay their fair share of taxes. And why do I as a federal member raise these state issues? Because people pay the GST collected by the federal government-$9 billion redirected back through to the state government-and people demand accountability on a local level and that their money is spent back with them. I go back to the roads again, and I can understand why Labor do not believe in funding roads. In particular, there is a member of this House who opposes the $20 million that we invested in Bucketts Way, and that is none other than the member for Hunter. The member for Hunter said in this House on 27 May: These RONIs, as they are called-Roads of National Importance-are just a political stunt: a means of redirecting money into projects where the government gets the best bang for its buck. It is not the government who gets the best bang for its buck; it is the residents and businesses that those roads service. What we need to see is more investment in these roads, but from the level of government directly responsible for it, and that is state government. The state government is very citycentric, and I see the member for Blaxland laughing. He would be laughing, because all the money goes to building tunnels and increasing the roads in Sydney, but very little of it gets spent in regional and rural areas-and that is where the money needs to be spent because that is where the safety program needs to be improved. Reid Electorate: Community Organisations my appreciation of the effort of a coalition of groups, including Anglicare Australia, the Australian Catholic Social Justice Council, St Vincent de Paul Society and Uniting Care Australia, in launching the Say No to Poverty campaign. The situation they outlined this morning is that there are 3.6 million Australians living in households with incomes under $400 a week and there are 800,000 children living in jobless households. In my electorate, for instance, 90 per cent of people do not receive any benefit from the recent budget tax cuts at the top. This coalition of concerned organisations simply wants to put this issue on the public register and to make sure that the political parties in this country understand that, despite an unemployment level of 5.5 per cent, which many would say is far lower than previous years, and despite the booming economy, the reality is that prosperity has not spread to the underclass in this country. There are growing disparities of income, and this coalition basically seeks strong public recognition of these realities. I mention the lack of employment opportunities in the black spot suburbs of south-western Sydney, Western Sydney and parts of Melbourne et cetera. In this context I want to put on the record my appreciation for a number of local organisations that make massive efforts on these fronts. The first of these is the Granville Multicultural Centre, which grew originally out of the Catholic Church in South Granville. Mark Drury, the MAIN COMMITTEE",341,Cowra In One Months Time
461,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (12.20 P.m.),"I wish to put on the record this morningmanager there, runs an organisation which has 20 employees. It runs family support programs for those families in crisis situations, before and after school care, a youth program with a counsellor and child care. It is funded by the community services department, and the fair trading department and education department of the New South Wales government-a government that, according to the previous speaker, has the wrong priorities. I say they are the right priorities. It also receives a grant for family assistance towards child care. That is an organisation that is on the ground doing vital work in my electorate. Recently it held the multicultural festival, with attendance improving each year. Similarly we have the Auburn Migrant Resource Centre, which last year handled 25,000 clients in an area which has one of Australia’s main concentrations of new arrivals. RecentlyI saw a question on notice by another member, and what the answer to that question proved was that one-fifth of all temporary protection visa entrants to this country live in my electoratenot one-fifth of Western Sydney, not one-fifth of Sydney, not one-fifth of New South Wales but one-fifth of TPV entrants to this country reside in the electorate of Reid. So the Auburn Migrant Resource Centre is a crucial local amenity. It has been funded consistently by the department and is respected by the public servants in that department. Its funding has been very well merited. The centre essentially looks after small and emerging communities. Amongst those that have had presentations of cultural activities over the last year have been the Kurdish, Ethiopian and Eritrean communities. It is currently conducting a community garden program. It has the Hey Dad Parenting Program, a multicultural women’s group which meets once a week, and a home help program. With the government’s increased emphasis on the Horn of Africa and Africa in general with regard to the refugee intake over the next few years-these are countries where there has been great displacement of people and where people have no formal education-those services are going to be even more important. There is casework and case management assistance and there is a refugee youth project. The centre has also provided assistance to many people on issues such as housing. There is migration assistance, and employment and income support measures and identified settlement issues for young people are a major emphasis of this organisation. There are also a school holiday recreation program, a Sanctuary youth drama project, art classes for refugee youth and the establishment of a web site for youth. Ministers of the current government have been to the centre on a number of occasions and have joined with me in appreciating the vital work it has done in one of Sydney’s new arrival communities. I finally turn to the Turkish Welfare Association, which over the last few years has managed to build a Turkish house in North Parade, Auburn. Its social worker, Riza, has been part of the organisation’s stretching out to help not only Turks but also Azerbaijanis and other communities from Central Asia who are also of Turkish extraction. That organisation also houses the Turkish Federation of New South Wales. Dursun Candemir was recently re-elected. He is a person who previously had a background in publishing with the Dunya Turkish newspaper. It is another organisation that provides vital assistance in regards to migration matters and general welfare issues. Eden-Monaro Electorate: Roads spect to roads and after hearing the contribution from the member for Paterson, I also note MAIN COMMITTEE",342,Cowra In One Months Time
462,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (12.25 p.m.)-In continuing my earlier contribution with rethat the New South Wales budget provided nothing additional for the Princes Highway either-the road that the state government are responsible for. Down that part of the Princes Highway that I represent we will see this pathetic amount of a bit over $5 million a year going into it, which is very disappointing. One aspect I only mentioned briefly was the extended Roads to Recovery program, which has certainly been very well received by local councils. It is getting a lot of those back roads graded and built. It is a tremendous program because the money is going directly to local government; some of it is not getting skimmed off along the way. Local governments certainly appreciated the extension of it. One part of that program was a regionally strategic component, as we call it, of the Roads to Recovery program. That is opening up a whole lot of new possibilities for getting some roads built that probably would not have happened for a long time under current funding arrangements. In particular, there are a number of these in my electorate and I will be out there supporting our communities on these things over the coming months to see whether we can get some roads built that previously probably did not have a great chance. One of them is called Spine Road and it is a bypass route around Batemans Bay. Batemans Bay is becoming a very popular area and there is a real traffic problem there. The council has been working on this Spine Road-it has this name because it runs along the spine behind Batemans Bay-so that traffic can bypass the main part of Batemans Bay and the residential areas and get to the other end of the bay much more quickly. It is a big job and the Eurobodalla Shire Council have been putting money into it each year. When I had the Prime Minister down there a few weeks ago, I took him around to have a look at the road. I was very pleased to see that this road was actually referred to in the AusLink program as the type of road that could be funded under the regionally strategic component. It is the responsibility of local government, but it would be great to get that additional assistance under the Roads to Recovery program. So that looks very hopeful and I will certainly be working with the Eurobodalla Shire Council on that particular project to assist them to get that completed a lot earlier and solve a lot of problems down there. It would be great to get some money out of the state government as well because it is going to have to connect onto the Princes Highway and they could be doing more to assist with that. There are probably many roads that would fall into this category, but there a couple of key ones. Edwin Land Parkway is a road round the back from Jerrabomberra through to Queanbeyan. With Jerrabomberra growing larger and larger-and I know it well, because I live there-it is creating a bottleneck out on Lanyon Drive. The Lanyon Drive part has been upgraded by the New South Wales government and the Queanbeyan council, but for the section within the ACT down to the Monaro Highway the ACT government ought to direct some of their Roads to Recovery money to upgrading that in the next few years. If Edwin Land Parkway was completed, it would take some people out of Jerrabomberra into Queanbeyan by a different route. That is another project that I think could be a great project under the regionally strategic component of Roads to Recovery and I will be supporting the Queanbeyan council on that one. Another one to grow our tourism industry in the mountains is the connection from Ando across to Dalgety-which is basically Bombala across to Jindabyne, you could say, but the road itself goes from Ando to Dalgety. That would create a great transport route from the MAIN COMMITTEE coast across to the mountains. If we can tie that up we can get people moving much more easily, from a tourism point of view. Of any electorate in New South Wales, Eden-Monaro has the highest proportion of its work force in the tourism industry, and it is the fourth highest in Australia-9.3 per cent of our work force is actually employed in the tourism industry, which is quite amazing. We have a great opportunity to grow that even further, and a road like the Ando-Dalgety road would be a great road. I will support the Bombala Council on that one in relation to the regionally strategic component of the Roads to Recovery program. These are just some examples of things that can be assisted under this very innovative program, getting funds out there on the ground where they are needed, and they are the things that I will be working on over the coming months. Melbourne Ports Electorate: Central Synagogue South Africa, Rabbi Cyril Harris, who is going on a nationwide tour of Australia and is here for a very important event in my electorate, reflecting the commitment of the Labor Party and the Labor government in Victoria to immigration and the strong commitment that this side of politics has to immigration and its positive values. Rabbi Harris is a very distinguished person. For his political stance in opposing apartheid he has been internationally recognised, particularly for his involvement with the disadvantaged black community in South Africa. Rabbi Harris is Scottish born and served at three large synagogues in London, for almost 30 years, before arriving in South Africa at a very important time, in 1988. From the beginning, Rabbi Harris established a strong relationship with Nelson Mandela that continued beyond Nelson Mandela’s presidency. Rabbi Harris supported the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, chaired by Archbishop Tutu. President Nelson Mandela, speaking on the 10th anniversary of Rabbi Harris’s appointment, in 1997, said: The Chief Rabbi’s dedication to building bridges between faiths, including his exceptional contribution in the field of religious broadcasting, has added impetus to forging a new South African identity. And isn’t that a tribute. In my electorate, Rabbi Harris will be the guest of honour, along with the Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Brumby, at the opening of the new central synagogue in South Caulfield. Over the last few years there has been a significant migration of people from South Africa to the suburbs on the edge of my electorate-South Caulfield, Glen Huntly-and to Ormond and Bentley, which are outside my electorate. In 1998 Rabbi Yitzchak Reisenberg, together with other prominent members of the South African community, established the central synagogue, which aims to establish a congregation of people from South Africa. I have attended there many times, and particularly on Friday nights, when one has the most unusual and pleasurable experience of seeing a service that is extremely well attended and an almost entire congregation that sings-a phenomenon that most Australians would find very unusual. It is a very culturally South African thing that people go on a Friday night after work-even people who, like me, are perhaps not as observant as they might be. In just a few years people like Ian Harris, the secretary of the central synagogue, and Rabbi Reisenberg have built a great congregation and community. They have purchased the new facility in Maple Street. This Sunday it will be opened by Rabbi Harris, the Chief Rabbi of South Africa, with John Brumby, the Treasurer of Victoria. Rabbi Harris and his wife are prominent human rights proponents in South Africa. In Australia Rabbi Harris will be giving the ADC Gandel oration for the antidefamation commission of B’nai Brith-and will be talkMAIN COMMITTEE",343,Cowra In One Months Time
463,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.30 P.m.),"I welcome to Australia the Chief Rabbi ofing to audiences across this country about the Jewish community in South Africa and human rights concerns there and worldwide. Aside from congregational facilities, Central synagogue and community centre provides, as Rabbi Yitzchak Reisenberg says, ‘support services for social integration, networking, employment and business opportunities, educational services and the opportunity to practise Jewish cultural heritage’. Arising from the presence of former South Africans is the issue of immigration and the problems associated with it. Many are successful Australian citizens who want to have their relatives join them for short family celebrations and people who want to bring elderly relatives to Australia who are totally supported by them but have continuing difficulties with Australian immigration. We need a more visionary view of immigration, a view that sees the positive contribution that people like those associated with the Central synagogue are making to Australia. I cannot think of people who are more enterprising and hard working and of value to the Australian community than the people who comprise this new group in my electorate. I applaud the opening of central synagogue and the welcoming to Australia of Chief Rabbi Harris on that occasion. Trade: Free Trade Agreement p.m.)-I rise today to reflect on a matter of great moment and significance not only for this week in parliament but also for our nation’s history: the very last stages in the execution of what will be the largest free trade agreement ever entered into by Australia as a sovereign nation. I want to remind the chamber that there have only ever been two other free trade agreements concluded between developed economies. Most free trade agreements have been between a developed economy and a developing economy. Australia’s free trade agreement with New Zealand was the first free trade agreement between two developed economies. It is still the most liberal free trade agreement ever negotiated. The second was the free trade agreement between the United States and Canada. Those two free trade agreements have shown that the benefits tend to flow to the smaller party to the transaction. There are benefits on both sides, it is a voluntary agreement entered into for the benefit of both parties, but the preponderance of benefit goes to the smaller party getting access to the larger market. I want us to reflect for a moment on the relative sizes of these two markets. Australia has an economy of about $A700 billion and the United States has an economy of $US11.7 trillion. After doing the currency conversions, according to the Economist magazine, the US economy is 22 times that of the Australian economy. This is the opportunity which we are being given through this free trade agreement. In the area of professional services, in which I have a special interest as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, this will be the single most liberal professional services agreement ever entered into by the United States. No other nation in the world will have the degree of access that Australian lawyers and financial services providers will have to the American market. In fact the Americans have committed to work with us in the various state jurisdictions and with professional organisations to try to accelerate access to and penetrate further into the various layers of the American economy. Here we have Australia with 2.2 per cent of the Morgan Stanley capital index of global GDP and the United States with about 25 per cent of the capital index. This is a vast opportunity for Australia. So what is the attitude of the Australian Labor Party? What we find is a MAIN COMMITTEE",345,Cowra In One Months Time
464,Mr Ross Cameron (Parramatta,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (12.35party which is riven with divisions, which is completely perplexed and which is like a marsupial in front of the headlights not knowing on which side of the road to get off. This gift-horse for our nation, according to the conservative Treasury estimates, in 10 years will be worth $6 billion a year in annual GDP and will create 30,000 jobs for our children and their children. I see the member for Greenway in the chamber. Western Sydney generates 10 per cent of Australia’s GDP. To apportion that for the member for Chifley, who is in the chair, it will mean 3,000 jobs for our constituents in Western Sydney if we can execute this agreement, and Labor does not know whether to pass the agreement. Labor has baulked at this magnificent opportunity for Australia and it has reserved its right to oppose it in the Senate. To me, this is not just about the free trade agreement; it is also about the capacity to govern a nation. The leadership of a country like Australia is about the capacity to recognise and seize opportunities for 20 million Australians. Often, opportunity knocks but once. It comes in a time and tide and, if we do not seize that moment, it will pass us by. If anything disqualifies the Australian Labor Party from a credential to govern this nation it is their vacillation over this agreement. I urge all members of this parliament to get behind the FTA and sign it into law. (Time expired) Greenway Electorate: Education ate of Greenway and about education in general. I think it is generally recognised that Greenway is the educational capital of Western Sydney, due to its vast educational facilities. I do not expect you to totally agree with that view, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, but we do have many excellent schools in my electorate across the whole range of services, such as the public system, the Catholic system and other Christian schools such as Church of England schools. I would like to see more cooperation between all sectors of education so that we can produce a good educational outcome-the best educational outcome-for the students of Greenway. We do have that in a number of areas, particularly in the educational precinct of Narimba, where we have Terra Sancta College and Wyndham College working hand in hand and sharing facilities. We also have the University of Western Sydney. A university is a jewel in the crown of any electorate in relation to education. I know that not all government members necessarily agree with that, but the member for Chifley and I certainly agree that the University of Western Sydney is a great asset to the area, not only for the students going to that university but also because of the products that come from universities, such as economic development and research that benefit industry in the area. I am very pleased to have that university in my electorate and I support the necessary funding to enable the university to operate effectively. We also have a TAFE college in the Narimba complex, so we have all facets of education there, and that is a great advantage. The other thing is to see the outcome, the students that come from these educational facilities. I am very proud from time to time to welcome to this parliament many students from my electorate. It is always said that students from Western Sydney are among the best behaved students who come to this parliament. Also, their comments are quite enlightening. They ask many interesting questions. One that is asked from time to time is: do you have to be intelligent to be a member of parliament? I tell them no. They certainly take a great interest. MAIN COMMITTEE",346,Cowra In One Months Time
465,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (12.40 P.m.),"I want to speak about schools in my electorTo the naked eye, it would appear that some schools have better resources than others. That cannot be denied. This unfortunately creates a feeling of inferiority and resentment amongst those that feel disadvantaged. SoI would like to draw to the attention of the parliament some of the concerns that have been expressed to me this week by teachers from schools in my electorate who have visited me. They have drawn to my attention the need for additional facilities, which I fully support. I have a whole list of concerns, but I will mention the schools initially before I go to the items that they are concerned about. The schools whose representatives have visited me are the William Rose School, the Metella Road Public School, Lynwood Park Public School, Blacktown West Public School, Quakers Hill Public School, Hamilton Public School and Lalor Park Public School. These are the schools in my electorate where the teachers feel additional resources are needed. The William Rose school is a special needs school. It has put to me that it needs a wheelchair bus; a sensory garden; a wheelchair swing; wheelchairs; speech therapy; an increase in physio and occupational therapy; computer upgrades-both software and hardware; a school hall; library books in Braille; large print and audio books; additional teachers’ aids and a hydrotherapy pool. Metella Road Public School has also put to me that it needs specialised teachers for struggling students who need one-on-one assistance; more teachers to reduce class sizes; and logistic support for teachers, particularly in maths and science. The school community has funded air conditioning in some classrooms but more is needed. It says it needs counsellors and support staff. Lynwood Park Public School has raised with me the need for carpets in at least five classrooms and the library. Lynwood Park needs air conditioning. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, air conditioning is very important in the summer months in our part of Western Sydney. The school also needs computer furniture in the computer room; covered walkways; returfing of the sports field and it needs a retaining wall. It needs security fencing; new blinds in the hall and some classrooms; an electricity upgrade; and more teachers’ aids. There is white ant damage to some buildings at Lynwood Park school that needs attention. I should draw to the attention of the Main Committee that many of the schools are older schools and this sort of problem does exist in them. Lynwood Park also needs hot water in the staff toilets; an upgrade of student toilets; more resources for teachers such as reading books; and smaller class sizes. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence in allowing me to expand on the needs of the public schools in my electorate. member for Greenway thoroughly deserves. BeforeI put the question, I would like to draw to the attention of members that during the adjournment debate matters were raised that were directly being debated in the House. House of Representatives Practice is unclear on that matter. I propose to take that matter up with the Deputy Speaker and seek clarification. Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict gence to speak briefly on the Gaza withdrawal plan. I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, has recently commended the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr Ariel Sharon, on the proposal to withdraw from Gaza. Supporting unilateral disengagement is a very hard decision that those of us in the international community who are concerned about stability and peace in the Middle East need MAIN COMMITTEE",347,Cowra In One Months Time

467,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.47 P.m.),"by leave-I thank the House for the indulto examine in as realistic terms as possible. I think we will all come to the same conclusion that the Secretary-General of the United Nations has reached-that is, while it may be impossible for direct negotiations between the parties to take place at the moment because of the chances forsaken by the President of the Palestinian Authority, the disengagement of the two peoples is an achievement in itself. I note again, against two nostrums of conventional wisdom, that the building of the separation fence has led to a total collapse of suicide bombings in the civilian areas in Israel that were affected. Obviously, for a civilian population faced with daily attacks on people in restaurants, supermarkets et cetera, you would have to understand how, as I recently saw on the BBC, the overwhelming majority of people in the streets in Israel proper regard this halting of suicide attempts as a very positive development. The other conventional wisdom relates to the role of Hamas in Gaza. In Gaza there is an existential war between Hamas and the state of Israel. Hamas is determined that the only border the Israelis should have is the Mediterranean Sea. Faced with an existential war, any country has the right to defend itself against the military practitioners of terrorism against its civilian population. Again, against conventional wisdom, it seems that the killing of the terrorist chieftains Rantissi, Sheik Yassin et cetera seems to have been absolutely effective, again leading to the virtual collapse of homicidal bombing. I hope that, in the future, direct negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis will recommence. I note the recent comments by King Abdullah of Jordan that Mr Arafat should resign and give up his post. I notice also the comments by President Mubarak of Egypt that all the security services of the Palestinians should be established under one authority. I note the comments of the European Community that payments to elements of the Palestinian Authority should be made, especially European money, to authorised people and not to people for the purpose of buying suicide belts and going across and destroying any possibility of reconciliation between those two peoples. The disengagement from Gaza, whatever one thinks of Mr Sharon or his past policies, is something that people around the world who have the courage to face the rational choices will need to face and should support. Disengagement of people in that area is the only way we can move forward at the moment until a new, more accommodating and far-sighted Palestinian leadership can come forward. Such Palestinian leaders are just below the level of Mr Arafat and will wish to negotiate a permanent peaceful solution. Australians of all political persuasions support such a solution. We supported, in 1948, a Palestinian Arab state alongside an Israeli Jewish state. That is a solution that everyone in the world knows is eventually going to take place. That is a solution to which I think the disengagement from Gaza is a precursor. People on this side of politics and, I am sure, people on the government side will support the disengagement from Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza being supported by the Secretary General of the United Nations; the European Community; the quartet-the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Israel-(Time expired) Question agreed to.

Education: Trades (Question No. 3442) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on 1 April 2004: (1) Is he aware than many Australian Industries are now facing serious skill shortages, especially in the traditional trades; if not, why not. (2) Is he aware that (a) Commonwealth Australian National Training Authority funding between 1997 and 2001 decreased by 16.3 per cent per curriculum hour while TAFE enrolments grew by 16.3 per cent and (b) approximately 50,000 people will miss out on TAFE places this year: if not, why not. (3) Can he explain how the Government’s policies for vocational education and training will address the serious skills shortages in trades? (1) The Australian Government is very aware that a number of industries, particularly the traditional trades, are experiencing critical skill shortages. Skills shortages are caused by a variety of factors including a strong economy, high levels of employment, high levels of infrastructure investment and the emergence of new industries as well as lack of interest in trades among school leavers and the ageing of the workforce. The Australian Government has recognised that any approach to addressing skills shortages, needs to confront the issues on a variety of fronts. On Tuesday6 April 2004 I launched the Australian",350,Questions On Notice
469,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Government’s National Skills Shortages Strategy (NSSS) – a new, comprehensive approach to tackling skills shortages, particularly in the traditional trades. The NSSS will build on the work we have undertaken in partnership with eleven industries through the National Industry Skills Initiative, as well as complementing other relevant programmes addressing skills needs, including the special incentive for traditional trades, support for changing attitudes to traditional trades and support for group training. Attached are fact sheets detailing the Strategy’s nine tiered approach to addressing skill shortages. Skill shortages also featured highly in the proposed ANTA Agreement for 2004-06, with targets being set to improve the number of New Apprenticeships in skill shortage areas. States and Territories unfortunately rejected the Australian Government’s offer for the proposed Agreement. (2) (a) There was a 22.3 per cent increase in hours delivered by both TAFE and private providers under the ANTA Agreement between 1997 and 2001 and an approximate 16 per cent increase in the total number of TAFE and private provider students undertaking training during the same time period. Improved efficiency in the use of funds allowed the national VET system to grow in numbers of people in training and hours delivered, at the same time that the public cost per hour of training was reduced. States and Territories were aware of the need to improve efficiencies in the system and signed up to the efficiency provisions in the ANTA Agreement with the Australian Government during this time. Consequently, the comparison of funding per curriculum hour is not an appropriate indicator to measure the costs of training, as it does not take into account productivity/efficiency gains realised throughout the sector. The efficiency gains were made while maintaining the quality of training. The high quality of the training provided throughout the VET sector is reflected in the employers’ survey which rated employers’ satisfaction at 80 per cent in 2001. Graduates’ satisfaction also remains high, with satisfaction levels recorded at 82 per cent in 2002. The Australian Government is committed to VET and has significantly increased its funding to the sector. Australian Government funding provided to the States and Territories grew from $888.0 million in 1997 to $1.056 billion in 2001, an increase of around 19 per cent. I would also like to point out that since 1996 funding for VET has increased in real terms by 33 per cent and funding for New Apprenticeships and industry training has increased by 83 per cent. (b) There has been a steady decline in the level of ‘unmet demand’ for VET over recent years. In 1995, an estimated 60,700 individuals were unable to enrol for a TAFE qualification. This had dropped to 45,800 in 1999 and to 42,800 in 2003. Figures for ‘unmet demand’ in 2004 are not yet available, however, the Australian Government will directly purchase 7,500 additional VET places for priority clients including people with disabilities, parents returning to work and older Australians with funds forfeited by States and Territories when they rejected the Australian Government’s offer for the proposed ANTA Agreement for 2004-06. (3) One of the key issues in addressing skill shortages in trades is changing outdated views of trades and showing they can be challenging, lucrative and provide great opportunities for career advancement. The Australian Government’s New Apprenticeships marketing campaign was specifically designed to dislodge negative perceptions of traditional trades. The Australian Government has a number of strategies and policies to address skills shortages in trades and has been proactive in improving the numbers of people undertaking education and training in trade areas. Some of these include: The recent launch of the Australian Government’s National Skills Shortages Strategy (NSSS) – a new, comprehensive approach to tackling skills shortages, particularly in the traditional trades. The Strategy includes special incentive for traditional trades, support for changing attitudes to traditional trades and support for group training. The innovative skills shortages projects which will pilot a range of approaches to recruiting and training new entrants in traditional trades suffering skill shortages and the Targeted Initiatives Programme (TIP) which is currently giving priority to projects that target traditional trades. The Australian Government provides a number of special incentives for traditional trades. Since 1999, the Government has spent over $120 million on incentives for construction industry employers and $86.6 million on manufacturing industry employers; There is a special incentive of $1,100 for New Apprenticeships in skills shortages in rural and regional areas. Since 1999, around $41.6 million has been spent; and A special incentive of $1,210 for New Apprenticeships in innovation industries. Since its introduction in January 2003, more than $6.9 million has been paid. The Australian Government has made some significant inroads to addressing skill shortages in trades with: 34 per cent of our current 406,900 New Apprentices being in the trades and related occupations grouping including carpenters, plumbers and electricians. These occupations only make up 13 per cent of the workforce; and employment growth in trades and related occupations growing over the last five years at an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent, while New Apprentices in training in trades and related occupations grew at an average annual rate of 2.3 per cent. I recently announced a further $4.5 million for the continued support of careers advice by the Australian Government. Some of these initiatives are packaged into the National Skills Shortages Strategy to directly address areas of skill shortage. For the benefit of the Member for Lowe the suite of initiatives that I announced on 16 April 2004 include: funding to develop an accreditation scheme for careers practitioners; a three-part professional development package for careers practitioners; a new scholarship scheme to reward Australia’s most outstanding careers teachers; a ‘tear out’ pack for parents advising their children on career options for inclusion in the 2005 Job Guide delivered to every Year 10 student throughout Australia; initiatives to strengthen the 216 local community partnerships assisting schools, TAFEs, universities and local industries to advise students on career choices; careers forums for school principals and careers advisors to be held in conjunction with major careers expos across Australia; and infrastructure for a new national careers telephone helpline service.
