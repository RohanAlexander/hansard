Ms HOARE (Charlton) (8.00 p.m.)-I am pleased to take one of the final opportunities to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1999-2000. The 1999 budget, brought down on 11 May, was Treasurer Costello's fourth budget. This is a budget which is extreme in its conservatism. It is brimming with the conservative ideology of those who sit on the government benches. This is a budget which, like its predecessors, reflects this government's pursuit of the free market agenda. This is a budget which is reliant on the highly improbable future full sale of Telstra to preserve its bottom line. The first issue I will address tonight is that of the sale of Telstra-part of this government's ideological obsession with the sale of government assets and its relentless pursuit of economic rationalism. I take this opportunity to express my concern about the way in which and the extent to which governments around the world, including this coalition government, have embraced the notion of economic rationalism and have instituted the process of privatising government assets. I believe that economic rationalism is better described as economic fundamentalism, because there is often very little about it that is rational. Economics is supposed to be a social science, but to the fundamentalists it has become purely a study based on market processes. WhilstI do not totally oppose economic efficiency, I firmly believe that its pursuit must be tempered by recognition that it will not necessarily provide the best social outcomes or the outcomes which are in the best national interest. For example, in the region in which my electorate is located, market forces and private managerial decisions have caused coal mines to be abandoned before the coal reserves have been exhausted. In many cases the coal that remains is lost forever. That may be the best decision for the bottom line of the mining companies, but failing to secure a finite national resource is criminal from Australia's point of view. In conjunction with lost revenue for Australia, the families of the miners who lose their jobs as a result of these managerial decisions do not even have the security of the knowledge that they will receive their just entitlements. This government has just appropriated $350 million for a stevedoring fund to payout those unfortunate workers who bore the brunt of the failed Reith-Corrigan campaign to bust the MUA. Now that workers in the coal mining industry find themselves without jobs and robbed of their benefits following the closure of their mine, this government seems unwilling to establish a similar fund for these workers. If it does not, the workers of this country may have the perception that the stevedoring levy fund was established to try to distance Reith from the stench of that waterfront dispute. Failing to secure finite national resources is a crime. Failing to secure workers' just entitlements is a crime. If Telstra is fully sold by this government, it will fail to secure quality,",137,Broadcasting Services The Framework Will Not Apply To Private Or Amendment Online Services Restricted Distribution Communications Such As
224,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nebl) Took The Chair At 8.00 P.m.,"Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 6927 efficient and accessible communications resources for all Australians, and that will also be a national crime. This coalition government only in the past week has secured Senator Harradine's support for a further 16 per cent sale of Telstra by rolling out the pork barrel in the senator's home state of Tasmania. The bribes offered to Senator Harradine by the Prime Minister include $40 million earmarked to develop Tasmania as what the government has dubbed 'an intelligent island', although I fail to see how this announcement by the Prime Minister can be explained effectively to Tasmanians by Senator Harradine or indeed by any of my five Labor colleagues from Tasmania, given that it seems to call into question the current perception of Tasmania and its people held by this government. While the government is talking about developing and promoting a clever state, we must really question what has happened to the development of the clever country. The Prime Minister tried to claim that this is an education budget. However, it includes no extra funding at all for further or tertiary education for young Australians. What this budget does do in the area of education is to provide an extra $210 a year to every child in a private school, but it provides less than $10 a year to the 70 per cent of children in government schools. While Dr Kemp and his government pursue the concept of so-called choice in the free market environment of competition, the wealthiest schools providing education to children from affluent families increase their government revenue base while Australian children in public schools enjoy a greatly diminished education equity. This point was emphasised very eloquently and forcefully by Sharan Burrow, the Federal President of the Australian Education Union. While condemning the disparity between the budget funds for private and public schools, she said: The 30 per cent of children in private schools get three quarters of the budget increase while the 70 per cent of our children who depend on public schools get a mere one quarter. Private schools get the cake and the' public schools get the crumbs. Australia will never become a truly clever country while conservative governments continue to downsize the public education system from kindergarten through high schools, TAFEs and universities. Over the past four budgets, the Howard government has shown its pure contempt and hostility towards the public education system. This budget does not even go close to filling the $2.7 billion education hole that John Howard dug in 1996. It is quite unacceptable to us in the Labor Party, to families who have children in the public school system and to those who work in that system that in 1996, the first year of this government, there was 54c in recurrent expenditure going to public schools for every dollar that went to a private school. This amount has been reduced to 42c in 1999, which equals a loss of $800 million to public education. And all of this after we have just celebrated the 150th anniversary of the first public education act in Australia. The scorecard of this government in relation to public education includes, starting in 1996, a $350 million cut to public education and the deregulation of private schools. In 1997 we saw the equity programs abandoned. In 1998, despite increased numbers in public schools, the enrolment benchmark adjustment took effect and stole $11.9 million from public schools to pay for increased enrolments in private schools. And in 1999, as I have mentioned before, we see around $800 extra per child for private schools by the year 2003 and around only $100 6928 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 extra per child for public school students, plus the enrolment benchmark adjustment takes a further $21 million from public schools and sends it off to the private education system. Another area I would like to address tonight in speaking to this appropriation bill is that of health. This government has shamelessly embarked upon a process of enticing Australian families to opt out of the public health system and to opt for private health in'surance. Two of the major implications of this disgraceful policy direction are: first, universal access to quality health care is being undermined; and, second, it places increased medical expenses on many families who are least able to afford them. Over the past two years, Australians have been faced with a government which spends millions of dollars to prop up private health insurers at a time when waiting lists in public hospitals are months long. Last year, 1998, the cost of the government's failing private health insurance rebate was $1.5 billion. The government's own union of doctors, the AMA, forecast that this would increase to $2.25 billion per annum. At that time the government needed only to spend half a billion dollars and public hospital waiting lists would have been eliminated. This budget continues to ignore the public hospital system. The Prime Minister and the minister for health continue to try to save their previous bad decisions in the search for a further resurrection of private health insurance. The current rescue package has been named the 'Lifetime Health Cover', something which I understood all Australians should receive under Medicare. The 'Lifetime Health Cover' is just another admission by the minister that his private health insurance rebate scheme is a debacle and a sham. Any government with a social conscience should have the health appropriations focusing on public hospitals and public health. Private health insurance companies are large enough and wealthy enough not to need government support or government funding. Those families who choose to take out private health insurance can usually afford to do so without the necessity for Australian taxpayers to foot their bills. As for the AMA, the only union tolerated by this government, history has shown that its members are resourced well enough to be able to look after themselves and those of their ilk. First we had the $1.5 billion windfall for the privately insured and now we have a scare campaign to blackmail Australian families into taking out private health insurance under the threat that unless they do so by 1 July 2000 they will be paying up to 70 per cent higher premiums for the rest of their lives. These threats have been aimed at those least affluent families who would never consider, or be able to afford, private health insurance in their lifetimes. The position of the 1950s, which the Prime Minister embraces in most areas of social policy, continues to undermine the national government's responsibilities of accessibility, affordability and equity for all Australians. The Labor opposition espouses social reform policies which foster equity and fairness for all in the community. Those who recall the tremendous social reforms initiated during the Whitlam era will look on this budget with dismay and horror, for this budget represents a return to the pre-Whitlam days, to the dour, dank conservative rule of the 1950s. At the 1972 election, Gough Whitlam became the first Labor Prime Minister for 23 years. Initially he and his deputy, Lance Barnard, and then his government, embarked upon an extensive, ambitious, almost revolutionary program of reform. Let me remind members of some of those reforms for which Whitlam will always be remembered. His government took over financial responsibility for tertiary education and abolished fees. His government introduced Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 6929 welfare payments for single-parent families and homeless people. His government set up language programs for ethnic minorities, improved employment opportunities for women, and his government established Medibank. Gough Whitlam changed the focus of government. Under Whitlam, government became more people focused, more involved in providing people with opportunity, choice and justice. The reforms he introduced have been taken for granted by Australians for decades and they have remained intact under successive Liberal and Labor governments. We now see this government systematically dismantling those reforms in its efforts to be economically rational. Let there be no mistake, economic rationalism is not people friendly. I recently had the pleasure of joining with many others to pay tribute to Gough Whitlam at a dinner held in his honour in Sydney. The opportunity to reflect on the reforms Whitlam initiated was more than just an indulgent reminiscence; it was an opportunity to reaffirm what it is that we in the Labor Party believe in and continue to fight for. I look forward to participating in the budget preparation by a future Labor government which is both socially and morally responsible. public priorities of the nation: our priorities for the economy in which we work, our priorities for the society in which we live, as well as our priorities for the international community of which we are an integral part. It should not, therefore, be simply a narrow exercise in fiscal policy, important as fiscal policy might be. It is a broader exercise in how we deploy the public resources of the nation and, as such, it is a reflection of a government's vision-and, yes, I have dared use the 'v' word; it has been some years since using the 'v' word has been fashionable in this place-but a vision for the nation, the type of nation we wish to be. If there is a basic difference between the government's view of the budget and that of the alternative government, it is this: this government defines budget success in terms of what a government does not do; the alternative government defines budget success in terms of what government actually can do. This government defines budget success as decreasing the size of government, decreasing the role of government, a celebration of the doctrine of government in retreat. The alternative government defines budget success in terms of how we can harness the energies of government to build the nation, to build its physical infrastructure, to build its human infrastructure, to contribute to what the literature describes as national capacity building. . When it comes to a vision for the nation, this government proudly proclaims that it does not have one. If you think this is an extravagant, partisan claim, then I would draw members' attention to what can only be described as the stunned mullet expression on the face of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, Mr Costello, when asked on ABC television on budget night what vision underpinned the government's budget strategy. He simply looked bemused at the nature of the question. He had no response to that overarching question, 'What is your fiscal strategy serving in terms of an ultimate blueprint for the nation?' By contrast, we on this side of politics do not apologise for the 'vision thing' because we believe that, when framing the budget for the nation, it is not only valid but necessary to ask fundamental questions as to why and how we are raising and expending some $150 billion in Commonwealth revenues. We believe it is both valid and necessary to ask what impact the taxation architecture of a nation will have on individual and corporate incentive, and therefore the impact that that will in tum have on national economic efficiency and performance. We",140,Representatives Main Committee
225,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (8.15 P.m.),"An appropriation debate should be a debate about the6930 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 believe it is valid and necessary to ask what the taxation architecture of the nation will deliver by way of revenues and whether those revenues will be sufficient to ensure that we protect the weak and provide equal opportunity to the strong. We believe it is valid .and necessary to ask whether we are providing educational opportunity based on ability and not just background, whether we are caring for the sick, whether we are giving shelter to the homeless, whether we are offering aid to the destitute, be those destitute at home or abroad. All these are valid and necessary questions because they go to the heart of the question of who we are as a people, not just as individuals; what values we hold as a people, not just as some collectivity of self-interest. They also ask the question of who we wish to become as a nation. Budgets are huge resources for governments to build nations with. Nations are not just built by individuals. They are built by individuals as well as the collective resources of individuals reflected in the energies and resources of government. To believe somehow that the allocation of the resources of government is some minor bagatelle, some irrelevancy, and that the ultimate burden simply depends on individual incentive, and individual initiative in the economy at large is a radical misreading of economic reality. ' I would like to address briefly just three elements of this overall equation. First, in terms of this government's vision for the future of the nation, what is its taxation vision? Second, and briefly, what is its education vision? And, third, how does this government seek to reflect its vision for the nation's engagement with the region and the world? Firstly, on tax: in designing the tax architecture of the nation, it is reasonable to ask what national objectives are to be served by the architecture of taxation which the Treasurer has articulated in the various tax bills currently before the parliament. It is reasonable to ask whether this tax proposal will increase economic growth. It is reasonable to ask whether, perforce of that, it will also increase total factor productivity in the overall efficiency of the economy. It is reasonable to ask whether this tax initiative will increase employment. It is reasonable to ask whether it will maintain price stability. It is reasonable to ask what impact this overall tax proposal will have on overall government revenues. It is reasonable to ask what impact it will have on the overall efficiency of the taxation collection system, just as it is reasonable to ask what impact it will have on the federation itself, fiscally and functionally. Finally, it is reasonable and critical to ask what impact this new tax architecture-this new taxation vision for the nation-will have on basic Australian fairness. All these questions go to the heart of the sort of Australia that this government wishes to create. In the absence of a formally articulated vision, the. tax policy or the tax proposal that we have before the nation at present is something like a vision by default. It is the vision that you have when you are not having an articulated vision. . Let us look at its constituent elements. What impact will this tax proposal that is core to the appropriations which are before us at the moment have on future growth in the Australian economy? If you look at the collection of evidence before the nation, both before the Senate inquiry and in the public discussion beyond that inquiry, you will find that the impact on economic growth which will occur as a result of this package being implemented will at best be negligible and, on the basis of a substantial slice of the professional literature on this subject, it will be negative. The maximum positive projection contained in any of the literature on what additional increment will be added to national economic growth as a consequence of this package being implemented, which would not otherwise occur as a result of other factors out there in the economy, is 0.2 per cent per annum in the long term. The long term Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 6931 is defined at the fiveto seven-year point. That is a long time to wait for a small and marginal dividend indeed. The second element I said we should touch on when looking at this vision for the nation as reflected by the tax proposal before us is: well, if it is not going to grow the economy hugely, what will it do for the efficiency of the economy? What will it do in terms of what the economists describe as the total factor productivity in the economy? This is a critical equation. It is basically a question about whether, by bringing in new price signals through the income taxation system in the country, combined with the impact of the consumption tax, people are going to allocate and use the economic resources at their disposal more efficiently than they have in the past. If you tum to the professional literature, again we find that there is not a single shred of evidence, either in the publicly argued case by the government or in the evidence presented before the Senate inquiry on the GST or elsewhere in the public debate on this issue, which suggests that factor productivity in this economy will increase as a consequence of this package being introduced. The third thing that I said we would touch on is: what will its impact be on employment? Here the impact will not be negligible; it will be decidedly negative. Consider again the evidence before the Senate inquiry-and the member for Fairfax just shakes his head in disbelief at this, but if he reflects on the constituency from which he comes, one which I am most acutely familiar with because I was born there, it is a constituency where in fact tourism is one of the primary employment generators. If there is a sector of the economy which will be torpedoed amidships by this tax proposal, it will be tourism. The projections before the Senate inquiry are that the national loss to tourism employment across the nation in both Queensland and the other states will be something in the range of 50,000 to 100,000 jobs over a several year period. If that is the definition of a po-iti.Ve dlvidend from a proposal of this order of magnitude, then the government's definition of 'positive' frankly escapes anything contained in the Oxford Concise Dictionary. We look at price stability, a further test of what vision is somehow encapsulated in this tax proposal before us. The heroic boffins of Treasury project that the price impact of this overall proposal will be maximally 1.9 per cent. No other credible economist--correction: no other economist-in the country accepts that proposition. The range of projections which are contained in the professional literature on this subject suggest that the price impact of this package once it flows through will be in the order of four to six per cent. If that is a useful contribution to price stability in the economy-and price stability, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank repeatedly reminds us, is critical to the future macroeconomic management of the Australian economy-then I do not think, again, that the government and the rest of the professional community are speaking the same language. A fifth test of this government's taxation vision is what its impact will be on revenues. The underlying presupposition which the government has somehow managed to sell, to part of the community at least, is that the existing taxation system is broken in terms of its ability to deliver adequate future supplies of revenue to Commonwealth coffers to fund the future social requirements of the nation. Once again, if you look through the tax package and the formal documentation attached to it, do we find any shred of evidence anywhere where the government says, 'Stick to the existing raft of tax measures and you'll find that revenues fall in a heap in three years, five 6932 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 years, seven years or nine years'? No. The evidence is not there at all. Why is it not there? It is not there because it is not true. The existing revenue system of the Commonwealth as demonstrated by the ballooning in government revenues in the last three years is perfectly adequate to deliver our future revenue requirements. In fact, if we look at the revenue impact of this new proposal before us, this new tax system for the nation will represent a further increment in government revenues. What you will find is that the Commonwealth coffers will in the future be even more flush because this consumption tax proposal is an absolute beaut when it comes to guaranteeing the delivery of revenues to the Commonwealth. The people who will be dancing in the streets-quite apilrt from the accounting industry of the nation which will, of course, provide services necessary to assist businesses comply with the most complex tax package which has been introduced since taxation measures were first introduced in the Babylonian Empire-are the Australian Taxation Office because it is a huge additional increment to the future revenue delivery to the Commonwealth. This additional revenue delivery is not necessary given the fact that the existing system not only is not broken on that count, but has not been proven or established to be broken in the debate to date. I spoke also of the impact on the federation. ANTS mark I-the first version of this taxation vision for the nation-in fact proposed that a system of arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states which could only result in the exacerbation of what is described as vertical fiscal imbalance, that is the greater reliance by the states on the Commonwealth for revenues as a proportion of the total revenues of the states and relative to the total outlay responsibilities of the states. That was the old package. Now we have a new package as a consequence of the deal done with the Democrats. A deal which has been described by that great advocate of Labor Party causes, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, when he said that the current tax package as it affects the states is unacceptable and should be taken back to the drawing board. The bottom line is, if you look at the fiscal and functional architecture of the Australian federation, this does not do a single thing if the vision is to return to the states a capacity to raise revenues which are approximate in strength and size to the revenue responsibilities of the same states. In fact, it heads in precisely the reverse direction. If we aggregate the arguments, we find in fact that the package before us achieves very little by way of positive vision. On fairness itself, we come to the kernel of the argument. If this tax package fails the test of economic growth, if it fails the test of adding to economic efficiency, if it fails to add to the employment of the nation, if it fails to ensure price stability, if it does nothing to add to the functionality of the federation and if it does nothing about and in fact heads in the reverse direction on questions of fairness, we might well ask, 'Why are we doing it?' And that is where we come to the core of the argument. The often unstated reason we are doing this is that what we have here, in its essence, is the Robin Hood tax in reverse. This is a tax which redistributes the taxation burden of the nation away from the rich and towards the poor. It is a massive wealth redistribution tax. That is the core of the argument; that is the core of the logic which underpins this entire package; that is the core of the government's vision. It is a vision based, in the end, on what I can only describe as the worse forms of accentuated individual greed because it fails all the broader tests of economic efficiency and of overall economic benefit to the economy at large as well as any passing test of social justice. When a vision for a nation says that 'greater taxation rewards should be delivered to the rich' -and that is the summation and conclusion of that vision-and that vision is somehow a risk worth taking when measured against the other risks, I think it is a vision which the Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 6933 nation does not need. What the government is saying about its vision for the nation is that, by embarking upon this enterprise to deliver greater taxation benefits to the richest in our community, it is at the same time worth risking future certainty in terms of the growth of the economy; it is worth putting at risk inflationary stability in the economy; it is worth putting at risk the unemployment situation within the country; it is worth placing in jeopardy that which remains of basic fairness in our society. It is worth putting all those things at risk, in the government's vision, simply in order to deliver this taxation windfall to those in our society and within our economy who least need it. HereI speak of those at the wealthiest end of the Australian taxation spectrum. If this is this government's vision as reflected in the guts of this taxation proposal-in the essence of its architecture-it is a poor and shrivelled vision indeed. It is one which is as economically irresponsible as it is socially unjust-8;nd all in the cause of individual greed. I said I would touch briefly on education and the region. When we look at education and what this government does through the budget for education, we see a higher education sector which has had $800 million ripped out of it. On one further measure, it is a sector which has had $2 billion ripped out of it, if you add to that the $1.2 billion which has been delivered to the sector through the increase in HECS charges. When we look at literacy and numeracythat matter which the federal minister for education trumpets loudly each time he performs in the House of Representatives-and if you unpack the reality of all that, you have a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing, because the numbers underpinning it in fact suggest that very little by way of additional resources has been delivered to that sector at all. To do something serious and substantial about literacy and numeracy in the school system-and I speak from my experience of having worked for many years in a state government in this country-requires significant resources. The additional funds allocated separately and individually by the state Labor government in Queensland since 1995 on literacy and numeracy programs exceed by a country mile that which the federal education minister proclaims and boasts of as representing his concrete contribution to literacy and numeracy programs across the nation. You cannot educate a nation on the cheap. You cannot equip the next generation of Australians with the skills that they need for the economy to perform efficiently and for them to obtain the benefits necessary for them and their families on the cheap. You cannot equip our work force with the skills for the next industrial revolution-the revolution in technologyon the cheap. These are essential investments in the nation's future, in the future efficiency of our economy as well as the equity of our society. In conclusion, I draw attention in this appropriations debaJe to the question of the pattern and texture of our international and regional engagements. I simply say this: if we are serious about projecting this nation's interests in the region, how can we emasculate and kill an organisation such as Radio Australia? How can we emasculate and kill an organisation such as Australian Television International? Are these not worthy of the public resources of the nation? They are, and they are a thousand times so. The vision for the nation requires investment across these fronts, not the retreat from them. (Time expired) has just talked about vision. He has talked about vision in terms of the lack thereof contained in the government's budget delivered some weeks ago. Tonight, I want to focus my remarks in respect of the budget and the appropriations on what that question of vision, or the lack thereof, means for Australia's defence. Defence policy in Australia is very much a bipartisan",143,Representatives Main Committee
226,Mr Martin (Cunningham) (8.35 P.m.),"My friend and colleague the member for Griffith6934 MAIN COMMITIEE Monday, 21 June 1999 issue and rightly so. The defence of this nation is above politics, or at least it should be. That is why on different occasions, since I have been the spokesperson for the Labor Party on defence issues, I have found it necessary to agree with the minister on issues associated with defence or, indeed, on a couple of occasions actually to lead the minister in respect of issues associated with the defence of this nation and our strategic circumstances. It is also important that, with that bipartisan approach to defence issues, the opportunity should not be lost for some introspection: looking beyond what the present government believes is appropriate, as we enter the next century, for the defence of our nation and what it means for the strategic environment in which we find ourselves. It is that lack of vision which, to some extent, worries me, as Labor spokesman on defence, about this continuing bipartisan support that we give to this very important element of government for all Australians. Defence is the sort of area where-and, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, you would know this certainly from our adjoining electorates in the Illawarra-if you go and talk to any of our constituents and talk to them about defence issues they really do not have a great deal of understanding. They are, rightly, more concerned with issues such as those mentioned by my colleague the member for Griffith. They are concerned about the effect the GST will have on their lives in the future, family payments, the cost of living and employment. But, equally, of course, they should be concerned about the defence of their nation. They should be concerned about the fact that we still live in a free democracy, and about the fact that they can tune in their television sets most evenings and see images from different parts of the world where people, regrettably, do not enjoy the sorts of benefits that we here in Australia take so much for granted. But to get to those circumstances requires a coherent policy for the defence of this nation; to continue those circumstances requires a vision for the future for our defence. Why do I say this? I say this because, the government having moved to a new accounting process during the course of this last budget period, it is very easy to get wrapped up in just the bald numbers-in dollars and cents terms-that were directed towards defence. At the end of the day, if you add it all up, I think you will probably see that there is about $19 billion that has been directed towards defence in this budget. People could sit back and say, 'My God, $19 billion for the defence of this nation-that must mean that there are some terrific programs under way.' But, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I know you are aware, with the accrual accounting process, when you pare it back to the actual amount that is going into defence expenditure, there really has just been a maintenance in the barest possible way of expenditure on defence in real terms. Again, people might say, 'What is wrong with that? This government said that it would retain expenditure in defence in real terms in this coming budget.' The difficulty in real terms is that there has not been major growth in defence expenditure to meet the needs of Australia into the next century. With the back of inflation having been broken by the former government led by Paul Keating and maintained by this present government-and inflation is continuing to be extremely low-that increased amount of money is not going to be that great when you start talking about the expenditure necessary to retain real expenditure terms. But, sadly, in a number of ways, that does not reflect a vision for the future. Let me go on to explain what I mean by that in a number of important issues in defence. Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 6935 It is a fact of life that Australia's strategic circumstances and environment are changing dramatically. No-one in the defence white paper-the paper set the strategic overview for Australia's defence planning and was introduced by the former Minister for Defence, Ian McLachlan-talked about the Asian economic crisis. No-one in defence made any plans on the effect that might have on what Australia would need to expend in its defence or what it would mean for our neighbours who equally were proposing some fairly massive expenditure on defence items. I am talking specifically here of the capability that we as a nation must develop-and by that I mean the platform that we have-whether it be naval, on land or in the air. We are a middle-ranking but important power in this region, which means that for us to continue that dominance to some extent-we should have enough firepower so that people say, 'We are not going to mess with Australia'-we need to ensure that we have that firepower and that it is at least equal to that of our neighbours. With the Asian economic downturn a number of our neighbours had to put off purchasing some pretty sophisticated equipment and some pretty sophisticated platform, particularly for their air forces. This would have meant that the capability we possessed through our FA1S fighter aircraft and the FIll bomber was likely to be eclipsed, which highlights a very real problem for Australia. I know the minister is aware of this and that he has called for another strategic review. I think that is appropriate in view of the comments I have made about defence not factoring in the Asian economic downturn or even seeing it coming, as evidenced in the last white paper produced by this government. It is significant because, in meeting our strategic needs from a defence perspective, we are going to be faced with a massive problem, that of block obsolescence. Block obsolescence is a process whereby we have come to the end of the economic life cycle of the platform. that we use to defend this nation. It is regrettable but it is a fact of life that both the FAl8 fighter aircraft and the FIll bomber will come to the end of their economic life at the same time; therefore, we have to make some strategic decisions about what aircraft we are going to need in our own Air Force to meet the circumstances of the future in the defence of Australia. There is no doubt-and this is again demonstrated by the bipartisan nature of the defence policy-that we as a nation will have to effectively defend the air-sea gap against any hostile incursions. Like everyone, we hope that something like that will never happen; nevertheless, we have to have a plan for our own security as a nation, a plan for our regional security and a plan for our region as part of a major defence relationship. Unfortunately, as I said, in the budget that has been handed down for defence we do not see a lot of that vision or that plan. That block obsolescence is not just going to go to issues associated with our aircraft. Regrettably, similar sorts of problems are going to confront some of our naval vessels, and we will have to look at replacement there. At the present moment there is debate about a new attack helicopter for the Army, and we will have to give consideration to one of three tenderers that are going to put forward their views as to which one we need. One of the helicopters is the Apache helicopter, which has been used in Kosovo. Really it did not get used; they lost a couple, I think, in training exercises. But the question is: do we need something like that, which is really a tank buster, or do we need something else? Are we going to see amphibious tanks or something like that coming across the Torres Strait to Australia at some stage in the future? If we are, then maybe we need a helicopter of that type. These are the sorts of strategic decisions we are going to have to 6936 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 make in the not too distant future, based on a very clever and a very succinct assessment of our security arrangements. The fact of the matter is that Jindalee coming on line shortly will give us something of a technological edge, too. That is going to be extremely good for the defence of Australia. We talk about the role that satellites now play in the defence of nations as well, and I think it is fairly common knowledge that that is going to be and will continue to be significant for Australia. When we start talking about the fact that we are now looking through the knowledge edgewhich is, I guess, defence talk meaning that technology has advanced pretty rapidly-when we start to give consideration to the type of capability that is available to people who might want to be hostile, we have to make some fairly careful decisions about how we are going to defend this nation. As Admiral Barrie, the Chief of the Defence Force, said in a speech some few months ago, we have to redefine how we defend this nation. In the future the type of defence we have to prepare for might well be a hostile force coming with aircraft or with ships of some description, but it might also be people landing at Sydney airport carrying weapons of biological warfare-perhaps not at Sydney airport; maybe flying in undetected over this incredibly large coast that we have-and in some way causing terrorism activity to take place in this nation. When you start to get into some of the smart bombs and the I-bombs and the technology that is out there now for disabling computers through developments taking place under this knowledge edge, it can become fairly scary. At some stage we might not see anybody killed other than the massive computer at the Australian Stock Exchange. We might see somebody walk into the Reserve Bank of Australia and blow all their computers away simply by putting something down in the middle of the floor, concealed as a briefcase, which actually sends out electromagnetic pulses that wipe out the entire memory of the computers in the Reserve Bank of Australia. Can you imagine what that would do to Australia in terms of everyday commerce? These are the realities of the future. Whilst it is important that our Army, Navy and Air Force heads and people at Russell Offices sit down and start thinking about our strategic environment in terms of what people would regard as traditional warfare, there are other issues which have to be addressed, and I think it is appropriate that the Australian Defence Force turn their attention to them. But we do not see a lot of that recognised in this budget, save for $10 million put aside for the creation of something which has been called the Office of Revolution in Military Affairsa touch Stalinist for this government, I would have thought. Nevertheless this revolution in military affairs is a name which the United States use to describe what I have referred to as the knowledge edge and all this smart technology that is going on at the minute. But I have to say that I think that only $10 million for something like that is not really appropriate: I think we should be investing a lot more in that aspect of our defence relationship. So our strategic circumstances, the sort of capability that we will need, the platform that will be required in the future to ensure that we can defend this nation, need to be improved. At some stage down the track people might start thinking about missiles or unmanned aircraft. We are buying some reconnaissance aircraft shortly as well, to go with the helicopters for the Army; we are talking about upgrading the frigates; we are talking about the Collins class Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 6937 submarines coming on line progressively over the next 12 months, and most of the issues associated with the difficulties encountered there have been worked through. On that, I might just say in passing that, instead of people going out and bagging the Collins class submarine project, which is leading edge technology, and which is having an industry base in Australia develop, we should be saying, 'Isn't it terrific that we are doing something that will give us the best conventionally powered submarine in the world,' and 'Isn't it good that it is actually going to be an effective part of the deterrence and the strategic defence of Australia?' Wouldn't it be good if, just for a change, somebody started saying, 'Australian Defence Industries is terrific?' Wouldn't it be good if somebody overseas suddenly said, 'If they are making them in Australia, maybe we might like to have some of those as well; maybe we could buy some of those from Australia?' Wouldn't it be terrific if the Australian Submarine Corporation could continue to make those down in Port Adelaide? I think it is ridiculous that, in the defence community overseas, we are something of a laughing stock because, instead of our praising our ability to manufacture something like tl).e Collins class submarine, we are being knocked by our own, and the defence community overseas is saying, 'You blokes must be mad. You think you wlJ,nt to sell that down the track? No way will anybody buy that now because of what people have been saying about it.' Yet, as I say, technically the glitches have been remedied, the Navy is satisfied with the progress on it, and I think that when they do go fully and operationally into service, Australia will have a fabulous platform for its future. Australian industry also is something which I believe needs to be continually refined and addressed when it comes to defence issues. I talked about block obsolescence and tbe economic life of many of our platforms coming to an end at the same time, and the sad fact is that so too is defence industry, with three specific maritime platforms all going to end at the same time. We will finish manufacturing the mine hunters at Newcastle, the frigates at Williamstown in Melbourne and the Collins class submarines in Port Adelaide, all at the same time. There are going to be three shipyards completing-all over, red rover in terms of what they are manufacturing-all at the same time. In defence planning, they are the sorts of issues, from an industry point of view and a regional employment.p0int of view, that have to be considered. At Williamstown alone there are 1,000 people employed at that naval dockyard. What happens when the frigate project is all over? The New Zealanders said that they would not take the third. They are going to buy some second-hand junk aircraft from the United States instead. So another one could have been built there and people could have continued to be employed-but what are we going to do about that? Where is the vision statement from Minister Moore about this? I will say one thing about Minister Bronwyn Bishop when she was Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. She did bring down a document on defence industry, which set some guidelines for the future. We disagreed around the edges on some of the things contained within it; nevertheless, it was a blueprint, and it could give some guidance for the future. I would like to see that built on, but I am afraid we do not hear the former industry minister-now the present defence minister-John Moore, saying much about that. I will certainly give him bipartisan support on it. In developing Labor's policy on defence into the future, I am going to point very heavily to some issues associated with that. Finally, I think it is important-although, these days, not necessarily in my area-to make some comments very briefly on personnel issues. The minister, in a statement in the House 6938 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 some few weeks ago, talked about the way in which all the changes in the Defence Force were leading to savings which were being redirected to the pointy end of defence. I have to say that we are a little sceptical about the savings that are proposed to be engineered from the Defence Reform Program. Why? Because it was predicated on a defence force of 42,500, the lowest in about 30 years. What is the real circumstance? Unbeknown to many people, this government has decided that it is going to keep the Defence Force at 50,000; therefore those savings cannot possibly be realised. As a consequence, we see the sorts of headlines that were in the Canberra Times today, 'An Army in retreat, if not quite disarray', where it goes through chapter and verse of how unhappy many people are in Australia's defence forces, why morale is so low. These are issues of vision for Australia's defence. These are issues of vision for Australia. I think the government, rather than simply saying that we are maintaining expenditure on defence in real terms, needs to address these issues. We are happy to enter into that debate with the government because defence policies are largely bipartisan, but we want to see that vision. (Time expired) Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (8.55 p.m.)-I wish to participate in the debate this evening on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1999-2000. With this budget the government helped me to keep a promise I made to the people of Capricornia, going into the last election. I warned the voters of Capricornia last year that this government did not have a plan for us in Central Queensland, or indeed for Australia; I said that it had a plan for a new tax. Every word the Treasurer said on budget night, and just as importantly every word he did not say, reassured me that I had been totally honest with the people in my electorate. There is no plan; there is the GST and there is the sell-off of Telstra. Well, the people in Capricornia have heard that one already and they did not like it the first time. This is a lazy and complacent budget from a government that is more interested in earning pats on the back from the big end of town than doing the hard yards to meet its obligations to the Australian community for now and into the future for wherever people happen to live in this country. It is a budget that shows that this government is completely out of touch with the needs and concerns of the Australian people, and in particular with the needs of those of us who live in regional areas. When I read through the budget papers and when I listened to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister sell the budget in the parliament and in the media, it was painfully obvious to me that there are whole sections of the community and whole sections of our country that just do not appear on this government's radar screen. In this budget the government continues to fail the people in the community on average and low incomes. When the Prime Minister can talk about the difficult choices facing people in choosing between visiting an extra country on their next overseas holiday or taking out expensive private health insurance, it is pretty clear that he is out of touch with ordinary people. The arrogance of this government is truly breathtaking. All over my electorate people's jaws were hitting the floor when they heard that little gem from the Prime,Minister. He is out of touch with ordinary people, and more than that, he does not understand their lives. His government does not care about the real choices people living in my electorate have to make. They are not choices between overseas holidays or private health cover, but between a new pair of school shoes or a family outing for a meal at the leagues club, a service for Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 6939 mum's car or a school camp for the kids. People ring my office in Rocky with a whole range of problems, but a toss up between overseas holiday destinations is not one of them. It is clear from this budget that the government's radar is still faulty when it comes to recognising regional Australia. I say that because there is nothing in this budget to indicate that the government sees the potential of our regions or the need for a coordinated strategy to maximise each region's strengths to ensure a strong and sustainable future. It appears that in this government's mind set, regional means rural and the two constantly get lumped together. I am fairly sensitive to the distinction between the two, because the electorate of Capricornia represents a fair proportion of rural and remote communities included in the broad region of Central Queensland, as well as the region's key centre, the city of Rockhampton. While there are definitely a number of measures directed at the rural sections of Capricornia, there is no sense that it is part of a comprehensive strategy for our Central Queensland region, a strategy that identifies what industries and activities are going to form the foundation of our future growth, and more importantly, ensures that every part of our region has the capacity, both in terms of physical infrastructure and skilled people, to participate in that development and benefit from it. Instead, there are examples all the way through the government's policies of opportunities that are going to be lost because of the government's lack of strategic vision and obsession with its new tax at the expense of good policy. There are two opportunities in particular that I see going begging as far as the future development of Central Queensland is concerned, opportunities to make our mark as a region in two emerging industries that will complement our traditional strengths in primary industries and mining. The two areas I am thinking of are tourism and education. Instead of pulling out all stops to support these industries, the government is taking them one step forward and then two steps back, recognising their importance on the one hand but then making it impossible for them to flourish. As far as tourism is concerned, the step forward is the commitment in the budget to extend the runway at the Rockhampton airport. This is a commendable decision and one that holds great promise for the tourism industry around Rocky and Central Queensland. However, at the same time the tourism industry is threatened with the wipe-out of the GST. That is more like one step forward and 10 steps backwards for the tourism operators around Central Queensland. The impact of the GST on tourism was not even looked at by the Treasury when they did their modelling of the government's package, but everyone else who has analysed the effects has forecast disaster. It does not matter whether you look at international tourists or domestic tourists, whether they are travelling by car, plane or train-every combination faces a job destroying downturn as a result of the GST. The idea of extending Rocky airport's runway is to open up opportunities for attracting international tourists to Central Queensland. On current trends,that should succeed. The most recent Queensland visitor survey available from the Capricorn Tourism and Development Organisation found that international visitors account for 11 per cent of tourists to our region annually-a total of 89,700 visitors from around the world. That is a significant proportion and not a number easily overlooked, or so you would think. But, despite the growing significance of tourism as an export industry and employer in Australia, Treasury did not think tourism was important enough to look into when modelling the GST. Instead, it was left to 6940 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 those who understand and value the contribution of tourism to our economy to do the work on that front. The Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia said in its submission to the Senate inquiry: Monash University Economics Professor Peter Dixon has forecast a 10 percent decline in international visitors to Australia as a result of the GST. This equates to the loss of $1.6 billion in export earnings. Queensland stands to suffer the greatest loss of income and employment. The competition for attracting international tourists is fierce and, according to the analysis presented to the Senate inquiry, very price sensitive. That is bad news for Central Queensland when you look at the breakdown of international visitor figures. For example, 61 per cent of international visitors came from Europe and the United Kingdom, so it is a pretty fair bet that most of those were backpackers trying to see the country as cheaply as possible. How are they going to feel about paying a GST on every bus ride, hostel room and souvenir? Unfortunately, the story does not get any better for domestic tourism. I just spent the last weekend travelling around the western parts of Capricornia, through the gemfields and out to Barcaldine. Everywhere you looked there were caravans on the roads and tourists enjoying the sunshine and the atmosphere of friendly country towns. Almost all of the tourists were from within Australia and were taking extended driving holidays on carefully managed budgets. All of the locals I talked to told me that numbers are growing every year and they are all hopeful that tourism will grow to add a new dynamic to the region's economy. I would like to think that their hope is well founded, but why is the government risking that bright outlook by hobbling it with the GST? Of course, it is not just the west that is looking at domestic tourism as part of its future prosperity. Most of the visitors to the Capricorn Coast are from within Australia and are looking for a moderately priced holiday. According to the Tourism Council of Australia: The analysis shows that prices for Australians travelling at home will rise by 5.2 % if the trip includes an air component and 4.8 % if travel by car. This is backed up by the Tourism Task Force in its submission to the Senate inquiry: The Tourism Task Force estimates the overall impact on domestic travel is at least a fall of 4.4 %, due to the net impact of increased prices of domestic travel and decreasing prices of travel to overseas destinations. There is nothing to feel very hopeful about in that outlook. Maybe people will be able to think about an extra stopover overseas as well as their private health insurance in such a scenario, but they will certainly be thinking twice about flying, driving, camping, caravanning or any other holiday activity in Central Queensland because the cost will undoubtedly go up under the government's GST. So, on the one hand, we get the runway, but the other hand deals us a tax on a developing industry that will see jobs, revenue and opportunities lost to Central Queensland. The development of Central Queensland as a centre for education and research is another opportunity that the government has the power to either make or break. The University of Central Queensland's innovative Smart City project has the potential to position the uni and Central Queensland as a leader in distance education, in the use of interactive technology in teaching and as a major exporter of education. Following a large investment by the Beattie government and a commitment by the federal opposition to gift the Commonwealth building to the uni, the government was dragged into an agreement to sell the building to the university. Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 6941 The university, and indeed the whole community of Rockhampton, welcomed the government's belated embrace of the Smart City project, but again we see one step forward and two steps back. Instead of handing over the building,. the government is making the university pay for it. The government continues to limit the ambitions of universities and students in Australia due to its failure to restore funding to tertiary education. The government's spending on higher education this year is still $800 million behind Labor's spending in its last year in office. The lack of vision and strategy in this budget is bad enough whenyou think of the options that would be open to the government and this country if it was not squandering the surplus on pay-offs for the GST. It is made even worse when you recall how the surplus was arrived at-it was paid for by cuts to regional services and education. We saw our government services in Central Queensland shut up shop in the name of producing a surplus. Now that there is a surplus, what do we get? We do not see our services being returned: we get a GST that increasing numbers of people in Capricornia-whether they are the pensioners at the supermarket or the bloke running the servo down the road-are telling me that they definitely do not want. The tax office in Rocky is'a classic illustration of how this government operates. Obviously, it is not about what we want or need in Central Queensland but what the government's GST obsession dictates. In 1996, the tax office in Rocky closed its doors as part of the government's budget slashing to community services. Now we find out that Rocky will get an office staffed with GST field officers. So again, one step forward and two steps back. Sure, we welcome the extra jobs that the field office represents, but there is no way we are getting back what we lost in 1996. It is far from a fully equipped tax office, open to take all inquiries that the general public would like to be able to take directly to a tax officer rather than waiting on the phone to Townsville for every request. Instead, we are getting a cubbyhole from which field officers will travel around visiting businesses to implement the GST. So we lost our community's tax office in order to get a surplus that we are now told is going to be spent on a tax office that is not for the community but for the GST. I think the people of Central Queensland are entitled to feel pretty ripped off by that equation. I do not like to let a speaking opportunity in here pass me by without mentioning the government's performance on jobs. WhateverI say about employment now, it will certainly be more than the Treasurer said on budget night. I was waiting quite expectantly for the Treasurer to announce some initiatives for creating jobs and cutting the unemployment rate. I could not really believe it when his time was almost up and he still had not touched on the issue. Then right at the end, almost as an afterthought, he shrugged his shoulders and said, 'The unemployment rate should remain around its current level'. Just like that. Not, 'We're the government and we should be committed and passionate about ensuring that every Australian has a chance at gaining the education and skills to get a job'. Not, 'We're the government and we should be working with communities and businesses to identify opportunities and problems to ensure that development occurs right across Australia'. No; all we got was that the unemployment rate is just going to sit on 7.5 per cent indefinitely without too much concern from the government. And, of course, the rate in Capricornia, being a regional area, is higher than that figure-up at eight per cent. But I guess the Treasurer would just shrug his shoulders at that, too. 6942 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 This government's approach to unemployment is another example of where programs and services were sacrificed in the name of producing a budget surplus, only for the surplus to be wasted on achieving a GST that will only harm the creation of jobs. The government seems quite comfortable with spending $20 billion on the GST over the next three years and not producing an improved unemployment outcome. It is quite hard to believe. Their one concession to the 700,000 unemployed people in Australia, including almost 5,500 unemployed people in Capricornia, is the Work for the Dole Scheme-the Work for the Dole Scheme with a 32 per cent success rate for participants finding employment compared to the rate of 50 per cent to 60. per cent under Labor's Jobstart wage subsidy program. The disappointing thing here is that the government knows what it could be doing for unemployment in this country because it only has to look at the final months of the Labor government when the creation of full-time jobs was double that currently being achieved by this government. The government knows what it needs to do-provide training and wage subsidies-and it would have the resources to do that if it was not spending the surplus on a new tax. This is a government with the wrong priorities-a GST ahead of jobs and education, and the sell-off of Telstra instead of a commitment to providing a high level of accessible and affordable telecommunications infrastructure to all Australians, both city and country. The government offers no vision for this country, and the people of Capricornia know it. All this government does offer is an unfair and job destroying tax, and the people of Capricornia know that as well and they do not want it. Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (9.10 p.m.)-I rise in this appropriation debate to address one issue of vital importance to my electorate, and that is the complete failure of the government in this budget to allocate vitally needed funds to upgrading the Princes and West Gate freeways which connect Melbourne and Geelong. This is an issue of vital concern to my electorate because it is bisected by this road, which we call locally the Geelong road. Let there be no doubt about the importance of this road. A few simple statistics quickly paint that picture. Make no mistake, these are statistics which are no doubt known to the government, particularly as I have referred to them in this place before. Fact 1: the Geelong road carries up to 132,000 vehicles a day, with traffic increasing by almost five per cent a year. After the construction and connection of the western ring road, traffic volumes have increased and indeed we have already exceeded the 2005 projections for traffic flow. Fact 2: it carries more than six million tonnes of freight a year and services more than 30 per cent of Australia's exports through the ports of Melbourne and Geelong. Fact 3: the freeway services one of Victoria's fastest growing population and economic regions and is the key link to export markets for primary producers throughout the western district and South Australia. Fact 4: it is a gateway to one of Australia's premier tourist attractions, namely the Great Ocean Road and the various tourist venues which lie along it. Fact5 and most important of all: it is Victoria's most deadly road, with more smashes on its 63-kilometre length than were experienced on the 1,000 kilometres of Victoria's federally financed highway system in the same period. Since 1990, 86 people have died on the road. There have been 6,000 crash victims in total and 1,000 of them have been injured. At the Maltby Bypass in my electorate, which is a severe accident black spot because a design flaw causes traffic moving from Werribee to Geelong to merge into the fastest moving lane of traffic rather than into the slowest moving lane, we have suffered 11 deaths and 300 Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 6943 accidents in the past eight years. The road needs to be included in the national highway system and upgraded to national highway standards, and Labor promised to do just that in the last federal election campaign. Labor did so because it recognised the clear economic and social benefits of upgrading this road. Specifically those benefits include cutting costs to businesses which use the· road by at least $50 million per annum, therefore stimulating investment, employment, tourism and regional growth; enhancing Australia's export performance, given the volume of exports which use the road; creating 4,500 jobs both in the construction phase and as a result of the efficiencies gained from improving the road; reducing traffic jams; linking Melbourne and Geelong in a more productive and time-certain way to allow goods to be shipped out of the port of Melbourne and the port of Geelong more efficiently; ultimately moving from Avalon airport in more time-efficient manner and, of course, most importantly of all, saving lives and reducing serious accidents. But despite the clear case for upgrading the road to national highway standard, this vital issue seems to be trapped in the swirling and apparently poisonous currents of Liberal Party politics. Out of this noxious brew, my constituents and all of those who use the Geelong road are now being asked to accept an extraordinary proposition. They are being asked to accept half a road at a second-rate standard. First of all, why are we being promised half a road? In the last election campaign, Labor promised that an incoming Victorian Labor government and a Beazley Labor government would jointly fund an upgrade of the Geelong road and that, after the upgrade, the road would become part of the national highway system and thereafter be part of the federal government's responsibility. The Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, always keen when he sees an electoral winner, decided to jump on Labor's bandwagon and promised that his government would put $118.5 million into upgrading the road and would seek the matching $118.5 million from the Howard government in this budget. Indeed, so full of fight was Premier Kennett that on 19 March 1999 he attended a business breakfast in my electorate in Werribee and promised that, if the federal government failed to allocate money to the Geelong road in this budget, he would start a campaign against them and would not give up until the money was allocated. We all know what the state of relations is between Premier Kennett and the Prime Minister and his Treasurer. The Prime Minister has frequently been driven to exasperation by Premier Kennett's tendency to have an opinion on everything but a solution to nothing. Of course no-one in Australian politics would easily forget the scandal that surrounded the colourful terminology used in the Kennett-Peacock telephone call. being invited to. and the Treasurer is also well known and becoming increasingly so as the preselection spats in the seats of Brighton and other places fill the pages of Victoria's newspapers. While Premier Kennett was talking tough about beating up on the federal government and getting the necessary matching funds to upgrade the Geelong road, the minister for transport was busy pointing the finger at Jeff and saying that it was all his fault. Indeed, in the run-up to the budget in a letter to me dated 27 April, the minister for transport said:",147,Representatives Main Committee
227,Mr Sercombe,What was it?,157,Representatives Main Committee
228,Ms Gillard,"It is not terminology one could easily repeat in this place, although I am",157,Representatives Main Committee
229,Mr Sercombe,Give it a go.,157,Representatives Main Committee
230,Ms Gillard,"I would not use words like that. The animosity between Premier Kennett6944 MAIN COMMITIEE Monday, 21 June 1999 Geelong Road and its upgrading is the responsibility of the Victorian government. As you are aware, over the past six years the Commonwealth has provided to Victoria over $500 million in untied funds, previously fonning part of the Commonwealth's road funding program. At any time during this period the Victorian government could have directed these funds to upgrade Geelong Road. What are the electors of Lalor to make of this division in the Liberal Party, with the Premier of Victoria threatening fire and brimstone if federal funds are not made available for the Geelong road and the federal minister apparently saying, 'It is all Victoria's responsibility'? We will never know what role the poor set of personal relationships between Premier Kennett, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer played on the decision making that led up to this budget. We will never know what that poor set of personal and political relationships cost us. But we do know one thing for sure: in this budget not one cent of the $1.6 billion allocated to road funding was allocated to the Geelong road. The fact that there would be no money-despite some press speculation that perhaps the government, in a cynical electioneering sleight of hand, was actually holding back the announcement about the Geelong road until the Victorian election was called-was clearly confirmed by the minister for transport when he answered a question I asked him on the day after the budget. My question was quite comprehensive: it went to the fact that the budget did not allocate any money to the Princes Freeway; it referred to his letter to me dated 27 April, which I have just taken you to; it referred to discussions between the Prime Minister and the Premier on the question; and it asked the minister whether it was his view that the road was solely a state responsibility or whether he would contemplate allocating some federal funds. In answer to this the minister for once chose to actually direct his answer to the question and gave quite a plain answer. He said: The government has no plans to make any announcements in relation to matters that are not included in the budget for this year. If the minister is as good as his word-and I repeat, if the minister is as good as his wordthen, of course, we will not see any federal funding for the Geelong road. One would have thought that, given his complete rebuff by the federal government and his fighting words at the Werribee business breakfast and in other places, the Premier of Victoria would immediately have started his promised campaign of action against the federal government to try to force the money out of them. I am sure there are many ministers who would have been worried about that prospect. But not so. On this occasion 'tiger' Kennett turns into a sleepy pussy cat. On 13 May, two days after the federal budget, the Premier is publicly reported as having told the federal Treasurer and the Prime Minister that he did not require money to be allocated to upgrade the Princes Freeway in this federal budget. So much for the promised campaign. Clearly Premier Kennett tried to get the funds out of the federal government, failed to do so and decided to try to disguise the failure by pretending he never really wanted the money anyway. This is all very interesting in terms of psychology, personal politics and a bit of face saving. But where does it leave my constituency and the users of the Princes Freeway-who are not interested in Premier Kennett's attempt to save face and who believed that he would stand up for Victoria when he came to Werribee and promised to do so? It leaves us in the ridiculous position where, according to Premier Kennett, work will start on the Princes Freeway upgrade-he will spend the $118.5 million that the Victorian government has made available-but when funds runs out half way, work will stop. As completely crazy as it may seem, the federal coalition government and the state coalition government have allowed the stupid backbiting of their own internal party politics to result Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 6945 in a situation where a major and vital infrastructure project in Australia is about to start, with only half of the necessary funds guaranteed. This is where the budget leaves us. This sorry and stupid saga about half a road does not stop there. Not only are we to have only half a road but we are, apparently, to get that half road at a second-rate standard. The Victorian government has approved a plan to allow two service centres and an interchange to be built on the Geelong road near Avalon. The national safety standards-that is, the standards applicable to highways within the national system-demand that the distance between a pair of service centres and an interchange be not less than two kilometres. This allows for an adequate distance where traffic, particularly heavy vehicles accelerating on to the freeway from a service centre, does not interfere with decelerating traffic intending to leave the freeway at the upcoming interchange. This is a clearly logical concept which avoids creating an accident black spot where traffic is trying to both accelerate and decelerate at the same point. In contrast, the standards for rural highways are of a lesser dimension, as one would expect given the lesser volume of traffic that they hold. In that case, the standard for the distance between service centres and an interchange is only one kilometre. Commonsense would tell you that the Geelong road would not be treated as a rural highway, carrying as it does huge volumes of traffic, including commercial traffic servicing, amongst others, the port of Melbourne, the port of Geelong, Avalon airport, Ford, Toyota, the petrochemical industry, the Laverton North industrial estate and a major agricultural precinct. Indeed, common sense would tend to dictate that a road that carries that volume of traffic would be treated as part of the national highway system and would have standards that reflected that. Yet the Victorian government, with a clear lack of common sense-in fact doing something that absolutely defies common sense-has said that in respect of this particular development near Avalon the rural highway standard is good enough. Indeed, on 5 May in the Victorian Legislative Council, the Minister for Roads and Ports, Mr Geoff Craige, who was very keen to be seen with the federal minister for roads at a photo opportunity on the Geelong road-but who has not been so keen to do anything else in respect of the Geelong road-said, when he was asked about this clear safety issue, in a breathtaking display of intelligence, that, 'Even Freddy can see it is not a national highway.' Indeed, Minister, it is not a national highway because currently funds have not been allocated to upgrade the road to national highway standards. It is not a national highway because the Commonwealth government-this coalition government-has refused, yet again, in this budget to allocate the necessary funds to upgrade the road. With due respect to the Victorian minister for roads, my constituents believe it should be a national highway. With due respect to the Premier of Victoria, if he is afraid to campaign on the issue, my constituents are not. With the respect due to the Prime Minister, his Treasurer and to the minister for transport, this budget simply is not good enough. The Geelong road should be upgraded-but not by making it half a road at half a standard. The Geelong road should be upgraded so that it becomes part of the national highway system at national highway system standards. The campaign to achieve this result will continue. Since the budget, the Princes Freeway Action Committee has already erected signs on the Geelong road which say 'Caution-No Federal Road Funds Ahead', a little further along, 'Caution-No Federal Road Funds here either' and, finally, as you come off the freeway, 'Caution-No Federal Road Funds behind 6946 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 you'. It is nice clear language and it makes the point. The point that those large black and yellow signs make to every commuter every time they use the road is that this government, in this budget, failed to allocate the necessary funds to upgrade the road to national highway standards. Perhaps even more graphic than this signage on the road for every commuter to see every time they use it is a display which has been put together by an ordinary Victorian, a Victorian courier, Mr Leo Gleeson, who uses the road every day and who is sick of encountering accidents as a result of the problems with the safety on the road. He has mounted his own unique form of protest by placing a cross near the road for everyone who has died on the road. If that statistic--chilling as it is-increases, he is intending to add a cross for every further death on this road. We also have Robert Mitchelson, who is continuing his campaign for the service centres and the interchange, which I spoke about, to be dealt with at national highway standards rather than at the rural highway standard being proposed by the Victorian government. To these noted campaigns and campaigners, you can add the hundreds-indeed thousandsof Victorian commuters who have signed the petition, who have sent the Prime Minister a note on the issue, or whose cars sport the 'Fix the jam' sticker. None of them will go away until this issue is resolved. Perhaps more importantly, we have regular metropolitan coverage of this issue in the Herald Sun, which itself is campaigning for this road to be dealt with appropriately and as part of the national highway system. In conclusion, I would like to use the words of the Herald Sun in an editorial that it published late last year about the attitude of this minister and this government to the Geelong road. The tragedy is that, even though we have had a budget come and go in the period since this editorial was published, every word of it remains true today. The editorial read: John Anderson must mend his ways-and Victoria's deadliest road-if he wants to win back support from the bush for the Howard Government. By refusing funds to rebuild the Melbourne-Geelong freeway, the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services ignores the fact that this narrow, overcrowded 50km stretch of bitumen has claimed 86 lives in the past eight years. Yet Mr Anderson shows callous indifference towards the families of the dead as well as others injured since 1990 in the 6000 crashes on this section of highway. The minister will not explain why his government refuses to provide the $100 million needed to match a similar contribution the Victorian Government would make to fix our worse killer highway. Instead, the people of Geelong and the commuters of Melbourne's outer westnamely, my constituentshave been told by the minister's official spokesman that the Herald Sun's Fix our Deadly Highway campaign is a 'wonderful beat-up in true tabloid fashion'. Some beat-up, some spokesman, some minister, when 86 people are dead. pleased to bring this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1999-2000 to a conclusion. I have noted that there have been many contributions throughout the course of the several days of debate on this legislation. In fact I am told that 101 speakers have participated in this debate, and that indicates the importance that the parliament places on debate on the national economy and on the management of the national economy by the government. I think it is fair to say that all members expect to see many problems in the Australian community addressed through the appropriation of funds by the Commonwealth, and I indicate that",157,Representatives Main Committee
231,Mr Fahey (Macarthur,"Minister for Finance and Administration) (9.29 p.m.)-I amMonday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMlITEE 6947 perhaps the honourable member for Lalor might fall into that category with her contribution to this debate. Appropriation is a complex process. Roads are a complex process as well. It is simply not a case of saying, 'Let's spend money here, there or anywhere.' It is about ensuring that the spending of public moneys is prioritised correctly and that, where spending occurs, it is within the government's means. We, as a government, have continued to ensure that we do not spend outside our means. That has highlighted and underpinned the administration of the public accounts in the time that the coalition has been in government since 1996. It is also about a government putting together a budget, underpinned by the appropriation bills, which is in accordance with the objectives that the government has set out to achieve, and I would like to touch on those objectives. The 1999-2000 budget builds on our achievements and it addresses our key priorities. Those key priorities are to deliver on our election commitments. I can say that all members of the government were delighted to listen to the Treasurer on election night and to know that, as that budget speech was being delivered and those bills were being tabled, all of those promises put to the Australian people before October of last year were contained, on the first opportunity for such promises to be contained, in a set of bills called the appropriation bills-delivering to the Australian community as promised. The second objective is to promote an economic climate conducive to high levels of sustainable economic and employment growth and to provide a social safety net for those in need. A further priority is to build a modem, fair and efficient taxation system, and the Australian community, heaven knows, needs a modem, a fair and an efficient taxation system. It seems that all Australians acknowledge that, except the Australian Labor Party. Even the Democrats acknowledge that. Another priority is to deliver increased services to rural and regional Australia, and that of course is something which is paramount for the Australian community as a whole. It is a priority for the Liberal Party and the National Party and, as a coalition government, the Liberal and National parties have focused very much on the needs of rural and regional Australia. Lastly, by way of priorities, is the priority of ensuring that government resources are used as effectively and as efficiently as possible. Let me go back to the strong economy. The Labor Party has made much of the social impacts of the budget. Many of those 101 contributions to this debate have continued to address the so-called lack of social impact from those appropriations bills. It seems that Labor continues to take the view that there is a capacity of government to address the social needs. The first role of any government in securing the welfare of its people is to provide sound economic foundations. Far from being mutually exclusive, a government's social and economic goals should support each other. Time and again members will say to you, 'You can afford social policies only when you have the economic side of government in order,' and that is something this government has addressed over its 3Yz years in office. Without those strong economic fundamentals, there can be no guarantee of fulfilling and lasting employment, there can be little hope of security for individuals and families and no stable revenue base to provide the social safety net which all communities demand. These are all reasons why the government acted resolutely to put the budget back into surplus after its election in 1996, why the government moved to put an end to the spiral of 6948 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 deficit and debt left by Labor and not only to bring the budget back into surplus but to keep the budget in surplus. For the third year in a row, the budget will be in surplus, a surplus of more than $5 billion. We have already paid, or repaid, some $24 billion of Labor's debt, and we are now in a position to pay off more debt. In the last four budgets, in net terms, we have not borrowed one single dollar. We are moving steadily towards a debt free Commonwealth, a Commonwealth which was labouring under the burden of some $90 billion of additional debt under the previous Labor government. That was the legacy that Labor left this country in 1996. Sound economic management has protected Australia from the regional economic crisis that many predicted would draw us in. In the face of that regional crisis, our economy continued to grow. In fact, it grew faster than economies in the countries of Europe and faster than economies in the developed world as a whole, even faster than the economy of the USA. And unemployment fell; in the past year 180,000 new jobs were created. The restoration of the fiscal position, along with the government's success in lowering inflation, has provided an environment for the lowest housing interest rates in almost 30 years, and unemployment-which we will acknowledge is still too high-has fallen to its lowest level since the start of the decade. Just as the economic reform of three years ago gave us the strength to ride out the challenges of the last year, the reforms of today will determine how we ride out the challenges of tomorrow. If we want growth, if we want the living standards and jobs in the next decade, we must rise to the challenges of today. The reform of the Australian taxation system is our greatest reform challenge. I will touch on that taxation system, which has been the subject of much debate in the course of dealing with these bills. For Australia's sake we put forward a plan to reform the current outmoded, outdated, complex and unfair taxation system which is holding Australia back. Anyone who is.serious about welfare reform must also be serious about taxation reform. Without a fair and sustainable tax system, the long-term viability of the social safety net must always remain in doubt. Without a broadly based goods and services tax, there can be no guarantee of a secure revenue base for the Australian states and territories to provide the schools, the hospitals, the roads-even, for that matter, roads such as the Geelong road. Without a broad based tax, there can be no guarantee of any roads-or the police. We all know that those things are the needs of the Australian community. Without a broadly based goods and services tax, you cannot abolish 10 unfair taxes including the unfair tax 'bed tax' in the state of New South Wales. You cannot cut personal income taxes. You cannot catch more than the $3 billion that is estimated to be in the black economy, and you cannot reduce the tax on health, education, child care and charitable institutions. The Australian Democrats have recognised this. They have demonstrated a commitment to the national interest by sitting down with the government and working out a way to deliver reform that is in the national interest. Sadly, that once great party, the Australian Labor Party, has vacated centre stage. They have taken a one-way ticket to policy oblivion, and it is has been left to the Democrats to occupy that centre stage in the national interest. This plan will deliver great economic benefits to Australia. What it will deliver is that 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be on the top marginal rate of 30 cents in the dollar, and we will be reducing business costs by about $IOYz billion per year. This tax plan will guarantee that no states will be worse off during the transitional period. Further, it guarantees that, after Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 6949 the transitional period, the revenue gains to the states will be such that they will be much better off than if the existing arrangements continue. There are many in this chamber who formerly had a state background and who would know only too well the difficulties that the states faced with the Premiers Conference year after year, wondering what the take would be after the trip to Canberra and knowing always that there was no certainty about whether there would be growth in the revenue of the states, because the Commonwealth had the first say, the Commonwealth had total say, and the states were at the mercy of the Commonwealth when it came to that return of the Australian people's taxes. That will cease. That will cease because there is growth built into the new tax plan, and in the end we are going to have a much better tax system. Let me touch briefly on rural and regional Australia. As I indicated earlier, we are strongly committed to rural and regional Australia and we have delivered a number of important initiatives in this budget. They include a series of measures to improve rural health services in the short and the long term, measures to ensure that students from rural and regional areas have much better access to education, and measures to defeat the distances that make it hard for rural and regional Australia to access government and community services, through the establishment of the regional transaction centres. In the area of education we will spend some $4.8 billion on primary and secondary school children in government and non-government schools. We are committed to the provision of choice in education, again for the benefit of all Australians. And whilst many speakers have addressed this issue, I have noted with some interest that there has been some conjecture about the contribution to non-government schools. The contribution which the government stands firmly behind and is very proud of will bring an additional $553 million over five years to the Catholic systemic schools, and that implements once again an election commitment made last October. This decision came out of an independent assessment of the needs of the system which was conducted by the Non-Government Schools Funding Review Committee. The budget announced a new formula for distributing recurrent funding to non-government schools based on the needs of the parents and taking into account the resources of the community that a school serves. In 200 I, non-government schools will be funded according to a measure of the socioeconomic status, known as the SES, of their school communities. The new funding arrangements replace a system that was widely seen as unfair. It was complex. and it was inadequate as a measure of need. We are going to have a much better and a fairer education funding system. Government schools have not been neglected. In the five years ahead an additional $1 billion has been provided for government schools. I referred in the priorities of government to effective and efficient government and the need to ensure that all that a government does achieves those objectives. Our public finances are reported and presented on a world class basis. Our Charter of Budget Honesty is now advocated internationally as a model for other countries. This budget represents a major shift in the way the federal government budgets for and manages its resources because for the first time the Commonwealth based its budget on outcomes and outputs and accrual accounting principles. But this entails much more than a technical change in accounting policies. The new framework puts outcomes and outputs-that is, results and deliverables-at the centre of how agencies plan, how they budget, how they 6950 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 manage and how they report. It marks a strategic and more business like approach and it incorporates standard financial statements with a strong emphasis on results. After all, surely that is what it is about. It is about outcomes, it is not about process. Traditional cash budgeting makes it difficult to assess the financial position of agencies or to compare performance from one financial year to another. It simply does not promote best practice management by agencies or true accountability. Accrual budgeting is recognised internationally as a more accurate tool. It is based on full costs as they are incurred. It changes both how and what is measured for budgeting, for accounting, and for reporting purposes. All in all, it means government having a better handle on knowing precisely how much it costs agencies to do business. The critical element is changing the performance focus to budgeting, managing and reporting on the outputs and the full costs required to achieve the outcomes that the government wants. The object is clarity: it is clear accountability; consistently applied and clear performance measures; realistic goods and services, planned and delivered; and, ultimately, the financial results that are achieved. The result is more transparent, and more transparent government is in fact something all of us would seek to achieve. The move makes Australia a world leader in government budgeting practices and positions Australia at the forefront of the international community for public sector resource management. The Labor Party has suggested that the move to accrual budgeting is an important change, but not important enough to mark as a major achievement of this budget. In one sense, and one sense only, this is true. Accrual budgeting is a tool to achieve the real end of an efficient and effective public sector, one that achieves the outcomes government wants, at the lowest possible cost. This allows the government to direct its resources to the areas of highest needs. The strong economic foundations which we have built, and continue to build upon, are the best guarantee of employment growth, security for individuals and families, and a stable revenue base to provide that social safety net I referred to earlier that the community demands.

Mr O'CONNOR (Corio) (9.49 p.m.)-I welcome the opportunity in this consideration in detail stage to make some more detailed comments on the appropriations which comprise the government's outlays in the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio area. I propose to engage this debate on two levels. One is to comment on the fundamental assumptions which underlie the outlays which have been made in this portfolio area and, indeed, the government's overall budget strategy; and then to make some more specific comments on some of the programs that have been funded in this particular portfolio area. I was very interested in the comments of the Minister for Finance and Administration who preceded me in the general debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1999-2000. He made some comment on the broad objectives that the government is pursuing in this budget strategy, and I presume those objectives relate in some way to the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry portfolio. The first objective he stated was that the government was delivering on its election commitments. I am sure that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will get up and tell the House just how wonderful the government has been in addressing some of the promises that it made in the context of election campaigns. But I say, 'About time.' You spent three years driving the boot into the bush. You spent the last three years stripping away the services to rural and regional Australia. We would expect you, in this budget, at least",164,Representatives Main Committee
234,Mr Deputy Speaker,"Is it the wish of the Main Committee to consider the items of6952 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 with the $5.5 billion surplus, to start addressing some of the damage that you caused in the previous three budgets that you brought down. It was a comprehensive betrayal. What the government has attempted to do in this budget after it has stripped the homestead bare over three years is to refurbish the one room bungalow out the back. If you think that is really going to restore your credibility in rural and regional Australia, you have another think coming because I am going to reflect, in the context of this debate, on some of the programs that you are funding and what the rural sector has said about them. The finance minister commented on the importance of developing a sustainable economic climate for growth and employment. We are happy to engage you on that particular debate. We left you with an inflation rate of less than two per cent and a growth rate in excess of four per cent. I do not know why the minister for agriculture here acquiesced to a Liberal lawyer who masquerades as an economic expert, why a member of the National Party would roll over year after year after year to drive the economy backwards so that it can go forwards. It is back to the future so that we can progress. That is what we had in the three years preceding this particular budget. One of the objectives of a finance minister is to build a modem, fair and efficient taxation system. If you think the package that you have delivered with the Democrats is really going to be accepted in the bush by those farm businesses that you are going to now heap on millions of dollars worth of compliance costs, and if you think that is going to restore some credibility out there in the bush, I think you are really barking up another tree. The king of all statements was what the finance minister said this budget was about: increasing the level of services to rural and regional Australia. As I said, you spent three years stripping the rural sector bare of those services, so we would hope that, in one of your budgets in four years, you might address some of the damage that you have done. It is interesting that the finance minister talks about bringing the budget back into surplus and the importance of wiping out deficits and running budget surpluses. We agree with you on that. We do not have a problem with that because we think the rural sector needs, consistently over time, a secure fundamental macro-economic framework in which it can develop and grow. The minister for agriculture is smiling away and he is going to trumpet the achievements of the government which, in effect, were the achievements of Labor in government that he is now attempting to claim as his own. (Extension of time granted) I found these comments about the surplus quite extraordinary. In the postwar era, we had 22 years of Liberal deficits and Liberal debt. In the Fraser years, when the current Prime Minister had control of the treasury bench, we had another seven years of Liberal coalition deficits. So we know a bit about deficits. We know about coalition deficits because we had something like 29 years in our post World War II experience of coalition deficits. We had the onerous task of bringing the Commonwealth budget back into surplus, which we did on four occasions. The former minister for agriculture grins away. Four Labor surpluses, 29 years of coalition deficit-I think there is a bit of an imbalance there. We would expect you to run a surplus. We would expect you to emulate what we gave you-growth, a high-growth economy, a low-inflation economy and, of course, budget surpluses. I have got to say to the minister that we welcome the fact that we have flushed out of the system the 29 years of coalition deficits and that you have now joined us in producing budget surpluses. We are happy to do that. But, of course, I find it quite extraordinary that the finance minister said, and I think I got the quote correct: Monday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 6953 ... the reforms of today will determine how we ride out the challenges of tomorrow. That is a very good quote because that is what we did in 13 years when we had to reform the Australian economy and Australia's agricultural sector to put it on a sound financial footing so that it could weather the economic crisis that the finance minister referred to. We had to massively restructure our industrial base. Labor engaged in the most comprehensive program of micro-economic reform that this country has ever seen. We developed a true export culture in our manufacturing and agricultural industries. We reformed the finance system. Labor engaged in skill development, infrastructure development and investment development as contained in the programs of One Nation, Working Nation and Investing in the Nation, and indeed the reforms over those 13 years positioned Australia to ride out the challenges that the finance minister referred to in the debate today. An important feature of this consideration in detail stage is the opportunity that it presents to reflect on the government's budget in the cool light of day and against the backdrop of some of the comments by those affected in the government's announced decisions. The role of the opposition is certainly not a spoiling role. We are not here to disagree with every initiative mounted by the government in the budget context. Indeed, .it would be strange if a government of any particular persuasion were to go through the budget process, with the enormous creative resources of an expert department at their disposal, and not come up with worthwhile initiatives. I do not propose here tonight to take issue with all elements of the government's rural budget. There are some initiatives in there that we as an opposition would support. Indeed we might take the view that the government has perhaps not gone far enough in its funding allocation to meet the particular problems facing the rural sector at this point of time. The $30 million over five years to rehabilitate the Great Artesian Basin is one initiative we would support. The $4.2 million national ovine Johne's disease control program is another. The $15.8 million over four years to increase patrols in our sub-Antarctic waters to protect our fisheries is another expenditure that we would support. From the opposition's point of view, we question some of the fundamental assumptions on which this budget and many of the programs targeted at the rural sector are indeed based. We have to appreciate the political context in which this budget was brought down. It was brought down against the backdrop of three years in which the coalition has taken a real belting out in rural and regional Australia. We take the view that this inot the real budget and, as I have said, we have questioned its underlying assumptions and its lack of vision. (Extension of time granted) I would like to make some quotes about the fundamental assumptions that the government has based its rural budget on and indeed about its lack of vision. In relation to the underlyingr assumptions, in The Land, Peter Austin had an article headlined 'How thin is budget ice' and he had this to say about it: The real worry in the budget is the extent to which outcomes rely on factors well beyond the government's control-and I don't simply refer to the sale of the rest of Telstra.... The thing underpinning our projected high levels of growth is consumer spending, which could fall in a hole overnight ... a consumer spending boom is no way to sustain an economy, especially when so much of the wealth is derived from unproductive activity .... Like Simon Crean, I wonder why the government is so keen to ditch a tax system that has so far succeeded in keeping Australia on the path of low inflation and strong growth during a period of regional turmoil in favour of something untried and problem fraught. 6954 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 Those are not our concerns that are raised; those are the concerns of rural commentators. I go to a quote by an Alectown farmer, Peter Unger, in The Land of 13 May, where he refers to one of the fundamental assumptions on which the government's revenue projections are based. He had this to say: I expected better of Peter Costello and Tim Fischer. [... ] Tim Fischer-supposedly battling for the rural sector-is out again for another 'duck' ... selling Telstra to achieve its budget surplus-it's just creative accounting. I could just as easily thrill my bank manager by selling the front paddock ... In effect, what we are doing here is selling a future revenue stream from an institution and an economic enterprise that farmers already own. They already own it; they already have a share in it, and you want to sell it to foreigners. That is how they perceive it out there in the bush and they are right on to you guys-the National Party-in rural Australia. If there is one element of the betrayal or one broken promise that will be a millstone around your neck-and we will make sure it is-it is the sale of Telstra. You promised you would not sell it and then you said you would not run it down. been pleased to see me, but nonetheless he will still direct his remarks through the chair, or he will be less pleased. Mr O'CONNOR-I will do that; I am humbled before your ruling. IfI might just comment on the lack of vision in the budget, I think there are some very telling quotes that I can read to this House about what the farm sector had to say about the budget's lack of vision. The United Graziers Association of Queensland stated: ... the budget was fiscally responsible but innocuous and neutral, lacking in initiatives to spark wealth creation for the nation in the longer term. They were referring there to one of the great wealth creating sectors of this nation-the agricultural sector. The UGA President, Noel Kennedy, had this to say in the discussions that I had with him: A debt free Australia was a noble aim but he would have preferred to see the $S.2B surplus put into infrastructure development. The Queensland Farmers Federation said that the budget contained some useful and welcome measures-we agree with that; we do not have a problem with that-but 'lacked a clear and coherent vision for the rural sector'. Here are farming groups saying of the government-after three years with their hands on the tiller, having stripped rural and regional Australia bare and driven the boot into the bush-' All they can come up with is a budget that lacks vision.' I would like to address in my concluding remarks the issue of services and the equity of access for rural people to services. The NFF has been quite critical of the previous budgets of the government in this respect. Ian Donges, the NFF President, in a press release of 11 May, stated: The NFF remains concerned that the Government's spending proposals will not sufficiently redress the inequities between city and country Australians. The NFF is disappointed in the reduction in funding for Co-operative Research Centres, which have the capacity to contribute enormously to providing Australia with the scientific edge. . . .. there is a long way to go before rural and regional Australians will feel they're getting the same level of services as those who live in the cities.",165,Representatives Main Committee
235,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Order! The honourable member for Corio might haveMonday, 21 June 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 6955 It is a very neutral comment which really sums up the attitude of many rural and .regional Australians who are disappointed with the government's performance in this budget. There are specifics of the budget that I would like.to deal with, but I think I am going to run out of time. We certainly have some serious questions about elements of the budget: the departmental cutbacks, the initiatives in biotechnology, Supermarket to Asia and the educational initiatives. (Time expired) forestry in the 1999 budget is a one-off allocation of $5.8 million to complete the eight remaining regional forest agreements. Of this figure, $4 million goes to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and $1.8 million to the Department of the Environment and Heritage. As Labor initiated the RFA process and remains strongly committed to it, we agree that adequate· funding must be provided to allow the necessary economic, social and environmental assessments to be completed by the December guideline. This does not mean, of course, that we agree with the approach being taken by the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. In his home state of Western Australia, we see clear signs that the RFA he signed last month is already unravelling in a massive way. In the last week, we have seen a National Party MP cross the floor in the state parliament on the issue. The state director of the Western Australian National Party, a close friend of those opposite, has warned of dire electoral consequences. It is indicated in today's West Australian that there is a strong push from within the coalition with five Liberal Party backbenchers pressing for a review of which forest blocks are to be protected in the reserve system. As noted in my media release earlier today, the Western Australian RFA can hardly be seen as a secure 20-year agreement for the future when the state's Deputy Premier and leader of the National Party publicly talks about possible changes only a month after it was signed. These developments reinforce my view that the ham-fisted approach taken by Minister Tuckey will ultimately prove to be counterproductive for the very industry groups that he purports to be protecting. The budget also continues funding for two other of Labor's forest initiatives: the Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Program-FISAP; and the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy-WAPIS. I will briefly touch on each of these vital programs. Labor introduced the FISAP program in 1995 to help the native forest industry adjust t() the requirements of Labor's national forest policy statement of 1992. It was always clear that this statement would lead to significant reductions of timber harvesting to more sustainable levels and to a significant expansion in the size of the reserve system for old-growth forest. . All of the early, misleading rhetoric from the current federal minister-later discounted and dismissed by the Western Australian state government-that there would be no job losses is exactly what that program was aimed at. Labor allocated $107 million of Commonwealth funds over five years to FISAP and secured significant matching funding from the New South Wales state Labor government. Despite the government's rhetoric about looking after timber workers, one of the first things the current coalition government did after the 1996 election was to cut $6 million from FISAP. More recently, in November last year, the minister unilaterally suspended FISAP funding to New South Wales in a clear attempt to stand over the Carr government. The irony of this move is that, of the states, New South Wales alone has contributed significant amounts of state funding to FISAP. According to the Commonwealth's own figures, as of last February, New South Wales has provided $15 million. No other state",168,Representatives Main Committee
236,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (10.05 P.m.),"The sole new funding allocation for6956 MAIN COMMITTEE Monday, 21 June 1999 has provided a single cent to FISAP, yet New South Wales is the only state whose funding has been suspended. Now that the New South Wales election is over, and with the coalition, predictably, suffering a devastating loss, it is clearly time for the Commonwealth to restore FISAP funding. In recent Senate estimates hearings, Commonwealth officials said that negotiations about this were continuing but refused to promise that New South Wales would have its original allocation completely restored. I invite the minister to stop using timber workers as the meat in the sandwich in Commonwealth-state negotiations and restore FISAP funding to New South Wales without further delay. The coalition's approach to Labor's Wood and Paper Industry Strategy has been equally deplorable and lacking. Indeed, one of the first decisions it made was to abolish the expert Wood and Paper Industry Council that was supposed to drive strategy. Such an industry council obviously did not fit comfortably with the anti-interventionist approach of its key economic ministers. It is all right for Minister Tuckey to say that he is a good bloke and a friend of the CFMEU, but he really cannot get past Prime Minister Howard because Prime Minister Howard is so strongly against this kind of industry policy. In place of the council the former industry minister set up-but not until 18 months had passed-a Wood and Paper Industry Forum, which has met twice. This great industry council, which is going to drive industry policy, has met twice in the period of the coalition government. The lack of seriousness with which the coalition approaches the industry strategy is demonstrated by this fact. (Extension of time granted) It is little wonder that the current minister, having essentially dismissed the performance of Minister Moore and his other predecessors in this policy field, has taken to reconvening a series of meetings with industry stakeholders to develop what he calls 'an action agenda' for the timber industry? This is something that the opposition will be paying close attention to. So far the minister has been strong on rhetoric and short on action. He has refused to commit the government to re-establish the Wood and Paper Industry Council, telling the union that if he is forced with a gun at his head to adopt this council he will, because he really cannot get it across to Prime Minister Howard that it is a good idea; he is really a nice guy, a friend of the union, but Prime Minister Howard is stopping this type of policy direction. Let us say to the minister: your rhetoric might be more attuned than your predecessor's to the need for an industry policy, but we will be watching for outcomes-whether you will re-establish the Wood and Paper Industry Council and give it sufficient resources to do its job; what your promised action agenda provides for in terms of specific industry development and research measures; and, most of all, how much in funding the Commonwealth will provide with a strategy for the three to five financial years after the budget we are currently discussing. All of these questions must of course be viewed in the context of the manner in which the government, soon after its election, attacked the Wood and Paper Industry Council, attacked where all the stakeholders were involved in a very real sense.
