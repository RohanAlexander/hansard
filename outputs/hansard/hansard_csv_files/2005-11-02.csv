Wednesday, 2 November 2005 ----Reconciliation Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (9.31 am)-From time to time. I have found myself dismayed at the way that this government has changed national debate in this country and has set the national agenda. At one time. I was inspired by actions such as Keating’s speech at Redfern on reconciliation, the massive reconciliation walks that took place in this country or a host of other events-of popular mainstream bands such as Midnight Oil, for example, singing songs on reconciliation, a movement that was important to Australians and to Australia. I believe that that movement still is important to Australia, and I think it is shameful the way that this government has let it drop off the national agenda. In thinking of this, I was, however, pleased when a couple of weeks ago I took the opportunity to visit Goodwood Primary School. Its students, teachers and community all contributed to launch a dreaming garden. This stands as a monument of appreciation of the depth and diversity of Aboriginal culture and of our appreciation for it. The dreaming garden, as its name suggests, mixes ideas from Aboriginal dreaming stories and traditional patterns with native flora and fauna. Before beginning the project the students of the school worked with Paul Dickson, an Aboriginal instructor who worked closely with the students and taught them about local Aboriginal culture and Aboriginal designs and shared many significant Dreamtime stories. With their newly learned knowledge of Aboriginal culture, the students set about creating the garden and placed several poles which were painted with designs and colours that related to Kaurna culture and stories. The garden now serves as a living monument for the primary school to the Kaurna people, the original inhabitants of the Adelaide plains. To celebrate the opening of the garden, the ceremony included traditional Kaurna dancers and the lighting of a traditional fire. The dreaming garden and the ceremony of its opening moved me deeply, most importantly because it also reminded me that the compassion and the will to work towards reconciliation is still alive in our communities today, in spite of the fact that the Howard government has completely turned its back on this issue. I would like to congratulate the staff and students of the school. I would also like to note that the state minister, Stephanie Key, was in attendance, as was the Unley city council mayor, Mr Michael Keenan, who I believe contributed to funding the project, along with his council. I would like to congratulate all of the students, who are now in years 5 and 6, who built the garden but also remind them that, whilst they will enjoy the garden, the garden will be enjoyed by future students, families and teachers at Goodwood Primary School long after they have graduated, for many years to come. I must commend all involved and congratulate them on such a beautiful gesture. (Time expired) Travel Insurance Urquhart, who is the Consul-General in New Caledonia.

321,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.34 Am),"Last week I was privileged to meet with Ms Janethe Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands in 2002. She is a very highly experienced diplomat. I must say, as I meet Australia’s diplomats overseas, I never fail to be impressed with the quality of the people who represent us in other parts of the world. She alerted me to something which I would like to alert the parliament to. It was particularly in relation to a constituent of my electorate who had taken a cruise to New Caledonia. That person had taken a cruise without taking travel insurance. The person felt quite safe and did not see any need for travel insurance until they found themselves with a heart attack in Noumea, ending up in the Noumea hospital, having to be medivaced back to Australia and having to pay a bill of $40,000. My strong recommendation to the parliament, but also to the people of Australia, is: when you travel, travel with travel insurance. There are many reasons why you might need travel insurance. Hospitalisations are unexpected. People do not expect, in the main, to get sick, and they do not expect to get sick in the most tragic of ways. Indeed, 600 Australians die overseas every year, and their families have to make arrangements to get them back to Australia. If they do not have travel insurance, the families may end up having to sell their family assets, their homes, just to get their loved ones back to Australia. There is a very celebrated case of a young Australian surfer who went to the United States for a surfing competition. He chose the wrong wave during a practice session. The wave dumped him on a reef, and he sustained serious injuries. He was flown to the local hospital and underwent two major operations, and the hospital bill was $A290,000. That is a very powerful case for having travel insurance. Of course, tourists and travellers can also suffer other than from illness. They can suffer theft, robbery, assault and those sorts of things. I think that it is wrong to travel overseas without providing for the unexpected. My strong message to all Australians is: when you go overseas, take your travel insurance with you. Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program Ms CORCORAN (Isaacs) (9.37 am)-In September this year, I had the privilege of hosting Lieutenant Commander Timothy Bolitho in my office for a week. The reasons for doing this will become obvious in a moment, but suffice it to say that one of Tim’s jobs was to write a speech for me to deliver in parliament. What follows now is the speech that Tim wrote, as he wrote it. He chose to write it as though I was speaking, so the pronoun ‘I’ refers to me. The Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program is an ongoing opportunity for members and senators to experience first-hand the work of our hard working defence forces and for officers of the three services to experience the inner workings of federal parliament. I have now participated in both sides of the program. In July 2003, I spent a week on patrol in the Top End with NORFORCE. Throughout my time with the Army, I was impressed with the level of professionalism and pleased with the willingness of the personnel I worked with to accept my presence and to involve me as part of their team. In September I had the opportunity to experience the other side of the program, with Royal Australian Navy officer Lieutenant Commander Timothy Bolitho serving in my office for a week. It has been a valuable experience for both of us-for Lieutenant Commander Bolitho to experience a vastly different environment from his normal workplace and for me to see how MAIN COMMITTEE capable and adaptable our military officers are. It may be of interest to the House to hear Tim’s thoughts on his time here, so here are his words: The week that I have spent in the Parliament has been an extraordinary experience. Despite the short period of exchange I have had the opportunity to meet a broad range of people, from ministers to staff of the Department of Parliamentary Services, who ensure that the whole organisation functions. So often when discussing matters of government money is used as a measure of the importance of a problem or how it is being handled, but my overwhelming impression is that the currency of the parliament is time. There is so much to do and so little time available that every moment is precious, as evidenced by the more than 2500 clocks adorning the building. It is with this in mind that I wish to thank the elected representatives and the departmental staff who have given so much of their valuable time to the officers in this programme. Everyone that I have had contact with during the week has been more than willing to assist and I leave here with a much fuller understanding of the process and a firm impression is of professionalism at all levels and on both sides of politics. As a serving officer and a constituent I leave the parliament with a sense that the business of the nation is in safe hands and that this truly is a house of the people of Australia. That is the speech that Tim wrote for me as part of his job. It was a tremendous experience having Tim in my office, and I hope he enjoyed his experience in parliament as much as I enjoyed my time in NORFORCE. I should make the point that I made Tim come with me at all times. He had to be in the gallery for every single question time. If there was a division, he was in the gallery. If we had a late night sitting, he had to stay late. But he still walked away, having enjoyed his experience. (Time expired) La Trobe Electorate: Hands on for Habitat Awards am thrilled to say that the Basin Primary School in my electorate of La Trobe has won the Victorian upper division in the Hands on for Habitat awards. Basically, they are the best upper primary school in the state, and I congratulate them for that. The Hands on for Habitat awards program was created to raise awareness of threatened species and is run in the lead-up to National Threatened Species Day, which was on 7 September. The program is a partnership between the Australian government and Cadbury Yowie. It is designed to encourage primary students to learn how they can help to protect our unique animals and plants. The awards encourage sixto 12-year-olds to participate in activities to protect these native Australian animals and plants. By doing so, these students increase their environmental awareness and are prompted to take action to protect animals and plants that need our help. The learning outcomes for the students involved in this program included gaining an understanding of what a habitat is, understanding the relationship between different species and habitats, identifying elements of different habitats and how these are interrelated, finding out what a threatened species is, understanding how their own actions affect their environments in both a positive and negative way, finding ways to help protect threatened species and their habitats, and identifying practical ways that they can work with groups in their local communities to protect threatened species.

I wish to pass on my sincere thanks to the school for the day we had out there. It was fantastic. (Time expired) Mr William Evan Allan ANZAC Cove passing of Australia’s last World WarI veteran who saw active service. William Evan Allanor ‘Darby’, as he was known-passed away a few days ago at the age of 106. When we look back at the tremendous effort that this country put in at the time of World War I, this is probably an appropriate time to remember some of the figures involved. More than 400,000 Australians enlisted to serve in World War I. Of those, 330,770 saw service overseas. Australia’s sole remaining World WarI serviceman is wireless operator John Campbell Ross, who is 106, of Bendigo in Victoria. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in February 1918, but the war ended before he saw active service. Australia’s last surviving veteran from the fighting on France’s Western Front, Peter Casserly, died in Perth in June aged 107. What we are seeing is the passing of an era. ‘Darby’ Allan led a very interesting life and served in both world wars. In World WarI he had been a junior rating, serving on HMAS Encounter and later seeing the surrender of the German fleet. In 1918 he survived when the Spanish flu kills dozens of his crewmates and, in 1928, he was washed overboard from HMAS Australia into the Atlantic. In 1945 he was posted back to the Australia, but it sailed early; the officer doing his job had been killed in a kamikaze attack. ‘Darby’ Allan obviously had a fair bit of luck to have lasted as long as he did doing the things that he did. His life was obviously a colourful turn over a century. I was very pleased to be able to represent the opposition, with the deputy leader, at his funeral at HMAS Cerberus just the other day. It was a state funeral that I am sure ‘Darby’ Allan would have been proud of. It was a dignified occasion where the pomp and ceremony and a sense of significance were clear for all to see. It has been a long time since I have been down at Cerberus. The last time. I was there I was playing soccer, about 20-plus years ago. I note that the member for Flinders is present here today. I have to say that it looked a picture and I was certainly proud to be there on that occasion and to think a bit about the struggles that that generation went through at a time which was a real test of our nation in its early days of the Empire. I turn quickly to the recent sojourn into politics in this area by the member for Hughes with respect to a proposal for a theme park regarding ANZAC Cove. I do not question the member for Hughes in respect of her intentions-I am sure they are honourable-but they were certainly completely and utterly misguided. The proposal has been roundly condemned-it MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Statements By Members

(Time expired) Stony Point Railway Line Heritage) (9.46 am)-I wish to bring before the House a series of concerns I have in relation to security and inadequate resources for our fine police in the Hastings and Somerville area. The security question arises in relation to the Stony Point railway service. The conductors and the people who serve the Stony Point railway service do a tremendous job, let me be absolutely clear about that. But they, as are the local police, are not adequately resourced and they are not given sufficient backup. The result is that they are under threat and the local residents and local train travellers are under threat. The most recent evidence I have on this is in relation to an inquiry and an approach made to me by a constituent who has asked to remain anonymous. She is a woman who recently had a terrible experience on the Stony Point railway line. The evidence she presented to me was that she was travelling on the 4.10 pm service from Frankston to Hastings and was approached by two drunken men in their late 20s. They were abusive and bullying and threatened the patron and schoolchildren. They told all the passengers that they would ‘punch their lights out’ but in worse language than that. They leaned close to the constituent in question and made an accusation in a sneering and snarling way, saying, ‘You look like my mum,’ and then used extremely offensive language. This is something which affects ordinary people going about their ordinary day-to-day business. They were not in a position to be protected and certainly not in a position to counter these aggressive folk. The conductor was in fear of his safety, I am informed. As a consequence, there is a failure by the state to provide adequate and safe public service on the Stony Point line, and this example is a very important one. It is a failure of a basic responsibility by the state. The state member, Rosy Buchanan, has been informed, and I am not aware of any activity which has been undertaken. It is indicative of two broader problems. The first is that there is a clear failure to provide adequate police resources at Hastings police station. I know from discussions with people involved at the police station that many folk who are rostered there have been placed on assigned duty elsewhere, so technically they are on the books but, in reality, they are not there. The police do an outstanding, incredible job but they are not given the resources. This leads to the second point: we need a fully manned, fully staffed police station at Somerville in addition to full resources at Hastings. Only then will the people of Hastings and Somerville be fully protected. (Time expired) Workplace Relations Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (9.49 am)-Today there is only one country in the Western world where a worker can be locked up for six months for failing to cooperate with a government interrogator and thrown in jail for refusing to dob in a mate. These powers have been described by the Federal Court as: … foreign to the workplace relations of civilised societies, as distinct from undemocratic and authoritarian [regimes]. MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Statements By Members
324,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andBut sadly they are powers that exist in Australia courtesy of the extreme industrial relations agenda of the Howard government. The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill, for the first time in Australia’s history, creates a government agency to police workers and encroach on Australians’ basic civil rights. This agency, the Australian Building and Construction Commission-or the ABCC-has the role of policing construction workers and their unions. The commission possesses coercive, police-like powers, with more than 150 investigators and a $20 million budget. If we were ever on the brink of becoming a police state, this is a sure sign of things to come. On building sites across Australia, the commission’s investigators will be found spying on workers as they attempt to micromanage on-site relationships between workers and their employers. This conflict driven, litigious approach is indicative of the Howard government’s arrogant approach to workplace relations. Today the government is trying to introduce its long-awaited Work Choices industrial relations reforms in the House. The legislation is being introduced, as we are seeing, by the subversion of House standing orders. If workers of Australia need any example of the government’s agenda in action, they need look no further than the ABCC and the government’s own disregard and contempt for due process. The Howard government has given the commission coercive powers to force construction workers to answer questions or hand over documentsand the powers do not stop there. A worker who engages in now unlawful industrial action faces fines of up to $22,000, and unions who encourage industrial action can be fined up to $110,000. Even a stop-work meeting can be deemed unlawful by the commission, as could the simple act of workers getting together to discuss pay and conditions. This is an extreme government with an extreme industrial relations agenda, an agenda that seeks to erode the basic democratic rights of working Australians. But the CFMEU and other unions will not be legislated out of existence. As workers begin to feel the pain of the government’s IR agenda as it impacts on their weekly pay packets and working conditions, so too will this government feel the wrath of the workers at the next election. TodayI want to convey to this House the anger of many of my constituents who are members of the CFMEU, and their determination, alongside that of the union movement, to fight against this government’s attack on their workplace and their working conditions.

Particularly in the past, we have identified opportunities for the Commonwealth government, through this Howard government initiative, to support the community policing effort and the efforts of Neighbourhood Watch groups and also local traders in improving the safety, well-being and appeal of the communities where we live. I am particularly pleased that the Mornington community has joined forces to make an application under this program with a view to installing closed-circuit TV cameras in the vicinity of popular nightclub hotspots in Main Street in Mornington.

SinceI announced that we are putting effort into that application, I have been contacted by many Main Street traders welcoming the possibility of these cameras. It has also highlighted just how stretched police resources are on the Mornington Peninsula. This is a growing population with quite diverse policing needs. As my friend and colleague the member for La Trobe, a former policeman himself, would know, during the summer months there is a mass influx of people to the region who are often involved in community activities that may draw attention to themselves and may involve policing at some point. The hunger for initiatives like the National Community Crime Prevention Program underlines how stretched the local policing resources are. Residents in Mornington East have contacted me, highlighting a disturbing and continuing trend of vandalism in the area. Smashed letterboxes are, sadly, a familiar sight. I am exploring the possibility of a Neighbourhood Watch presence in the area-again, another tool to help ease the burden on our local police. Previously I have spoken in this House about my efforts to attract another patrol car to the area. During off-peak times there are as few as two patrol cars covering the entire FrankstonMornington Peninsula region, a population of over quarter of a million. We have been given the run-around by the state police minister’s office and the Office of the Chief Commissioner of Police on that, but I can assure the electorate of Dunkley that I will continue to push for the resources to make sure policing has the tools that are needed to support our local community. There have been increases in police numbers, but police need the tools to function. Just recently the Hastings police station had to be closed because there were no relief police available. Fewer and fewer officers are having to cover more and more shifts, adding to the wear and tear on those individuals and causing the station to close. I call on the state government to provide the tools that are necessary to support vital local policing. (Time expired) Woodcroft Festival lot of pleasure and certainly a great deal of pride.

The measures in this bill were foreshadowed in the government’s white paper of June 2004, titled Securing Australia’s energy future. The energy white paper set expectations low, and with this legislation the government has met those low expectations. While this approach is disappointing, it is not surprising. After all, this bill comes from the same group of government ministers and their conservative supporters who reject the Kyoto protocol-a multinational and operational protocol with 155 countries committed to it. They have criticised the Kyoto protocol whilst praising the Asia-Pacific climate pact, which is positive but limited. It is consistent with other multilateral and bilateral agreements under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, but it does not have targets, it does not have funding allocation and it does not have a market mechanism to drive change. I note the first meeting of the climate pact, which was due to be held later this month, has been postponed until next year. I am very concerned at this bill’s lack of support or vision for alternative fuel and renewable energy industries. After all, getting serious about Australia’s fuel self-sufficiency should be a pretty high priority for the government in the current circumstances. Two weeks ago, on 19 October, Labor’s leader, Kim Beazley, laid out his third blueprint statement, focused on Australia’s fuel and energy needs. The blueprint makes it clear that Labor supports Australian fuel self-sufficiency and supports Australia participating in the emerging international emissions trading market. Labor’s view is that by ratifying Kyoto and adopting emission reduction targets Australia will adapt more quickly to protect ourselves against the risks of climate change. We will also avoid the escalating costs of adapting our economy years from now. We should be doing much more in these renewable energy sources-it is the reason why Labor supports increasing the MRET. The Howard government should follow the lead of state Labor governments in providing a government fleet market for ethanol blends to set an example and help grow the biofuels market. The government should do more to develop Australia’s vast gas reserves and to convert them into clean, synthetic crude oil and diesel. And, of course, the government should increase its support for renewable energy. With the necessary mechanisms and support, it is clear that the Australian renewable energy industry can become a focal point for our region. We should be using it as part of our drive for exports. Indeed, our full participation in the global renewable energy market is essential to unlocking environmental and economic growth opportunities. So far the government has failed to take up this opportunity. We have the potential for a stronger renewable energy industry, yet the government’s inaction has instead seen our jobs go overseas and our market isolated. The bill also appears to ignore many of the positive bipartisan recommendations from the Sustainable cities report. For example, recommendation 17 was: ... that the Australian Government encourage the States and Territories to mandate disclosure of the energy efficiency and greenhouse performance of residences at point of sale and point of lease. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesMAIN COMMITTEE Sitting suspended from 10.05 am to 10.20 am that the Australian government double the photovoltaic rebate to further encourage the uptake of photovoltaic systems and that the Australian government further develop its commitment to energy sustainability, particularly in the area of increasing the use of renewable energy. Then there is a very good proposal for a sustainability charter and a sustainability commissioner. I have an eerie feeling that these practical and very good recommendations will just be ignored by the Howard government. The overwhelming evidence that climate change is occurring tells us that even half-hearted measures such as this bill are a small step in the right direction to avoid dangerous climate change. We know the challenge of climate change and, most importantly, we know enough to act now. That is why we need stronger measures. We need to confront the problem immediately and head on. The stakes are just too high. We need to start now to prepare our economy and the energy sector for a carbon constrained future. I am very concerned by recent statements by the environment minister that: Discussing emissions targets for countries after 2012 is a waste of time. and: The concept of getting up another negotiating process for caps, targets and timetables is a terrible waste of time. The minister did, however, say that the establishment of an effective global carbon market could be a useful tool to fight global warming-but he did not envisage that happening for another 15 or 20 years. It is appalling that the minister is not interested in talking about targets, timetables or, indeed, playing a role in establishing the global carbon market. It is simply not good enough to say, ‘See you in 15 or 20 years on that one.’ Labor’s view is that establishing targets for greenhouse gas reduction is critical. That is why adapting our current energy use is so important. Using energy more efficiently is not a question of choice; it is an absolute necessity. We should be leading the world in delivering energy efficiency and emissions reductions. We should view the challenge as an opportunity. The pricing of our environment and of our natural resources will be the next major economic reform. It is critical that we establish the real price of production and get that right. We need to better price our energy resources, our water and our timber, so that we can achieve sustainability dividends from our investments. The proper pricing of energy will help drive energy efficiency, but at the moment the signals are all wrong. The price of the most greenhouse intensive energy sources are the lowest. You can get a tax rebate for cutting trees but not for planting them. There is no incentive to do anything other than go for the least cost option. We have to change that and factor in costs to our environment. We need to ensure that our national resources are directed to uses that maximise benefit for the current and for future generations. We need to make sure the technology we develop and apply improves living standards now and into the future. There is ample proof that energy efficiency can deliver economic growth to the economy and greater profits for business. The recent book, Natural Advantage of Nations, identifies many case studies where companies have reduced their greenhouse pollution and increased production. While increasing production by nearly 30 per cent, Du Pont has cut its greenhouse gas pollution by over 70 per cent in recent years, saving more than $2 billion in the process. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005
330,Mr Albanese,"Recommendations 26 and 27 are very relevant. They are:Five other major firms, including IBM, Alcan, Bayer and British Telecom, have reduced their greenhouse pollution by 60 per cent since the early 1990s and saved another $2 billion. In 2001 BP announced that it had already met its 2010 target of cutting greenhouse gases to 10 per cent below its 1990 level. BP reduced its energy bills by $650 million over the decade. The Climate Group, a UK based non-profit organisation, recently reported that 43 companies had significantly reduced their greenhouse gas emissions and saved a total of $15 billion. This shows that energy efficiency is good for the environment but most importantly it is also good for the economy. To illustrate this point, I draw members’ attention to the fact that the British economy since 1990 has increased by about 38 per cent in GDP terms. Over the same period, the UK has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 12 per cent. The UK experience is that investment in energy efficiency and alternative energy sources is likely to boost economies rather than to cause damage through loss of existing assets. The year 2005 has seen unprecedented new evidence that climate change is occurring, including retreating arctic sea ice, drought across southern Europe and floods in India. According to the CSIRO, climate change will only worsen drought conditions in Australia. On 12 October British Chief Scientist, Sir David King, when giving the Magna Carta lecture in Parliament House, made a powerful case for Australia ratifying the Kyoto protocol and joining the global effort to avoid dangerous climate change. Sir David King outlined the measures that 25 EU countries and Russia, Japan and Canada are undertaking to help adapt their economies, most notably the development of successful emissions trading systems. Avoiding dangerous climate change is as much an economic and social issue as an environmental challenge. Climate change is real and Australia has a lot to lose. I do not want to sound unduly alarmist but, although the science has been acknowledged by the Howard government, when the Minister for the Environment and Heritage stated just last week that the debate was over, you cannot help but be concerned. George Bush has admitted that climate change is happening and that we need to do something. It is his Republican colleague Arnold Schwarzenegger that has been leading conservative thinking on this issue in the US. To achieve this, the ‘Governator’ has put in place aggressive energy efficiency standards for buildings and transport, thereby saving Californians millions of dollars on their energy bills. He has set ambitious targets to increase the contribution of renewable energy to 33 per cent of electricity supply by 2020. I do not want to pretend that energy efficiency measures that work for California can simply be translated to Australia. Put simply, this is not a debate between the Left and the Right in the political system. This is a debate where leading conservative thinkers and politicians are taking strong action in other parts of the world. Here the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage praise Tony Blair but, compared with the Blair Labour government in the UK, they are doing nothing to address these issues. Australia is unique in the climate policy debate. Not only are we disproportionately high emitters-the highest emitters per capita in the world-we also have more to lose than most from the impacts of climate change. We live on the driest inhabited continent on earth. Our task is great, and that is why we need to start now. To do nothing will inevitably cost more. There is an opportunity cost of time. With our long coastline, significant agricultural sector MAIN COMMITTEE and unique animals and plants, we are particularly vulnerable to climate change, so it has been frustrating to watch the Howard government’s failure to take decisive action. Next month, the 155 parties to the Kyoto protocol meet for the first time since the agreement came into force. On 11 October, the Prime Minister said: Kyoto has always been inadequate for Australia’s interests. It was never right for Australia to sign up to Kyoto. That was not what he said when Kyoto was signed by Australia in 1997. On 19 December 1997, John Howard said: We end the year having achieved this ... absolutely stunning diplomatic success at the Kyoto conference. That was an extraordinary achievement, that Kyoto summit-an absolutely extraordinary achievement-and it was against all the odds. I mean, what we were able to do at Kyoto was, both, make a massive contribution to the world environmental effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions but also to protect Australian jobs ... thanks to the superb negotiating job that Robert Hill did at Kyoto, we achieved a win for the environment and a win for Australian jobs. There was nothing equivocal about that. There was total unequivocal support for Kyoto and praise for his environment minister, yet five years later we see a complete reversal. The Prime Minister was right then-he was right to praise Senator Hill, who made a terrific effort in negotiating Australia’s deal there-but then we walked away from it. The Prime Minister was right then, but he is wrong now. Labor believes that we do need to be part of the international effort. Labor believes the climate pact that the government is a part of is positive, but it is limited. Technology transfer and working with our Asia-Pacific neighbours is absolutely critical to delivering outcomes; there is no debate there. But we need to be serious about making real progress and not simply rebadging old commitments. Those who suggest there are opportunities for Australia through technology transfer are absolutely correct, but they miss the main point: you cannot transfer technology without the technology to transfer. New technologies evolve from new markets not new documents. The question is how you drive change. Technology transfer by itself cannot achieve the outcomes we need. We need targets, funding and market mechanisms. We need all of those. This is increasingly becoming the reality throughout the world. The European Parliament recently adopted a report calling for increased use of renewable energy sources from a current level of about six per cent to 20 per cent by 2020. It is simply incoherent for a string of Howard government ministers to argue Australia should and will meet our Kyoto target and yet argue that to ratify the protocol will destroy our economy. You cannot have it both ways. Noone believes the Kyoto protocol is perfect-Labor does not argue that-no international treaty ever is. But the Kyoto protocol is real. It is in force now, and we are missing the economic opportunities that come from taking early action to cut our greenhouse pollution. The external costs of climate change are currently not factored into many, if not most, of our energy investment decisions. Without clear direction from the Howard government, many companies are complacent about energy efficiency and future carbon costs. Protecting industry from real risks is not good policy. We need to better define the risks and how best to minimise the uncertainties. Given the long life of many infrastructure projects, investors need to start now to consider the carbon liabilities associated with each decision they make. MAIN COMMITTEE Companies investing now are doing so in the full knowledge of the science of climate change and the likely order of magnitude of global emission reductions required to stabilise atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Over the last decade there has been a growing understanding of the need for ecological productivity as well as economic productivity, but the Howard government has been arrogant and complacent. We want the environment on the energy sector balance sheet as a basis for securing a lowemission economy for Australia and a low-emission future as the future for fossil fuels. We have to give the right signals in the market. This was acknowledged by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, on the Insiders program when talking about the climate pact. There are only two sorts of price signals you can make to get the market involved: the first is emissions trading, the second is a carbon tax. I am not sure what the foreign minister was talking about when he spoke about the need for price signals, but Labor know what we stand for. We stand for support for emissions trading, because the external costs of climate change are currently not factored into many, if not most, of our energy investment decisions. The bill before us today will do little to address this matter. Labor believes the key to driving change is emissions trading, and it does seem obvious. Create an incentive for efficient, cleaner technologies and a flexible market mechanism to drive least-cost emission reductions. Allow the market to do the job it is best at doing: allocating resources. In fact, emissions trading is such an obvious, uncontroversial tool that federal cabinet considered a joint submission from four departments-Treasury, Foreign Affairs, Environment, and Industry-supporting a national emissions trading system for Australia, but it got knocked over by the Prime Minister. Instead, he maintained the status quo, focusing on voluntary programs. Although some are worthwhile they have failed to adequately price the cost of carbon or to adequately slow the rate of growth, let alone start reducing emissions. Australia is on target for 123 per cent of emissions, on 1990 levels, by the year 2020. That is a figure of the Australian Greenhouse Office. It is untenable that at a time when the rest of the world are reducing their emissions that is what we are on target for. It is simply not good enough. In August this year, the nine north-east US states moved to freeze greenhouse gas emissions by 2009 and then cut them by 10 per cent by 2020. How will they do that? They will establish an emissions trading scheme. California, Washington and Oregon are looking at a similar deal. These initiatives are being led by two prominent Republicans-Arnold Schwarzenegger and New York Governor, George Pataki. In Australia, all state and territory governments are working together to develop a national cap and trade emissions trading scheme. Of course, it would be best for the market and for the environment if the federal government established a scheme rather than leaving the hard work to state governments. Labor stand for a strong economy, creating wealth and security for all Australians. We understand that environmental progress is a necessary component of that economic prosperity. That is why Labor support putting in place the mechanisms to actually drive energy efficiency and greenhouse emission reductions. I support the amendments before the House. on the member for Grayndler’s address. Clearly, he is passionate about this subject, but he is incorrect on some points. He made a particular point about pricing. Whether we are talking about water or energy or any infrastructure type issues, it is terribly important to remember that, for the poorer in our community to participate fully in the activities that we call our life MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005
331,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (10.36 Am),"I would like to make a couple of commentsand our society, we should not encourage price points in the market that take away people’s ability to participate-particularly with water. A lot of people have been saying recently that we are just not charging enough for water. I do not agree. I think it is a community benefit and we need to think about those in our community who are poorer. We have a responsibility as the governmentpeople and their needs so that they can fully participate. Just because you are in the lower income echelons, it does not mean that you are to miss out on the benefits of being part of society. I put to the member for Grayndler that Australia has met its targets under the protocol that we put in place. Whilst renewable energy is important, it is only going to play a tiny role to the year 2030. I am a supporter of renewable energy, but I put to this parliament that I am not a supporter of destroying a landscape with wind turbines on the altar of renewable energy. I am sure that reasonable members of this parliament would support me in that. I am particularly interested in Gippsland. As I have explained to the parliament already, you now come around the Anderson turnoff, look down that glorious vista and you see seven massive wind turbines one kilometre from a town and a stone’s throw from the beach. I must have been wrong, but I thought that under the Hawke and Keating governments and prior to that we had covenants that protected our coastlines and our seashores. I thought we had international responsibility to protect those, yet the Victorian state government has come out and put these things fair smack in the middle of the landscape as you come over the hill and look down upon that glorious beach. And for what reason? Seven of those things will not keep a cowshed going. The people in Geraldton in Western Australia have done a great job. Their wind turbines are way back off the foreshore. You cannot see them unless you are flying over Geraldton. Mr Albanese interjectingexercise that actually will provide power in that area, it is totally supported by the community and I do not have a problem with that. I believe that this country, under whatever government, will come up with renewable energy ideas before other countries do, as we have done before with innovative, new ideas-perhaps to combine wind, solar and, as some have said, tidal energy. I do not know how you match up all of those, but there are issues there and I believe Australians are still an inventive and capable people. They are also brave enough to say, ‘Are we prepared to put solar hot water systems all over the place?’ That would make a greater difference to our energy consumption than putting wind turbines right up and down our coastline. The other thing is that it is important for us, in everything that we do, to be conservative guardians of the landscape that we have today because that is what we are passing on to future generations. I want to say this to the member for Grayndler; I know he has to go: we are in this parliament to do what we need to do to pass on the assets to the next generations. With all due respect to your longevity, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan, we are not here for long. As a nation we have been in this country for such a short time. We have to have regard for the degMAIN COMMITTEE",177,Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005

334,Mr Broadbent,"Yes, they are way back. There are some 74 of them. It is a mammothradation we have done. The Sustainable cities report is a tremendous one. It gives a whole lot of pointers and guidelines as to where we might go as a community. I spoke yesterday in a committee meeting. I will not go into the long story about the farmer, which was important-actually, I will. I met an older gentleman in my electorate. I will not give his name. He is in his eighties. I spoke about his mum. I noticed an emotional reaction when I spoke about his mum. He said, ‘Russell, I didn’t grow up with a mum; my mum died in childbirth.’ The lady died during his birth. He said, ‘Dad married another lady and she also died in childbirth.’ What was our reaction to that as a community? We built bush nursing hospitals right across Victoria and Australia. Today we live in a world where death in childbirth is minimal. We also had a problem in looking after our older people. What did we do? State governments, along with local governments, created nursing homes next to these bush nursing hospitals right across Victoria. We had a problem and there was a whole-of-community approach in addressing it. With all due respect to this parliament, the state parliaments and the local governments, and how they operate together and their desires-and I hope the member for Grayndler will take this on board as a matter of policy; he asked how do we do the things that he raised, how do we get a community response-we do not just need the federal, state and local governments joining together to promote our ideas; we need a whole-of-community response, like the whole-of-community response that created those nursing homes. Somehow we as a nation take a totally different view. We take reports like Sustainable cities, we grab hold of those things, but somehow we have to invest in those all the way back to the community. So the action needs to happen not just with industry, as the member for Grayndler clearly enunciated before, but in every household, in every school, in every workplace. It is a different mindset as to how we should be sustainable. When we have moved to contracting out all sorts of things-the former government did it and this government does it-in areas where previously governments had a chain of command all the way down, why are we not addressing sustainability as part of those contracts? If you are going to put a tunnel under Sydney, or you are going to put a new private road into Melbourne, part of that contract has to have a sustainability clause. We should be thinking that far in: from contracts all the way down to school provisions. The Investing in Our Schools program, which the government introduced in the last budget, is a terrific program for secondary schools and primary schools in my area. But why can there not be a clause for sustainability even as part of the process of us delivering funds in the Investing in Our Schools program? I think there are lots of ways that we as a government can encourage-but we cannot do. The doing has to be by the new generation of people. When we as a community, particularly in cities like Sydney and Melbourne, are spewing out our sewage by the tonnes per minute into our oceans, why is it that a government like ours cannot turn around and say, ‘We are going to invest all that we can for clean oceans from Tasmania all the way through to the cape, from Western Australia all the way through to Sydney and beyond’? We are pouring this stuff out, but we are wealthy and able enough not to do it. We are wealthy and able enough to not only grab hold of renewable energy but actually use this water for the benefit of the nation instead of pouring it into the oceans and having a toilet hanging off each city, which in this day and age is unacceptable. MAIN COMMITTEE As the bush nursing hospitals were the response to something that became unacceptable to the community, this Sustainable cities report is a community saying broadly to the committee and its chairman, Dr Washer, ‘We believe the things that are happening in our community are now unacceptable. We would like you, in this report, to give us a guide to go forward.’ I do not want the Sustainable cities report, which was raised by the member for Grayndler, to just disappear onto a shelf in a member’s office and never be picked up again. In fact, if it were possible, I would love the Sustainable cities report to go into every secondary college, every library and every place where somebody might pick it up and grab just one of the ideas in it and say, ‘We can implement this at a local level.’ The Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005 that we are discussing today is the result of a wide canvassing of views and research among business and industry with the intention of introducing measures that alleviate excessive greenhouse gases. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.47 am to 11.06 am sions in a responsible and practical manner, which is reflected in this legislation. The bill establishes the mandatory energy efficiency opportunities measure announced in the energy white paper, Securing Australia’s energy future of June 2004. Subsequent to the release of findings from the white paper, the government announced that the energy efficiency opportunities measure was being introduced as part of a comprehensive policy approach that included significant budgetary support for new low-emission technologies aimed at lowering the greenhouse signature. The desire to lower where possible greenhouse emissions has also resonated in my discussions with industry leaders within my electorate of McMillan. In my view, their core obligation is to their workers, clients and their local community but this has not overridden their desire to bring forward new and innovative ideas to address global environmental challenges. The Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005 establishes the measure, broadly outlines its requirements and allows for regulation making to provide detailed requirements. The basic obligations contained in the bill require that corporations using over 0.5 petajoules of energy a year register, submit an assessment plan, undertake an assessment of energy efficiency opportunities every five years and report on the outcomes of the assessment, including their response. This is a proactive environmental initiative aimed at getting government and industry to collectively work together in an economically responsible manner that is mutually committed to lowering emissions and harmful greenhouse gases. In order to achieve this the government has canvassed widely with industry, particularly in the development of assessment and reporting procedures. The industry feedback to this consultation by business leaders has resoundingly indicated that they recognise this measure as a lower cost alternative to some of the other measures the government was being urged to pursue. Further, they are willing to prepare and comply with the requirements of the legislation. There are two important considerations to note on these initiatives. The first is that the increased take-up of energy efficiency improvements will benefit the Australian economy through increased productivity. The second, of course, is the environmental benefits that will stem from the implementation of the bill through reduced greenhouse gas emissions associMAIN COMMITTEE",178,Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005
335,Mr Broadbent,"The government does recognise the need to reduce greenhouse emisated with energy use. I know this to be the case at the Loy YangB power station and Hazelwood power station adjacent to my electorate in the Latrobe Valley. These power stations, of course, were part of the electorate before the redistribution and were part of my former electorate of McMillan that I held between 1996 and 1998. Mrs Moylan-And well held it was. plants employ hundreds of workers from the Latrobe Valley region and act as a main artery sustaining the local economy. So they are of special interest to me as a local member and of special interest to the Victorian community because of their importance to our economy. International Power, the owners of Hazelwood and Loy Yang B, are both diligent towards their local community responsibilities and reducing emissions. This was reiterated to me by Jim Kouts of International Power, when he said: We are committed to growing our Australian business and working with Federal and State Governments to find realistic solutions to reducing emissions while ensuring that we can run a viable business with near on 700 Australian employees. We welcome the Federal Government’s industry funds targeting the reduction of greenhouse emissions through technological development. The bill is a clear indication that the Australian government is serious about improving Australia’s energy efficiency performance. The government recognises, however, that our energy efficiency performance, in combination with energy market reforms and incentives for lowemission energy technologies, is part of a comprehensive approach aimed at enhancing Australia’s energy prosperity, security and sustainability. Energy efficiency opportunities are directed at large energy-using businesses and sit alongside a range of measures to pursue the benefits of using energy more efficiently: energy market reform, solar cities, improved appliance and building standards, and targets for reduced energy use in government operations. The objective of the EEO measure is to improve the identification and uptake of costeffective energy efficiency opportunities by large energy-using businesses. It aims to do this by requiring businesses that use greater than 0.5 petajoules in energy to, firstly, undertake an assessment of their energy efficiency opportunities to a minimum standard in order to approve the way in which those opportunities are identified and evaluated and, secondly, report publicly on the outcomes of that assessment in order to demonstrate to the community that these businesses are effectively managing their energy. There is ample evidence to show that costeffective energy savings are possible in the business sector. The bill will encourage all companies to understand their energy use and improve energy efficiency. The measure is expected to be particularly successful in companies that either do not have energy management systems in place or do not monitor their energy use. It will enable the individual business to demonstrate to the community that they use energy responsibly. The opposition has tried to make much of the government’s unwillingness to sign the Kyoto protocol. In this area it should sign Kyoto and introduce emissions trading. One stunt this year that springs to mind is the shadow spokesman for the environment’s attempt to turn Valentine’s Day into a love-the-environment day in honour of the Kyoto protocol. Gestures do not achieve things, but practical and sincere actions can and do. As the Prime Minister rightly pointed out earlier today on Kyoto, it was not right for Australia and Australia’s interests. Signing up to Kyoto would have been akin to the Prime Minister selling out the working men MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005
336,Mr Broadbent,"It was lost at that time, but thank you for the encouragement. Bothand women of Australia in the resource sector, particularly the power industry in the Latrobe Valley. Speaking on behalf of hundreds of men and women from the Latrobe Valley who work at the Hazelwood, Loy Yang, Loy YangB and Yallourn power stations, I could not more fully endorse the Prime Minister’s words. The Kyoto protocol would not be right for the Latrobe Valley or for the interests of the Latrobe Valley. Australia is on track to meet its 108 per cent Kyoto protocol target without having imposed additional costs on the Australian industry. The latest national greenhouse gas inventory shows that emissions have dropped 33.4 per cent per dollar of GDP from 1990 to 2003. The government has committed more than $1.8 billion towards its climate change strategy through the 2004 budget and energy white paper. Australia is also a founding member of the Asia-Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate with the region’s largest economies and most significant greenhouse gas emitters. The partnership will promote the further development of all energy technologies, including fossil fuels, renewables and new technologies such as hydrogen. Industry groups in Kyoto countries such as New Zealand and Germany have endorsed the approach taken by the partnership and have called on their governments to adopt a similar strategy. With respect to the emissions trading, until a robust and effective international framework is in place that includes all major emitters, such a cost would simply erode Australia’s international competitiveness for no global environmental gain. The EEO, along with other measures announced in the energy white paper, is laying the foundations for a lower greenhouse signature without imposing inordinate costs on the Australian economy. The Productivity Commission is opposed to mandating energy efficiency investment by firms. However, this was never intended under EEO, and the bill does not oblige firms to invest in opportunities they identify. The Productivity Commission considers that mandatory energy efficiency assessments are not warranted on solely private cost-effectiveness grounds, even though it acknowledges that the barriers exist that inhibit energy efficiency improvement and that there are constraints on the quality of decision-making. However, the Productivity Commission recognises that government intervention on energy efficiency is a legitimate means of achieving broader policy objectives such as delivering economic wide GDP growth and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I want to pay due respect to the power stations, the companies and the employees of the Latrobe Valley today, simply because they have spent $400 million in their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005, moved by the shadow minister for primary industries, resources and tourism. While I will not be voting against the passage of this bill, I believe it should go further. There is no doubt that we can all do more when it comes to energy efficiency. We are no longer dealing with a situation where there is any considerable doubt about the impact modern life has on our natural environment. We are no longer dealing with a situation where only businesses can do something to reduce their impact on the environment. It is about time that we all contributed to the need for greater energy efficiency throughout all sectors of the economy. RecentlyI had the opportunity to attend the Macarthur Centre for Sustainable Living. They held an open day at Mount Annan. I was, fortunately, invited to attend. This open day preMAIN COMMITTEE",181,Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005
337,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (11.15 Am),"I rise in support of the second reading amendment tosented an excellent opportunity for the community to gain a greater insight into what sustainable living is all about. It gave people the opportunity to see that by simply changing a few things in their own lives and lifestyles everyone can contribute to the general health of their environment. The centre has the stated aim of promoting ‘sustainability, social equity, cultural diversity and economic stability’. It does this by providing a number of interactive displays with working models to demonstrate just how everything could work and should work in a proactive society. I point this out simply to say that this is not pie in the sky. These are real working models, and the volunteers who operate the centre harbour an ongoing commitment to demonstrating just how simple it can be to modify our behaviour to help the environment and to reduce the impacts of our daily lives on our surrounds. I would particularly like to congratulate Del Cotter, a good friend of mine, and the other volunteers at the centre on their hard work and dedication to this cause. They are not the only ones seeking to reduce the impact of modern society on the environment. The south-west of Sydney is subject to considerable housing growth at present. That does not seem likely to stop in the foreseeable future. It is not a bad thing. It certainly creates jobs in my electorate and brings people to what we consider to be a great part of the world. While many people have criticised developers in the region for their approach to construction and what might be commonly referred to as the ‘McMansions’, there are a number of responsible people out there putting in a real effort and a commitment to producing energy efficiency and environmental sensitivity in their developments. These developers have been able to design and build houses in areas to provide the best aspects of modern living whilst seeking to avoid and minimise the worse of it-that being the environmental excesses. It is an important point, and it is certainly a significant trend which is now occurring in our society. A great number of people are disgusted with the government’s lack of action on environmental management, particularly in its refusal to ratify Kyoto. Consequently, it has fallen upon people to demand more action when it comes to sustainable living and sustainable development. The south-west of Sydney is fast becoming an example of how it can be done. It is fast becoming an example of how modern city living and sustainable living are not mutually exclusive concepts. Whether it be through the reticulation of grey water, the processing of waste water or energy efficient appliances, people are focusing on their environment and, as a result, energy efficiency. Even one of the biggest road constructions ever undertaken has accommodated a growing desire for people to have alternative forms of transport to the family car. I am referring to the construction of the Westlink M7 Motorway. Throughout the entire length of the M7 Motorway there has now been constructed a cycle clearway. The designers have been able to find an innovative way for cyclists and motorists to share this significant transport link. This in itself is an interesting reflection of the views about sustainable living that influence the daily lives of residents of the south-west of Sydney. While the Macarthur Centre for Sustainable Living, the approach of developers in the construction of more efficient residential dwellings and the fact that cyclists and motorists are able to coexist on a road such as the M7 might not be directly related to the bill, they nevertheless demonstrate that there is a strong community desire to reduce the impact of modern living on the natural environment. Disappointingly, though, the fact that the community demands it has not necessarily translated into the government insisting upon it. The community MAIN COMMITTEE is leading the way when it comes to sustainability and yet the government is being, in my opinion, dragged along. The bill we have before us today is no better example of this. The purpose of the bill is to establish mandatory energy efficiency opportunities assessments announced in the white paper entitled Securing Australia’s energy future, which was released in June 2004. It seeks to establish a program that will require large energy-using businesses to assess the potential to improve their energy efficiency and report publicly on the outcomes. That is a good start but, let us face it, it is not the most radical or far-reaching suite of activities to address the need for greater efficiency. Quite frankly, apart from the public reporting aspects of the requirements of large energy users, most people would expect large energy users to seek to reduce their consumption, in their capacity as responsible corporate citizens. Shareholders would expect managers of these large companies to examine energy consumption with a view to reducing costs. Many large organisations are now reporting annually on their triple bottom line. Some reporting issues may already be well and truly covered. Australian companies have been slow in the take-up of the cause of energy efficiency in comparison to those of other countries. There is a need for a greater effort on the part of businesses to up the ante when it comes to improving energy efficiency. Business use of energy accounts for about 80 per cent of Australia’s primary energy consumption, and a relatively small number of businesses are responsible for the majority of energy use. It is estimated that 250 of the largest energy users account for approximately 60 per cent of all energy used by business. If government is willing to demand that these businesses become more efficient, what about those businesses, including those in other sectors of the economy, that use the remaining 40 per cent? These sectors are certainly not insignificant energy users; nor do they consume energy at an insignificant rate. RecentlyI had the opportunity to view an interesting statistic, one which stuck in my mind given the amount of new residential developments occurring in my area. It is estimated that there is at least 70 per cent penetration of airconditioners in the new residential home market. When I think about the number of new homes that are being planned in my electorate in the south-west of Sydney alone over the coming years and about what that means in terms of the number of airconditioners and other household electrical items, I start to wonder what that means for the future of energy and energy consumption in Australia. While other levels of government, through their planning requirements and approval processes, are making efforts to compel developers to create more energy efficient and environmentally sensitive dwellings, the federal government is simply not going far enough with this bill. To say that this bill stops short of what should be occurring as part of Australia’s ongoing economic and social development would be an understatement. Australia is a nation of energy users, for all sorts of reasons. We are more inclined to jump into the car to go to the shops than to walk or catch public transport. The use of the car is becoming an increasingly discussed topic for many people, particularly in the south-west of Sydney. As I move through my electorate, I am continually asked about the level of petrol prices and the impact it is having on family budgets and, from the business perspective, about the impact it is now having on business. I have raised these issues in this place a number of times, and I will not use this time to again examine the government’s shortcomings on the issue of petrol prices. But the issue remains that the government and this bill seem to ignore MAIN COMMITTEE or to have forgotten the whole concept of the issues associated with transport fuels. I can assure members opposite that the public certainly has not forgotten the issue of petrol prices. While the bill requires large energy-using businesses to register with the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources-they will have to submit a plan for assessment and there will be a public report on the assessments-it does not place the same compulsion on other sectors of the economy or the community. It is an important piece of legislation that stops short of addressing the broader agenda. It does not require action from the broader group other than the largest of our energy-using businesses, and it does not set a broader agenda to explore our options when it comes to sustainable energy supplies. While the opposition has taken up the challenge to examine broader energy issues, with some innovative thought when it comes to Australia’s ongoing energy needs, the government seems reluctant to meet this challenge. Energy efficiency-or, more correctly, energy inefficiency-affects all of us, and it deserves a proper public debate and should be the subject of very considered public policy. The current issues of high petrol prices and high resource prices are partly the product of an increasingly competitive global energy market. The emerging economies of China and India are energy hungry, and the point about the additional demands that these economies place on the energy market needs to be made and considered, particularly in relation to future energy use. Supplies will not expand by themselves, and growth in the world’s energy demands seems unlikely to cease, yet the government is hoping that the issue will simply go away without causing it too much trouble and without it being required to address the issue. On the other hand, federal Labor is keen to promote new thinking when it comes to energy. On transport fuels, the Leader of the Opposition recently delivered a blueprint speech in which he set down an agenda for developing Australia’s fuel industry. Labor set out the need for Australia to diversify its fuel industry and become a more self-sufficient nation. Labor set out an agenda in which it set forth some serious thinking on issues that government members would do well to examine for themselves. If they examined that agenda, they would at least see that it is an attempt at bold policy making. They might then understand that policy development is about dealing with more than just the immediate issues and they might realise that when it comes to energy we all have a part to play. The continuous and certain supply of energy is necessary to sustain modern life and, while it is necessary to point the finger at big business and demand more from them, it is also time we all looked at our energy consumption and considered it in light of future needs. Energy efficiency should not simply be about shaming large users. Surely the government can come up with something a little better in terms of policy development than something that could be considered as a little tired and old. Why isn’t the government encouraging the use of building materials that use energy more efficiently? Why isn’t the government encouraging the use of more energy efficient building designs throughout Australia? Why isn’t the government acting to develop alternative fuels, rather than simply trying to address a quick fix option? While the extension of the use of ethanol in transport fuels is an important first step, more needs to be done to develop longer term solutions for the emerging shortage in transport fuels. We have already seen what can happen when a government fails to take issues of resources sustainability seriously. While serious problems with water emerged clearly earlier this year, the water issue has not gone away. That situation provided a little insight into what might happen. Quite frankly, this government has ignored the issue of water resources security for MAIN COMMITTEE years, and the drought brought home the serious nature of this issue. Of course, the drought also brought the issue home to the broader community, and people responded positively in the way they tempered their consumption of our diminishing water resources. As with recycling over a number of years, people realised the impacts on them but it took effort from government at all levels to encourage people within the community. The same applies with energy. The community will step up. All sectors of the economy, not just big business, will also step up if there is just a little leadership from the government on this issue. The time is right for leadership on energy efficiency. We cannot delay it until there is an energy crisis. We cannot delay petrol pricing until transport fuel hits $5 a litre, for instance. Federal Labor is not seeking to amend the detail of this legislation. It is not seeking to amend the legislation simply for the sake of amendment. The amendments proposed by the opposition are fair, reasonable and driven by the desire to see serious efforts being made to address the issue of energy efficiency. Australia has a culture of finding innovative solutions. We are innovative and we are certainly inventive. If we have the task of developing new sources of energy and developing new ways of improving our energy efficiencies, we will develop them. Some solid research into fuel cells to substitute and eventually replace current transport fuels is already under way. It is even occurring in our schools. There are people like Steve Zorbas, who has developed a teaching program which is being administered to schools in the south-west of Sydney. Under this program Mr Zorbas is encouraging students to build hydrogen cells to run model cars. That is a competitive project which is being embraced by a number of schools in my area. I say that the bill before us is a good start, but it does not go far enough. (Time expired) the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005. It is a direct result of the government’s actioning recommendations in the white paper called Securing Australia’s energy future, which was released in June 2004. That white paper, which the Prime Minister released, stated: … the government will require large energy users to undertake a rigorous assessment of energy efficiency opportunities every five years starting in 2006. These assessments will be undertaken consistent with an improved Australian standard and will be designed to identify energy efficiency investments with a payback of four years or less. Firms will be required to report publicly on the outcomes of the assessment, and will be free to make decisions on investments identified via their normal business processes. The government will act to ensure the assessments are rigorous and comprehensive, and to disseminate the lessons learned to the wider business community. Public reporting will be designed to provide the markets with useful information while protecting firms’ reasonable commercial interests. Details of the regime will be developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders. This bill provides a framework for mandatory energy efficiency opportunities assessments and for public reporting of outcomes by large energy-using businesses. The government announced that the energy efficiency opportunity measures were being introduced as part of a comprehensive policy approach that included significant budgetary support for new lowemission technologies aimed at lowering greenhouse emissions. Indeed, the government has put not just words but also money there to ensure that its comprehensive policy approach can be managed effectively, and nearly $2 billion has been committed by the government. The bill establishes measures that broadly outline its requirements and allows for regulation making to provide detailed requirements. The basic obligation in the bill requires that MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005
338,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (11.35 Am),"It is a privilege to have the opportunity to speak oncorporations using over 0.5 petajoules of energy a year register, submit an assessment plan, undertake an assessment of energy efficiency opportunities every five years and report on the outcomes of the assessment, including their response. We have consulted extensively as a government with industry in the development of assessment and reporting procedures. Business leaders recognise that this is a lower cost alternative to some of the other measures the government were being urged to adopt, and they are prepared to comply with the requirements of the legislation. That is very important: it is one thing to put into place black-letter law; it is quite another to ensure that it is complied with. I have quoted the founder of the Liberal Party, Bob Menzies, on many occasions. He made the point in a debate in this place in 1949 that if the legislation that government brings to this place is too hard and too harsh and is not reasonably achievable then people will rise up against it and nothing will really be gained. They were very wise words, and they are words that we perhaps should reflect on more often in this place as we seek to deal with some of the tough challenges that we are confronted with in contemporary society. The bill further makes sure that increased take-up of energy efficiency improvements will benefit both the Australian economy and the environment through reduced greenhouse emissions associated with energy use. Indeed, it will benefit the economy through increased productivity and reduced cost to business. It is well documented that companies focusing on efficient energy use can actually improve their overall efficiencies in production. I will come to that bit a little later when I discuss it in a little more detail. But the debate over global warming has been raging for several decades. It is a tough call for governments anywhere in the world, and it poses questions that are difficult to answer in one or two syllables, which is your averageA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.40 am to 12.00 pm has been raging for several decades. It is a tough call for governments and it poses questions that are difficult to answer in one or two syllables, which is your average media grab. But the arguments put forward by many run along the line that if we impose tough environmental measures we will interfere with economic aspirations, and the upshot of that is that it will drive many people into poverty. I do not subscribe to that theory. I think we have to balance our policy and manage the changes so that we do not create problems, and I think that is achievable. Let us examine some facts about climate change. Greenhouse is a serious and long-term issue and it does require long-term strategies. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is 30 per cent higher today than it was in pre-industrial times. The earth’s global average surface temperature increased by 0.6 degrees Celsius over the course of the 20th century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has projected that by 2100 global average surface temperature is expected to warm by between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees Celsius, that the global mean sea level is predicted to rise by between nine and 88 centimetres, that rainfall patterns are likely to change, that extreme weather events are likely to increase in some areas and that ocean current patterns are likely to vary. The possible impacts of these changes for Australia include reduced run-off, which will have consequences for irrigators, urban water supply and environmental flows. It will also mean more severe and frequent droughts, storms, floods and MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005
339,Mrs Moylan,"Before the suspension, I was saying that the debate over global warmingheatwaves. In addition, there will be shifts in the range of native plant and animal species, so we may well lose many of these. That is just a snapshot, but there are plenty of credible scientists who have provided evidence that we can no longer pretend that this is not a serious problem. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.03 pm to 12.14 pm points of emphasis and punctuation. I will get back to it. Over the years it has become increasingly obvious that a strong case can be argued to support the global warming proposition. It is no longer idle speculation or based on a hunch; it is actually backed up with rigorous scientific evidence. So it was very pleasing for me to pick up the Australian the other day and read our Minister for the Environment and Heritage’s comments, as reported by Matt Price, during the minister’s visit to the Tarkine area in the north-west of Tasmania. There are some quotes from the minister in the article, and I would like to take a couple of pieces from it. The article quotes the minister as saying: There’s no doubt ... that humans have contributed to global warming and ... we’re heading for calamity unless the world co-operates to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The article went on to say that the minister has been criticised by some commentators for expressing this view. I think that is a sad reflection-these are my words now-on our ability to recognise the enormous pressure that our environment is under and the need to dramatically modify our behaviour and our way of life if we are to ensure a future for following generations. The article went on to outline some of the other comments by Minister Campbell. The minister was alleged to have said: ... “a very small handful of what we call sceptics” are dead wrong when they insist the science behind global warming is flimsy and deliberately alarmist. The article said that the minister has: ... seen the graphs on climate change and carbon emissions that, having held steady for millions of years, “take off like a skateboard ramp” after 1950. “It is a very serious threat to Australia,” Campbell warns. The minister cited other world leaders, such as GeorgeW Bush and Tony Blair, and scientists, such as Australia’s former Chief Scientist Robin Batterham and scientist and writer Tim Flannery, author of the book The Weather Makers. It comes as no surprise that, having expressed these views, the minister is regularly asked why Australia has not signed the Kyoto protocol. To pause for a moment before answering that question, I must say that the minister came under some pretty heavy-duty criticism by a couple of elements of the media and others. I think it is a pity that some of these commentators cannot stay on the subject and argue their case, rather than attacking the minister and trying to do a personality assassination on him. From what the minister is saying, he has taken the time to properly inform himself. Clearly he is knowledgeable on these issues, and I think people should sit up and take a bit of notice. I welcome the comments by the minister. MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005
340,Mrs Moylan,"These divisions make this a little bit like drawing teeth. I hope they addIn relation to the criticism about the Kyoto protocol-and I think it is a fair question to ask-the minister says that we have moved beyond Kyoto, and I would agree with that. The other thing is that we need more than signatures on a piece of paper in forums where practical solutions are bogged down in a sea of words and circular arguments. That is not to say that Kyoto did not play a very important part and a significant role in raising the stakes in environmental management. I think you would be hard pressed to argue against that, but we need to move on and we need practical solutions. Australia is on track to meet its 108 per cent Kyoto protocol targets without having imposed additional costs on Australian industry. The latest national greenhouse gas inventory shows that emissions dropped 33.4 per cent per dollar of GDP from 1990 to 2003. This is a significant achievement; make no bones about it. The minister has made the comment that Australia is up there with the top few countries in its achievements in reducing greenhouse gases, even above many of those who did sign the Kyoto protocol. The government committed more than $1.8 billion towards its climate change strategy through the 2004 budget, and the energy white paper has outlined very clearly some of the government’s objectives. Australia is also a founding member of the Asia-Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate among the region’s largest economies and most significant greenhouse gas emitters. The partnership will promote further significant greenhouse energy technologies, including fossil fuels, renewables and new technologies such as hydrogen. Industry groups in Kyoto countries, such as New Zealand and Germany, have endorsed the approach taken by the partnership and called on their governments to adopt a similar strategy. I do not know that I have time to go through all of the elements of the new partnership. I will make the point that the partnership covers 50 per cent of greenhouse gas emitters and 50 per cent of the world’s population; it brings together key developing and developed countries in a region; it will address challenges of climate change, energy security and air pollution; it will develop cleaner, more efficient technologies; and it will strive to encourage economic development and reduce poverty. SoI think the arguments that you cannot achieve better greenhouse outcomes without damaging economies and creating poverty is dead wrong. I think we can achieve both of those things if we manage it in an effective way. With respect to emissions trading, until a robust and effective international framework is in place that includes all major emitters, such a cost would simply erode Australia’s international competitiveness for no global environmental gain. This measure, along with other measures announced in the energy white paper, is laying the foundations for lower greenhouse emissions without imposing inordinate costs on the Australian economy. I would like to remind the House of those other measures, because we heard a couple of speakers this morning say that we are not doing enough. I think it is important that we set out the way in which we are managing emissions. I will try to do that briefly. There are four elements that Australia is interested in: developing low-emission technologies; encouraging growth in renewables, including wind power; using energy more efficiently-which is a big area, and this bill really goes to the crux of that energy efficiency issue; and encouraging increased uptake of carbon sinks to absorb emissions. Some of the things we have achieved over this time are that we have put, as I said, almost $2 billion into addressing the climate change issues, including half a million dollars into the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund. I will not go through every area but we MAIN COMMITTEE have put quite a large sum of money into the area of renewables. There are four major projects to drive renewable energy development initiatives. In the area of efficiency and energy, $75 million has been committed to the development of Solar Cities. I chair the Public Works Committee and have done since 1998, I think. One of the things that we do in our committee now is that, for every government building and major infrastructure work that we examine as a Public Works Committee, we ask the proposing agencies whether they have been in touch with the Australian Greenhouse Office to talk about ways to build and develop these buildings in a more energy efficient way-not only for energy efficiency but also in a way that conserves water and uses water wisely. That is happening. In recent times we have approved two new headquarters for various departments. Again, I will not go into the fine detail, but one of them is actually using the surface area of the roof as a water catchment facility and they have put an underground tank into a 14-storey building. This means that there are significant water-saving measures. On top of that they have incorporated the most up-to-date energy-saving measures into that building as well. So our own government can drive this by setting an example and leading the way in the efficient use of energy and better designed buildings. I am running out of time now so I will move on from that, but I think it really is important that people understand some of the measures that the government is taking, because there are a number of them and they are all important in trying to resolve these problems. We did have a report from the Productivity Commission which said that this was a bad idea, but again the government has taken the lead. The government points out that the Productivity Commission report was a draft and that the commission have reviewed their position since then, because it appears they may have misunderstood the intention of the energy efficiency opportunities measure. They implied that investment in energy efficiency opportunities was mandatory, which is not the case. The government is clearly using the carrot approach of assistance. Let us work with our big industries. Let us see what better measures can be put into place to save energy because, as I said before, this is a good measure not only for all Australians and for our environment but also for companies, because it helps them to reduce their reliance on high energy use and the cost that goes with that. In one of the reports I saw, energy is about a five per cent cost factor in our big corporations. So about five per cent of the total cost of goods is attributable to energy. If we can reduce that reliance or use that energy more efficiently and more effectively, that is a very positive thing. I was in China twice earlier this year. They are looking to Australia for a lead in this matter. They recognise that we are very efficient energy users in this country-that our industries are energy efficient-and are looking to improve their own energy efficiencies. This is terribly important, because we all know that their economy is growing dramatically and that they are big manufacturers. If Australia can show the way there, that would be a very positive thing. As I said, I know that China is looking at our policies and taking a lead from them. The Productivity Commission looked at one aspect of it. It was a narrow view. This is a very good bill. It is a very good way to move forward. I congratulate the minister responsible and commend the bill to the House. (Time expired) Opportunities Bill 2005, I join with the member for Pearce in recognising some of the conseMAIN COMMITTEE",188,Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005
341,Mr Windsor (New England) (12.27 Pm),"Before speaking to the Energy Efficiencyquences of global warming in her speech. I did not hear all her speech, but it is positive that there are people within this parliament that are starting to recognise that there are real problems out there and that we should be embracing some of the solutions to those problems. I support this legislation. I think it is very important legislation. It is aimed at creating opportunities for industry and is geared toward increased efficiency. Increased efficiency does not only have an economic spin-off. Obviously the intent of this legislation is a dual benefitan economic spin-off as well as an environmental spin-off. As the member for Pearce alluded to towards the end of her speech, it also could have a very meaningful impact on our competitiveness in global trade. There are a number of things that will develop over the coming years as we come to grips with the global warming problem and the energy problem. Not the least will be price, which we are looking at today in relation to fuel, and other energy sources, but there will also be the markets that will develop globally over carbon trading et cetera that will have dual economic and environmental benefits. This legislation is essentially about efficiency and achieving targets. I have been critical of the government in the past because of their slowness to embrace some of the new energy sources and some of the advantages that we have in Australia with energy. One of the issues that I have raised a number of times in this parliament is renewable energy, particularly ethanol and biodiesels-the sorts of fuel sources that we can grow in Australia-for a whole range of health, environmental and economic reasons. I would just like to spend a moment, if I could, relating to the ethanol debate once againthe debate is centred around ethanol, but the same principles can be applied in other areasand the way in which renewable energy can in fact put this country in a much better position than it is in now. We are currently facing an explosion in fuel pricing and energy pricing, which is dictated by foreign sources. The Singapore price, what is happening in the Middle East, global conflict and a whole range of other factors are coming together to increase the price of fuel. Some experts would suggest that may not be a long-term phenomenon: global crises may stop and the Middle East might become a paradise tomorrow where everybody becomes good friends. I hope that is the case and that the price of fuel plummets. But I think we have got to be a little prepared in this nation if we want to be globally competitive. One of the very reasons the industrial relations bill is currently before the House, in my view, is not so much about the efficiency of the processes and the mechanisms of the labour market but that people in Australia are recognising that unless we do become globally competitive we are going to miss out on the future opportunities of the globe. As China and other places become more efficient and more economical in their productivity et cetera, we run the risk of missing out. One of the attempts of the IR legislation is to over time bring the labour rates back down so that there can be some efficiencies. The ethanol issue is very pertinent because it encapsulates a number of key issues. It is an energy source that Australia can produce and produce very efficiently. We are constantly told that agriculture in Australia is the most efficient in the world. So we can produce these energy sources very efficiently. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, who is in the chair now, I am pleased to see, comes from a sugar-growing area. There are other advantages of ethanol. We have collapsing agricultural industries. The sugar industry is a prime example. It is collapsing because of the pressure of global markets and the uncompetitive nature of our cost structure in Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE So we have this dual effect. We have an opportunity to grow energy from an industry that is going broke. We can also relate that to grains, of course. Grains, as Mr Deputy Speaker Causley would recognise, are a bit more efficient in the production of ethanol. There are biodiesel sources, as well, that are quite efficient-probably more efficient than sugar. Nonetheless, we should take an overall view, a societal view, an economic view, a health and environmental view of energy into the future. Part of global warming is about production from fossil fuels. We have the arguments about carcinogenic products in our current fuels, that we should lift the octane ratings et cetera for modern-day energy. We have an opportunity with ethanol to have a triple whammy or possibly more: in health, in environmental-it is a natural oxygenator in terms of the octane rating for modern engines-plus in the economic and social additions of providing an outlet for sugar production. We now say to those industries, ‘Well, if you cannot survive on the global scene, you should not be there and you should vacate the premises and move to Brisbane.’ Rather than doing that, an efficient society would be looking at options that may well be available for that industry. It could move towards what Brazil is doing. Brazil has embraced the production of ethanol. It is increasing its output of ethanol at the rate of one Australian sugar industry in total a year. The United States have had not only farm based pressures, and I recognise that, but also enormous health related and environmental pressures from some of their more urbanised states. Building an ethanol plant at the rate of one every 23 days, this is an enormous explosion in relation to recognising global energy problems into the future, health and environmental problems of the day and the future, and coming to grips with an agricultural sector that has been finding it difficult to be economic by just being a food producer. Australia has a more critical problem than that, because most of our produce from agriculture is exported. But the government has sat on its hands in relation to this issue, and the grains industry has too. The Grains Council of Australia, of which I am a former member, has had a pathetic attitude to the promotion of ethanol. It seems more concerned about motorists having choice than about showing leadership on an industry basis, and the same could be said for the government. The government has been highly reluctant to move away from a position that essentially says that if the global fuel companies-who are part of the problem of high prices, in my view-do not embrace the concept, if the market does not accept the concept, it is not a concept worth having. The government responded recently by putting in place a MRET, a renewable energy target, of 350 megalitres of renewable biodiesel ethanol by 2010. That is exactly what it did going into the election period in 2001. There is less ethanol produced now than there was in 2002. There has been some window dressing. Various ministers-one of whom had been very opposed to the ethanol industry, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources-are now out there embracing this concept of ethanol being available at petrol stations as a choice of product. The government should be doing much more than that I have introduced a private member’s bill into this place, and I know the member for Kennedy has also introduced a private member’s bill-as all over the world there has been the introduction of mandated use of ethanol in fuel. A 10 per cent mandate over a progressive period of time, at the rate of one per cent a year from now until 2015, would have an enormous impact regionally and would require about 30 ethanol plants across Australia. This could save the sugar industry and it could MAIN COMMITTEE have an enormous impact on the grain industry, with three to five million tonnes of grain that could be needed. We have just seen the charade that the Wheat Board had to go through to sell grain overseas, and the $200 million that eventually found its way to Saddam Hussein and his friends. We are seeing all those sorts of pushes to try and get product that we produce out onto the global market, and here we have an instance where we can cut the corner rather than be a nation that is shackled by a domestic cost structure which in my view is artificial; it has developed through a whole range of processes over many years. Rather than be shackled to a corrupt world market, we can start growing some of the produce that we grow well-our farmers are the most efficient in the world, we keep being told-and convert that product into a healthy, environmentally sensitive fuel and energy source. A mandated 10 per cent in our petrol, for instance, would have an enormous impact on our regional industries. It would have an enormous impact on the carcinogenic outputs that some of our modern engines produce because of the high-octane fuels that they have to burn. Members would be conversant with the ethanol plant that is proposed for Gunnedah, which is in the electorate next-door to the electorate of New England. The main proponent happens to be a constituent of mine, so I declare an interest. We are talking about energy balance and the conversion of a seed grain to an energy source. Energy balance is exactly what this legislation is about, and there will be more opportunities for business in being more efficient. The problem with this bill is that it tends to look at industries individually rather than at industry globally. If you follow the production of grain in no-tool agriculture, where very little fuel is burnt by way of tractors et cetera, in a plant the size of that proposed in Gunnedah the energy balance-energy out plus energy in and energy produced-has the same impact as removing 70,000 cars from our urban environment. Speakers who follow me may have more mindful things to say about what that does to our environment and our health. The government is reluctant to look at the issue of energy balance. But I am encouraged that the government has introduced this bill. At least it is starting to look at and encourage efficiencies. Some would say it is a bit narrow in what it is trying to do and some would say it is about providing very small carrots for very small gains. I think there are options that really do need to be looked at. The National Party were very strongly in favour of a 10 per cent mandate; it was a similar situation to that of having sugar included in any free trade agreement with the United States. The government has gone back to having a sustainable target. It used to be a mandatory renewable energy target, but the word ‘mandatory’ has crept off the agenda. They now have a renewable energy target, which they hope industry will embrace through a few handshakes and cups of coffee, of 0.85 of one per cent by the year 2010. I do not think that is real progress. I do not think that is embracing a concept like that being embraced by the United States and other countries in Europe and South America. I do not think that is addressing some of the societal problems in regional Australia. I do not think that is doing any of those things. It is very much paying lip-service to a problem. I hope ethanol plants are developing. I had a lot to do with the proponents in Gunnedah, Dalby and other places. I thought the role of government was to help drive policy that would benefit our nation into the future and have an impact on all of those external things such as global warming problems et cetera. I wrote to the Prime Minister about a month or six weeks ago on this particular issue. It seemed to me at the time-and I am sure it does to others-that government has no real procMAIN COMMITTEE ess for embracing the future of our energy requirements. My suggestion to the Prime Minister was that he establish a renewable sustainable energy authority. I now know there are a few odds and sods committees, mostly guided by the hand of government in what they want to hear. But we really need an independent authority that can sit down and examine some of these issues. There are people out there who are not all politically driven. Some of those people have views about the future and what we can look at. I think we have enormous capacity in this country to produce energy, not only from agriculture but from solar, wind and water sources. There are strategies that we really have not embraced. There are time lines involved in getting from A to B; even to get to 10 per cent ethanol would take 10 years. It is an enormous time line. You just do not snap your fingers and have it happen tomorrow. In those other energy areas, too, we do not seem to be doing the research. We are not putting money into the research and development of solar energy or wind powered energy. A lot of global wind energy proponents are leaving Australia or do not want to come here, because of this lethargic attitude. Our system says to them: ‘You can only deliver a very small portion of the energy cake, therefore we are not overly excited about you. If you want to locate on the top of a hill, we’ll see how many galahs you kill as they fly through.’ That is our attitude to these sorts of sources of energy. We should be looking 50 years out. There was a debate in the parliament yesterday about the CSIRO. Our scientists need the freedom and the money to be able to look a long way out, further than the three-year term of a parliament or the short-term nature of the commercialised way in which we look at research. They need the opportunity to really look forward. If there are failures in terms of some of that research, so be it. I am yet to meet a person who has not failed in doing something. In research, particularly, we need to push the barriers in terms of our attitude to some of these energy sources. Look at the things that we have a natural advantage in: agriculture, sunlight. I do not know where we stand in terms of wind and whether we have a comparative advantage, but we have a massive area with very few people. That obviously has some political overtones to it as well. In our debate on the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005, we have the opportunity to look at energy efficiency. Hopefully, this bill is only the start of that process. (Time expired) ber for New England. Indeed he is right to identify the impacts on human health, amongst many others, that not moving rapidly to both energy efficient and non-polluting productive capacities and processes means for us. I notice that the member for Pearce earlier referred to the necessity for low-cost measures to be applied to urge and move business towards considering energy efficiency, and certainly in the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005 they are low-cost measures. A little more than $3 million, perhaps, per year is about as low cost as it can possibly get. But I think the member for Pearce missed what really is the more important point: that is, what are the costs to us if we fail to enact robust measures across a range of areas in relation to energy efficiency? Not least of these is the issue that the member herself referred to: what are the consequences for us in terms of global warming? The member said that global warming was a ‘tough call’. It is certainly that, and more. One of the things that I have witnessed in the short period of time that I have been in the House as a member of parliament is the fairly profound change in attitude that has come from the government-government members and MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005
342,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (12.47 Pm),"I welcome the comments from the memgovernment ministers-on the issue of global warming; and I welcome that change. Having been pilloried for the view that there was such a thing as global warming and that climate change may be a consequence of it-pilloried by, amongst others, former Deputy Prime Minister Mr Fischer, whom I have a close and convivial relationship with, I have to add-it gives me no joy to be joined by members on the other side of the House in the recognition that this is indeed the most fundamental challenge that we face. There is no question about it. We face big challenges in terms of terrorism. We face big challenges in terms of managing this country in an equitable and sustainable fashion into the long term. We face big challenges, ones that members present are going to refer to, in getting our fuel industry on a slightly more sustainable basis. We face big challenges in making sure that we have healthy and productive natural landscapes. But global warming is the biggest challenge that we face. It is to the government’s great discredit that it has taken so long to recognise the scope of this challenge and that, having in a halting way started to recognise it, the measures it proposes are so paltry and insignificant. The LarsenB ice shelf has come down to the sea. The prospects for the increase of transmission of diseases, including dengue, are greatly increased. A recent report by the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Conservation Foundation found that likely health impacts of climate change would include transmission of airborne viruses and diseases-and so it goes on. The question really is: how robust, how comprehensive and how effective will the government’s measures be? They really ought to be judged in many ways by world’s best practice. It is to that that I will confine my remarks later on in this speech. But, firstly, this bill does emerge from the energy white paper of June 2004. Since that time two things have become very clear: first, the original criticisms of the government’s approach in the white paper, which were significant, were well founded; second, the need for us to have a comprehensive and robust approach to addressing what I describe as the collision point of increasing energy demand, where the prospects of likely climate change as a consequence of global warming have been reached. Once that collision point is reached then measures that are incremental, measures which are essentially small scale, measures which do not go to the core of what we are doing here in relation to greenhouse emissions, will not have that much effect at all. Added to this question of the collision point is a lurking issue. It is an issue that I think the Treasurer has addressed within the last six months, but he has chosen not to return to it. I do invite the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources to return to this issue, because we have certainly returned to it. It is the issue of the price and future scarcity of oil and the likelihood that we will be deriving a significant amount of our energy use in terms of oil for our motor vehicle industry and for other industrial uses from imports over the longer term. What is clearly going to happen is that over time the price is going to go up. Scarcity will demand that that should happen and we will be faced with the consequences of our vulnerability in our energy policy as a result. This bill notes that primary energy consumption, to confirm that point, has grown at an average rate of 2.4 per cent per annum between 1973-74 and 2001-02. Our appetite for energy is undiminished. At the same time that our appetite is undiminished we keep on producing more greenhouse gases. On a per capita basis, as members present would know, our production of greenhouse gases is amongst the highest-if not the highest-in the world, certainly in relaMAIN COMMITTEE tion to equivalent countries. Once you discount land clearing it clearly is the highest. So after 9½ years the Howard government still has world’s worse practice in our production of greenhouse gas emissions. You often hear the argument from the government that we are a small country with a small population. In fact, it is a per capita track record that we have. If you compare us to countries like Italy, for example, which is significantly larger in population-I am not exactly sure of the population of Italy; it must be close to 40 million-you find that we exceed them greatly in our production of greenhouse gas emissions on a per capita basis. That is not good enough. We welcome the fact that the government has started to address the issue, particularly the issue of spiralling energy consumption, because the demand for stationary energy services looks like going to about 50 per cent growth by 2020. The majority of this is produced by business energy users. This bill is seeking to address itself to those business energy users. Whilst it is quite modest-‘paltry’ is perhaps too strong a word, but I think it really is paltryand welcomed, it clearly does not go far enough. I would call these tentative but necessary steps. They are tentative because, in the political context, the government are fixated on other ideological agendas. We have seen that in the House today with Australian traditions of collective bargaining. Pursuing an agenda through the House and applying their energies to it have become a key focus for the government. But, on the critical focus of determining what measures are going to address greenhouse gas emissions-which continue to increase-and the likely impacts upon us of climate change, there is very little to be seen. This bill refers the registration of company details to the department, which undertakes assessments. Energy efficiency opportunities are assessed. Companies will report publicly on the outcomes of assessment and compliance, and there will be enforcement arrangements. So far, so good, but so much more could be done. The Solar Cities initiative to which the government has committed itself, again, is to be welcomed, but again it is so minor. We talk about tens of millions of dollars; other countries spend hundreds of millions of dollars. I spoke in the House yesterday about the CSIRO report indicating that they were considering removing and scaling back their research on renewables. I pointed out to the House that at one stage an Australian scientist led the world in research on solar energy. We even have the situation to datehave a situation where, in the most recent adaptation by Australian industries-and particularly the solar industry-to the challenge of producing energy efficiency, they have had to go overseas. I think the last company went to Czechoslovakia in order to produce Australian solar systems, which are actually being produced and sold in Europe. Let us face it: the climate in comparative terms is not as beneficial to the use of solar energy as that of Australia. It is plainly obvious to everybody, both those listening to and reading these speeches and those in the public, that Australia should be a solar nation. That is clearly our future energy path. The lack of capacity of the Howard government both to recognise and embrace our solar industries and to develop both an investment and a legislative framework to enable us to become a solar nation is to be sorely regretted.

344,Mr Garrett,"The honourable member makes the very good point that, in fact, we nowables research have been closed down. The emphasis on the other side of the House by the government is towards clean coal. I have a strong view about what our likely solutions and sources of energy are in relation to the looming greenhouse gas problem and the collision point that I referred to. I think that, because of our natural resource gifts, coal clearly has a role to play, and I hope that we do end up with something that approximates clean coal. I have my own reservations about it. But the most important and significant issue is that, at the same time, we ought to be moving rapidly and comprehensively towards developing a suite of renewables that will assist us to meet the gap. In Alberta they have actually set up a solar bank. Alberta, as you would know, is one of the provinces of Canada, somewhat to the northern latitudes. If Alberta can set up a solar bank, why can’t Australia? The fact is that without a substantial commitment to developing a suite of renewable energy sources, without a substantial commitment to a decent sized mandatory renewable energy target, we end up with bills which, whilst welcome, go a very short distance towards dealing with the kinds of issues that we have in front of us. It is not as though the parliament has not had an opportunity to consider it, and it is not as though members on both sides have not come out with some extremely good and I think very productive suggestions. I am referring to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage report Sustainable cities. This report, which had bipartisan support, produced 32 recommendations, which encompassed governance and policy, planning, transport, water, building design and energy, as well as research and feedback. I call on the government to implement those recommendations. There is no reason whatsoever that the government should not move, as a matter of urgency, to considering and implementing those recommendations. I will take this opportunity to identify several of them here. I understand that the member for Wentworth, amongst others, is going to speak to this committee report, and I commend him for doing that. I think he and other members of the committee have come up with something which they believe would address the collision point that I have referred to, but now the onus is on the government to do something about it. In terms of governance and policy frameworks, those recommendations included, amongst other things, establishing a sustainability charter that would be adhered to by all levels of government and establishing a sustainability commissioner to monitor this charter. The idea of a sustainability commissioner is very close to my heart. In my previous life as president of the ACF I pushed very strongly to premiers and to opposition leaders, prime ministers and treasurers in this House that we ought to reform the COAG process entirely and put it on a footing which included sustainability. I have been very pleased to see that some of those earlier suggestions-I do not take credit for them; I am just noting this-have been taken up by diverse groups, including the Property Council of Australia, the Royal Institute of Architects and others. In fact they are reflected in the House of Representatives standing committee report Sustainable cities and are starting to be reflected in work that has been done by the competition watchdogs, the Productivity Commission and Treasury. I cannot stress more significantly how important I think this work really is. Until we start to deliver a sustainability agenda into the policy processes, through cooperative federalism, we will continue to have piecemeal bits of legislation come through the House which will not deal with the real problem. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage further recommended, in relation to planning and settlement patterns, that the Department of TransMAIN COMMITTEE port and Regional Services invite representatives from the Department of the Environment and Heritage and CSIRO to join the development assessment forum. That is a sensible recommendation. There is a recommendation to investigate sustainable modes of transport, including investment in public transport. On water, building design and management and energy, there is a recommendation to further encourage the uptake of photovoltaic systems and renewable energy, and to investigate the benefits of decentralised energy delivery and solar energy. I call upon the government to both consider and implement those recommendations. For fear of pushing too strongly the barrow about energy in this debate, in the time that I have left, I want to draw attention to the statement recently released by the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, on what a prudent and appropriate energy policy would look like in Australia, including processing of liquid gases to fuels. I suggest at this stage that the requirement for industry to implement energy efficiency savings which are identified for the government can only be made effective if targets are set-if there is a national sustainability framework which sets targets for the reductions of greenhouse emissions and for the increases in energy efficiency. It is not that hard to do. Many years ago I built my own sustainable three-bay shed in New South Wales. Honourable members present who have a rural background will recognise that one of the reasons I built a three-bay shed was to encourage my neighbours, who were familiar with the shed-a tractor goes in one part of the shed, hay goes in another and the rest of the tools go in another-to consider not having to go on to the grid. They could have a couple of modest solar panels on the roof, some yachting fixtures that take 12-volt in both the kitchen and the bathroom, composting done out the back and a little bit of LPG for the stove. Guess what? Running costs per annum were in the vicinity of between $50 and $75. It can be done very easily. I was lucky enough to be able to do it a number of years ago. I hope some of my neighbours will have followed suit. More importantly, and to make my personal asides serious, this needs to be done nationally. So we call on the government to implement the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage in the Sustainable cities report as a matter of urgency.
