My questions are as follow :1. If he has j'et received auy reply to his promised inquiries as to the number and names, and cause of punishment, of Australian soldiers confined in English prisons ? 2. If so, will he supply these particulars to the House? 3. If he has any information as to whether men named Brearley and Laurie, members of Victorian contingents, are imprisoned in Gosport Military Prison, England, and for what cause? 4. If he will make representations to the English authorities in order that these men may be permitted to write to their Australian relatives ? the honourable and learned member's questions are as follow :1 and 2. The inquiry was made, but no reply has yet been received. 3 and 4. These two men have recently returned to Victoria, having been discharged in England by the Imperial authorities after undergoing a short imprisonment.

I can understand that certain quantities may be imported in bulk, but probably they would be of an inferior description, and the rate of duty would be higher. 80 per cent., anyhow. think it could come up to such a high rate as that. Perhaps in this case I might meet my honourable and learned friend, Mr Glynn, by agreeing that the duty should be 2s. per cwt. in bulk, and 4s. per cwt. in tins. all round 1 which is imported in tins is very valuable ; running from £ 2 4 to £ 2 8 per ton. Honourable members will see that we can fairly impose a reasonable duty upon that article. I admit that so far as the bulk article is concerned the proposed rate may be too heavy. I advise the committee to agree to a duty of 2s. per cwt. in bulk, and 4s. per cwt. in tins. the Statistical Register of South Australia. I cannot find that the South Australians import any of this article, so that it is impossible to estimate the price at which it is imported, but according to tbe New South Wales returns ordinary grease averages about 16s. per cwt. Anti-friction grease would average a great deal more than that here. should be 4s. per cwt. whether it is imported in tins or in bulk. It is complained that we do not give an opportunity for the working up of our products in this State. I cannot see the force of sending away to other countries the grease and other by-products of our primary industries and allowing them to come back in a manufactured state. Although the duty on anti-friction grease has been 4s. per cwt. when imported in tins, the price has been less here, according to travellers' returns, than in other States. In New South Wales, they imported most of their supply duty free from America. able and learned member for South Australia, I think,-is nearly accurate in what he stated with reference to the difference between the value of the article and the duty of 4s. per cwt. It is of no use the honourable member for Yarra taking our bulk statistics, dividing them up and finding a price, because all sorts of qualities of material are included in the general bulk. I believe that this stuff is shipped free on board in New York at 7s. per cwt. ? , ^ w rw tallow in ifc at 7s. per cwt. ments made by persons who are of very high authority, and who trade in the article. friction grease. not say 2s. per cwt. entirely to the definition in the Tariff-axl e grease. A duty of £ 4 per ton on an article worth, on board ship in New York, £7, is a pretty stiff one; it is a long way over 50 per cent. As the freight and shipping charges amount to £ 3 per ton, there is practically a natural artificial protection amounting to 100 per cent. Are. we going up to 100 per cent, in the case of grease when we will not go beyond 15 or 20 per cent, in the case of our great manufacturing industries ? This stuff is used in the manufacturing and producing industries. We ought to try to observe some consistency in our rates. Two shillings per cwt. would amount to over 27^ per cent. poor classes it might, but not on the really good stuff. seems to know all the shades of greaseI On anti-friction grease the duty do not. £30. this is, then, which charges the same rate per cwt. on an article worth £ 7 ' per ton as it does on an article worth £ 3 0 per ton!

Of course the figures do not work out in that way. The prices which have been furnished to me show that the average cost is about £ 1 4 per ton, so that the article quoted at £ 3 2 per ton must have been a very superior one. The prices which have been given to me are for articles of similar quality, and used in similar work, namely, £ 1 1 in Victoria, £ 1 2 in New South Wales, £ 1 4 in Queensland, and £ 1 6 in Western Australia. I suppose that the differences in the price are partly the result of freight charges, and partly the result of distances to be covered, but I believe the average is about £ 1 4 per ton. I do not know a very great deal about this matter, except that some four companies are engaged in manufacturing the article here. I believe it is manufactured in every State in Australia, and to that extent it must be locally consumed. The Victorian product has given every possible satisfaction to the users, more particularly to mine managers. I have some letters from the Bendigo, is used there in large quantities by mining managers and others, who all state that it has given every possible satisfaction; years, varying from twelve to sixteen; and the Minister think that it has served all their purposes, and, above all, that it is quite cheap.

Evidence like this, coming from free-trade importers, ought to be a recommendation in favour of the quality and the price at which these men are producing the article. for exorbitant duties. I have are from mine managers and others, who say the local article is good in quality and is supplied at a fair price. TheI f I heard him correctly, he manufacturers say that they started the industiy as the result of a duty of 4s. per cwt. being imposed in this State; that if it be removed probably they will come into very severe competition with the American Standard Oil Company, who, in part, manufacture this article from the refuse of the oil wells ; and that if they are subject to that severe competition they will have either to reduce wages or to take other steps. It does seem to me, on the evidence I have before me, only a fairfching to maintain the duty as it is, and to allow local persons to supply the market. followed the arguments of the last speaker, and he has confirmed, to my satisfaction, the statement made by the leader of the Opposition that this grease is bought in America at £ 7 per ton, and landed here at £14 per ton. He showed very clearly that this duty is quite equal to 40 or 50 per cent, on the cost of the material in America. If the Government desire to put a duty of 50 or 60 per cent on grease, then their action is quite consistent.",16,Tariff

42,Mr Henrywillis (Robertson),"IButi f it is desired to impose a duty of 25 per cent, the amount should be reduced from 4s. to 2s. per cwt. There is no possibility of Australia competing with Americai n the manufacture of axlegrease. The best Australian grease is made from tallow and oil-chiefl y cod oil which comes from Newfoundland. The cod oil would cost here between £ 3 0 and £ 4 0 per ton, and the cheapest tallow cannot be obtained for less than £ 1 8 per ton. We can make axle-grease of better quality than that which is imported, but it will not do better work, and when we have to pay £ 1 8 per ton for tallow, it would be impossible for us to compete with the imported article at £ 1 4 per ton. That is one of the reasons why the consumers of axle-grease in Victoria had to pay more than was realized for the article in New South Wales before the Federal Tariff came into operation. Axle-grease is being made in Victoria, and sold at £ 1 per ton cheaper than in New South Wales. I hope the compromise suggested by the Treasurer will be accepted, and that we shall get on with the business. able member for Melbourne Ports desires the business to be expedited, he will not make wildly inaccurate statements such as that which has just fallen from him. I have some figures taken from Messrs. Lewis and Whitty's price-list before the Federal Tariff came into operation. was then admitted free in New South Wales, but was subject to a duty of 4s. per cwt. in Victoria. Messrs. Lewis and W b it t y sold their axlegrease called "" lubricator,"" in one and a-half pound tins, six dozen in a case, at 4s. 9d. per dozen tins in Sydney, whilst the Melbourne price was 5s -3d. per dozen. This made a difference of 6s. 2d. per cwt. in favour of S3'dney consumers. Treasurer has agreed to reduce the duty by 2s. per cwt., I suggest that the honourable and learned member for South Australia should accept the compromise, so that we may save discussion and get on with the business. Treasurer will accept the 2s. duty for the whole item I shall be content. sent to that. committee by consenting to a duty of 2s. per ton upon grease imported in bulk, retaining the 4s. duty upon grease imported in tins. Now the honourable and learned member for South Australia wishes me to apply the 2s. rate all round, and I do not think that it is fair to press me to that extent. If the committee will not accept my offer I must stand by the original proposal. object to the Treasurer's proposal, because it is intended to vary the duty according to the package in which an article may be imported. Why should the nature of the package determine the rate of duty to be charged upon the contents 1 are so different. friction grease in tins be subject to the payment of a higher rate of duty than is asimilar commodity imported in boxes or barrels, or jars 1 It does not follow that there is any difference in quality. Unless an ad valorem duty is imposed under which the grease will have to pay duty according to its quality and price, an all round fixed duty should be applied irrespective of the packages in which the article is imported. chief objection to the proposal now made is that it will permit large companies, who always buy their grease in bulk, to escape from the payment of the higher duty, whilst those who use the grease in small quantities Axle-grease and purchase it by the tin, will have to pay duty on the higher scale. According to this price list the axle-grease is brought here in bulk and put up in tins within the Commonwealth. the greater number of consumers would have to pay a higher price for their grease owing to the difference in the duty. An all round duty of 2s. per ton would be quite sufficient. cheapest qualities of axle-grease are i?nported in tins. give quite a different report upon the matter. grease is imported in barrels, and the Treasurer will defeat his own object, if a higher duty is imposed upon the grease imI cannot conported in the smaller packages.

The grease is sure to be brought in here in large quantities, and tinned within the Commonwealth, but we shall scarcely be justified in imposing a high duty upon axle grease in tins, in order to encourage its importation in bulk, so that it may be put in tins here. the Government is a very fair one. It is perfectly legitimate to impose a higher rate of duty on grease imported in tins, with a view to encourage its importation in bulk. Honourable members opposite declare that axle grease will continue to be imported in bulk, and that the tinning will be done locally. ployed by the local manufacturer should be given a preference. Despite the repeated declarations of members of the Opposition that they are in favour of extending consideration to the primary producer, they want to send away tallow from Australia in order that it may be worked up into axle grease in another country, and then imported into the Commonwealth.

I trust that the compromise suggested by the Treasurer will be accepted. order to put this matter to a test, I ask the permission of the committee to amend my amendment, to provide for the imposition of a general rate of 2s. per cwt. Amendment, by leave, amended according ^1 point out to the committee that the total revenue which the Treasurer expects to derive from this particular item is £S30 per annum. After declaring that the Government would consent to the imposition of a duty of 2s. per cwt. upon axle grease, we find Ministers affirming that there must be a difference made between the tax levied upon grease imported in bulk and that collected upon grease which is imported in tins.

I am addressing those honourable members who have some regard to the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth. The proposed duty will fall upon the bulk of the producers, because they are the persons who use this axle grease. But simply because a particular Melbourne firm says"" We should like an extra duty of 25 or 30 per cent, imposed upon this particular article,"" their wishes are cheerfully acceded In my judgment, the men emto. The Commonwealth is composed of the people of Australia, and not of the half dozen manufacturers who make representations to the Ministry. porters ' who instruct the honourable and learned member. opposite are always considering how much of any particular duty will be diverted from the Treasury into the pockets of the individual. The interests of the consumer are never considered. We are asked to impose a 50 per cent, duty upon axle grease, simply to benefit one firm which is engaged in its manufacture, and which probably does not employ more than half-a-dozen men. Sir JOHNQUI CK (Bendigo) I do not think the honourable and learned member is justified in declaring that the proposed duties are intended to benefit one particular firm. In this connection I would point oub that in Victoria alone, four firms are engaged in the manufacture of this grease. the Commonwealth are engaged in treating the crude stuff. and learned member for Werriwa is always haunted by the suspicion that any honourable member who speaks from the Government side of the Chamber, must be speaking on behalf of a particular firm.

It is ridiculous to impose a duty on this article, because for the last ten years the surplus which must be exported has ranged in value from £1,000,000 to £1,500,000 per annum. Tallow ought to be placed on the free list. I wonder whether the Government, having placed a varying duty on axle-grease in tins and casks, propose to treat tallow in the same way. That would make the position even more ludicrous. I suggest that the duty so far as it relates to tallow, be omitted.

I refer to cotton seed oil, and the duty proposed to be imposed upon its introduction. I presume that so high a -duty has been imposed upon this article because it is used considerably as an adulterant for olive oil. So far as regards the encouragement of purity in that direction, I have no objection whatever to the extent of the duty here proposed. I do think, however, that there is an incongruity when the adulterated olive oil can come in at Is. 4d. per gallon, while the cotton seed oil would have to pay 2s. There is another aspect of the question to which I desire to direct the Minister's particular attention. After some years of experimenting, and the expenditure of a considerable sum, a process has been devised in New South WalesI do not know whether it has been used in any of the other States-by which tallow is sufficiently refined to produce what is called ""edible fat."" This edible fat is a marketable article, and in its manufacture a considerable quantity of cotton seed oil is used. It is quite true that we have expressed our opposition to "" edible f a t "" going into competition with our butter in these markets, 'but there is a large demand for it in England, and on the continent, as a marketable article. The difference to Australia is that, whereas the finest refined tallow may bring £ 2 9 per ton, this "" edible f a t "" sells at £ 4 0 j>er ton. It is not retailed by the exporters, but is simply sold on the market as ""edible f a t "" at £ 4 0 per ton. I cannot speak from my own knowledge, but this is an article of commerce which is said to be utterly harmless as an article .of consumption. per doz. I 0 0 it is used. Do we know for what our tallow per doz. 4 0 is used? American lard is said to per gal. 1 4 contain the same admixture of this cotton seed oil as does this refined tallow which per gal. 1 4 is described as ""edible fat,""andwepropose to let American lard in at i d . per lb., while we charge nearly 3d. per lb. on cotton-seed oil. How can we say what our products are used ... per gal. 0 6 for? I have myself observed that in Lon...per gal. 0 3 don the finest quality of our tallow is refined per gal. 0 6 there and used as the basis of a substitute for butter. Are we to ceaseexporting tallow or to place difficulties in the way of its exportation because it is so used ? We know that the poorer populations of Europe cannot afford to pay the prices charged for butter. They are perfectly willing to accept these edible fats, knowing them to be edible fats, and why should they not get the benefit of using them? This being so, there is an opportunity of increasing our export trade, of improving certain products of Australia, and of obtaining a much higher price for them than can be obtained for them as tallow. Why should we allow difficulties to be placed in the way of this industiy? By placing a duty of 3d. per lb, or £28 per ton, on cotton seed oil, unless some arrangements are made for giving a drawback upon the quantity of oil used in the manufacture of the fat exported, we raise the price of the finished article by some £ 1 4 per ton, and immediately destroy the business. Thousands of pounds have been spent in perfecting the processes and providing the machinery necessary to produce this articlej and such an expenditure has in other instances been urged by honourable members opposite as a good reason for protecting industries. But protection is not demanded here, and the request is simply that we should not destroy this industry by our Tariff proposals. This article is never offered upon the local markets ; but while an industry of this sort has been established in New South Wales at an expenditure of thousands of pounds in machinery, and while there is a demand in Europe for the article, not as a substitute for butter, but simply as "" ediblefat,"" for whatever purj>ose it may be used, it is ridiculous for us to interfere with that industry, and destroy it.

On the same principle they should put difficulties in the way -of the exportation of tallow, because, as I have witnessed in London, a considerable amount of that article is refined, and then used as a substitute for butter. So far as that kind of thing is honestly and openly dono, it is perfectly legitimate and proper, and we cannot stop it . We can only prevent the Australian producers from getting -tlie benefit of that outlet for their products, and the present prices for their articles in the markets of the world are such that every possible assistance should be given them to raise the prices of tliose articles. There is no question of protection in this ; it is only a question of removing by drawback the disability which this duty will impose upon the industry, and of allowing Australia to supply what is in demand in other portions of the world, and which will be supplied, and will be used practically to the same extent if Australia cannot supply it . If the duty is to remain at the figure here proposed, or even at a much lower figure, the proper way will be for the Minister to arrange that on the exportation of this ""edible fat,"" there shall be a drawback given upon the quantity of cotton-seed oil it contains. upon cotton-seed oil is undoubtedly high, and it has been purposely made so because the article is not only used fraudulently, but, so far as we know, it is injurious to health. Olive oil is produced within the Commonwealth and this cotton-seed oil is absolutely put into bottles in which olive oil has been imported, and then sold as olive oil. That is undoubtedly a fraud, the oil being a less valuable article than pure olive oil, and we are informed upon expert advice that it is injurious. The honourable member for North .Sydney admits that there ought to be a very high duty imposed upon it . Cottonseed oil is made very largely in America, and goes through several processes before it is exported. In these processes various chemicals are used, and amongst them caustic soda, potash, and milk of lime. These ingredients are used in refining the oil. The committee will, I hope, pause before they do what the honourable member for North Sydney asks us to do. If there is anything which more than another we have attempted to do in all our State Parliaments it is to be perfectly certain that everything exported from our States as butter, or as a substitute for butter, shall be as pure as we can possibly make it. If this is an article which, for the reasons I have mentioned, ought to be heavily taxed, surely the honourable member will see that he is asking us to do something which would not be wise in the interests of Australia. It may be that this particular industry has been established, but we all know that it is not absolutely necessary to use all these ingredients. This cotton-seed oil is used for some purpose, but I doubt whether my honourable friend will tell us that no other ingredient could be used which would answer the purpose as well. If we admit, as I think we do, that this is an article which is fraudulently used, it is one upon which we should not only put a heavy duty, but one which might very well be considered when we come to discuss later on a list of articles which ought to be prohibited. able gentleman prohibit the export of tallow ? prohibit the export of tallow, but I would prohibit the export of anything which contains ingredients which we know are injurious, because the export of such. articles can only react injuriously upon ourselves. of its injurious nature ? evidence from our officers that it is injurious. My honourable friend admits that there ought to be a heavy duty imposed upon it for the same reason. it is a question of the reasonableness of a drawback. a non-injurious article there would be no reason for putting a heavy duty on it. All the evidence we can get, and all the information supplied to us, shows that this is an article the use of which we ought not to encourage.

Isi t useful 1 It is, and it is used in thousands of cases. will find, if he reads up the American statistics, that there are thousands of gallons of it made, and that shows the extensive use to which it is put. The committee are asked at the present time to impose a duty upon it, which, with the import charges, amounts to possibly 100 per cent. The original price of cotton-seed oil is from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 6d. per gallon. We are asked to impose a duty of 2s. per gallon upon it, and I suppose the import charges would amount to not less than fid. per gallon. The argument used is that cotton-seed oil is used in place of olive oil. Is that not rather an absurd reason to bring before this committee ? We must deal with this article on its own basis, and look at it from that point of view entirely. It seems to me that it would not be a bad thing for members of this committee to get one or two elementary lessons in chemisbry, that they might learn that scientists are endeavouring to day to make foods cheap. In spite of what has been said, I would defy honourable members to tell good cotton oil from good olive oil if both were placed before them. Fraud occurs only when an attempt is made to sell common oil for some other oil, and we cannot prevent that. If the protectionists were to have their way in regard to matters like this, they would prevent any new discoveries in chemistry. The assertions of the Minister for Trade and Customs would convince a schoolboy that he does not understand the subject. I think Mark Twain, in his Life on the Mississippi, devotes a couple of pages to a discussion as to the use of cotton oil in America, where there was a great deal of prejudice against it 20 or 30 years ago, and the right honourable member seems to have obtained his information from that book, when he would have been much Cotton-seed oil may, better occupied in making himself acquainted with some author on the subj ecu of political economy. The committee are not now considering the provisions of an Adulteration Bill. We are engaged upon a Tariff, and why cannot we keep to what is before us 1 No wonder that the number of lawyers is increased. The Postal Act contains a number of provisions which rightly belong to other measures, and now it is proposed to insert in the Tariff provisions which should belong to an Adulteration Act. not know of my own knowledge whether cotton-seed oil or even olive oil is injurious ; but I know that edible fat mixed with cotton seed oil has been sold in England for years, and the British Adulteration Acts are the strictest in the world. If the British Government allow this article to be imported, we may be pretty sure that it is perfectly wholesome. The best refined tallow brings £ 2 9 a ton, and is largely used as a substitute for butter, but if edible f a t mixed with cotton-seed oil is sent home it brings £ 1 1 per ton more. seed oil used 1 a three months' voyage acquires a peculiar rancid flavour, which should be absent from an edible fat. This article is exported to Great Britain from the United States and from South America, so that, even if we prevent its exportation from Australia, we cannot prevent its importation into Great Britain. My complaint is this : If cotton-seed oil is imported and then exported, a drawback is allowed, but no drawback is allowed when the cotton-seed oil is exported mixed with some other substance. importer would be entitled to a drawback under such circumstances. hitherto refused to grant drawbacks.

An difficult to tell the difference. comes in. afford to buy butter, we surely do not want to prevent them from procuring edible fat as a cheap substitute. I remember when I was a youngster-and doubtless other honourable members have a similar recollectionthat we ate a fair amount of bread and dripping, and it did not do us much barm. That was edible fat, and surely we should not discourage the export of fat in a refined state. If there is any fraud committed in connection with the sale of the article in some foreign country, surely that country may be left to look after its internal government. The ambitious spirit of the Minister for Trade and Customs will find sufficient occupation in squaring the financial returns with the Treasury, without bothering himself about what they do in countries 12,000 miles away. It would be absurd to interfere with tbe operations of Australian industry here on the basis of some anxiety for people somewhere else, who can very well look after themselves. I have no doubt, therefore, that that matter will be put right. I understand that cotton-seed oil is an article which can be used honestly for a number of purposes, although I believe that frauds are practised in connection with its use. There again, is a subject that has a great deal more to do with some other Act than with the Tariff Act. I do not desire to attack those honourable members who wish incidentally so to shape the Tariff as to ""prevent fraud. I do not see anything to object to in that. Prom all I can hear, large quantities of cotton-seed oil are used for a purpose which has not yet been mentioned, namely, in the operations of those who sell fried fish. to be fried in olive oil. that two-thirds of the oil used for frying fish is cotton-seed oil. I am afraid that in Our endeavour to follow the manipulation of imported articles we shall only land the unfortunate public in a greater difficulty by causing those who now use cotton-seed oil to substitute a still more objectionable article. China nut oil, which is subject to only a low rate of duty, could be used for some of the purposes to which cotton-seed oil is now applied, but it would not be anytake a very big contract if in passing the Tariff we try to deal with this trouble. As long as the point mentioned by the honourable member for North Sydney, with reference to drawbacks, is attended to, the main object of this debate will have been served. MR . KINGSTON I think we shall do well to be very careful in dealing with butter substitutes, or with substitutes for any of our staple products. It will be admitted that some parts of Australia may be described as a second Palestine& land of corn, wine, and oil. It is difficult for me to omit recollecting at this moment that I liave the honour to represent a State which has acquired a very considerable reputation in connection with the production of olive oil. I believe there are other parts of Australia equally well adapted for the production of this excellent article, and I look forward to our being able at an early date to meet all local requirements in the way of edible oils. Cotton-seed oil has been attacked in a variety of ways, and I confess that I have been taught to think that in many respects it lends itself to fraud, and that we often get it when we do not expect it. I believe that there are good reasons for believing that under certain circumstances its use is deleterious. I wish to especially address myself to the whole question from an agricultural point of view-fro m the point of view of dairy farmers and others. Of course our agricultural resources are of the greatest importance, and what I am afraid of is that in endeavouring to get a small market for'butter substitutes we may incur a huge loss as regards butter itself. A t the present moment Australia enjoys a verj' fair reputation for butter, and I believe that, as time goes on, we are likely-by the adoption of more careful methods than those which have hitherto been adopted-to improve that reputation. The higher our reputation in connection with the manufacture of an article for the production of which Australia is so eminently suited, the greater will be the financial reward of those who engage in an industry of the character to which I have referred. It is of the utmost importance that we should strive, in every conceivable way, to increase our reputation",27,Pairs

129,Mr Reid,"Yes; but I understandas a butter-producing country. We know that the production of butter has been a great stand-by and a magnificent source of assistance to our farmers at various periods when they were urgently in need of it . Why is it that Australian wines enjoy such a high reputation ? It is because we do all that we can for the purpose of preventing their adulteration. They are said to be pure, and I believe they are. Hitherto Australia has never had its name associated with oleomargarine garine. like it . When people in the old country buy Australian butter they know that they are getting butter. Would one of us willingly purchase a substitute? Would we, instead of getting a smaller quantity of real butter, purchase a larger quantity of fat and cotton-seed oil? The very idea of the thing is repulsive. These butter substitutes can be palmed off upon the people as butter. I have a letter in my hand bearing upon this very question. The matter is put as follows :I take the liberty of bringing before you an inafter the clear exposition which was given dustry that has reached great dimensions in England, America, and the continent of Europe. The incidence of the present Tariff makes tliis manufacture impossible in Australia. Emulsions A hard ox and mutton fat when emulsified with American edible cotton-seed oil produces soft oleos. These soft butter substitutes go to South Africa in hundreds of tons. There is also a demand for them in the East, in fact they are now in universal demand everywhere. demand. oub how it is possible for Australia to participate in this trade. What would be the result of our doing so ? Either we should engage in it secretly, or we should do so openly, and thus have our reputation for the production of excellent butter mixed up with bhe rabher discomforbing reflection and criticism that we were indulging considerably in the manufacture of butter substitutes, and were supplying those who think that they are getting butter with cotton seed oil and tallow. I trust that our name will never be associated with anything of the sort. It would work great injury to our reputation as exporters of pure butter, and any amount of revenue -which might be derived from such a source would be as nothing compared wibh the loss bhab would be susbained by those engaged in the production of the genuine article. We have already dealt with a somewhat similar matter in the Customs Act. In thab measure bhe importation of oleomargarine, butterine, &c, is prohibited. We practically say that we will protect Australian stomachs and constitutions against the baneful results caused by the consumption of these deleterious articles. We declare that we will prevent our people from being imposed upon, and that our farmers shall is not oleomarnob be broughb into competition with artificial articles of this sort. going to stop thab by the adoption of their present proposals. stop it and another thing to facilitate it . I ask'bhe commibtee bo consider whether it is not wise to encourage the production of the genuine article, and if it would not be a mistake to mix up trade of thab description with fche manufacture of a spurious article which often imposes upon people, with the possibility of results such as I have already referred to ? of the point at issue, the Minister for Trade and Customs looks at the matter in that wa} I almost bremble for his adminisbration j of bhe Customs department. He states that we have prevented Australian citizens from using oleomargarine. We have done nothing of the sort. There is nothing in bhe Customs Act to prevent all our citizens from being supplied with oleomargarine. All we have done is to declare that oleomargarine shall nob be imporbed into the Commonwealth except under certain conditions. Buti t can be made in every State of the Union. It is being made to some extent at the present time. understand, to a small extent in New South Wales. This fact evidences the inaccuracy of the statement made by the Minister. Nothing has been done to prevent the local production of oleomargarine or to interfere with its exportation.

Are we going to say"" ""We shall not refine tallow to the highest degree of perfection and export it, lest we should damage the reputation enjoyed by Australian butter?""

These soft butter substitutes go to South Africa in hundreds of tons. dealing with the duty on olive oil, I am going to take the Minister for Trade and Customs at his word. we ought to impose a heavy duty on cotton seed oil for the reason that it is used in the manufacture of adulterated substances which are very injurious to our trade when used as substitutes for Australian butter. Another reason urged by him for the imposition of the duty was that cotton-seed oil came in here as a substitute for olive oil, and was used by people under the impression that they were using olive oil. It has been put to the committee that that is a very wrong practice. I believe that olive oil is much superior to cotton-seed oil, and it is with a view to foster the use of the former, and to supply a motive for the use of olive oil, that I propose to strike out the duty upon it. That will lead to a strict examination on the part of the Customs department, and to the "" policeI ing "" of these oils, with the result that the people will obtain the pure article. On the very grounds upon which the Minister urged the imposition of a heavy duty on The consumers there know its cotton-seed oil, I move That the words ""and on and after 1 Sth February, 1902, free,"" be added to the duty "" Olive, per gallon, Is. 4d."" -The Government know, as every one knows, that they are proposing a duty on olive oil at a higher rate than that which has existed in any of the States save South Australia. Under the old State Tariffs, the duty on olive oil was 6d. per gallon in Victoria, and Is. per gallon in Queensland, Is. 3d. per gallona very high duty imposed for revenue purposes upon this and all other oils-in Tasmania.' In Western Australia and New South Wales no duty was imposed. AVe understand that the increased duty is proposed for protective purposes : but there is no reason for protecting that which is protected already by nature. Just as it is impossible for India to import from Europe any oil which can be compared for one moment with that which is manufactured locally, so is it impossible for the Commonwealth to import oil equal to the local product. The oil imported by these States is not able to stand the long sea voyage from Europe, and is more or less rancid when it arrives here. Olive oil is manufactured in the Commonwealth, and if it cannot compete with that imported from Italy, Spain, or elsewhere, which suffei's the natural disadvantages to which I have referred, the industry ought not to be assisted.

It is justifiable not only on the ground that it will raise revenue : but also because it will tend to encourage and promote the production of native olive oil. For many years past scientists and others have been advocating the cultivation of the olive in Australia. They have advised orchardists and cultivators generally that the olive should grow in certain parts of Australia just as well as it does in certain parts of Europe. The result has been that the olive has been and is being cultivated successfully in South Australia as well as in various parts of Victoria. Sir JOHN QUICK tralia as well as in New South Wales, so that it may fairly be claimed that the olive has been acclimatized here. As the result of its cultivation vast quantities of oil have been produced in Australia, under local conditions and subject to local rates of wages, but it has had to compete with rancid oils from foreign countries, imported in large quantities, and sold at veiy low rates. facture of olive oil in Australia 1 member ought to be particularly interested in justifying this duty, because no State will benefit by it to such an extent as will South Australia. I believe that the duty is justified on the ground of the protection which it will afford Australian cultivators of the olive. In time, perhaps, they will be able, to compete with the imported article ; meanwhile this duty will steady the market, and keep out inferior olive oil imported from the old world, which does not tend to popularize the consumption of that article but rather to disgust the public taste. If the attention of the public is directed to the pure olive oil of Australia, and that article has a fair field, unembarrassed by cheap products from the old world, the industry may become thoroughly established here, with the result that millions of money will be placed in the pockets of Australian cultivators. the few duties proposed by the Government which I shall support. I certainly regard it as a revenue duty which is incidentally protective, and I should be very glad to support the Government if they introduced a few more proposals of the same kind. gone wrong. vation, because when I was before the electors I stated distinctly that I took up the position held by the leader of the Opposition; that I would have a humane regard for existing industries. I consider that the duty on olive oil relates to an industry for which we ought to show some consideration, and, as it is also a revenue-producing duty, I think there is very little in it to which objection can be taken. support the amendment. I believe in conI n Western Aussistently following out any policy that one adopts, and in adhering to that policy, irrespective of how it may affect the interests of any individuals whom an honourable member may represent. I am in favour of olive oil being placed upon the free list, or, at any rate, of the proposed duty being reduced very much. I would draw the attention of the committee to the fact that, with one exception, the duty is higher than that which existed under any of the State Tai'iffs. No duty has been imposed upon olive oil either in New South Wales or in Western Australia. In Victoria the duty was only 6d. per gallon, while in Queensland it was Is. per gallon. In South Australia tliere was a duty of 2s. per gallon. South Australia is the chief producer of olive oil, and as it supplies most of the oil required by the other States, I fail to see that there is any necessity for this duty.

Formerly, the duty upon these oils was Is. in Queensland, Is. 3d. in Tasmania, and 6d. in the other States, with the exception of New South Wales. That fact has actuated us in fixing the duties at 6d., and 3d. upon mineral oils, which are morelargely used in our industries.

The rope-makers and the tanners get paid for the oils they use in the price of the rope or the leather they sell. I am told that the rope-maker pays altogether for the oil he uses in making his rope about £ 1 8 per ton, and gets £ 8 0 per ton for the oil in the rope he sells.

The duty was taken off, I understand, in the interests of protection. The imported lubricating oil was compounded with Victorian animal oils, and I am informed that the effect of the imposition of this duty has been to take away from Victoria the trade we had in Tasmania. The railways in Tasmania always took this oil from us in the past, but will not take it now in consequence of this duty. It is a matter which might well be inquired into.

I see no reason why mineral oil used for illuminating purposes should not be treated upon the same footing as is mineral oil intended to be used as fuel.

M) object in submitting this amendment is T to destroy the composite character of the proposed duty. I would point out to the committee that under the Tariff which formerly operated in New South Wales, paints and colours were admitted free. In Victoria, where a duty was applicable to everything from white lead to paints in tins for household purposes, the system has been anything but a success. Indeed, it has been an abject failure. That the effort to encourage the manufacture of white lead has been a failure in this State, is proved by-the fact that to-day it is being made only in small quantities by Messrs. Lewis and Whitty. Honourable members are also aware that the Messrs. Patterson, who claim to have discovered material upon their property suitable for the making of paints and colours, received a subsidy from the Victorian Government. ment, however, the industry has collapsed, and the Government has seized the machinery. proposed duty upon anti-fouling and anticorrosive paints, which are used for painting the bottoms of ships, will directly affect the employment of several thousand men. find their own paints. for them. But the point is that in Eastern ports, where labour is cheap, these paints are admitted free. The result offcheimposition of the proposed duty will be that ships will not undergo repairs within the Commonwealth, but will proceed to Eastern countries and be docked there. If the Minister for Trade and Customs is not prepared to concede all that I ask, I hope that he will consent to the payment of a drawback upon anti-fouling and anti-corrosive paints when they are used in connection with shipping. Australia does not produce , either white lead or colours, and I would , point out that upon the poorer classes of paints, which cost 10s. per cwt., the proposed composite duty would work out at about 3Ss. 6d. member tells us that the poorer article costs 10s. per cwt., the composite duty cannot represent more than 25 per cent. Sir MALCOL MM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I would strongly urge the Government to discard the composite duty, although I cannot go the length proposed by tlie honourable member for Dalle} , be7 cause I know that those who are chieflyinterested in this matter would be satisfied with the Victorian duty of 2s. and 4s. per cwt. I would point out to the Minister that steamers like the Kalgoorlie have to be docked every six months. To paint the vessel I have mentioned absorbs 14.1cwt. of material, which costs £ 7 8 18s. 7d"". Under the Tariff which formerly operated in Victoria the duty upon that material was £ 2 18s.; but under the present Tariff it represents no less a sum than £ 1 2 l is . 3d. is used? Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN It is a composite paint which is not manufactured here. Despite this encouragehigh on some very valuable article not much used. composition to which I refer is used very considerably in painting all ships that are docked here. In fche case of anti-corrosive compositionI am referring entirelv to paints that are not manufactured here-the old Victorian duty was 4s. per cwt. The present duty is 14s. 6d. per cwt., an increase of 10s. 6d. per cwt. On anti-fouling composition there is an increase of ISs. 6d. per cwt., the proposed duty being £ 1 2s. 6d. per cwfc., as against the former duty of 4s. per cwt. On water-line composition the duty is £ 1 l is . , as against 4s. under the old Tariff, an increase of £ 1 7s. per cwt. Let me say in dealing with these particular items that, if these enormous increases of duty are imposed, steamers will not be docked and painted here. Therefore, while the States themselves are spending money in providing largely increased docking accommodation, the Federal Government will be doing what they can to drive away from our ports ships requiring to be painted and repaired.

If I have anything to bring forward I endeavour always to put it before the committee fairly. I do not advocate a -reduction to Is. per cwt., because those interested would be perfectly satisfied if a duty were imposed similar to that which prevailed under the Victorian Tariff. The majority of the articles on which this heavy duty is to be collected are used in the manufacture of paints. Take white lead, for example, which is not made here. wrong ; it is made here. lead is only Is. per cwt. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN It is explained thatWhite lead, which is the largest item in the oil and colour trade, and is practically the basis of all prepared paints, is not manufactured in any of the States, although it was recently announced in one of the Melbourne dailies that a company was formed in April, 1900, for the purpose. So far its manufacture is not on the market, and past experience of white lead manufacture in the various colonies does not induce any hope of its success. able member say is the value of white lead 1 Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN It used to be about £ 1 8 per to n ; 1 do not know what it is now. I am making this appeal for the painting trade generally, and especially in regard to the particular compositions that are used for the painting of ships. able member say is the average price of the compositions required for the painting of ships 1 Sir Twelve cwts. cost £ 5 4 10s.; those are actual figures taken from actual payments. Quite apart from the fact that a composite duty is objectionable-and I said at the outset that I should vote against composite dutiesI would urge the Government to do away with it, and fix a duty that will be acceptable to all parties concerned. The Government have before them the example of the rate under the old Victorian Tariff, which was 2s. and Is. per cwt. as I understand it is simply to have a fixed been pointed out that some of the paints I am embraced by this item are of very great value, but the Government worked on an average of about 30s. percwt. Afixed duty of Is. per cwt. upon that value would be about 3 per cent., and the addition of 15 per cent. ad valorem makes an average duty of IS per cent. We certainly think that an average duty of 18 per cent, is not unreasonable on articles such as these. If we were to take off the fixed duty of Is. per cwt, and leave the impost at 15 per cent, ad vcdorem, the duty would still be very heavy on the class of paints to which the honourable member for Melbourne refers. The fixed duty of Is. therefore makes practically no difference. The proposal to have only a duty of Is. per cwt. is something to which we cannot agree. If we fixed only an ad valorem duty of 15 or 20 per cent, the impost would still be high on the class of paints referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne. Such a course would not get over the difficulty suggested by him. Seeing the way in which the prices of these goods vary, it. seems to me that this is one of the class of articles to which we may very fairly apply a composite duty. A t the same time. I do not want to do anything that would drive work away from any of the States. We must oppose the amendment, but any other reasonable suggestion might be considered by us. would destroy this composite duty. I suggested before the adjournment for tea that we should leave the fixed duty of Is. per cwt., and abolish the 15 per cent, ad valorem duty. Reasons had been given by various speakers why this should be done, and I suggested that the Government should the old Victorian Tariff, the duty was 2s. per cwt. per cwt.

That is all I said. chinery because they put their money on the wrong horse to begin with. I am sure they will not repeat such an experiment. That is the explanation of Patterson Brothers' failure, but there are others in the State who have produced these paints, -and they are being produced here at the present time in large quantities. I wish to direct special attention to the serious way in which we have handicapped paint manufacturers already, by the revenue duties we have imposed upon linseed oil and methylated spirits, which are very largely used as raw materials in the manufacture of paint. The duties we have imposed upon the raw material in the case of this industry reduce, almost to vanishing point, the protection afforded by a duty of even 4s. per cwt. If we are going to raise revenue upon the raw materials of this industry, surely it is only fair to give its production some substantial protection. I appeal to honourable members not to ruthlessly destroy this in-dusfcry, which is finding employment for a large number of men at excellent wages. skilled work, and the wages paid in the industry range from £ 6 to £ 3 3s. per week, while boys are paid from 30s. to £ 1 per week. The industry employs a large number of men, and those engaged in it have entered into large monetary obligations in the establishment of the necessary plant. -employed 1 able member the exact figures for one firm, which will prove that it is not an insignificant industry. I do not hold with the theory that if an industry employs only two men and a boy it is not worthy of consideration. If it employs only half a man, and he has an interest, in it, we have no right to destroy his interest. The honourable member for Dalley has been lamenting that this proposal may lead to some 600 men being thrown out of work. That is all a myth. There is no likelihood of any such thing taking place. A duty of IsI t might simplify proceedings if we knew per cwt. upon paints that cost from 12s. to 29 A SOs. per cwt. is not going to make the slightest difference in contracts for the painting of ships. Such a duty is trifling and insignificant when estimated upon the And the Government have price of the paint. It must be remembered that we are able to produce They have the maall the paint required, and can enlarge the output to meet all demands made. I therefore ask the committee not to be influenced by any suggestion that the imposition of such a duty is likely to throw men out of employment. The only likelihood of men being thrown out of employment in this connection would arise from the injury which might be done by refusing the very moderate protection asked to enable those who have invested largely in this industry, and who turn out an article which gives the utmost satisfaction to all who use it, to continue the production of that article. I hope that the Government proposal will be ""maintained, and failing that, that there will be an emphatically protectionist duty imposed. Revenue without destruction should be our motto again in this case, and-we may do serious injury to a large and promising industry unless we can give liberal terras under this head, seeing that we have already taxed those engaged in it to the utmost limit upon the raw materials which they use. If we are going to do justice we must compensate The work is scientific and those engaged in this industry for that heavy taxation. able member vote for it ? have to protect other industries as well, and the whole thing hangs together. If we are going to have a patchwork in the Tariff, with a free-trade page here, and a protecmany men are tionist page there, it will be veiy mixed up by the time we have done with it . WeI can give the honorhave imposed duties upon raw materials of this industry for the purpose of protecting the local industries established for the production of those raw materials, and to be consistent we should now insist as far as we can upon a reasonable protection for this industry. The Government proposals in their original form are no more than adequate to meet fche case. We may have to accept a proposal, making a differentiating duty of 2s. and 4s. per cwt., but I would prefer the original proposal. exactly where we were.

I am afraid that he knows no more about this subject than other honourable gentlemen do. A t any rate, his speech was not very enlightening. He got upfcodemolishfchearguments of fche honourable member for Dalley, but what he said confirmed the honourable member's statements in regard to the efforts of the Victorian Government to galvanize into activity the business of Messrs. Patterson Bros. Some time ago we heard that the Victorian Government has a beet sugar plant on their hands, and now we find that they possess paint-making machinery as well. I wonder that they do not hold an auction, and get rid of some of their machinery. The honourable member for Southern Melbourne told us that the paint-making industry could not be established here because the necessary ingredients for making the paint are not to be obtained in the State. If that be so, what an idiotic thing it was for the Victorian Government to pour out itsCOOK -Would that be an money in the attempt to establish the industry here ! It shows the length to which the protectionist policy and the hungering, unintelligent desire to establish impossible I underindustries will drive people. Tbe honourable member asks for a high duty upon paint, because we have put high duties, which he I w ill not drop voted for, upon the raw materials, and he says that unless these high duties are imI am posed scores of men and boys will be thrownj out of employment. How many men and boys are employed in the industry he does not tell us. The Government estimate to obtain about £27,000 a year from the dutiesupon paint, and I believe that if that money, which we are taking out of the pockets of those who use paint, was distributed amongstthose who are employed in the paint-making industry, it would give them all very handsome pensions. As against the few persons, who are employed in the manufacture of paints, there are thousands of persons in thegreafc industrial centres of New South Wales who use paint. From the revenue point of view New South Wales will have to stand the brunt of any reduction of these duties. butes £9,000 a year; which is about the same on the population basis. clearest proof that the high duties which they have had in Victoria have been of noavail 1 industries in which paint is used in Victoria than in New South Wales. strange, in view of the fact that New South Wales contributes more to the revenue from the duties on paint. We ask that the requisites of a great industry may not be excessively taxed.

Our object was to make the more valuable varnishes pay the higherrate, but these are chiefly used in connection with coach-building and similar industries. The committee having shown by the vote on paints and colours that they prefer a fixed rate, and as a fixed rate appeared in many of the old State Tariffs, we think it wise to accept the general feeling and propose a duty of 2s.

It is proposed to impose a duty of 2s. a gallon on varnishes. That was the duty under the old Victorian Tariff. In the other States where there were fixed duties, there were imposts of 6d. and Is. 6d. a gallon; yet we are asked to accept the offer of the Government as a compromise. If we are going to accept the high level of protection represented by the old Victorian Tariff, we on this side of the committee might just as well give away the whole free-trade side of the question. Another point is that the manufacturers themselves are willing to accept a duty of Is. 6d. per gallon. Sir manufacturers want 2s. a gallon. compromise in this matter, it ought to be a reduction on the highest fixed duty that existed in any of the States prior to federation. Here we have not a reduction of the highest fixed duty, but the highest fixed duty itself. That is no compromise. It represents the high level of protection, and I think that honourable members of the Opposition are in duty bound to oppose this proposal. I move That the words ""and on and after J9th February, 1902, Is. 6d."" be added. On looking up tbe State Tariffs which prevailed prior to the Sth October last, I find that in Victoria there was a duty of 2s. per gallon on varnish. That was equal to 40 per cent, on the varnish of inferior quality, and 7 per cent, on varnish of superior quality. In Victoria, where varnish of inferior quality is made ment. me the report of a Aletorian commission which sat and took evidence on this and j Then the commission go on to sayother matters, and which was composed I We recommend thatfcheduty should remain as exclusively of protectionists. old. is not eight years old.

AVhat is the compromise not given; but the report which, I think, we might accept as one that was adopted by a protectionist Parliament sets forth that:Numerous objections were made to the duty of 2s. per gallon on varnish by witnesses in various trades. Painters and decorators wished for a reduction on the ground that it was a. hindrance to their business. They use, they say, Victorian made varnish for some purposes, but nob for the best descriptions of work. Requests for a reduction or abolition of the duty were also made by agricultural implement and carriage-makers, and a cartridge manufacturer. The carriage-builders and cartridge-makers do not use Victorian varnish, which they state is nob suitable for their purposes, and they consider bhab the duty is detrimental to their indusbries. The quality ol Victorian varnish was said by imported and unsuitable for many kinds of work, bub this was denied by the principal manufacturer, who affirmed that the adverse opinions expressed were due to prejudice, and that he manufactures various qualities of varnish ranging in price from 4s. 3d. to 21s. per gallon. He ascribed some inferiority in his varnish to his inability to obbain sufficienbly good imported linseed oil, and hoped that a superior oil would soon be manufactured in the colony. He would not at present ask for a higher duty on varnish, bub said he would be pleased if the rate were increased from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per gallon. The industry is not extensive : the largest factory employed but eight hands in this work, and we could only hear of two makers. AA'e were told thatfchemanufacture is very simple, employing little labour, and this appears to be borne out by I thefiguresbefore us. In one factory eight hands made nearly 12,000 gallons in a year, and, as tlie annual consumption of bhe colony is about 40,000 gallons, about 27 hands could at the same rate make sufficient for our internal trade. It is not probable thatfchetrade could spread beyond the limits of Victoria, as long as a heavy duty remains on linseed oil, which is one of bhe principal ingredients used in bhe manufacture. The price of varnish rauges from os. per gallon to 28s. per gallon ; a duby of 2s. per gallon, therefore, equals 40 per cent, on the lowest class, and 7 per cent, I on.* fche best descriptions. The average rate, according to fche Customs returns, is approximately 22A per cent. ' ab present.",47,Malcol M Mceacharn Be Satisfied With A Specific Duty Under

303,Mr Henry Avillis,"The name isThe honourable member for Melbourne Ports is seeking to impose upon the .Commonwealth a duty on varnish very much higher than that borne under several of the old Tariffs. In New South Wales this article was admitted free. In Queensland there was a duty of 25 per cent.; in South Australia 6d. pei gallon; and in Tasmania Is. 6d. per gallon. It will thus be seen that the Government proposal is no compromise. It is seeking to enforce upon us the high duty which prevailed in Victoria, where an inferior article which is not suitable for the requirements of the trade is produced. Eveni f the duty be imposed it will not be tlie means of producing a better class of varnish, because it appears that the manufacturer is not able to make it . We shall find that an import duty of 2s. per gallon will amount to something like £3,000 a year, while the wages of the men employed in the local industry, assuming that they receive £100 a year each, would not exceed £2,700 per annum. Therefore, the people will actually be required to pay a duty in excess of the full amount of wages earned in the manufacture of this article. I shall support the amendment. received a statement from Harland and honourable gentleman would not receive Son, amongst the largest importers of these people in connection with the Tariff. goods in the State of Victoria, and I desire to refer to the suggestions they quote as deputations. having been made by various persons to the Minister for Trade and Customs and the deputations the Minister would not receive.

Son's circular states that the Trades Hall representatives on a deputation suggested a duty of Is. per gallon and 5 per cent, ad valorem, which is equal to 17 per cent. Surely there is some truth in that statement, and it is not made merely with a view to cheat members of the committee into agreeing to a lower rate of duty than would otherwise be imposed upon this article. The proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney is that there should be a duty of Is. 6d. per gallon, and that would be equal to 17 J per cent, ad valorem. So that the Trades Hall representatives seem to suggest an absolutely lower duty than that suggested by the honourable member. The coachbuilders are said to have made another statement.

The Trades Hall deputation who waited upon an officer of customs, asked for nothing of the kind. The Trades Hall would support tbe proposal of the Government, because they recognise that varnish of the very best quality can be, and is being,'produced here, and is being used by some of the leading coachbuilders. The honourable member for Robertson has quoted from a report which be has been told several times is se\ en years old. The Legislative Assembly of Victoria placed their Tariff on the statute-book after that report had been presented. That has also been stated times out of number, and yet the report is continually being read as though it were something new, and as though it were a discovery to which honourable members should attach great weight. the sense to listen to it, though the Viccent, upon it .

The minority report was accepted and acted upon by the people of Victoria through their representatives in the Legislative Assembly, and what, therefore, is the use of quoting the majority report as representing the opinions of the people of Victoria? Varnish, it appaars now, is another thing which we cannot make. In tbe name of Heaven what can we make except soldiers and politicians? It is admitted that we can make them first class, but I am of opinion that we can make first-class articles t of any kind.

The composite duties have been abandoned, and we ask tbe committee to accept a duty of 2s. per gallon, the rate fixed in connection with other similar items of manufacture. We have agreed to a duty of 4s. in some cases and 2s. in others, and we propose the lower duty i u connection with these varnishes. I hope the committee will not yield to the solicitations of honourable members opposite. Seeing that this article is the raw material of a number of tradesmen, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports ought to be builders are as good an authority on this wealth who are outside the coachbuilding trade altogether.

Sir EDWARD again! am not at all staggered, as that kind of thing is becoming so frequent, from the source I have mentioned. able member for Melbourne Ports seems to be taking charge offcheMinisterial business, and he has now got to the length of speaking about what "" we propose "" and "" we submit."" It gives some support to a rumour that the honourable member is acting as the dry nurse of the Government in dealing with this Tariff. MightI suggest to the honourable member when he is so impatient about the reading of a document some years old, that a.much more recent document issued by the Government throws a very strong light upon the item before the committee. The Government are proposing for us the highest duty in connection with this article which existed before federation, and that is the Victorian duty. The people of Australia were told by the Prime Minister, speaking for the whole of the Government, at Maitland, that the Victorian Tariff would not be the model taken by the Government for their Tariff, and was in fact the very last one that would be taken, because the right honourable gentleman regarded it as an extreme protectionist Tariff. He said that the aim of the Government would be to frame a Tariff which would be a happy medium between the two extremes of free-trade in New South Wales and the high Tariffi n Victoria. we find the Treasurer and his colleague bringing this maximum Australian duty forward as if they were making a very graceful surrender of their position. It seems to me that the proposal made by the honourable member for North Sydney is a I should like to say, perfectly reasonable one, and might very well have been accepted. I admit that the Government have now made a much better proposal than the one which was the result of a great deal of deliberation. Are we now fco 'suppose that as the Government have steadily given up these composite duties one after another, they have determined not to force that principle upon the committee in connection with the Tariff? able gentleman should never suppose anything. suppose anything based upon what Ministers composite duty in the case of so maay articles, we ought to be in a position to suppose that they intend to give them up in all. in the case of cigars. cigar people upon their success, but it only strengthens the force of my observation. The Government have adhered to the composite duty in one case, and have given it up in other cases, and I wish to know if there is to be any consistency. Surely the principle is a good one or a bad one ? If it is a good one why not adopt it right through, or, afc any rate, to the extent which the Government originally proposed ? However, as there is still a doubt, we are not yet in a position to assure the people of Australia that the Government have given up these composite duties. When the rabid Minister for Trade arid Customs was in a position in the most misgoverned Soate in Australia-South Australia-whic h he has desperately, but unsuccessfully, attempted to occupy here, the duty on varnishes, varnish stains, and enamels was only 6d. per gallon, and the duty on things like pefcrif}'ing liquids and dampwall compositions, 10 per cent. Yet we are told that a duty of 2s. per gallon is a triumph of moderation.

In addition to the factory he manages an adjoining hotel. The factory is a dilapidated shanty, but the hotel is going strong. He sells his varnishes considerably below the prices charged by other people, because of their poor quality. Is the Treasurer proud of a composite undertaking of that sort ? I submit thatfcheproposal of the honourable member for North Sydney is thoroughly reasonable, and while I do not wish to see unnecessary divisions, I think that, by way of protest, we should place upon record our desire to carry out the Maitland programme in this matter. It was only because of that programme that the life of the Ministry was possible. It was there promised that there would be a fair compromise between the exorbitant Victorian Tariff, which produced the monstrosity to which I have just referred, and the free-trade policy of New South Wales, and I ask Victorians, who are enjoying the advantages of federal union, to help us in securing the performance of the promise made at Maitland. We are fighting the battle of the manufacturers nowthe battle of the thousands who use paints and varnishes, against this one man who runs a hotel and grocery store in conjunction with a varnish factory.

As to this item, two members of that -deputation, members of the Trades Hall Council, and representing a union, did recommend a duty lower than that which the Government proposed, but in every -other case they recommended a duty either as high as that which the Government proposed, or higher. Of course, in the latter instances, our honourable friends on the other -side ignore any proposal which was made by any such deputation for any increase, and assume that they were nobodies.

My impression was that they did not object to the Victorian duty being imposed on this particular line. Honourable members on the other side unwittingly, I believe, assume that this is the Victorian duty. Under the Victorian Tariff the duty on methylated spirits was only Is. per gallon.

The honourable member for North Sydney will agree that it does not show as large a margin. free before'? less than it is now. I believe we have carried a duty of 3s. per gallon on methylated spirits, and the excise duty is 6d. per gallon. I trust that the committee will reject the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney. I am prepared to vote for a duty of 2s. per gallon all round, but if we do not get that, I intend to ask the committee to make a separate line of ""lithographic varnish."" In the manufacture of this varnish, the linseed oil has to be burnt, and as it takes nine gallons of oil to make eight gallons of varnish, honourable members will see that it will make the manufacturer's position considerably worse. I have here a price-list from a reputable English firm, showing that the price of lithographic varnish varies from 6s. 9d. to 10s. 6d. per gallon. The ACTING CHAIRMAN ( Mr Batchelor) I do not think that the honourable member can move to make a separate line of lithograph varnish, because tbe committee has already added words to the item.

They are not on this side, and as the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs have repeatedly quoted from tlie report, which they will not allow me to do able member that during the whole of the proceedings on the TariffI have not quoted once from the report. the impression that it had been quoted, but I must accept the Minister's disclaimer. My copy is in the hands of the Ha/nswrd staff, otherwise I should beableto read the minority report which does not affect the varnish trade against this onslaught on the public on whatever. The Treasurer was in a state of great indignation just now, because we would not. mention names. I never mention names if I can help doing so. In most cases I can help myself, and I do not give the names. But as he wishes to know what the names are, I would refer him to that report, which is voluminous. A great number of manufacturers in all trades gave evidence, to the effect that the varnish was not suitable to their manufactures, and without exception it was admitted, even by the manufacturer himself, that he could not produce a varnish suitable to their requirements. So that all that has been brought out by the leader of the Opposition, and supported as bearing on this item, they have such by his followers, is borne out by the evidence given before the Tariff Commission. The Government should propose a reasonable compromise between the A ictorian 7 duty and the low duty in South Australia or Tasmania, and should not force on the Commonwealth once again the high A icr torian tariff that has been, I suppose, an absolute failure. The leader of the Opposition stated that there were sev,en men and one or two boys employed in the industry. The commission stated that there were but eight hands employed, and that they could hear of only two men being engaged in the industry. All that has been contended has been proved, and I hope that Ministers will show some consideration for the people of Australia, and fix a duty that will be acceptable to the Opposition. the strictures passed by the Treasurer upon the possession of the members of the comme and other members of the Opposition mittee? were entirely undeserved. If there is any personal character given to our consideration officer is accessible to any honourable member. of these items it arises from what I have always considered a most regrettable fact that when there is an attempt to fasten burdens on the people, tlie names of certain manufacturers in Melbourne are quoted on the other side of the Chamber. Their namesare brought in here not for the purpose of relieving the people from burdens, but for the purpose of taking money out of . their pockets. If any personal tone has been introduced, or if references have been made to manufacturers, it has arisen mainly from I was under the fact that a large number of objectionable propositions have been passed through the committee, by the use of the names of individuals as being embarked in a certain industry. It is our duty on this side, as behalf of individuals, to endeavour as far as we can, to protect the great mass of the people from these burdens. The great mass of the men who use this varnish, and upon whom this proposal comes as a tax, have no medals to show, butthey are men who pay their way, carry on a lawful calling, and vastly outnumber the men for whom the Government are standing up. AVe have not had handed to us a list of medals gained by. individual manufacturers. The Government are in that position. They are in close communication with the manufacturer, and the moment some reference is made to his industry, and the fortunes of his enterprise, admirable information about all these items that a Minister of the Crown is able to jump up at once to tell the committee where he won his medals, and what he won them for. The men who make varnish have opportunities of communication with the Cabinet, which the great mass of the men who have to pay this duty have not. Mi-.

I have had a great deal to do with building operations, and have had an opportunity of judging of the advantages arising from the use of varnish, and I do nob think that the small amount of employmenb given in bhe manufacbure of the article would justify us in imposing a heavy tax upon those who use it . make one statement which I think it is only fair bo place before bhe commibtee. I referred bo a manufacburer in Melbourne, and bhe very adverse conditions under which he laboured. I now have great pleasure in stating that the son of this manufacturer started a varnish factory in Sydney some few years ago, and that he employs two or three times the number of hands that are employed by his father, and pays away twice the amount of wages per week. I believe in encouraging enterprises of bhis sorb as much as I can, and when I was ab bhe head of bhe New Soubh Wales Governmenb I gave directions that when an article was made within the State, the manufacturer should have an opportunity of tendering for that one article apart from, any others that might be required at the same time. I hope the Commonwealth Government will adopt a similar practice. In this particular case I made it possible, for the manufacburer bo obbain Governmenbconbracbs bybenderingfor the supply of the one commodity produced by him. I also omitted to mention another large varnish factory in one of the suburbs -of Melbourne, in which the proprietor of the establishment and two boys are employed in making varnishes for bedsteads. In order to show that I was not indulging in any exaggeration when I was speaking of the large number of people who use varnish, I desire to mention some of the industries in which it forms one of the articles of consumption. They include I could not poscoach-building, house-painting, furnituremaking, Japanning works, bedstead works, shipping and boat building, agriculI f any considerable tural implement works, and many others. In addition to this, the Treasurer when he speaks of the assistance given to these industries must remember bhab bhe probecbion exbended under bhe Victorian Tariff. hear the leader of the Opposition state that there is a flourishing varnish factory in New South Wales, the proprietorof which employs three times as many men as are engaged in the industry in Victoria.

That after the word '* sod ""fcheword "" wood"" be inserted, and that the word ""benzine"" be omitted. In this connection I would point out to the committee that naphtha and benzine are mineral oils, and practically stand on the same footing as gasoline, which we have already declared shall be dutiable. Asi t would be impossible for the Customs department to distinguish between them, it would be wise to omit naphtha from the free list. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South' Sydney). -Before we consider the list of exemptions I should like to remind the Minister for Trade and Customs that a few weeks ago I submitted to him a communication from the leading Sydney merchants who are interested in importations of paints and varnishes, complaining of the duties which are charged upon outside cases. According to the regulations the duties are chargeable where the goods are not free or are subject to 29 B a fixed duty. Of course these goods were Against. not subject to fixed, but to composite. I Bamford, F. W. Now that the composite duties have been | Deakin, A. discarded in favour of fixed duties, I wish to ' Salmon, C. C. know whether these outside packages will Sawers, W. B. S. C. be admitted free ? Fysh, Sir P. O. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (MelMacdonald-Paterson, T. bourne) I wish to point out some of the McColl, J. H. anomalies which exist in connection with Piesse, F. W. this matter. In many cases the packages cost more than the goods, as they cannot Watson, J. C. possibly be manufactured within the ComManifold, J. C. monwealth, as no manufacturer in England Higgins, H. B. will send his goods out in bulk to be repacked and relabelled at the discretion of the Australian importer. Also the duty on packages is, in some respects, anomalous. For instance, if paint is imported in 14-lb. iron kegs shipped loose, these packages are ""outside"" packages, and, by a recent In order to decision of the department, are exempt from, duty. If , however, the same kegs arepacked in casks to. insure delivery in bettercondition they become "" inside "" packages and are consequently dutiable. The duty on packages also seriously affects the smaller buyer, as it increases as the size of the package is reduced, Should paint be imported in 28-lb. kegs there is no duty on the packages. If , however, the same paint is imported in 7-lb. tins, such as are required by the ordinary painter, duty is payable on about os. per cwt., if in 1-lb. tins on 13s. per cwt., and if in i-Ib. tins on 22s. per cwt. for the packages I m o v e alone. This is an important matter to consider, especially as it applies to the smaller man. to mention the point which has been raised, by the honourable member for Melbourne. As stated by him under a recent decision of the Customs department, iron kegs containing white lead, varnishes, ifcc, areexempt from duty. But the practice exists, of sending out kegs of this material packedin casks to .insure their landing in bettercondition. Under the decision to which I have referred the outside casks would probably be admitted free, but the inside kegs,, which are practically outside packages, would be dutiable. Then, as the. honourable member for Melbourne has said, there would be a duty of about 5s. per cwt. upon the packages containing paint if it is imported in 7-lb. tins, of 13s. per cwt. if it is imported in 1-lb. tins, and of 22s. per cwt. if it is imported in A-lb. tins.

373,Mr Reid (East Sydney),"I was goingTrade and Customs knows, most journeymen painters buy these 7-lb. tins. They would thus be placed at a distinct disadvantage as compared with those who obtained their paint in bulk. However, I think the miscellaneous section is the best place at which to deal with matters of this sort. substituted a fixed duty for a fixed duty with an ad valorem rate, I believe some of the points of complaint which have arisen will disappear. The particular matter which has been referred to by the leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Melbourne has not yet come before me. RutI will look into it . It is a matter upon which I would not like to commit myself offhand. I would further remind honourable members that the whole question of packages is a very interesting one, and we have provided for its discussion in the latter part of the Tariff'. 1 do not intend, therefore, to anticipate its diseussion at this stage. Amendment agreed to. Sir EDWARDBRADD ON (Tasmania). I take exception to the first of the exemptions in connection with paints and colours -artists ' colours.

Surely artists can afford to pay duty on their colours 1 They will be rewarded, according to merit, in proportion to what they produce. The small amount of duty levied on their colours would be something so inconsiderable that there is no reason why we should pay any attention to it . I move That the words ""Colours, artists',"" be omitted. with the right honourable member for Tasmania. The duty on ordinary colours is 4s. per cwt. I cannot conceive that any artist would be seriously handicapped by being called upon to pay 4s. per cwt. more for his colours. paint a cyclorama. that an artist would not use .many cwts. of colours. This exemption reminds me very much of the cartoon in Punch depicting two country people looking at a picture, and one of them remarking to the other that the paint used upon it must liave cost £ 5 , let alone the labour of the man in laying it on. This exemption seems to be conceived in very much the same spirit. I do not think that a duty on artists' colours would save any of the States from insolvency, should they be threatened with such a disaster : but it does look like the refinement of ingenuity to allow artists' colours to come in free. that such a stout protectionist as the honourable and learned member for Corinella is able to see the anomaly of allowing artists' colours to be free when all other colours are liable to a duty. Tliis proposal shows that Ministers must be votaries of the fine arts. I would remind them that when I pleaded the cause of other artists-me n who paint ships, men who labour long and do not give their wares to the wealthy alone-the Government could not see their way clear to place the particular preservatives used by them upon the free list. As a free-trader, the only point I can see in the Government proposal is that the amount of duty on artists' colours would be so small that it would not pay to collect it . It cannot MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) -Are the Government going to accept the amendment ? valorem duty on colours has been struck out, and all that remains is a duty of 4s. per cwt.

Whoever buys a picture worth anything^ in this country ? Last year Pierpont Morgan paid more for one picture than the whole of Australia spent on works of art. Although this item may seem to be small, the children of the poor who go to the public schools, and from whom the artists come, would have to pay the duty. Artists' colours are not manufactured, i^a. the country, and consequently the strugglers, the masses, from whom all tlie genius of' the world comes, would have to suffer if a duty were imposed. to point out that the attempt of Ministers to mollify the honourable member for Kennedy is scarcely a happy one. They said that now that the duty of 15 per cent. ad valorem was taken off, the matter was not worth fighting for, just as if they did not exempt artists' colours from the Is. duty as well as from the composite duty. member is a little mixed in regard to this matter. Althoughi t is not worthwhile grumbling about this proposal, the trouble of collecting the duty on artists' colours at the rate of 4s. per cwt. seems likely to be of such an extent that it is difficult to decide what is the -right policy to adopt in the circumstances. Had. the-larger duty prevailed, it might have been worthwhile to collect it on artists' colours, but as that has been struck off I am inclined to think that the exemption should stand as it is. -""Will the two right honourable Ministers in charge of the Tariff come to some agreement on this suDject' One of them tells us that it is utterly uselessto attempt to 29 B 2 charge a duty on artists' colours, while the other says that it is not advisable to collect it, because it is so small. The argument that During this year I the collection of the duty would involve a certain amount of trouble is absolutely absurd, and if it were applied all through the Tariff we should have nearly everything on the free list. tion of artists' materials in Australia ? not know. This may develop art in the community ; canvases by the mile may be covered by artists if they find that in so doing they will not be called upon to contribute to the revenue. allow this proposed exemption to go without protesting against the invidious class distinction sought to be made. Ordinary painters who have to point in the broiling sun from day to day have to pay 4s. per cwt. for the paint they use, but the average artist who sits in a luxurious studio, puts on an. ounce of paint a month, and then scrapes it off, and perhaps uses the same paint a dozen times over, is to have his colours placed on tbe aristocratic free list of this conservative Administration. The Government proposal is utterly absurd. It will cost twice as much for the Customs to prove that colours are exempt as it would cost to collect the duty.
