In Committee (/Consideration of Senate's amendments resumed from 29th November, vide page 7536): Clause 4""Industrial dispute"" means a dispute in relation to industrial matters(a) arising between an employer or an organization of employers on the one part and an organization of employees on the other part, or (4) certified by the Registrar as proper in the the Federal tribunal. Any one who imagines public interest to be dealt with by the Courtand extending beyond the limits of any one State, including disputes in relation to employment upon State railways, or lo employment in industries carried on by or under the control of the Commonwealth or a State or any public authority constituted under the Commonwealth or a State; but it does not incluude a dispute relating to employment in any agricultural, viticultural, horticultural, or dairying pursuit; Senate's Amendment -Leav e out ""but it does not include a dispute relating to employment in any agricultural, viticultural, horticultural, or dairying pursuit."" External Affairs) -Before we proceed to discuss the amendments made in this Bill by tlie Senate, I wish to justify a statement which I made yesterday, the accuracv of which was denied by the leader of the Opposition. As honourable members will recollect, I represented the honourable member as having laid great stress upon the difficulty -unde r the amendment submitted by the honourable and learned member for Corinella-of ascertaining whether a majority of those interested in any industry approved of the granting of a preference to unionists. I stated that his objection to the proposal was mainly based upon that ground. Without making any further remarks. I wish to quote from page 4045 of Hansard. If honourable members will turn to that publication, they will see the speech which was delivered by the leader of the Opposition upon the amendment of the present Minister of Defence in opposition to the proposal of the then Government, to recommit .the preference clause of the Bill. The honourable member for Bland follower! the honourable and learned member for Corinella, and in the course of his speech made these remarksIt is therefore quite possible that the interests should be insured before a preference was of all children employed in an industry might be affected by an award, and the Court would have to be satisfied, under the honourable and learned member's amendment, that the application for a preference was approved by a majority o of the children as well as of the adults concerned. I take it ""that ""satisfied"" means that the Court shall be satisfied in the clearest and most unmistakable way that the majority of those affected have approved of the demand for preference. not object to the provision for a majority ? every case, in all the Arbitration Courts, has been to grant a preference only when the majority, reasonably ascertained, is in favour of such a preference. I am not so foolish as to anticipate that the practice laid down by the Arbitration Courts of New Zealand and New South Wajes will be departed from by the Judge appointed to that the Judge in the Federal Court would lay down a new line of procedure-that he would grant preferences to unions which manifestly represented only a minority of those employed in the industry or in the district in respect of which the preference was asked-canno t have paid any attention to the general procedure under legislation of this kind. I contend that the objection to the honourable and learned member for Corinella's amendment, as a detail of preference-no t as affecting preference as a principle-is that it would be absolutely impossible in a great number of cases to prove that the majority of the industry concerned approved of the application. I make that quotation in justification of my statement yesterday. the quotation which has just been made by the Prime Minister does not controvert my statement of yesterday. WhatI said then was that, so far as the principle of preference was concerned, I did not give way to any limitation of the right of the President of the Arbitration Court to declare whether or not a preference should' be granted. I replied to an interjection by the honourable member for Franklin to the effect that I did not object to providing that the consent of a majority of those interested in any industry should be necessary, but I fear that the use of the word "" no"" in the report of my remarks is inconsistent with what I said immediately afterwards. WhatI was attempting to convey was that I did not object to the principle that the Judge should insist upon obtaining the approval of a majority before granting a preference. 1 evidenced that both before and after the interjection of the honourable member for Franklin. I stated that I preferred to trust the Court unfettered, but I quite expected to get from it in practice an insistence that a majority of those engaged in any particular industry, or something approaching one, granted. cepts the principle of the amendment, but objects to it being expressed in the Bill ?",14,Mounted Infantry Regiments

Prime Minister to-day made a personal explanation. statement concerning all the amendments made in the B ill by the Senate, and the honourable member for Kennedy asked whether other honourable members would be afforded an opportunity of adopting the same course. the affirmative, because"" I thought it would be very unfair if honourable memlbers were not allowed to do so. In my judgment it would meet the convenience of fhe Committee if honourable members tude to that which was extended to me. Then when the general discussion has been exhausted, we shall be in a position to deal with particular amendments. course suggested by the Prime Minister will facilitate business, because it will assist us to arrive at some conception of the trend of matters before we address ourselves to the Senate's amendments. seems to me that if there be any real anxiety on the part of a majority of honourable members to carry out their pledges to the electors to give effect to the principle of compulsory arbitration, we ought I accept the principle to welcome any proposal which will expedite the passage of the measure. I trust that the Committee will see the wisdom of allowing the general debate to continue until honourable members have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to express their views. Asi l indicated yesterday, I exceedingly regret that the Government have not seen fit to go further towards meeting the views of the Senate in connection with this B ill . The Prime Minister has atThe honourable member tempted to set up the position that there is no obligation upon his part or upon the .part of this Committee to go any appreciable distance in the direction of meeting the Senate, because the views which it has expressed in the amendments before us are not those of an ordinary second Chamber, but are rather the opinions of another branch of .the party which happens to be in Opposition. That is one of the most astounding statements which I have ever heard from a gentleman occupying the I think that the responsible position of Prime Minister. He suggests that in casting up the respective positions of the two Houses we should enter into the detailed beliefs and political ideas of every member of the other Chamber. I have never heard that view expressed before. So far from these amendments representing merely the opinion of the Labour Party in the Senate, they reflect in addition the views of a fair proportion of senators who are not members of that party, and owe no allegiance to it . But even if the statement of the Prime Minister were justified, and we had a right to consider that aspect of the matter, the fact would I replied in still remain that the amendments made by the Senate are approved' by some of those who, upon matters of general politics, support the right honourable gentleman. One or two members of the other branch of the Legislature who vote with his party are were allowed similar latijointly responsible with the Labour Party for some of these amendments. Buti f the Government entertain any real anxiety to pass this Bill into law, should they stand upon considerations of that character? What does it matter to us to which party a majority of members of the Senate belong when it comes to a question of enacting legislation which the people have demanded at two elections in the most emphatic manner possible? Recently, a meIt morial was circulated amongst the members of both branches of this Parliament by the Employers' Union, in which they asked the Ministry to drop this Bill, urging against its constitutionality and general",15,Conciliation And Arbitration

46,Mr Watson (Bland),"I think theexpediency a number of considerations which apply particularly to their view of the question. Although the Ministry have not ostensibly agreed to the opinions expressed by the Employers' Union, it seems to me that they approach dangerously close to doing so when they adopt the attitude of declaring that, they intend to pass over with contumely all the amendments proposed by the Senate. In effect, they say, "" Take this or leave it . "" I do not know whether or not the hope is present that the Bill will be dropped, but the position wears that sinister complexion, when we recollect that the attitude of the Ministry is coincident with the view which has been expressed by the Employers' Union. mise does the honourable member expect from the Ministry? at a later stage. In themeantime I draw attention to the fact that there is no measure of compromise. Of course, I can understand the anxiety of the honourable and learned member in regard to this matter, seeing that the memorial to which I have referred consists for the most part of a laudation of himself. morial. the honourable and learned member has done so. At the same time, I may inform him that it credits him with having almost successfully placed immovable barriers in the way of the B ill. Although it does not bear upon the amendments which are immediately under consideration, itasserts that they afford a good opportunity to throw the Bill overboard, and revert to the position which was previously taken up by the honourable and learned member. states that whilst the employees' side of the question is represented in this Chamber, the employers are without any representation. It seems to me that that is an indication of grave ingratitude on the part of the Employers' Federation. They have had the help of quite a number of honourable members of this House. The honourable and learned member for Wannon has given them every possible assistance., and I think the Federation show that they are guilty of gross ingratitude, when they are not even prepared to recognise the Herculean services rendered in their behalf by the honourable member for Kooyong. While many honourable members opposite do not adopt in set terms the designation of employers' representatives, they make it their business on all occasions to so attempt to safeguard their interests that there is no reason for them to complain of non-representation in this Chamber. With a view to prevent the passing of this measure, another statement has been made by this organization to the effect that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of New South Wales, upon which this Bill was originally largely framed, has retarded investment, and harassed employers in that State. The latest statistics available are those for the year ending 31st December, 1903, and it is curious to find, on referring to Coghlan, that during that period-notwithstandin g the effects of a drought of the greatest severity that the State has ever experienced, and which has had a paralyzing influence upon a large number of industries-ther e was an increase of I shall allude to that nearly .£250,000 in the capital invested in manufactories. This increase took place, despite the fact that the drought compelled a number of employers to close their factories pending a general revival in ' trade, and that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was also in operation. the new protection. stage to discuss other issues. The Em ployerfs' Federation also assert that the operation of the State Act has led to a lessening of employment in New South Wales. We find, however, on turning to the statistics for the year 1903, that, notwithstanding the effects of the ' drought, there was an actual increase of employment in industries which were subject to awards given by the Court. In that year the following reductions in the number of employees in different industries took place It in New South Wales:-Flou r mills, 6 1 ; breweries, 64; sugar refineries, 116; brick works, 52; boiling down, tanneries, woolwashing, &c -and the reduction in this case would certainly be due to the drought -400 ; engineering, 900; meat preserving, 240; docks and slips, 350; a total reduction in these industries of over 2,200. In many other branches of industry there was an increase in the number of hands employed ; but to none of those which I have just quoted-and they are the only industries in which any substantial reduction has occurred-ha s an award of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court ibeen applied. On the contrary, according to Mr Coghlan, there has been an increase in the number of persons employed in every industry in",16,Conciliation And Arbitration

As a matter of fact, no award applying to them has been made. is all I wish to prove. The falling off in the number of persons* employed has not been due to the operation of the State Act. simply controverting an argument of the other side. that these facts show that a Conciliation and Arbitration Court is a good thing in itself, but they disprove the statements made in the memorial to which I have referred. Coming to the amendments made by another place, the Prime Minister stated yesterday that the fact that the provisions in the New Zealand and New South Wales Acts, allowing the Court to interfere in disputes affecting agricultural labourers, had not been availed of, was a reason why no provision should be made in this B ill for the settlement of any disputes that may occur amongst those engaged in such an occupation. I admit that for eight or nine years past the Conciliation and Arbitration Court of New Zealand has had the power to deal with disputes amongst agricultural labourers, and that during, that period no such dispute has been submitted to the Court. But there is a variety of reasons for that. In the first place, in New Zealand, agricultural labourers are in. a much better position than they are in Australia. that. wages were paid two years ago, when I visited New Zealand, and I am also aware of the wages paid to those engaged in similar employment in some parts of New South Wales. So far as I am aware, the conditions both in regard to than are those prevailing in Australia. member saw the statement made a few days ago by the Premier of New Zealand that the cost of living had increased by thirty per cent. ? That lowers the purchasing value of the wages. not relate wholly to goods which an agricultural labourer must buy. The cost of living, to the community as a whole, includes rent, and we all know that rent's have gone up. I deny that the cost of food, so far as agricultural labourers are concerned, has materially increased. The cost prices are not materially higher now That than they have been for some years. But owing to the increase in general prosperity, rents have gone up. Every one knows that as soon as prosperity is evident in any country, rents are raised. That fact simply proves that, however prosperous a country may be, the major portion of the benefit is secured by the owner of land. not of rents, but of Ihe cost of living. but does not the honourable and learned member recognize that he was speaking of the population generally, while I am referring to agricultural labourers, who, as a rule, live in their employers' houses, and pay no rent? wear the same things as do other members of the community. the honourable and learned member had paid particular attention to the report to which he refers, he would know that special reference was made to the increase in rents. Mr Tregear drew attention to the advanced cost of living, and said that this was due chiefly to the fact that rents had gone up. He advocated that some effort should be made to restrict the power of landlords to collect toll from the rest of the community in the manner in which they were doing. I do not wish to argue this point at length;",17,Conciliation And Arbitration

68,Mr Watson,"Of course they do. I fbut, generally speaking, the condition of the farm labourer in New Zealand is better than that obtaining in Australia. Eveni f that were not so, I admit that it is difficult to secure anything like organization among farm labourers, because to a very large extent they do not remain long in the same employ. But the fact that no organization has existed hitherto is no guarantee that many of the agricultural labourers have been organized. tural labourers. they have organized. think I am fairly correct in asserting that there is no organization of agricultural labourers as such in New Zealand, although some of them are included in organizations of ordinary labourers. That, however, is a matter of no value, so far as my present argument is concerned. The point I wish to make is that the fact that there is no organization amongst farm labourers in Australia is not a guarantee that there is no need for organization among farm labourers, or that there is no causa of complaint. The men are scattered, and it is difficult to secure united action. In my own district, however, I have known a temporary organization to be set up where men met in the harvest field for the first time, agreed to stand out for a certain wage, and succeeded. That brings me to another phase of the argument in relation to the position of agricultural labourers to which I think sufficient attention has not been directed. A number of honourable members, led by the honourable and learned member for Wannon, assume to be the farmer's champions, in these and other matters, simply because they are attempting to exclude him from the operation of this Bill. They tell us in doleful tones of the trouble which will accrue to the farmers if the provisions of this Bill are extended to them. We are told that the farming industry will not permit of a working day of eight hours, or of the pavment of a dailv wage of eight shillings. The natural assumption on the part of those who listen to such statements, and have not studied the working of Conciliation and Arbitration Acts elsewhere, is that if agricultural labourers be brought within the purview of the Court farmers will be compelled, to pay them a wage of eight shillings per day, and to observe the eight-hours system. That is simply ridiculous. It is a statement which may be good enough to put before those who take no interest in the matter, or who are so blinded by prejudice that they refuse to investigate the matter for themselves; But, as a matter of fact, it is well known that in New South Wales the Court has, on quite a number of occasions, given as an award the direction that many more than forty-eight hours a week shall be worked. the majority of cases. tion of the honourable and learned member, who is more closely acquainted with the working, of the Court than I am. I know that in respect to the trollymen and draymen the hours allowed by the Court are sixty a week. Hotel employees also work about sixty hours a week. fifty-nine hours, and the bread-carters sixty hours a week. In one of these cases an agreement as to the number of hours to be worked was come to and assented to by the Court, but in the other cases the question has been adjudicated upon by the Court. Therefore, it does not follow that if the agricultural industry were subject to the control of the Court, any but the most reasonable view would be taken of a dispute. The Court is not likely to shed its common sense merely because a dispute affecting 'farmers comes (before it . It would naturally be guided by the evidence and the conditions of the industry. in the want of uniformity and in the inequality of conditions which prevail in the farming industrj'. objection presently. With regard to wages, f find that the New South Wales Court has fixed the rate for hairdressers at 45s. a week, and for bread-carters at the same amount, without board or lodgings in each case. and dravmen have been fixed at 40s. a week. show that the Court will be guided by the circumstances of the industry, and would not be likely to impose outrageous conditions upon the farmers.

At present the farmers are dependent very largely for a supply of labour at crucial moments upon what they can obtain from the various towns. Last year, when we had an abundant harvest in New South Wales, it was often very difficult to obtain labourers at the right moment. In any case, there need be no difficulty in working this provision, so far as it affects employment in the agricultural industry. 12 G 2 If organizations were formed among the farm labourers, and demands were formulated, the condition of .the farmers without the Bill would be infinitely worse than if it were in force and applying to them. so. toria is apparently a person who is very easily alarmed.

I should like to say a few words with respect to domestic servants. I do not pretend that this is a very important matter, because in the first place it seems as though it will be a considerable time before any organization that will affect a number of States is formed amongst domestic servants. Further, it would be much more difficult to insist that a dispute between employer and employed, affecting only domestic servants, came within the purview of the Constitution, than would be the case in other classes of employment. At the same time, I feel, as I felt when this matter was under discussion before, that, although it is not of pressing importance, it would be wise not to hamper the Court by imposing restrictions as to the class of persons to whom the Act shall apply.

Yesterday the Prime Minister urged the great diversity of climate and of the conditions of their employment generally throughout Australia as a reason why farm labourers should not be included within the scope of this Bill, but he failed to observe that his argument had rather a boomerang sort of effect upon his own proposals with regard to preference. If the diversified conditions which exist throughout the Commonwealth-the differences of climate and the scattered nature of our population-constitut e an objection to including agricultural labourers within the scope of this measure, surely those conditions are ten times more effective as an objection to the restriction upon preference which is involved in the amendment adopted at the instance of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. make an Act work smoothly in respect of agricultural labourers owing to the different conditions which obtain throughout Australia, how much more difficult is it to insure that the wishes of the majority of those who are likely to be affected by any award of the Arbitration Court shall be ascertained and conveyed to .that tribunal ? In the absence of a provision relating to preference, it seems to me that the whole scheme for compulsory arbitration must fall to the ground. ' Unless the unions have some direct interest in upholding the decisions of the Court, they are not likely to concern themselves in insisting upon effect being given to its awards, and especially if those awards involve a reduction of wages. been granted to unionists at Newcastle, would the Employes Association have insisted upon the Teralba miners resuming work? I contend that it would not. Further, unless the unions are recognised as bodies charged with the responsibility of assisting the Court, there is no possibility of effect being given to its awards. In speaking of .the case of the trolley and draymen in Sydney the. other day, Judge Cohen made some remarks upon the preference question, which, I think, it would be advantageous for me to quote. He adopted the attitude which was previously assumed by Chief Justice Stout in New Zealand, where no specific provision that a preference should be granted to unionists was contained in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Chief Justice of that country and his colleagues unanimously held that the granting of such a preference was an essential condition to the operation of the Act, and that the law did not contemplate the settlement, of disputes between employers and individual workmen, but only of disputes between employers and organizations. The Court held that the whole measure was based upon organizations, and not upon individuals. contested now. honourable member is one of those who is prepared to consent to the granting of a so called preference to unionists, whilst taking every step to insure that no real preference shall be extended to them. rule.

We should allow it to decide fully and fairly, in the light of all the evidence that is obtainable. I need scarcely point out that we propose to entrust that tribunal with the determination of issues which are almost incalculable. I Why, the whole question of employment within the Commonwealth will be dependent upon the judgment of its members. The President will hold within the palm of his hand all the industrial enterprises of Australia, and conceivably might, under some circumstances-if , for example, he were suddenly to develop insanityimpose conditions which would result in closing them. Of course, we do not anticipate any such result, but it seems to me that some honourable members take up a peculiarly illogical position. Whilst they are prepared to vest these plenary powers in the Court, they hesitate to allow it to exercise a. discretion in the matter of granting a preference to unionists. I cannot understand swallowing the camel and straining at the gnat in that way. I admit that there are many honourable members upon the opposite side of the Chamber who, some time ago, were equally anxious with me that we should pass a Conciliation and as possible. I trust that they will seriously consider any amendment which may be submitted, and not determine in anticipation to insist upon effect being given to every jot and tittle of our previous decisions. I now wish to address myself to members will recollect that, in that provision, an amendment was moved by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, the effect of which was to prohibit the submission of plaints to the' Court by any organization whose rules or binding decisions allowed its funds to be devoted to political purposes, or which required its members to do anything of a political character. Thereupon the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs proposed that under similar conditions no preference should be granted. He affirmed that the plaints, but that no preference should be granted which that provision now reads, although I know that it represents the general wish. It does not affirm that unionists may not get a preference upon the application of a person who is bound by the award. be able to interpret language from a legal stand-point as well as can the honourable and learned member, but it seems to me that the use of the words "" shall not be entitled "" practically precludes the Court from",24,Conciliation And Arbitration

When the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs was submitted I was prepared, on behalf of the then Government, to accept it.

It precludes, for instance, a union devoting any money to any political object, even if all its members be in agreement. union. union as an organization to which preference had been granted, or was proposed to be granted. If the clause were passed as it left this Chamber for another place, it would render it impossible for a union to make a grant towards any object of a political character, however worthy it might be, and even if its members were unanimously in favour of that course. I think that the amendment in question was put forward to prevent anything in the nature of the coercion of a member of an organization in the direction of party politics. It was held to be undesirable that an individual member of a union should be coerced to support, say, a member of the Labour Party, or that its funds should be used for party political purposes. politics do not cover the whole sphere of a union's operations in the political world. Every one is aware that long before the Labour Party was thought of as a political entity, unions were compelled by necessity to resort to political action. Almost every day they had to take political action in some shape or other ; agitations had to be conducted in order that the public conscience might be aroused in regard to existi n g conditions which prejudicially affected labour. But as the result of the amendment which we madei, any union 1 I cannot follow the desiring to conduct a public agitation in reference to legislation, and without regard to party politics, would have to refrain from doing so, and to continue to suffer the injustice which that might involve, unless it was prepared to forego the preference that might be essential to the proper working of an award of the Court. A Conciliation and Arbitration Court cannot deal with all the conditions that surround a workman.

Every member of a union might be of opinion that such action should be taken, but, as the result of our decision, it would be unable to do so, except at the risk of losing any chance of preference. the members of a union were unanimously in favour of subscribing to a certain object, men might still be forced to join one in some of the objects of which they did not believe. tinction between a proposal affecting the living and working conditions of members of the union, and one of a party political character, which might have for its object the return of a member of. a particular party to Parliament. this matter in relation to the question of presure to the farming industry was exhausference, and it seems to me to be altogether a misnomer to talk of giving preference to a union, if those who belong to it are to do none of those things that are open to a union as ordinarily constituted. When we impose such a limitation we depart from the ideal of a real preference, as well as from the true ideal of unionism. I submit these considerations to the Committee, so that it may have some idea of what honourable members of the Opposition desire. Committee will exhibit some real anxiety to pass the Bill, and to pass it in an effective shape. I believe that a majority of honourable members have that desire; and I certainly do not think that the Billi f passed in the form proposed by the Government would be effective. It would not be satisfactory to the people of Australia, or to the members of another place. Seeing that the downfall of a Government is not involved-that so far as the Treasury benches are concerned, it is immaterial what course be takenI feel that, as these conflicting matters, which intervened when the » question was before us on a previous occasion, are out of the way, honourable members will now have an opportunity to consider it without prejudice; and consequently I appeal earnestly to them to make some ; effort to improve the Bill, and to render it that there is really no question before the Chair, and I therefore suggest that the Minister in charge of the Bill should submit a motion upon which a general discussion might take place. That the amendment be disagreed to. I submit this motion on the understanding that honourable members will be entitled to carry on* the discussion initiated by the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition. glad that the Government have decided to ask the Committee to disagree with three of the four amendments which have been made. On each of these a very long and exhaustive discussion took place when the Bill was before the House on a previous occasion. The debate on the amendment exempting farmers 'from the operation of the Bill extended over three or four days, and the We are discussing whole subject of the application of the meatively discussed. Honourable members of another place have asked"" us to reverse our .decision in regard to this matter. It was asserted by a leading member of the Labour Party in the Senate that the amendment submitted in this Chamber, exempting farmers from the operation of the Bill, was carried largely because of a desire to deal a blow at the Labour Party. That assertion is utterly without foundation. Almost every honourable member at present I am hopeful that the sitting on this side, as well as the honourable member for Hume, the honourable and learned member for Indi, the honourable member for Moreton, the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, and two or three other members of the Opposition, voted for the amendment.

183,Mr Robinson (Wannon),"I amBill, and I think that those reasons have been pointed out to a large extent by the interjections made this afternoon by the honourable member for Moira and one or two other honourable members on this side. The conditions of the farming industry are very different from, those of any manufacturing industry. In the latter there is, in most cases, a large amount of capital invested, and very often a great number of men working under the one roof, but in the great majority of cases farming in Australia is purely a home industry. It is carried orr by the farmer and his children. The conditions relating to it are altogether different from thosei of the manufacturing trade, and a regulation which might apply to the latter would certainly be totally inapplicable to the former. I do not wish to discuss the fiscal question, but it must not be forgotten that the manufacturers of Australia are, to some extent, shielded from competition, whereas the farmers are nqt. The products of the latter have to be sold in the markets of the world, and the world's prices must be accepted. Although our output of wheat and butter-tw o of our leading productsmay appear very large, it represents but a fraction of the quantity consumed in the mother country. As a matter of fact we have never exported more than ro per cent, of the butter and wheat consumed in Great Britain. It would be highly injurious to our export industry if our producers, who supply 10 per cent, of the requirements of Great Britain, were rendered liable to restrictions which cannot apply to the producers who supply 90 'per cent. There is no such legislation as this in the United States, the Argentine, Canada, Russia, or Denmark, and if 'we adopt it, our producers, who, in addition to having to face the competition of the world, are further removed from the world's markets than their competitors, will be seriously handicapped. learned member does not think that this provision will be effective? effective, it will be a piece of political hypocrisy to put it into the Bill. It sometimes happens, however, that provisions which are enacted in the belief that they will not be effective, are discovered to be effective. I believe in taking time by the forelock, and preventing the application of this measure to the farming industry. The honourable member for Bland drew a most harrowing picture of the evils which might result to the farmers if agriculture were not brought within its scope. He tells us that their operations might be suddenly suspended because of a strike of their employees, and that they might be ruined because their crops could not be garnered. The farmers of Australia, as a whole, however, would rather take the chance of that dire calamity thancome under the Bill. That is the attitude of 99 per cent, of them. The honourable member told us that he knew of cases in his own electorate in which farm labourers had refused to commence work because the terms offered to them were not good enough. The Bill will not cure that state of things, because there can be no strike until employment has been accepted. If the members of an association to which preference , has not been granted, or which has not been the subject of any award of the Court,. do not commence work, there is 1 nothing in the B i ll to compel them to do so. Just affer the New South Wales Arbitration Act was passed, the shearers on some stations refused to go to work, and when the pastoralists tried to force them to do so, they were told that if the men. had accepted work, and had then gone out on strike, the Arbitration Act would have reached them, but that, as they had not commenced, it did not. The Supreme Court of the State decided that there could be no strike until employment had commenced . It is true that if a union is 1 granted preference, the condition is impose3 that there must ibe a. supply of employees; but that is a different matter. I do not think that even the Watson Administration would have contended that preference would ever be granted to an association of farm labourers. Therefore, the fancy picture painted by the honourable member for'Bland should not affect honourable members. If it does, I ask them to But the honourable and recollect that the farmers of Australia are willing to risk these dire disasters rather than have the Bill forced upon them.

When the next claim for preference came before the New South Wales Arbitration Court, and it appeared that the claimant union represented only a minority of tHose engaged in the industry, the Court refused to grant preference. the first occasion upon which such an application had been denied. The Cpurt had, in a previous case, granted a preference to unionists who were distinctly in the minority. Then occurred the case referred to by the honourable member for Bland. 1 forget the name of .the union, but I think it was the Trollymen and Draymen's Union to which Judge Cohen granted preference, and laid down certain conditions. It was, in that instance, shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the union represented a large majority of the men engagedI think it was about 1,200 out of the total of 1,600. learned member is mistaken. Those are nothing like the facts. ing from memory; but the figures show that the claimant union represented a majority of those engaged in that calling. Judge Cohen said that the union fairly and substantially represented the industiy. He drew a distinction between that case and the former one, in which the union were in a distinct minority. The position taken up by the Minister of Defence is that preference should not be granted unless a majority, reasonably ascertained, of those engaged in the industry are in favour' of preference. I should like to refresh the memories of honourable memlbers as to the attitude assumed by the late Prime Minister on this question. At page 4046 he saidThe Government do not desire that preference shall be granted to minorities. We have put proposal of the honourable and learned member forward an amendment as an alternative to the for Corinella, in which we ask that before preference is granted the Court shall be satisfied that the organization substantially represents the industry affected in point of the'numbers and competence of Its members. When this proposal was discussed in the Senate, two members of the late Government were present, but neither of them had the courage to argue in support of the proposition put forward by their late colleagues as a true and just solution of the . difficulty Some disparaging remarks have been made with regard to the change of opinion on the part of the right honourable member for Swan, but I think that a more marked instance of alteration of view is afforded by the members of the late Government.

It has been asserted that 1 the farm labourers of Australia are not organized, because they have no grievances. That is another statement which is founded upon lack of experience. The fact is, that it is more difficult to organize a body of men who are scattered over the community than one whose members are grouped together. It is not correct to declare that agricultural labourers have no grievances. In this connection, I wish"" to read a letter from a workman whose attention was recently called to an article which appeared in the Argus. It reads thusDear Sir, In re the leading article of Argus, 7th of June. The man who wrote it has never worked for a farmer, or cockie, as he is universally called; I have. The Victorian cockie is the greatest menace the working man has at present. He, the former, stays at home, when work is scarce on the stations ; ploughing, & c , and employing none if he can avoid it. When the shearing comes on he secures as many stands in a shed as he can, or goes out with his waggon and horses and takes wool carting from the man who makes or tries to make a living with his team. He secures the carting by taking a lower price per ton. During shearing' the cockies have the most to say about the hours, the price of shearing, wet sheep, and finding fault with the owner of the sheep for wanting his sheep shorn well. I have shorn with them, so I know what I am saying. They profess to belong to the Australian Workers' Union when working. Go to work for them, and the whole order of things is reversed-lon g hours, sixty or seventy hours and over a week for twenty-five shillings, and wet days stopped if they can, unless you work in the rain. I ask honourable members to note that pointIn this districtHe writes from Inverleighthis year some of them refused to take the threshers in and feed them on Sunday, and if it were' not for a few honest, kindly men they could starve, and every one knows farmers have to feed the threshers. What about their hours? Sixpence an hour means fourteen Hours a day to make seven shillings. I wonder how some of the men who have the most to say would like that. Unless the thresher provides his own sleeping accommodation he can sleep out in the wet if it rains, and no consumptive patients have to do that. It is-not compulsory to work such long hours during harvest. Two farmers in Winchelsea district, who cultivate nearly 1,000 acres between them, only worked nine hours a day all the harvesting, and they got their crops off and stacked as quickly as. those who worked from daylight till dark. They also paid better wages than most of their neighbours, so if they can do 'it others can. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Arbitration Bill. He then goes on to say that farmers who cannot make a living off their land without competing with those following other avocations, should not be allowed to hold it. He points out that the wages paid in the Werribee district are zos, per week, and mentions that he is prepared to give the names of the farmers who refused to allow threshing machines to go on their farms on a Sunday, as well as the names of the two who worked their men only nine hours a day. I have known farmers to refuse to take a thresher on, a Saturday afternoon, and have seen the men following the machine compelled to camp on the road-side without tents, and left to obtain their food as best they could until the following Monday morning. I do not ""say that this is the general practice, but the cases referred to by the writer illustrate what many of these men have to put up with. When honourable members say that farm labourers receive 20s. per week, they disregard the fact that on wet days they are unable to work, and that the average earnings are thus reduced. The letter that I have read was written by a shearer and farm labourer, on whom I can rely, and he expresses the views of farm labourers-* generally. As President of the Australian Workers' Union, I am able to say that cockatoo farmers from one district in New South Wales, and from certain parts of Victoria, have been principally responsible for the cut-throat competition which has taken place in certain callings. As the writer says, they take work as wool carters, and in other directions, at very low rates, and then, in the busy season, return to their holdings. When they become employers, they almost invariably prove to be of the very worse kind. I am not satisfied with the Bill as it stands, but I do not think that any lengthy debate is likely to cause honourable members to change their minds.

For many years I did as much as l could to educate the people on this matter. four years in succession, in connection with the work of an organization, I addressed meetings in nearly every country town in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. to depend less upon the old union methods than upon social and political reform. tried to teach them to exercise the political powet which they possessed under the Constitution, by showing them that, being in a majority, they could control the Parliament if they wished to do so. I stumped every big town in eight electorates in New South Wales, just prior to the election of 1891, organizing leagues, and preaching these doctrines. The leagues thus organized were quite apart from trade unions. was the result? When annual conferences were held, with a view to determining upon ancl setting forth definite political planks, we sometimes found that extremists and faddists came forward as the representatives of leagues. In one instance, three men formed a league, and sent a delegate. In this way the platform was influenced by men who were not chosen by the workers, and who did not represent their views. In England, America, and elsewhere, the -solid movement of trade unions is due to what Lord Rosebery has called the "" hardheaded "" trade unionists-to of labour. Men who obtain and hofd positions in connection with trade unions must be moderate and level-headed. union movement does not tolerate extremists. It was found, therefore, that if we wished to influence public opinion, we must put forward a propaganda which would secure public support, and. eventually the trade unions became political organizations, sending representatives Since that time, the best work, speaking not from the point of view of a particular class, but nf the community at large, has been done by trade unions. The influence of the wilder natures has been repressed. Those who work for their bread and butter are those who are represented in the trade unions. Mr Sfence. to take a part in politics. They have always confined themselves to questions of public interest and social reform, so that When the political our platform has not' been challenged, even by our bitterest enemies, ancl, at last, in each of the Parliaments, a large body has been returned to support its planks. This movement, which began in the old country, is now to be brought to an end, if some honFor orable members are to have their way. They do not understand its genius, or they have listened to misrepresentations. The trade unions are now being asked to give up all that they have been working for. Their My aim was to educate the people right to try to secure reforms by peaceful and constitutional methods is to be taken I away, and an endeavour is being made to hamper and coerce them by law. Some of those who declaim most loudly against coercion are, in this instance, wishful to apply it. The labour organizations have to give up more under the Bill than the employers are asked to give up. The employers are practically not asked to give up anything. They are only required to run their industries on lines which, in the opinion of an unbiased Court, are lines What of justice. The labour organizations could adopt what methods they liked. Now they cannot do so. They could admit or refuse admission to candidates, and expel members at their own will. Individual workmen had the right to work for any wages they chose to accept. ' Now, all that is to cease. The conditions of industry are to be regulated by the Court. The uniorvs are even to be prevented from using their best weapon against repression, by""'being deprived of the right to strike. They are also to be denied the right to take pari; in politics, and to exercise the political liberthe aristocracy ties which other bodies of men may exercise. Notwithstanding the keen criticism to which the administration of the New The trade South Wales Act has been submitted, no complaint has been heard there of the action of the Court in giving preference to unions having political purposes. In any number of cases preference has been agreed to by employers, and the agreements have been registered by the Court. In America and to a conference. England many of the unions have succeeded in obtaining preference for unionists, and in enforcing their rule that unionists shall not work with non-unionists, thus compelling men to become unionists in order to obtain a job. The Prime Minister is always praising unions, but although he speaks in favour of unionism, he works to Gradually, the unions began crush it. He has stated that every working man should be a member of a union,, but at the same time he is against provisions which would induce men to become members of unions. When legislation of this kind was first introduced into the New South Wales Parliament, he was directly opposed to it, and ""stone-walled"" it all night. poses. Honourable members are attacking Since then he has progressed sufficiently to admit that there is some good in it ; but while he declares that he wishes to give encouragement to unionism, he has asked the Committee to vote for provisions which will destroy it. The Hon. B. R. Wise, who has given this subject a great deal of study, and whose opinions are worthy of consideration, has shown-as it has been shown by the decisions of the Supreme Court of New Zealand-that the Act is based upon organization, ancl that preference to unionists is necessary in order to carry out its provisions. He goes so far as to say that when an organization applies for preference, its application should be granted, even if its members are a minority of those engaged in the trade, and he is of opinion that preference to unionists should be made compulsory in the interests of the proper administration of the Act and the peaceful prosecution of industries.' I think that he is quite right. We, however, do not ask for so much as that. All we ask for is that the Court may be allowed to deal with applications for preference according to the evidence before it. No application for preference has been objected to in the New South Wales Court on the ground that the organization applying has taken political action. Why should not organizations do as they please in this matter? Are we going to determine how the organizations of employers shall spend their money, making it punishable for them to spend it for any other purposes than those declared by our legislation? Do we tell any other body of men what they shall do with their funds? I contend that it is unjust to prohibit the members of the unions from using their money for political purposes if .they so desire. an opportunity to continue the most useful work they have been able to perform. interests of thousands of unionists should have been ignored, and that an attempt should have been made to use the Bill as a weapon' to strike a blow at the Labour Party. We have been told that the members of the Labour Party are opposed to any restrictions being placed upon the unionsbecause they fear that 1 they will lose their political influence, but I would point out that the work performed by the unions is carried on, apart from any interference by Members of Parliament It is not fair to tax the Labour Party with making use of the unions for political purthe unions because they believe that, by so doing, they will be able to retard the labour movement. They are, however, greatly mistaken. union attempted to bring coercion to bear, in a political sense, upon the men engaged in the pastoral industry. have been president for many years does not permit Members of Parliament to be associated with the executive, or to be connected with the board of directors of the Worker, the special journal of the organization. A special exception was made in my case, because I was an officer when elected to Parliament, and before the present rule was brought into operation. All the talk indulged' in with regard to the personal influence of labour members upon the unions has no foundation in fact. The unions are careful to do their own business in their own way, to exercise full control over tlieir own money, and, so far as the selection rests with them, to select the candidates whom they think the best. The political"" labour leagues exercise the real political power. It is absolutely unwarrantable to make use of a measure of this kind to strike a blow at the Labour Party. The unions have a perfect right to take part in any political movements relating to matters which concern the trades in which their'members are engaged. There are scores of matters affecting the health and conditions of labour of their members regarding which the unions have a perfect right to appeal to Parliament. I shall not be satisfied with the Bill unless the amendments suggested by the Senate are included. It is practically denying them. I am sorry that the Government are attempting to restore the clause relating to preference, to the shape in which it left this It is regrettable that .the House. The proviso added at the instance of the Minister of Defence was adopted practically without discussion, and at least one honourable member voted under a misapprehension in regard to it.

230,Mr Spence,"The.unio n of which IThe leader of the Opposition suggested an amendment which would have met the i ideas of honourable members if they had been anxious to render the Bill effective. But apparently their aim is to make it unworkable. The statement recently made in the Argus that there were no labour griev. ances to be remedied at the present time was entirely unfounded. It is true that, so far as the Australian Workers' Union is' concerned, an arrangement has been entered into with the employers in Victoria. The pastoralists of New South Wales, however, absolutely refuse to meet the representatives of the employees, and no settlement of a satisfactory character can be arrived at until the present condition of affairs has been radically changed. At the same time, it would be impossible for the Australian Workers' Union to prove that, in any application for preference, they had the approval of the majority of those who would be affected by the award. We may tude adopted by the Government that they do not desire to workable measure. If they wished it to become effective, they would surely pay some regard to the opinions of the officers of the unions, who have had the widest practical experience, and who are the best judges as to the probable effects of the prothat upon one occasion, at least, he overvisions contained in the Bill. The executive of . the Australian Workers' Union, which-is constituted not of Members of Parliament, but of clear-headed men of great experience, declares that it would be impossible to comply with the terms of the proviso which the Government desire to . restore to the Bill. The Trades and Labour Council in Sydney take up a similar position. I trust that honourable members will at least make an effort to put the Bill personally, opposed it. into a workable shape. This is the' only Parliament that has attempted to deal with an Arbitration Bill in the manner now proposed by the Government. South Wales and New Zealand Acts have not caused any trouble. Court of New Zealand has declared that in some cases preference is essential in order to carry out the purposes of the Act. We might very safely leave the whole question to the Arbitration Court. In regard to the provision which is intended to apply to .unions having political rules, I would urge upon honourable members that it would be unjust to upset the whole of the present organizations, and to place the trades Mr Spence. unions at a special disadvantage. I have previously replied to the statements of the employers' organizations to the effect that the working of the Arbitration Acts in New South Wales and elsewhere has proved discouraging to investors. I quoted figures, from the Investors' Review to show that the position in 1903 was very satisfactory, and that dividends averaging 5 per cent, had been returned upon the investments in the States affected by the working of arbitration legislation. No complaint has been made regarding the operation of the preference provisions either in New South Wales or New Zealand. Where, then, is the justification for the extreme attitude which the Government are adopting, unless it be that they are determined to use this provision as a weapon with which to crush the trade union movement, and to prevent their own party from being defeated whenever there is an appeal to the country? If they desire to make fairly assume from the attithe Bill workable, they will accept the amendments which have been made iby the pass a Senate. able member for Darling has taken credit to himself for being a very capable organizer, and I am quite willing to admit that he is. I would remind him, ho,wever, shot the mark. I have a vivid recollection that some years ago he was instrumental in bringing about an arrangement to which a great many of the pastoralists subscribed.

The difference between the. proposal of the present Minister of Defence and that of the honourable member for Bland, is simply as to how far the Bill ought to go in directing the Court with regard to the granting of a preference to unionists. sure does not instruct the President of the Court to ascertain whether a majority of those who are engaged in any particular industry, approve of the granting of such a preference. desires that the Court shall be allowed discretion to determine that a substantial number of those who will be affected by its award are in favour of the extension of a preference to unionists. To my mind, the difference between the two positions is a very small one. the honourable member affirm that it is possible to establish the fact that a majority are in favour of a preference. We say that it is not. leader of the Opposition desires that the President of the Court shall be satisfied in his own mind that a majority approve of the granting of a preference. willing to put the burden of proof upon the objectors to a preference? any absolute proof is required.

But when we are asked to lay it down that the Court may grant a preference if it be satisfied that the applicants "" substantially represent "" the trade concerned, the divergence between us becomes greater. We desire to direct the Judge that he shall have satisfied himself by all reasonable means that the probabilities are that a majority desire .preference. Absolute proof is not asked for.

The provision is badly drafted, and one which, if taken to pieces by a sensible man, will be seen to be incapable of achieving its object, and likely to do harm both from our point of view and from the point of view of our opponents. It is also unworkable. This has been admitted by tbe honourable member for Moira, whose experience and honesty we value. He has saidIt would appear to be open to objection, inaslabour, and so on. But as the clause has much as it would make it necessary to secure the opinion of the majority of the workers in any particular industry. In the earlier clauses of the funds for the distribution of such literaBill we have laid it down that 100 members may. constitute an organization having a right to submit a proposal to the Court. If people are compelled to go beyond that to find out the absolute number of workers in any particular industry, that they may be able to prove to the Court that they have a majority of those employed in the industry behind them, their task would appear to me to be an almost impossible one. Would the honourable member have the same objection to the proviso if the burden of proving that there was not a majority were thrown on those who objected to the preference being given? It is one thing to say that those ' who apply for preference should have to prove that they represent a majority absolutely ? asked to prove it absolutely to the satisfaction of the Judge. It would be a different thing if those who objected to the giving of a preference had to show that the applicants for it did not represent a majority. proof should be on those asking for the favour ? view of the honourable member, yes; but from the point of view of the Court, no. Knowing, as I do, how men who belong to unions are spotted by certain employers, and prevented from getting work, I regard it as essential that they shall not feel that they are marked men, and liable to lose their employment for appealing to thu Court. onus of proof on the plaintiff? preference is not a plaintiff. are hosts of cases, moreover, in which the plaintiff has not the burden of proof. If the proviso is persisted in, it will be persisted in by men who admit that it will produce difficulties of interpretation, and will be unworkable from the point of view of the unionists. With regard to clause 55, I think that it would be well if , before accepting the proviso of the Senate, we defined political matters. We ought not to prevent a union from publishing literature to send to Parliament to induce members to vote for legislation in the direction of improved sanitation, better wages, shorter hours of been sent to us from the Senate, it would be illegal for a union to use a penny of its ture. Honourable members on both sides who have any sympathy with the humanitarian legislation of recent days will help to have that put right. I think that words have been used which are rather wider than were meant. I suggest that from political purposes should be excepted all purposes relating to industrial matters which are defined in clause 4. fere with a man's political' freedom at all. that the legislation upon which this and the other House has spent months should not be lost. I fear that those who support the Bill have been going too far in the making of concessions, and no doubt the more we can concede, the more likely it is that our actions will be used as an argument against us hereafter. So far as I can judge of the feeling of the people outside, if the Bill is not passed by this Parliament, a much stiffer and stronger measure will be pressed for at the next elections. If the Bill were passed in some reasonable form, we should have rest from the subject for a time, but if it is rejected, or is passed in its present form, the chief issue at the next elections will be conciliation and arbitration. the risk. honourable member.

There, fore/ I think that it would be desirable to bring agricultural labourers within the scope of the measure. So far as domestic servants are concerned, I admit that I voted in favour of excluding them from the Bill, not because I did not think they -were entitled to the protection of the law, or because I under-valued the importance of the services which they render to the community, but because I could not conceive it possible for that class of labour to become organized in such a way that advantage could be taken of legislation affecting only disputes extending beyond any one State. I played a humble part in assisting to frame the New South Wales Arbitration Act, and I agreed to the exclusion of domestic servants from the scope of that measure, because I thought it would be scarcely possible to make the law applicable to them. If advantage could not be taken of State legislation in this direction, it is hardly likely that Federal enactments upon similar lines will beavailed of. Domestic servants were excluded from the provisions of the Bill when it was presented to the last Parliament, and 1 promised my constituents 1 that I would support that measure. I prefer to give my support to practicable measures only, and to ignore proposals which T The Approregard as impracticable and illusory. If the Government desire to place an effective law upon the statute-book, they should be prepared to pay some regard to the representations of those who are most intimately concerned in the proposed legislation. I believe that although the leader of the Opposition has spoken in favour of including agricultural labourers and domestic servants in the Bill, he would be prepared to give way with regard to those classes of labour if the Government indicated their willingness toomit the proviso relating to preference to unionists.

The effect in the case of the amendment proposed by the leader of the Opposition would be just and equitable, whereas in the other case the results would be just the reverse. We desire that the Court shall have the fullest possible discretion in dealing with all matters that come before it, and that it shall not be hampered or restricted by special provisions as ,to the extent to which proof shall be afforded that the union applying for preference represents the majority of those engaged in the industry.

317,Mr Webster,"There is a great dealtically without discussion. A general debate took place upon the question of preference, but the amendment in the form in which it was finally adopted had not been printed or placsd in the hands of honourable members until just before it was agreed to. All the trouble and friction which have arisen in consequence should serve to show honourable members the undesirability of adopting amendments without the fullest consideration. Court will take a reasonable view of the requirement that the application for preference shall be approved by the majority of those affected by the award, but the members of the legal profession who are to be permitted to appear before the Court will take care that every obstacle is placed in the way of the Court arriving at an opinion favorable to the claimants. Provision was made in the alternative amendment proposed by the leacler of the Opposition that the Court should be satisfied that the applicants substantially represented in numbers and competency those who were engaged in the industry affected. The importance of the element of competency has been entirely lost sight of by honourable members. It was proposed that when a union asked for preference it should be in a position to show that its numbers are competent to perform the work required of them. We ask that the organizations shall not only guarantee that before a preference is extended to unionists, a majority of those engaged in the particular industry affected shall approve of it, but that they shall also guarantee their competency. The present Minister of Defence pays no regard whatever to the question of their competency. During the course of this debate reference has been made to the views of those who have played a prominent part in the introduction of kindred legislation elsewhere. In this connection I desire to quote the following remarks from an article by Mr B. R. Wise, which was published in the Sydney Worker:One last word as to the particular amendment vernment went out of office. ' That provided that the Court should not grant preTerence, unless it was satisfied that the demand was made "" by a majority of the persons affected."" I have never yet met a lawyer who is able to tell me what these words mean, or how such a fact could be proved. Nor do I know of any one who has had any experience in the practice of the Court who does not admit that the insertion of such an amendment would make the preference clause a dead letter. In fact, the amendment is being supported by Sir John Forrest and all the Tories in Parliament, who are avowedly opposed to preference, and expressly hope .that the Court would have no power to give it. The very fact that Mr McCay's amendment is being supported by politicians of this class is sufficiently significant. Mr Watson attempted to counter the amendment by moving, as an alternative, that the Court should not be allowed to grant preference ""unless it was satisfied that the applicants substantially represented the trade concerned in respect both of numbers and competence."" The difference between the two proposals is very great. Mr Watson's proposal puts the burden of proof upon It is contended that the -the persons who deny that the applicants do substantially represent the trade in both these respectsof proof upon the persons who ask for preference. This is a difference which will be appreciated at once by any lawyer. Secondly, while under Mr McCay's amendment it would be impossible to prove that the applicants were "" in a majority,"" there could be no difficulty in showing that they ''substantially represented the trade""; and, thirdly, and this is the most important difference numbers the test of whether preference shall be granted; Mr Watson considers, not only the numbers, but the competence and standing of the applicants. is to he opposed to the numbers? has played that card so often, and the honourable and learned member for Corinella has watched him play it so effectively, that he has now come to echo his leader's sentiments. The Labour Party do not object to majority rule; on the contrary, its members have always advocated it. If the honourable and learned member can show how it is possible to determine whether a majority of those engaged in any industry approve of the granting of a preference to unionists, he will have done something which has not yet been accomplished.. But the fact is, he knows nothing whatever of the working of industrial organizations. although the honourable and learned member is not a worker in the sense in which that term is employed in this Bill. He belongs to a profession which enjoys the strongest protection of any union under the sun. I cannot understand why he should refuse to allow the Arbitration Court to decide whether or not a preference shall be extended to unionists upon the ground that they constitute a practical majority of the persons who will be affected by its award,",43,Conciliation And Arbitration

The Minister knows nothing whatever of industrial conditions, except what he has been told by those from whom he has held a brief. Upon the question of preference, the legal members of this Chamber differ. the honourable member for Wentworth, with his marvellous knowledge of the law, to agree with Mr B. R. Wise upon this matter? In New SoutH Wales litigation, in regard to industrial questions, has been fomented by members of the legal profession ; and, as a result, disputes which could have been amicably settled in half-an-hour by the rival parties conferring together, have been allowed to continue for a couple of years. selves are unable to interpret the provision relating to preference which is contained in this Bill. I am absolutely satisfied that that clause will become a dead letter if put into operation, and consequently I am not prepared to accept the Bill in its present form. I am convinced that Mr Wise knows more about the legal aspect of this question than does the Minister of Defence. ment with the honourable member. honourable and learned gentleman could disagree with such a proposition. I desire now to place before the Committee the opinion expressed by this gentleman on a concrete case. Mr B. R. Wise, in referring to the decision of the State Conciliation and Arbitration Court, in the case of the laundry employees, saidThe refusal of the Court to grant preference to the Laundry Employes' Union raises, indirectly, a question of great importance-namely , whether preference ought to be refused to a union which is numerically weak. It is to be observed that in the case referred to the Court gave several organizations, and may be subjected to reasons for refusing preference, of which the numerical weakness of the union was only one, and I by no means wish to imply that the decision of the Court upon the facts before it was incorrect. I do, however, desire to add to my previous observations on the Act a few words upon the very important question as to the right of the union to preference. I thoroughly concur with the judgment of Mr be adopted, it will be impossible to make Samuel Smith that the whole scheme and purport of the Act implies that unionists have a f r i m d facie right to preference in all awards, and this whether they represent a majority of the trade or not. As Mr Smith puts it, a union should be entitled to preference unless it can be shown that inconvenience will result either to the employers or to the great body of employees by granting preference. The very specious argument is urged that to grant preference to a union which only represents a minority of the trade is an undemocratic interference with the rights of the majority. The fallacy of this contention lies in the fact that it overlooks the basic principle of the Act-namely , that the Court should only recognise organized labour. For reasons which are well understood, only organized labour can set the Act in motion, and only organized labour ""becomes effectively liable to penalties, although no doubt penalties May also be imposed on individuals. It is only through the organization of labour that the employer has any guarantee that the award of the Court will be observed. Thus it is only right that those who bear the burden of the Act, namely, unionists, should also be those who gain advantage from its benefits. Can the Prime Minister, or the Minister of Defence, reply to such an argument? Mr Wise's reading of the law is absolutely corApparently the lawyers themrect. He says that without organization the Act could not be brought into opera* tion; that without organizations, disputes could not be brought before the Court, and that those who are responsible for the formation and maintenance of unions in such a way as to render it possible for an appeal to be made to the Court, are fairly entitled to a preference. Those who support the granting of preference on the terms favoured by the Government, do not realize the fundamental principle of the Bill They do not appreciate the fact that those who have been building up unions for years, in order that the united reason of the workers, may be brought to bear upon differences of opinion between employers and employees, have rendered yeoman service to the community. They have done what the Prime Minister grandiloquently describes as an admirable work in the cause of humanity and civilization, yet he would refuse to allow them any preference. Preference is to be denied unionists, although they have had to bear the cost of forming and maintaining the penalties under the Bill. How can non-unionists be placed on a footing with unionists, so far as the advantages of this measure are concerned, if they cannot be made responsible for penalties that may be imposed on unions for breaches of an award? If the Government proposal",44,Conciliation And Arbitration

332,Mr Webster,"I fail to see how thethem responsible for such penalties. I contend that we have no right in equity to give them the advantages which should accrue from the united efforts of more patriotic men in the same industry. This is an aspect of the question which has not been discussed. The amendment which enabled the Government to get into office was never really discussed, and that has been the cause of the whole trouble. Unless preference be granted to unionists on the terms proposed by the Opposition, an injustice will be done to them. We shall shackle them-w e shall deprive them of the power to strike, and subject .them to various penalties for breach of an award of the Court, whilst at the same itime the non-unionists upon whom no such disabilities can be imposed, will reap all the benefits of the Bill. I hope that the Government will arrive at a fair decision. If Ministers wish to shorten the debate, to place this Bill on the statute book, and to speedily reach .the haven of recess, for which they are so anxious, they will be prepared to accept a reasonable and practicable compromise. Those who ask for a Conciliation ancl Arbitration Bill, in order that industrial disputes may be peacefully settled, should be given a just and workable measure. intimate that they are prepared to accept .the amendments made by the Senate with reference to the question of preference, arid the Committee to disagree in the first place to more clearly define the meaning of political purposes, I shall assist them in passand other rural labourers. This Chamber ing the Bill. ing neither the employers nor the employees. The employers in whose interests they are supposed to be working, are appealing to honourable members by means of circulars, to put the Bill under the table, but I trust that that course will not ""be followed unless it is impossible to arrive at a decision that will enable us to place a workable measure on the statute-book. The Minister of Home Affairs has hitherto enjoyed the reputation of being a very fair-minded man, and if he wishes to retain that reputation which he has earned in State and Federal politics, and also as a citizen, he will realize the importance of bringing his influence to bear upon the Government to accept a reasonable compromise. He will certainly bring his influence to bear upon the Minister of Defence, who brought the Government into existence, and may possibly be the cause of their going out of office. I hope that the Government will agree to the passing of the Bill in such a form that it will be workable, and acceptable to the people; but, if, on the olher hand, they seek to carry it in such a form that it would disgrace our statute-book, and injure those whom it is designed to tcive, the Opposition will have to consider at a later stage what position they should lake up. not know that it is of any use to deplore the attitude of the Government on this matter. If I thought that it were, I should certainly point out that fhey are not making any serious attempt to give the decisions of the other Chamber that consideration which they deserve. The statement of the Prime Minister that it indicates remarkable unanimity that honourable gentlemen in another place have differed from the majority in this Chamber on only two or three matters is an interesting one, but these matters upon which we differ are of such vital importance that if there were a general election the whole' of the people of Australia would be divided in regard to them. The twoparties differ as widely as it. is possible for intelligent human beings to differ on such a question. The Government appear to wish to make out that two or three of the amendI f the Government ments are merely amendments of verbiage, but in our opinion a vital principle is involved in each case. The Government wish with the amendment excluding agricultural At present, they are pleasdecided by a fair majority that they should be excluded, though I could not follow the reasoning by which that decision' was supported, and I do not now believe that any section of the community shoulcl be excluded from the operations of the Bill. I listened with considerable attention to the attempt made by the Prime Minister yesterday to show that this provision is, first of all, not required, and, secondly, unsuitable. So far as we know, in none of the Australian States, nor in New Zealand, have farm labourers come before the Arbitration Court. That, however, is not the point.

335,Mr Hughes,"I know that in. Sydneybe registered, though I forget with what result. There are, however., persons in other walks of life who have not displayed any anxiety to take advantage of the provisions of this legislation, but they are not therefore excluded in set terms. Although agricultural labourers have not formed unions in Australia, they have done so in Great Britain, to their great advantage. For many centuries they blundered on, relying on their own initiative, and signally failing, wages gradually becoming lower, or their purchasing power becoming more restricted. Now that they have a union, however, their wages are materiallyincreasing, and their conditions materially improving. Prime Minister and those who support him do not seem to realize that the very lack of uniformity in the conditions of agriculture -which, however, is not veryl much greater than in any other industry-is one of the reasons why agricultural labourers should come under the Bill. The specialization of industry which marks manufacturing callings will sooner or later spread to agriculture. Whereas a little while ago one man did everything on a farm, we now find agricultural labourers who do nothing but make butter or cream. Why should a man engaged in a butter factory be treated differently from a man who works in a bread or boot factory? who reaps corn be treated differently from a man. who shears sheep? are now plenty of men engaged in the agricultural industry who do no thing else but follow a harvester or a threshing machine round the country. has pointed out that already there have been strikes in the harvest field, and similar occurrences will take place again. It has been overlooked that the competition of foreign countries makes it increasinglynecessary for our farmers to grow wheat on large holdings, requiring the employment of numbers of persons in one particular avocation at the one time. A strike might occur amongst such persons at harvest time, which would practically spell ruin to the individual employers) and perhaps disaster to the country. calling in which conditions are more onerous, . and the lack of regulation has been followed by more disastrous consequences, than the agricultural industry. I think the leader of the Opposition effectually disposed 01 the objection that to bring that industry under the Bill would involve the creation of an eight hours day, Mr Hughes. and a wage of 8s. a day. As I indicated by an interjection, the New South Wales Court, when unions whose members were working ten or eleven hours have come before it, asking for an eight Hours day, has in most instances not granted the application. I admit that there is very little likelihood of trouble in the domestic circle coming within the provisions of the Bill, but I opposed the exclusion of domestic servants, because I consider that no section of the community should be excluded. 1 shall not advance any arguments on the subject of preference to unionists, and the application of union funds The to political purposes, until we come to the amendments dealing with those subjects. I regret that the Government has treated this matter so lightly, and has made no serious effort to arrive at a'compromise. I can only suppose that it hopes to browbeat the Senate into a surrender of the principles expressed by a majority, or thinks that that body will abandon its position. I hope, however, that a calmer view of all the circumstances which have happened since this matter was last dealt with, and the fact that they are not now prevented from giving expression to their opinions, will lead some of their supporters to change their votes. The GoOr why should a man vernment are certainly not following the example of the two previous AdministraThere tions in making these questions vital. I hope that the Committee will accept the first amendment of the Senate, and that a reasonable agreement will be arrived at between the two Houses in regard to the The leader of the Opposition others. Government do not see .fit to accept more than the amendment which the Prime Minister has notified his willingness to accept. They appear to recognise that the provisions inserted by the Senate constitute the backbone of the Bill, and oppose them because they wish to make the Bill ineffective. At least fourteen supporters of the Government have at one time or another expressed themselves as opposed to arbitration, and have There is no said that they will not vote for the Bill in any shape or form. The honourable and learned member for Wannon said that, so far as he was concerned, he was willing to exempt practically every one from the operation of the Bill.

336,Mr Tudor (Yarra),"I regret that thebe worth our while to place it upon the statute-book. nected with trade unions for many years, and I know that the members of those bodies do not regard the B ill in its present shape as of any practical use. The amendment in clause 55, which the Government are prepared to accept, does not in any way rob the provision of its objectionable features. The unions have not Ibeen worked as political machines. I have never been connected with a union that has directed its members to vote for one political candidate or another, nor have I ever known any union to do this. Some of the highest officials of the Trades' Hall Council in Melbourne have voted against labour candidates, and it is well known that on many occasions the representatives of the trade unions, instead of voting for labour candidates, as has been assumed by many persons, have taken the opposite course, and this has been reported in the newspapers many times. The fact that the Government are prepared to adopt the amendment proposed by the Senate in clause 55 is sufficient in itself to demonstrate to me that it will be useless. Only four amendments have been proposed by the Senate, and the Government in effect take up the position that three of them should not be accepted, because they have been adopted by a Chamber in which the majority of those who have made the alterations belong to the party now represented on the Opposition benches. When, however, the Senate suggested certain amendments in the Tariff, the posite view. they should be ignored, because the majority at that time was on the side of the party to which he belonged. He contended that the Senate was the special guardian of the rights of the States, and that their representations were entitled to the fullest consideration. I submit that we have as much right in this case, as in the other instance, to pay regard to the views of the Senate, as the Prime Minister desired about two years' ago. did not agree with the Prime Minister's view upon the occasion referred to. view to-day. ought to be consistent. He differed from the Senate then, but proposes to accept their view to-day. I have been closely conthere has been a radical alteration in the Senate. Minister's change of attitude. would probably be able to explain any change in his attitude. I repeat, the trade unions are not political bodies, but the effect of the provision as it now stands in the Bil l would be to prevent any union from obtaining preference for its members if it had made a donation to the AntiSweating League, or had sent representatives to take part in a deputation with regard to the amendment of the Factories Act, and had paid them for their loss of time. I believe that the Minister of Defence would be prepared, in such a case, to argue before the Court that the union had taken part in a political movement. The fact that a union had, at some time or other, voted half-a-guinea towards the funds of the Protectionist Association in Victoria, or the Free-Trade Association in New South Wales, would also be held to disentitle it to claim' preference. I do not think that it is the wish of honourable members generally to place any such restrictions upon the unions, and I think that the clause should be amended in such a way as to leave matters as they stand today. Otherwise, the unions will declare the Bill to be useless. One of the amendments provides for the inclusion of agricultural labourers. A number of honourable members have stated lhat there is no necesPrime Minister took the opsity to bring the agricultural industry He did not suggest that within the scope of the Bill, because no dispute has ever taken place in connection with it. But that appears to me to be a very illogical position to assume. Many honourable members urge that we should make our defences as perfect as possible, although we have never been attacked, in order that we may not be found unprepared in the event of an, attack being made upon us. But when it comes to a question of preventing industrial war, they do not think it necessary to adopt any precautions. With regard to the preference clause, we were told on. a former occasion that there was a great deal of difference between the proviso adopted at the I do not agree with his instance of the Minister of Defence, and the amendment proposed by the leader of the Opposition.

Provision is .made that the applicants shall satisfy the Court that their request has the approval of the majority of the persons affected by the award. Under the Victorian factory law the application of which was so largely extended by the Minister of Trade and Customs, provision is made that in the election of representatives to the Wages Boards, only male adults and females over the age of eighteen years shall vote. Under the proviso, however, every child engaged in an industry would be entitled to a voice upon the question of preference. strued in that way ? need scarcely point out that a large number of juveniles are employed in the jam-making and confectionery industries, every one of whom-unde r the operation of the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella-woul d require to be counted.

I trust that the Committee will respect the wishes of the Senate in this matter. I believe that the present-is the first occasion in the political history of Australia upon which the second Chamber has proved itself more radical than that which is usually considered to be the popular House, although, of course, the Senate is elected upon .a broad franchise. I believe that if , as the result of disagreement between the two Houses, a double dissolution were to take place, we should find that the electors are not prepared to accept the sham measure which is offered to them by the Government. difficult to say anything fresh upon this sub4 ject, it is just as well that honourable members should clearly indicate the position which they take up in regard to the proposals now under consideration. I feel sure that the time which we spend in discussing these proposals upon a broad basis will represent time saved in the long run, inasmuch as it will prevent a good deal of discussion at subsequent stages. I am sorry that the debate seems to be confined to a very large extent to members of the Opposition.

353,Mr Fowler,"Upon more than one-of the House who swallowed the proposal to include the railway servants need not be -disposed to strain at the small gnat which is represented by the inclusion within its scope of farm labourers. The two cases are practically upon all-fours. that some very good arguments were adduced as to why the Bill should not be made applicable to the railway employees, but no such arguments have been advanced in support of the exclusion of farm labourers. I am aware that, with a few honourable members who represent agricultural interests, the chief consideration involved is one of expediency. But I take it that there are members upon that side of the Chamber who are sufficiently independent to do what is proper in a matter of this kind without paying regard to any particular section of their electorate. wish to ask them why they refuse to extend the provisions of this measure to farm labourers, seeing that they are prepared to make them applicable to railway employees? jority rule. are prepared to bow to majority rule, they should recognise that the majority which included railway servants within the scope of the Bill ought-for consistency's saketo make it applicable to farm labourers. The same argument applies also to domestic servants. If a i l to see why they should be denied the right to obtain justice before the Court which we propose to establish. admit that there may be grave difficulties in the way of their appearance before the reason exclude them from the operation of the Bill. matters pertaining to the ordinary affairs of life, we debarred a certain section of the community from having access to our courts of law? A very exceptional case, indeed, would require to be made out before the public would tolerate such a condition of affairs. I recognise that at the present time it is almost impossible to extend to domestic servants the benefits which this Bill will confer upon other classes. That, however, is no reason why we should deliberately exclude them from its operation. I say that we should give them the right to appeal to the Courti f they wish to do so. If they are so blind to their own interests that they refuse to organize, the fault will rest with themselves. Personally, I think that, with an increasing sense of their responsibility, they will be induced to organize at no distant date. Those who oppose the granting of a preference to unionists wish to impose upon the applicants, as a Condition preceI admit dent to the extension of any such preference, the obligation of proving that they represent a majority of those who will be affected by any award of the Court. I wish to know why they should be obliged to establish any sucli affirmation. The question to be considered by the Court, in dealing with an application for preference, is simply whether the applicants have a just claim. If a preference were extended to a very considerable number, some of the non-unionists might very well object that it would seriously interfere with their prospects of employment; but where the I organization making application comprised only a minority of those engaged in the occupation which it represented, I , as a non-unionist, should regard that rather as an advantage than a disadvantage. It should be shown, at all events, in a way that has not yet been attempted, that the granting of preference is bound up in the giving of If honourable members it to a majority of those engaged in the industry affected. It ought to be shown that the granting of a preference to a minority would be something in the nature of an injustice; but no honourable member opposite has yet attempted to prove anything of the kind. I do not wish to detain the Committee. I have indicated, as clearly as I can, the position I take up in reI"" gard to these amendments, and I trust that before many hours have passed, we shall have come to close Court.

It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that these proposals were carried as the result of the action of the Labour Party in another place, but if his contention be correct we may reasonably expect that the Senate will insist upon its amendments. If the Government are going to flout the will of the Senate, and to scorn its proposals, we may expect that Chamber to take up a similar stand with regard to the Appropriation BiU, or any other measure that may be sent up to it. result will be a dead-lock between the two 'Houses. That would be most undesirable in the early history of the Federation. It would certainly lead to a great deal of wrangling, to or to the different political parties in the Commonwealth. The decisions of another place deserve as much respect as do those arrived at by us. It seems to me that the leader of the Government, in dealing with these amendments in so jaunty a fashion as he did, was spoiling for a fight.

The sooner it comes the better, for it will probably lead to several parties in the House being more clearly defined than they are. We all know the desire of He did not.

It has been common talk among honourable members-and the matter has been discussed in the press-that he wishes In us to reject these amendments, because he is anxious to bring about a double dissolution. If that be his object, the sooner it is accomplished the better. As honest men, we have no right' to pretend to be passing legislation when we know that the state of parties in this House is such that the business of the country cannot be effectively carried on. The Minister of Trade and Customs may smile, but it appears to me that he and other members of the Ministry were quite prepared to forego their own opinions in order to gain possession of the. Treasury benches. I would remind the Committee that agricultural The labourers were exempted from the provisions of this Bill only by the votes of a number of honourable members,'who represent farming constituencies in this House, and who believed that by taking that action which would not redound they would gain a few votes. When they the credit of the Parliament, are prepared to do such a thing we cannot pay much regard tg their professions of sympathy with the principle of conciliation and arbitration. At the outset, it was decided that the Bill should be extended to public servants, and an amendment to that effect was carried by the votes of certain honourable membelrs, who said *that they supported it for the express purpose of wrecking the measure.

I intended to read a number of quotations from the speech made by the Prime Minister, more particularly in regard to the action of the Labour Party in another place, which really had nothing to do with the question before the Chamber. I think that there is no class in greater need of the protection of this measure than are the agricultural labourers. toria, New South Wales, and Queensland they are actually asked to work in some cases for wages ranging from 7s. 6d. to i2's. 6d. per week. We must not lose sight of the fact that they are unskilled labourers, and that as invention after invention is brought out, the number of unskilled workers on the labour market is increased. The result is that competition amongst them is becoming keener and keener, and it is very difficult for many of them to gain an honest living. What is the -excuse of the Prime Minister? His whole argument is that, because these men have no organizaof their political rights. tion, they should be excluded from the Bill.

We are going I do not wish to be to leave no stone unturned to organize the farm labourers as well as possible, because they require as much protection as do the other classes of the community. The domestic servants also, because of their long hours and poor pay, should be included in the Bill. It is no excuse to say that they are not organized. I hope that the amendment of the Senate, governing this matter, will be accepted. There has been a good deal of discussion on the subject of preference to unionists, and the Government came into power because of an amendment carried against the Watson Administration on this very subject. What, however, is the whole reason of the Bill? Its object is the settlement of disputes bef h e Prime Minister tween employers and employees, by conciliation and arbitration. The basic principle of the measure is the formation of organiI f he did, I am zations which can be dealt with by a Court for the prevention of strikes. If we do not give preference to these organizations, we shall be taking away from them privileges and rights which they have enjoyed for years, and giving them worse than no return. The Bill compels them to give up the right to strikea weapon which they hold at the present time, and which, although a barbarous one, is very effective. They are also asked to forego their political privileges. Nothing can ,be done for the advancement of labour, whether organized or not, without political In Vicaction. From the earliest times there has been political action in connection with unionism. Every concession, every privilege, and every right which the unionists now enjov. has been obtained by political action. The very fact that an organization is in existence makes' it a political organization, whether it does, or does not, run candidates for Parliament.

We have been told, however, that 100 men may register as an organization, and register under the Bill.

After the maritime and shearers' strikes, when our men were being tried for conspiracy and other offences, we were told that our proper method of obtaining redress for our grievances was to take political action. We heard the same thing from prominent political leaders. The moment, however, that we attempted to take political action every obstacle was thrown in our way.

I trust that the Senate's amendments in clauses 4 and 40 will be agreed to. I regard the amendment in clause 55, which the Government are .willing to adopt, as practically useless, and I do not care whether it is carried or not. The Prime Minister said yesterday that the Court could not be expected to deal with disputes between individuals, and he indicated that if the Bill were to become effective both tlie employers and the workmen must be organized. Yet he is not prepared to accept amendments which would encourage organization.

The honourable member for Kennedy has represented Australia. We should not be 12 H 2 the agricultural labourers as poor, benighted and unskilled workmen. I would point out to him, however, that the agricultural labourer who knows his business, is a particularly skilled worker, who requires to possess a good deal of technical knowledge. If he knows his business, he will be thoroughly acquainted with the importance of utilizing the soil enriched by leguminous plants for the purpose of growing other crops, and of taking measures for the inoculation of the soil with fertilizing bacteria. The agricultural labourer knows that his work cannot be regulated in the same manner as can that of the mechanic, who is employed in the large centres of population. The elements play a great part in regulating his labour. He has to sow and reap as the weather may permit, and open up the soil as opportunity may offer. He cannot regulate his work upon the eight hours system, and if any attempt is made in that direction, it will operate to his disadvantage rather than otherwise. How could a dairyman leave his stock at particular hours of the day, when perhaps they might require special attention? In connection with the amendment of clause 40, the Labour Party totally disregarded the principle of majority rule. The proviso to which they object, embodies that principle which is the only sound one that can be adopted in The experience gained granting preference to unionists.

A farm hand is in. a sense hopeless; no star in have worked on a farm, and know something about the conditions. When, as a boy, I ran away from home, I was on a farm, and my Yankee master used to keep me at work all the week, and on Sunday, when he was in chapel, singing travels in America and Australia.

I want the Prime Minister to be able to look back and say that he carried this measure, not for a section, but for the whole of the people. No question is settled until it is rightly settled. When George Washington We find the liberated his own slaves, he thought he was doing a wonderful thing, and the world praised him. But when he died in 1799, slavery did not die with him. Had George Washington exercised the great power he possessed, and emancipated the few slaves that were then in America, before Whitney invented his gin, and cotton became king, there would not have been four millions of men engaged in a murderous civil war from 1861 to 1865. That war occurred because the slavery question was not rightly settled in the first place. I ask the Prime Minister to settle this arbitration question now for all, ot settle it for none-to give every one the benefit, or give none the benefit.

The Prime Minister, without any provocation, being the first to speak on the subject, deliberately suggested that the Committee should not consider the amendments made by the Senate, because of the party by whom they were made. That is decidedly a wrong position for the Prime Minister to take up, in dealing with amendments made in another place. I should like to know what the present Prime Minister would have said if the honourable member for Bland had suggested the adoption of a similar course. I have a word or two to say about the inclusion of agricultural labourers. On a previous occasion, I described their incluis bad, the people will rise in a body, and sion in the Bill as being something which, like chips in porridge, would do very little harm. I complain that honourable members who, from their own experience of the operation of the New South Wales Act must hold the same opinion, should go about the country telling the farmers that the inclusion of agricultural labourers in this Bill would mean that they must work only eight' hours, and must receive eight shillings per day, and that they would have an inspector constantly on their farms. We know that, although a similar provision has been in operation for some years in New South Wales, the hours and wages of farm labourers still remain unregulated. not organized and registered under the Act. I remember that the perience gained in New South Wales, I would ask honourable members how the inclusion of farm labourers in this Bill is going to bring about all the calamities which have been described? Let honourable members opposite be honest and candid in this matter. I invite them to say whether any political party in New South Wales dared at the last State elections to advocate the repeal of this provision in the New South Wales Act. Honourable members must be aware that they are talking, right down humbug.

Honourable members opposite have said that, this provision will bring trouble upon those engaged in the farming and dairying industries, because it will affect the hours of labour, and the wages paid to labourers in those industries. It has been proved that a similar provision in the New South Wales Act has resulted in no injury, and how can it be said that it will result in injury under this Bill? The same arguments apply with equal force to the inclusion of domestic servants in this Bill. When the honourable and learned member for Wannor visits Horsham, or some such place in his electorate, he will tell the farmers the trouble which will result from the inclusion of farm labourers in this Bill, and will follow up that statement by painting a picture of the dreadful consequences which must be brought about by the inclusion of domestic servants.
