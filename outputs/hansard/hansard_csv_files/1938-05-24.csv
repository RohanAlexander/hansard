Conflicts inof Territories administered hy His Majesty and with respect lo members of those forces, stud for other puipds.es. StXOND Debate resumed from the 4th May (vide page t ill ) on motion by Mr The Labour party stands for this policy C'ASJSYThat the bill be now read a second time. The provision of social services is an essential feature of the functioning of the democratic state. This nation (toes not believe that the state is an authoritarian organization ruling the lives and liberties of the people in the sole interests of the state. On the contrary, the essence of cur form of government is that the state shall be the instrument of the peopletheir common property performing for them, as citizens, the services which, as individuals, they would find impossible. This position has not arisen overnight; ltchind it have been years of development. Whilst it is true that, organically, the state arose to provide for the defence of life and property against external attack, it has long been recognized that it must also provide for the defence of life and property against internal causes which produce, or threaten to produce, disruption and weakness. As the result, all over i lie world the state now performs social and economic functions which, if left to individual initiative or control, would be either done badly or not done at all. It in clear that the strength of tbe democratic nations will be proportioned to the virility and patriotism of their citizens. Accordingly anything which weakens the life of the individual deprives the state, in some measure, of the services of the individual involved. The social life ancl the social standard can, therefore, be said to be the measure of the power and greatness of modern communities. That is true of all democratic communities; it is particularly true of Australia. What has been done hitherto in providing service for the poor, or for the community, has been much more than the rneie u -e of the state to help sections of society. It has,, iu fact, been a policy side our territorial boundaries, due to basic social injustice, have been appeased by the ameliorative provisions of many statutes. National stability has been strengthened by the nation using it3 resources, and also the resources of its leeds of various groups in the social life. and for its expansion, because it believes that the policy is sound in principle. It says to the poor that the ordered processes of law should be invoked in order that their difficulties may be surmounted; it says to tbe rich that tbe taxes imposed upon them, and used in this direction are an insurance against internal disorder and dissension. The Labour party says further that, irrespective of the economic purposes of social service as contributing to national stability, considerations of humanity and concern for those whose circumstances evoke sympathy, are more than a national ideal. They constitute a vibrant principle in tbe national character. It is not a platitude to say that tbe family, and the well-being of family life, are the focal points upon which hinge the true greatness of the nation. The family's services to the state are infinite in variety and extent. The family is the source of national continuance. Its labours provide not only for the subsistence of its own members, but also for the services of ordered government, the administration of the law, and the defence of the country against attack. The family is the sole guarantee for the honouring of the obligations which the nation has accepted. As leader of the Labour party in this House, with a full recognition of my responsibility in connection with this bill, I put it to tbe country, that money may be invested no less profitably by society in the woll-being of family life than in the development of lands, the opening up of empty spaces, and the provision of the physical capital which will enable",16,Papers

57,Mr Curtin (Fremantle) [3.30],"industry to become more efficient. In vestment in social welfare is more than legitimate; it is profitable. To the extent, therefore, that this bill envisages the expenditure of public money to improve the social life of the nation, we can regard the expenditure as justifiable in the strictly economic sense as would be any other form of expenditure which may appear, either now or in the years to come, in the budgets of governments. Despite our boasted prosperity, far too large a proportion of our families experience conditions definitely prejudicial to their welfare as individuals, and, thereundone much whicli should be done; and fore, prejudicial to the contribution which they can make to tbe nation as a whole. Poverty is still with us. Sickness-preventabl e sickness-ravage s too gravely our physical fitness as a people. The individual struggle for existence is becoming increasingly intense. Ear too many may be described as victims of the system; and too large a proportion of our people have incomes so low as to make them absolutely deficient in the resources essential to decency and good living. Were it not for the fact that, in recent decades, tbe state has elaborated an extended system of social services, the poverty of afflicted members of our community would have rendered them desperate-jeopardizin g the existing interests of the well-to-do and all those who find the current economic order satisfactory. The Opposition says that the time is overdue for an enlargement of social services in Australia. We have to give emphasis and definiteness to the policy of social services and, in the years ahead, treat them, not only as a salvage medium, but also as an agency for the remodelling of the industrial and economic life of the nation. been spent on investigating proposals in this connection. insurance have cost over £45,000. The Royal Commission on Child Endowment, of which I was a member, cost £16,480, and tbe cost of the Royal Commission on Health was £7,087, a total of over £69,000. It can, at least, be said that this country has not been niggardly in respect of its expenditure on inquiries into nrohlems affecting family life. Mr Curtin. There are approximately 0,900,000 people in Australia, of whom, speaking broadly, one-half are males and the other half females. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) says that the proposals before us, when operating, will affect directly 1,S50,000 persons, and that in various ways its incidence will stretch to approximately 3,600,00U persons. He says, also, that it will apply to the bread-winners, the sick, the aged in the community, and the wives, widows and orphans of the workers. At this stage my criticism of the bill is that it will not do as much as the Treasurer claims. It will leave what it does propose to do will be done on the wrong basis, and in the wrong way. I object to the limitation of this bill to employees, but as that matter has already been determined by the House, I am unable to say more that that it is a fundamental weakness of the proposed legislation. The bill makes no provision for self-employed workers, farmers, or small shop-keepers, and it makes very doubtful provision for persons casually or intermittently employed. I venture the opinion that, in practice, its scope will be limited in substance to employees in regular work. Parts1 and 2 of the first schedule are drawn in a way which jeopardizes all the relief workers as insurable persons. Regulations may exclude them. I have endeavoured to ascertain whether regulations have been drawn, but I take it that, although Ministers have had under consideration some of the proposed regulations, it would be wrong for me to say at this stage that they may exclude casual workers. I point out, however, that the bill, as drawn, definitely empowers the government of the day to exclude the whole of the casual, interMuch money has mittent and relief workers from the ambit of even its limited benefits. Reports on national Therefore, all the casual and relief workers may at this stage be considered as at least doubtful participants in the benefits of the bill as insured persons. Parenthetically, I point out that the failure to provide as an integral feature of this plan for relief workers aud casual workers, and for those who in the main are most subject to unemployment, means that those who will most need the benefits of this bill will bo Jeast likelj to share in them. The magnitude of this group is indicated by the fact that in one year three of the States of the Commonwealth expended £12,500.000 in providing relief for them, and it seems evident that in any future period of depression they will be deprived of the positive advantage of this measure, insofar as it has any positive advantages. The bill leaves the major disability of unemployment cither as a social problem or as an individual misfortune. In 1925, Mr S. M. Bruce, then Prime Minister, described unemployment as "" this most deadly cause of anxiety and unrest/' yet this Government has no proposal for its relief. The Labour party believes in national insurance; but this bill is not national in character, nor does it ensure nationwide application. The proposals fail to ensure medical treatment or benefit for the wives and children of employed married men-notwithstandin g that these married men are "" insured persons"", and comply fully with all the obligations of the proposed law. It treats women differently from men, not only economically, but also socially. There is a sex discrimination in the measure which tends to vitiate the premises upon which it is constructed. Purporting to deal with a national problem, the bill contemplates an anomalous system of class taxation. Its benefits are not equally shared, and its burdens are not equally distributed. The workers and the employers, between them, are to find £1.1,000,000 a year in the early years of the scheme, the amount rising to approximately £15,000.000 a year. Inevitably, the impact of this burden on industry is bound to be significant. T decline to delude myself with the idea that a contribution is not a tax. ""We are taxing the employers, and we are taxing the employees. This principle of sectional taxation in a national health and pensions system appears to be fundamentally unsound. Clause 1S5 of the bill gives emphasis to the class taxation tbe bill contemplates, particularly as it affects the employees. T agree that industry should be responsible for the accidents which workers suffer, for that, is a hazard incidental to industry. I agree also that, to a degree to be determined, industry should bear a considerable part of any burden arising in respect of the relief of unemployment. But sickness, other than occupational diseases, appears to mc to be a social rather than an industrial contingency; and tbe same principle is valid in respect to superannuation or pensions for the aged. Social obligations should be community obligations; they should absolutely unrelieved, not be met by systems of sectional taxation. To the extent that the bill seeks to provide a better-equipped national life, it seeks to add to the national competence to resist either external aggression or internal disorder. It is therefore, as much an insurance plan for the protection of incomes derived from rentals and property in general as it is for the protection of incomes from industry and commerce. Why the rentier class should be specially singled out for exemption from their share of the cost of""these proposed now national services is something which the Treasurer has not explained, and which I challenge him to justify. The Labour party expresses its utter condemnation of individual contributions as a principle in regard to invalidity, old-age and widows' pensions. These services should bo a charge on the consolidated revenue of the Commonwealth. To impose special levies, either on workers or employers, is utterly unjust. The greater the number of workers that a business employs the greater will be the tax on the enterprise, while it could easily happen that the smaller would be the benefit to the employees I point out, in dealing with the contributory system, that many wealthy taxpayers in Australia are not employers and, except as contributors to consolidated revenue from which will come the initial finance for this scheme, will contribute nothing to it. Yet employers will be mulct double-firs t as normal taxpayers, and again as contributors because they are employers. As things stand, the workers, through indirect taxation ancl, indeed, directly, supply a large part of the revenues of Commonwealth governments. To disregard the burdens at present laid on them, and to insist that they shall make a special additional contribua flat rate contribution of Is. 6d. a week, tion for pensions is not only to tax them of which 7^d. will be assumed to be for doubly, but also greatly to endanger their health insurance and 10^d. for pensions eligibility in respect of this category of insurance. These rates will rise as the benefits. Furthermore, the bill contemyears proceed. plates that a married worker must make a worker will, of course, make a similar conspecial contribution to a friendly society tribution. Yet it must be obvious that in order to ensure medical treatment for the sickness which affects the worker's his wife and children. This is overloadwife and family-particularl y in the ing the camel's back. The principle is bad from two aspects. often than will be the case with the On the one hand it imposes secinsured worker himself.

It is assumed that this will be tion to pay. On the other hand, it done through the friendly societies; but confines eligibility for benefits to tbe insurance status of the contributors; and, as this status depends on contingencies which cannot be foreseen, either in point of time or in character-particularl y in the absence of unemployment insurance -the probability is that those most in without having to pay the contributions as need or equally deserving will not have insured persons under this bill, have not rights assured to them. They will have joined friendly societies through some exhausted their ability to contribute aJid cause or another-chiefl y irregularity of will be disqualified from tbe application employment and income, or a low income of the scheme -wil l be in no better position in future A The Labour ""party believes that the been in the past. time has arrived when national health services should be treated, in principle, insurance will increase in Australia, the in the same way as education. They criticism which the friendly societies have should be free to all members of the made against the bill warrants us in precommunity. The scheme outlined in suming that their experience suggests this bill is a limited system of health great prejudice to the future of friendly insurance. I have no doubt that, in the societies when this bill becomes law. In years to come, proposals will be made to these circumstances, the omission of extend it. But the fact is that this promedical benefit for the wife and children posed insurance scheme involves the of the insured male worker really means, creation of complicated administrative in practice, an absolute failure to provide machinery, the chief function of which is the thing which is the kernel of the sickreally to exclude people from it. ness problem in Australia, namely, a Basically, we shall have two sections of national health service.

On the othei tributions. It is proposed in this bill, hand the husband, even though he be however, that the employee shall make an insured person, will be less efficient Mr Curtin. The employer of the earlier years of the married stategenerally calls for medical advice more the Treasurer points out, as an argument in support of the bill, that at present only one-quarter of the wage-earners are in friendly societies. It is a fact that three-quarters of the wage-earners, who. to join a friendly society than they have While it may be said that the habit of little relation to health. Tbe man wlm' 1 in industry through anxiety and the cost incidental to the treating of his sick wife. The Government has not toid us what will be the cost of the medical service, as distinct from benefit, but 1 am assuming that, as the Treasurer has said, substantially it will work out at l is . per insured person. Taking the figure as lis. for the medical practitioner's fee for the insured person, it will be seen that we could treat, on this basis, the whole population for less than £4,000,000. The institution of such a great service at such a cost would give to Australia a national health service free from anomalies and one which, even on the limited provisions of tbe bill, would be an immense step forward in the prevention of disease, let alone its treatment. Recently we have heard criticism which suggests that the l is . per insured person is not regarded by medical practitioners in general as sufficient to give the minimum service which tbey think should be rendered. Tliere seems to be some sort, of a revolt against the agreement which apparently t ho council of the British Medical Association made with the Government. The British scheme, though invaluable, has many critics, and I venture to 3ay it is regarded by some as not altogether satisfactory. I doubt whether the medical profession in Australia, as a whole, has confidence in the plan contained in this bill, and its proposed application, in broad outline, to Australia. The Treasurer may tell us that the medical profession iu Australia, as a whole, is satisfied; but at this stage, having informed my mind regarding the opinions of those bodies in Australia competent to express an opinion, I would hesitate to say that the Government's scheme has that measure of confidence of the medical profession suggested by the Treasurer. Every argument advanced by the Treasurer in support of the medical treatment provisions of this bill, as they apply to insured persons, can be said, from the viewpoint of national interest, to apply more strongly in relation to the whole community. If this service is to be of real value to insured persons, if it is to meet their requirements in a reasonable and satisfactory manner, we shall be warranted in saying that those who are not insured-casua l workers, relief workers and the unemployed whose eligibility to maintain their insurance status, will be doubtful-wil l need this health service much more often and to a greater extent than will the category of insured workers in regular employment. Therefore the argument advanced by the Treasurer for health services for insured persons warrants the Opposition in declaring that in any national social service scheme the ideal should be a health service for the nation. The omission of wives and children from tbe medical benefit section of the measure not only is bad from the national health aspect, but also is inimical to the character of family relationships themselves. The wife is not insured, the contention being that she does not contribute. But her husband is insured because he does contribute, and the employer contributes as much to the husband's treatment as does the husband himself. 'The presumption is that the husband earns tbe wage. I reject this narrow view of the organic charactereconomically as well as social.y-of tbe married state. The wife who stays at home performing her housewifely duties contributes as much to the earnings of her husband's wage as he himself does, and she is entitled to tbe same amenities of civilization. To argue that the wage should be drawn on to provide a special deduction for the special treatment of her husband, without her sharing in this service, appears to me to be a gross failure to realize either the equality of husband and wife in the married state, or the citizenship rights of the wife as a subject of the state. As the wife of her husband, she is entitled, from her husband's wage, to every kind of service which he can derive from that wage, and as a citizen of the state she is entitled to share in any service to provide which either the consolidated revenue is drawn upon, or a tax upon employers is imposed. Therefore, the sex discrimination in the bill as drawn, I venture to s;:y, not only expound* a new heresy in the relationship of man and wife as we understand it in Australia, but also strike-* unnecessarily and unjustifiably a blow at the very civic status of the wife. I employer w ill make no contribution to enable the wife to be treated, but will make one in the case of the husband; otherwise the latter's contribution under the j>lan as constructed in this bill would be very much larger than is proposed. In relation to this aspect of the bill, I note that the 21edical Journal of Australia has this to say:No one will agree that the scheme is ideal. It is far from ideal for it makes no provision for the dependents of insured persons. Indeed, if the scheme, as drafted, becomes effective it may be that many of the dependents benefits. I put that forward positively will be deprived of medical benefits that tbey receive at present through friendly societies because the breadwinner may not be able to make voluntary contributions to a friendly society as well as compulsory contributions to national insurance. Another fault is that it does not include ""the unemployed and the unemployable-the people who need medical care most and are least able to afford it. Further, no provision is made for specialist services. I , of course, am aware that there appears to be some dispute between the general body of medical practitioners and the Council of the British Medical Association in regard to the whole scheme; but that dispute, I point out, bad not developed when this view was expressed editorially in the Medical Journal of Australia, and it appears to me to be a reasonable statement of the implications of the bill. There are other discriminations in the bill-becaus e it is limited in scopewhich are bard to justify. The Treasurer, no doubt, will argue that, because males contribute Is. 6d. a week against Is. a week by women, the scale of £1 medical benefit, 15s. disablement benefit, and £1 old-age pension for men, is in proportion to the 15s. medical benefit, 12s. 6d. disablement benefit, and 15s. old-age pension provided for women. I point out that the bill asks us to accept in substance the report which suggests that the number of women to be insured is estimated not to exceed 500,000 because of the limitation of the measure to employees and wives who will voluntarily continue their insurance status. Therefore, it is contemplated that the bill w ill affect only half a million women out of the total number of women in the community. I do not believe that it is practicable for a women to make the same rate of Mr Curtin. use this aigumeut because the contribution as a man. The fact is that her wage is less, even though she performs the same service. But1 see no reason why the injustice of unequal pay for equal work should be repeated in this bill of unequal benefits. Obviously, the woman cannot pay as much as the man. But we have here more than a mere actuarial problem; we have a problem of social and sex justice to decide. Without any increase of the contributions which women will make under this bill, they should be entitled to equai as the considered view of my party. .1 do not know what reasoning it was which led to the assumption that a sick woman can be sustained cheaper than a sick man, or that an aged woman can live at less cost than can an aged man. I absolutely deplore the provision of an old age pension of 15s. for women. I have said that I am unable to put forward any claim for complete equality. That would.mean equal contributions, and an equal age level for eligibility. Until the wages system is altered, or a system of family allowances is devised, any suggestion that, by paying equally with men, women may be given equal benefits under this legislation, cannot be sustained. Only the more comfortably placed families could satisfy the demand of an equal contribution by the wife in order to obtain a benefit equal to that given to her husband. The poorer families, and those which are on or about the minimum wage, would be unable to make the double contribution. In any case, the health services for children could not be met by this device. It must be clear, from an examination of the report of Sir Walter Kinnear, that what he had in mind in framing his general plan, and what the actuarial report bears out, was that a certain maximum figure could be accepted as constituting the amount which it is reasonable to expect the worker to pay each week. Upon that figure the whole plan was constructed. The justification for its anomalies is founded on the assumption that that contribution represents at least a workable starting point. If the suggestion should be made at this stage that women, by making contributions equal to those made by men, may obtain equal benefits, I would point out thai in practice that would work out fairly only in the case of those families in Australia which have wages considerably above those that are fixed for working men and women. The middle classes -those approximating between £300 and £365 a year-in the clerical spheres, might be able to meet that provision. But to advance, even belatedly, as a remedy for the sex injustice of the bill, the proposal that, by making equal contributions, women might receive benefits equal to those given to men, would merely be lo suggest that they be given a label without any reality, for only few wives of married men would be able to comply with such a stipulation. I repeat that, until the whole standard of life is raised, until the standard of wages is increased, any such attempt at this juncture to smooth out this difficulty, would be wrong. The i-ight way to do it, as I have already suggested, is, not to ask women to make an equal contribution, but to provide out of the consolidated revenue of the nation the money needed to give them equal benefits. Sir increase the wage rate of women, and thus enable them to do it? man knows that repeatedly I have asked for the Constitution of Australia to be amended so that this Parliament would have full industrial powers. When I last made that proposal, the honourable gentleman voted against me. Looking at the matter socially, which 1 think is just as important as looking at it merely from the viewpoint of the actuary, and knowing that a 15s. pension to a woman at 60 years will cost more than the payment of £1 to a man at 65, I none the less say that Commonwealth payments should be drawn on to provide for equality of benefits in this connection, in respect of payments, while still retaining the earlier age level for women. The Commonwealth can do out of consolidated revenue, under this insurance plan, what it has already done in respect of invalid and old-age pensions. It must be clear that many women will pass out of the category of ""insured person"". They will leave industry and marry, and there will be no surrender value or equity in the contributions they have paid unless, as wives they continue to make a contribution in order to receive the old-age pension. 1 am fearful that we shall find, in tbe main, that women coming into industry will replace those who are going outthat is, as insured persons-and that, while many women will have been contributors for a few years, not many wii' ultimately benefit by the provisions of the bill, except during the few years in which, as employees, they have been insured persons. Under the present pensions system, men and women receive equal payments, but under the bill it is contemplated that a disablement benefit of 15s. will be gi\en to men, but one of only 12s. 6rl. to women. That appears to indicate a wrong conception of the matter. I confess to being somewhat perturbed at the complicated administrative machinery which the bill establishes. Shortly put, we are to have a national insurance commission, an approved societies consultative council, a board of trustees for funds, a medical benefit council, a. district practitioners' committee, a pharmaceutical chemists' committee, and a panel of referees. All these arise from two things: first, the limitation of the bill to employees; and secondly, tbe decision of the Government that the administration of the act is to devolve upon bodies whose powers arid responsibilities cannot be smoothly executed without some over-riding supervision. Some approved societies will, apparently, be able in time to give more benefits than others. Some approved societies may even have to impose levies upon their members. Thus, we are facing the prospect of unequal advantages for insured persons, even though equal contributions are demanded from them. Furthermore, I require guarantees regarding the setting up of approved societies. Only the friendly societies and some trade unions have had any experience in administering medical and health services. We ought not to encourage the development of approved societies in which the provisions of this bill will be used as a second, string to attract other types of activity. That ought to be made clear.

While1 should be glad if large trade unions were to accept the status of approved societies, none the less I say that all trade unions have not bad experience in this matter, and I do not believe it to be either right or proper that bodies which are not experienced should be encouraged to come into the matter in order to prop up their existing business. had experience of this kind. those who have had it would be just as competent to engage in administrative work of this kind as would friendly societies. In Great Britain certain insurance companies have come into the scheme as "" approved societies"" in respect of medical benefits. There are 23 life insurance companies in Australia, but, from my comprehension of tbe position, only five of them appear to be strictly mutual societies. The remainder appear to be merely trading corporations operating in such a way that the whole of their profits are not devoted to the benefit of the policy urer pointed out, that only about G00,000 holders but, in part at least, serve tbe interests of shareholders. These, in fact, are capitalist organizations and should be disqualified from the administration of this plan which is presumed to be of mutual help. companies bas in fact had any experience in administering medical services. suggest that Parliament should make it plain to the insurance companies that they are not, in its judgment, the type of organization that should, without reasonable inquiry and adequate guarantee, be given administrative power in this service. For myself, and speaking subject to a second think on the matter, I would at this stage prefer to limit the administration to friendly societies and trade unions which have had experience in administering medical benefit services. I have the greatest admiration for tbe work which the friendly societies have done in Aust' alia. The organizations have nearly 600,000 members, the greater proportion of which are, I understand, married men, and they claim to benefit at present approximately Mr Curtin. ance for the single men included in their membership I am inclined to estimate the total range of their influence at between 1,500,000 and 1,750,000 people. I feel confident that their position would be, in the future, vastly different from what it probably will be and that they would have less cause for disquietude were the medical benefit side of this bill extended to cover the wives and children of insured males. They would, at least, continue at their present strength. It would be a bad thing in the civic life of Australia were they to attenuate gradually to extinction-apar t altogether from the invaluable financial and medical service which they have made possible. 1 know that thousands of workers arc outside the friendly societies, but this position is explained, in part, in my view, by the unjustified assumptions encouraged by industrial assurance canvassers that a better investment is open to them for a weekly contribution to assurance companies. This bill fails to cover the field of friendly society activity but yet threatens its competence for future strength. It may be true, as the Treasof the 1,S00,000 people covered by this bill are members of friendly societies and that therefore some system of compulsory assistance is desirable, but the fact is that the membership of friendly societies None of the insurance would be very much larger than is the ease were it not for the misrepresentaI tions which industrial assurance canvassers have made to thousands of working men and women that if they would insure their children for 6(3. a week over a period of years they would receive lump sums in 10 or 15 years. Inquiries have been made into this whole subject recently, and I do not wish to discuss it in detail at present. I make the point at the moment that had it not been for the wrongful enticements offered to the wives of workers particularly, very many morefamilies would to-day be covered by friendly societies than is the case. Any plan to safeguard the people, or even sections of the people, against certain contingencies should be founded on sound principles. Service and justice should be the essence of our objectives, and the cardinal features of our methods. i",23,Frederick Stew Abt Wh Y Not Medical Benefit Committee A Medical

60,Mr Curtin,"That is quite true, andThere should be equity in the treatment of our citizens, having regard to their needs, their rights and their obligations. This is not a bill for national insurance, even though it purports to be such. Its limitations and its anomalies in regard to benefits, its inequitable proposals respecting the manner in which the common fund shall be derived, and its incidence in general, make it very necessary that the House should order the preparation of a much more liberal bill for our consideration. The Government has brought down a plan in which the ideal of national insurance for social service has been converted, in substance, into a scheme for tbe assurance of the increased cost of existing Commonwealth social services against any possible contingency. Tbe Government appears to be more concerned with providing against the impending liability of the existing pensions scheme than with any other single consideration. It must be patent that our expenditure on pensions will steadily increase, and the nation has to face this situation. It is, however, reasonable to keep iu mind that our wealth-producing resources are not remaining static. We are advancing materially from decade to decade, and it is incongruous that a Government which has not hesitated to pass on an increasing interest bill to posterity should parade its desire to avoid passing on a higher pensions bill. Generations to come in Australia will have less difficulty in meeting the obligations of a non-contributory pensions system than in meeting those inherent in the debt legacies which will be bequeathed to them by this Government and other preceding anti-Labour governments. I , therefore, refuse to destroy the prinmotion for the second reading because I ciples upon which the Commonwealth system of invalid and old-age pensions have been founded. I also refuse to agree that pensions for widowhood should be put on a separate basis from that which, hitherto, has applied to old-age pensions. The Government has given to us the label of "" National Insurance"" without its reality. It is also offering us anomalies amounting to injustices in the general plan of benefits which have been outlined. If the country had been afforded an adequate opportunity to examine this bill, if the various institutions of our society which had had special training in social services had been given some better knowledge of the important phases of the bill; if the people at large had been more fully informed of the nature of the impact that this whole scheme will make upon the work already being done by friendly societies, State Governments, and various contributory hospital schemes which have been organized throughout Australia on a voluntary basis, the Government would have been obliged to draft a bill which would not have had so much irr it that is objectionable. A better, more comprehensive and more equitable bill should be submitted to this House. I therefore move That all words after the word "" T h a t "" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:"" t h is House is of opinion that in its present form the bill is unacceptable because(ci) It seeks to place upon a contributory basis the payment of pensions for old age, invalidity and widowhood, which should be provided as n matter of right without the exaction of individual contributions; (6) It provides unequal benefits for men and women; (c) It fails to provide medical benefit for the wives and children of contributors; (J) By partially overlapping the field of friendly society activity it tends to discourage young men find wnmfti from joining these associations of selfhelp, thus threatening the continued strength of friendly societies without providing in f u l l tlie servii-us which they now render; and, therefore, the bill should be withdrawn mid redrafted and a more liberal bill, freed from the defects now enumerated, should be introduced without delay."" I have moved this amendment to the believe that at this sta.ge wo should direct the architect to redesigu the structure rather than leave it to the builders, the members of this Parliament, to riome forward with a separate plan that would destroy the general symmetry which is essential in any well-constructed plan for national insurance. We all know what would happen if a flood of amendments were suggested to this bill. For that reason I submit that Ave should, at this stage, make a declaration respecting the form of bill which we consider should be submitted to us, and when a bill in that form has been drafted we could consider it and at the committee stage make such amendments and adjustments as we thought proper. required in this bill to make it acceptable are too radical to contemplate. The actuarial calculations upon whicli tlic measure is based would be thrown out of adjustment if any effective treatment were given to the general principles underlining this measure. AVe consider, therefore, that after the Government has taken into account the views of members of this chamber it should withdraw the bill and have it redrafted. After this debate it would be in a position to submit to us a more workmanlike and more liberal bill with which we could deal without doing so much damage to the structure of it. It would have been very much wiser had the Government avoided tbe secrecy whicli has marked its discussions on this proposal with various bodies. The genoral structure of the bill was one which it was important that friendly societies, medical practitioners, State Governments, aud workers' organizations, should have had before them. It is true that the report of Sir Walter Kinnear was made available some time ago, but how far and to what extent the Government intended to implement that report was not known until the Treasurer delivered his second-reading speech. The people should have been given more knowledge of this bill. It would be tragic if , at this order and offensive. I call on him to stage, the Commonwealth failed to do its utmost to accept a larger responsibility for the social services of Australia than it has hitherto accepted. T. am glad indeed that, after nearly four decades of federation, we have reached the stage at whicli we can come face to face with a greatly enlarged plan to deal with the health and welfare of family life in Australia; but I submit that the general principles of the bill should be reconsidered. The Government should take cognizance of the views of the Opposition, and of the friendly societies, and should endeavour to deal with the subject not as a party ministry but as the executive of the nation, co-operating with all interests concerned in the working out of a better plan than tbe hill contemplates. Mr r-urtiv. ister) [4.29] -The speech delivered by tbe Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) may be reduced to The alterations a very few words, which would indicate condemnation of the bill as a whole, and the desire to destroy it that has been in the minds of the Opposition for some considerable time. The Opposition desires the substitution of a measure that would place the whole community in a position of dependence upon the national Treasury from week to week, from, month to month, and from year to year. Instead of a system of insurance on a sound actuarial basis, guaranteeing benefits week by week, month by month and year by year, it desires a scheme under which the community would be dependent upon the circumstances of the Treasury from time to time, and would have no guarantee whatever that the benefits would be secured. Pensions Act operates in that way now. time when, because the payment of the pension is dependent upon the financial capacity of the Treasury, the pension could not be paid. Even friends of honourable members opposite have had to cut the pension down. The honourable member for East Sydney interjecting, The honourable member's remark is out of Parliament withdraw it, and apologize. Air. WARD -Certainly . Mr Speaker. Opposition was allowed to proceed with his speech without interruption. One of the reasons which impelled the Government to introduce this scheme is its. desire to provide for benefits the regular pavmenf of which can be depended upon. If the scheme were dependent on the circumstances of the Treasury at any particular time, there could bp no security from year to year with regard to the payments. This has been proved by recent history. I make no pretence that the bill is perfect or complete. Its introduction has been awaited for a very long time.

65,Mr Lyons,"The Leader of thein tlie preliminary examination of the position, constant attempts were made in this chamber to compel the Government to announce when the bill would be brought forward. The community as a whole has been eagerly awaiting the introduction of rhe measure, and the scheme submitted has met with the approval of a large section of the people. It has been critiproblem. I can only express my great cized, as inevitably it would be, because it is not perfect. As a matter of fact, this is merely the first measure. Government has been prepared from the beginning to receive suggestions for its improvement. I am surprised that some honourable members appear to be somewhat amused when it is suggested that the Government already intends to make changes with regard to some of the provisions of the bill. The Government has welcomed suggestions in the past and it will continue to do so. Despite the suggestion by the Leader of the Opposition that secrecy has been observed, I point out that the Government has consulted with every organization in Australia that it thought could contribute something of value in the consideration of the scheme. the Government consult? the medical profession, the trade unions, ancl the pharmaceutical societies. Consultations have been carried on to a greater extent than in connection with any former bill, in order to obtain as perfect a measure as is possible in tbe circumstances, and, as I have said, the Government still invites suggestions for its improvement. We hope that those suggestions will be constructive, not destructive. It has been proposed that additional bodies should be brought within the scope of the scheme and. that the benefits should be extended; but we should be as sure as possible that those who will have to make the contributions will be able to do so continuously, and that the benefits also will not prove too heavy for the scheme to carry. Without hesitation, I describe this measure as the "" first"" national insurance bill; there will be others from time to time. Already the Governrient is preparing for the introduction of another, because it has accepted suggestions which have been made in the proper spirit for the improvement of the scheme. Time will give us experience which we lack to-day, and the need for improvement will become apparent even without suggestions from outside. This is an honest attempt to make a definite contribution towards the solution of a very great disappointment that the members of the Opposition have not made some construcThe tive contribution to the debate for the purpose of improving the measure. Any practical suggestion put forward will receive consideration, but the Government is not prepared to run the risk of destroying the actuarial basis of the bill by accepting any suggestion haphazardly, merely because it may provide some special benefit to a particular section of the community, or even to the whole community. The benefits under the bill aro guaranteed to a majority of the people of Australia. They are of such a character that they are not exceeded, and I doubt if they are equalled, under any other scheme in the world. The benefits that will accrue are actually guaranteed, and will be received by the assured persons in return for contributions representing only one-quarter of the sum that would be actuarially required to cover those benefits at the average age of entry into the scheme. With this scheme in operation £3,000,000 will be annually distributed to insured persons who are laid aside by sickness. Apart from the relief which this will afford, the distribution of that large sum will beneficially affect the economic position of the country. The scheme will enable us to mobilize the medical resources of the community in a co-operative effort to relieve suffering, and at the same time to raise progressively the general standard of health of our peojjle. But the Opposition asks us to destroy this scheme before it is even considered. For the first time in our history, elderly insured persons will get the old age pension as a right, free of any deduction, or any inquisition as to their means. The benefits payable under this pension scheme will gradually rise from £2,000,000 a year to over £30,000,000 a year, and that will be in addition to the further £20,000,000 a year payable under",26,Frederick Stew Abt Wh Y Not Medical Benefit Committee A Medical

Its weekly circulation will materially increase the purchasing power of the people, and promote the prosperity of the country. Objection is taken to the contributory system, not by those who desire to improve the scheme, but by those who are entirely opposed to it. Surely we should pay heed to what is happening throughout tbe world, and to what is being done by other countries at least a3 democratic as our own.

It has been demonstrated clearly, 1 think, that it is practically impossible to have a scheme to deal with over 50 per cent, of the community without some assistance being required from employers and employees. Any other scheme would break down of its own weight. What was the position when the first Labour Government came into office in Great Britain? Tbat government was imbued with the same ideas as have been expressed by the members of the Opposition to-day, but in trying to put its scheme into effect it failed. In 1925, Mr Chamberlain, the present Prime Minister of Great Britain, introduced a contributory pensions scheme. Since that date, a Labour administration was in office in Great Britain, but far from repealing the act, it extended tbe scheme. There is scarcely a responsible Labour leader in compulsory health insurance Great Britain to-day who would suggest a departure from the contributory prinSuch a scheme as he ciple. I ask the Opposition to follow the example of the Labour party in England, and to assist the Government to place this bill on the statute-book so that, as time goes on, it may be improved. The Leader of the Opposition had a good deal to say about the sick and the suffering in this community. Let me assure him that this scheme will not interfere with what i * now being done, under existing legislation, to relieve them. Indeed, this scheme goes further; it will help those who desire to provide for their future but cannot by their own efforts do so.

There have been complaints that it is wrong to distinguish botween men and women in respect of the benefits arising froin this scheme. It is suggested that women will be unfairly treated as compared with men. Let us see what foundation there is for that charge. A woman in Australia may obtain the old-age pension on attaining the age of CO years. Under this scheme she will get a pension of .los. a week ou reaching that age.

85,Mr Lyons,"I challenge contradicspeech. given further consideration to the points raised to-day by the Leader of the Opposition and, as the result, has refrained from increasing the compulsory contribution by women, but I am in a position to give an assurance that, when the bill is in committee, provision will be made to allow women voluntarily to increase their contribution by 6d. a week, in order to obtain a pension at tbe rate of 20s. a week on attaining the age of 60 years. woman who makes the higher contribution will receive a pension equal to that which will be paid to a man at 65 years of age, although he will have paid a larger sum each week for a longer period. Of course, the option will have to be exercised within a limited period, but there will be no age limit. These provisions will apply to women who will become special voluntary contributors. for those with a limited wage. number of women will elect to make the higher contribution. As we are not living in an ideal world, we must face the fact that there is not equal pay for equal work for the sexes. Yet many young women have responsibilities which are considerably lighter than those borne by their men folk. Although the Leader of the Opposition has condemned the scheme of the Government, he complains that some sections of the people, such as relief workers, have not been included in it. I am not able to say now that they will be brought under the scheme, but I can say that it is the desire of the Government to include in it as many as possible. There is no need to question the bona fides of the Government; its aim is to make the scheme as comprehensive as possible. Nevertheless, acceptance of some of the suggestions which have been made would, before long, so extend the scheme as to include practically the whole community. That is not possible in a sound scheme of insurance. It has been suggested, for instance, that the medical benefits under medical services which practitioners were the scheme shoulcl be extended to the wives and families of insured persons. Others wish those benefits to apply also to farmers and other self-employed persons. Eurthermore, the doctors urge that specialist services of various kinds should be provided, and also that there should be a limit to the number of insured patients a doctor may treat. They ask also for increased remuneration. Some of the suggestions which have been made are interesting, and it is hoped that they will be incorporated in the scheme in the future. But in establishing a scheme of national insurance we must proceed along common-sense lines. We must use common sense at the beginning, so that we may achieve something to which we can add as time goes on. We have to consider, not only tbe finances of the scheme, but also the need for medical services. Where are we to get the required number of medical practitioners during the coming year? The services which the friendly societies have asked should be left to them, we shall leave to them. They also require the services of medical practitioners. The societies have asked that they should be the sole administrators of the scheme, but the medical profession and tbe Pharmaceutical Institute object. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, a very large number of persons has refused to join friendly societies in the past, and we are not prepared to enforce compulsory membership. In the interests of the friendly societies themselves, it would not be desirable. If people are prepared to join societies of their own free will, well and good, but if they are compelled to join, they would not be of much use even to the societies. Tbe Government will not agree to proposals that cannot be carried out, and I suggest that honourable members should adopt a more reasonable attitude to the proposals. We conferred with the friendly societies and with the British Medical Association; we entered into what we thought was an agreement with the Oouncil of the British Medical Association regarding the contract services to be rendered, but now the Council feels that it cannot carry out the underTaking which we thought had been given.",29,Frederick Stew Abt Wh Y Not Medical Benefit Committee A Medical

On the other hand, we could not agree to the friendly, societies alone taking f u l l control.

This was insisted upon oven by the International Labour Office in its recommendation on this subject. This bill is drafted in accordance with that principle-freedo m lo choose one's doctor; freedom, to choose one's chemist; freedom to choose one's society. This scheme is bringing into insurance 1,400,000 persons who, in the past, have refrained from joining friendly societies. Many of them have other attachments, and it would be wrong of the Government, and I believe it would be detrimental to the interests of the No ; but it means that friendly societies in the long run, to force those persons away from their existing a -sociations. and coerce thein into an unwilling allegiance to the friendly --ocietic-s. The National Insurance Commission may be trusted to exercise the most careful discrimination in its In approval of societies, aud there is a clause in the bill which empowers the commission to withdraw approval from any society which is not conducting its business in the sole interests of the insured members.

There is no truth in such suggestions.

We cannot hope to devise tbe perfect measure at this stage, and the Government is prepared to consider any suggestions for the improvement of the bill. I feel that this is only an instalment of our national insurance legislation, and that other measures will be placed upon the statute book from time to time. There has been a strong demand for the introduction of this scheme throughout Australia for many years. The Leader of the Opposition himself, when a member of the royal commission which dealt with the matter, said that the introduction of the scheme should not be delayed. Now the Government comes forward with a sound scheme, guaranteeing certain benefits, and I appeal to honourable members to assist the Government to place the measure on the statute-book as early as possible, in order urer, said that the benefits may not be delayed. Every fortnight that the measure is delayed will have tbe effect of ciitting out from the benefits of the scheme persons who have been looking forward to receiving them. man want us to pass the bill without discussion? that there should be undue delay.

The right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), in his closing remarks, said that any delay in disposing of the measure would mean delay in the establishment of the scheme to the detriment of those who would benefit under it. That was not a strictly accurate statement of the position because all honourable members know that, whatever time may be taken by this House in discussing its many provisions, the act, assuming that the Government's proposal is adopted by this Parliament, will not come into operation until the 1st January uext. A scheme such as the one outlined has been promised for a great many years. National insurance is on the platform of the Australian Labour party, but this does not mean that honourable members on this side must accept any pale shadow of national insurance legislation which this Government chooses to place before members. Many honourable gentlemen will recall the speech made by the present Minister for Commerce( Sir Earlo Page), who, as Treasurer in the Bruce-J'age Government, on 14th September, 1928, moved the second reading of tbe National Insurance Bill. The remarks of the Prime Minister this afternoon were reminiscent of those made nearly ten years ago by the deputy leader of the present Government. On that occasion, Sir Earle Pago, as TreasOn behalf of tlie Government, I have the honour of bringing before Parliament, in the National TiiMiiraueeB ill , thu most comprehensive and progressive measure of social reform that has ever been brought forward iu any parliament of Australia. But what happened to that ""most comAll honourable members know that it was intended as election bait for the pending appeal to the people and that the Government, when returned to power, made no attempt to honour its pledge. The present bill is the result of innumerable inquiries and reports on the subject of national insurance. For my own part, I doubted whether the Government had intended to proceed further with the matter, and now am convinced, in common with other honourable members not only on this side of the chamber, but also in the rank and file of government supporters, that the Ministry is actuated by ulterior motives: that its main purpose is to save expenditure on pensions and reduce the tax ou those sections of the community that are best able to pay taxes.

101,Mr Baker (Griffith 1 [5.15],"In myCurtin) pointed out that the bill is in essence a taxation measure, with this difference: instead of observing the golden principle of all sound taxation proposals, namely, that the burden should fall on those best able to bear it, contributions to we have the effrontery to debate it WH this scheme will be required of those least able to pay them. Summed up, the proposal is merely a device for sharing poverty. Once again, the poor will be called upon to assist the poor, while those who are really in a position to pay contributions and thus finance the scheme will escape. An examination of the bill discloses that a mountain of labour, as represented by the preliminary discussions and the. drafting of the many provisions, has produced a miniature mouse as represented by the benefits to be conferred on those who will come under the scheme. Instead of being universal ancl all-embracing, the Government's project will benefit directly about 1,850,000 employees in the Commonwealth, while a similar number will enjoy part benefits. In other words, the scheme embraces directly and indirectly, only about one-half of the population. It ignores completely the requirements of the most necessitous section of our peoplethe unemployed. I admit the constitutional difficulties to be encountered in bringing forward any proposal for unemployment insurance, but submit that much blame for this state of affairs must be attached to this Government because it has not made any serious attempts to obtain wider constitutional powers. As the result, the people are still suffering because of the continued existence of the anachrouism of State parliaments. If the present Government were sincere, it would have persisted in its endeavours to obtain for the central government wider industrial ancl other powers, as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. The Prime Minister, in the concluding sentences of his speech this afternoon emphasized that every moment occupied by the House in discussion of the bill would delay the coming into operation of the act. We have become accustomed to appeals of this nature since the Lyon.? Government came into power. Accordingly we appraise them at their true worth. Many months of idleness occursometimes the parliamentary recess has lasted for six mouths-and then when members re-assemble, we are expected to pass without delay measures of the utmost importance to the people. In connection with this bill we have been told that if shall prevent the national health and pensions scheme from being put into operation as rapidly as possible. There is no valid reason for this appeal. Although it was once, held that it was not competent for Parliament to enact legislation having retrospective effect, the Parliament can enact that payments under any bill shall be made from a given date, even if retrospective. A bill of the magnitude of the one now before the House calls for a very thorough examination of all its far-reach ing provisions. Therefore, we on this side make no apology when we say that we shall exercise all our rights as an Opposition, and use to the utmost the forms of the House governing debate to ensure that every clause of the bill is fully discussed. We are prepared, if necessary, to sit night and day. It is not our intention, as was suggested by the Prime Minister ancl the Treasurer, to pass it in 24 hours or a week, simply because a complete discussion of its many provisions may prevent the scheme from being put into operation as quickly as the Government wishes. The Treasurer told ns that ""every moment"" of the Government's time in recess had been given to the preparation of this bill. Of course the honourable gentleman spoke figuratively, otherwise the Government would not have bad time to consider the other measures which appear in its legislative programme for the present session. When, on the 4th May, the Leader of the Opposition, on the motion for leave to introduce this bill, submitted an amendment for the purpose of including in tlie scheme the unemployed, the Treasurer argued that the alteration was not necessary because the words "" other purposes "" included persons in the Commonwealth other than employed persons. Since the Treasurer is regarded as a man not altogether devoid of ability, I suggest that the argument which he employed to defeat the amendment on that occasion was unworthy of any Minister of the Crown, be he Prime Minister, Treasurer or other Minister. We on this side contend that a measure of such vital importance to the people should not he completed before the newly appointed senators take their places in that chamber on the 1st July. It is now seven months since the federal election resulted in the rout of Government candidates, but under an antiquated constitution the newly elected senators will not be permitted to take their places until the 1st July. Meantime the Senate is entitled to consider and pass legislation with the assistance of members most of whom have been rejected by the electors. orable member must confine his 'remarks lo the provisions of the bill. -.how why the bill should not be passed by this Parliament with the Senate as at present constituted. To do so is a negation of the principle of democracy which this Government ie supposed wholeheartedly to support. We had an example of its insincerity recently when it brought forward a measure which critics, rightly or wrongly, alleged was for the purpose of providing positions for superannuated politicians. That bill was introduced in the Senate in order that it could be passed by that chamber before tbe end of the financial year, and this chamber need not deal with it until after the next recess. able member is out of order. of this Parliament, and indeed of the Parliament of Great Britain, clue to the custom of following precedents instead of Mealing with each issue on its merits, has on many occasions prevented members of the Opposition from submitting amendments to bills not merely for the purpose of increasing the appropriation lionorable member to proceed on those lines. Orders as well as the procedure of the House, which has nothing whatever to do with the bill. reason for the position that has arisen, the public, I believe, will understand that insurance deficit would be £18,000,000. failure to move amendments to important legislation such as this is not due to oversight by tbe Opposition, but to the archaic procedure under which this deliberative assembly performs its business. the honourable member obey the direction of the Chair and confine his remarks to the bill. actuarial calculations will be found to be correct. In saying that, I am not criticizing the expert actuaries. Obviously, however, lionorable members of the Opposition have not at their disposal the resources possessed by the Government to enable them to check up the figures. I particularly stress this because our experience of the Treasurer's budgets will not allow us to place any reliance on his judgment in this particular regard. honourable member proceeds to discuss the bill, I cannot allow him to continue. position willnot arise as arose in Queensland in connection with a bill providing for railway superannuation which was brought before the Parliament of that State by a government of the same political complexion as this Government. Ostensibly, that measure was scrutinized in advance by expert actuaries, one of them being the most expert in Australia. Later, however, it was found to be totally unworkable. Investigations showed that unless the State government-whicl i at first did not propose to contribute anything, but later agreed to contribute £10,000 per annum-wa s responsible for over 50 per cent, of the total contributions, aggregating approximately £300,000 per annum, the bill would fall to pieces of its own weight. Not having had the opportunities which the Commonwealth Government has bad, I am not: suggesting that this bill may not be actuarially correct; but in view of our experience of governments of He is criticizing the Standing the same political kidney, we have every right to be very careful in regard to that particular matter.

111,Mr Baker,"I trust that the samebefore that initial deficit was overtaken. According to tbe Treasurer, the initial deficit will be £17,500,000, and it will be overtaken in 30 years. That is a very considerable difference. I prefer to accept Sir Walter Kinnear's figures rather than those of the Treasurer. I further point out that, since Sir Walter Kinnear's report was presented, the number of contributors has increased from 1,815,000 to 1,850,000. Obviously, therefore, the initial deficit will be greater five years older than the contributor instead of less than that ""which he estimated it would be, ancl a longer instead of a shorter period will be required to overtake it. , The actuaries who examined the Queensland railways superannuation scheme showed that actuarially it wa3 incorrect, despite which Mr Lyons) proudly proclaims will place Godfrey Morgan, then Minister for Railways in the Moore Government, signed the minute "" Take a risk."" That minute is still on the files in Queensland. I hope that the Commonwealth is not faced with a similar experience. I suggest that there is considerable risk that this scheme will fall of its own weight, particularly as there are eight or nine different organizations of non-government employees who will be given a free hand as to the manner in which they disburse government funds. There has been frequent reiteTation of the great benefits which this measure confers. I propose to prove, in the first place, that in several regards it is not nearly as beneficial as the act which is now in operation in Great Britain; and secondly, that it is nothing like as valuable a contribution to the mass of the people of Australia as was the bill brought forward ten years ago by Sir Earle Page, as Treasurer, on behalf of another anti-Labour Government. We are entitled dispassionately to make comparisons. Under the British act, the wife of an insured man also receives a pension, assuming that she has reached the insurable age. There is no such proposal in this measure, and I suggest that the Treasurer might consider its inclusion. The Opposition cannot move an amendment to that effect; it is precluded by the Standing Orders from doing so. There is also a very big difference between contributors ancl non-contributors. Under the Britisli act, a contributor receives a pension five years earlier than a noncontributor. Under this measure, the unfortunate person who has been scrambling along on the basic wage during the whole of his lifetime, and has contributed to this scheme, will receive a pension no earlier than a non-contributor who has been in receipt of a salary of more than £365 per annum. The necessity for differentiation was realized in Great Britain. There, the non-contributor has to wait until he is before he receives a pension. There is also another important difference. Under the British act, the allowance for a dependent child is fixed at 5s. a week. Under this so-called progressive legislation, which the Prime Minister( Mr Australia in the vanguard of democratic nations, 3s. 6d. a week is regarded as sufficient for a dependent child in this country. Great Britain? payment is 5s. a week for the first child and 3s. a week for every child thereafter. only in respect of the children of widows. Tbat is a very vital point. why a widow's child should need more than the children of other persons who are in needy circumstances. Not until an Australian citizen has four children will he receive as much as a man with a similar number of children in Great Britain. Under this measure, payment is to be made in respect of orphans ancl dependent children only until they reach the age of fifteen years, whereas under the British, act the payment is made in the first place up to the age of fourteen years, and then for a further term of two years in' the case of children who are in full-time attendance at school. The Government appears to have followed blindly the recommendations of Sir Walter Kinnear where they were found not to be too costly, and to have reduced other benefits recommended by that gentleman. I shall now compare this measure with the National Insurance Bill introduced in 1928 by Sir Earle Page. The second reading speech on it was made by that",34,Frederick Stew Abt Wh Y Not Medical Benefit Committee A Medical

115,Mr Baker,"I fail to understandgentleman in September of that year, but tbe bill was not further proceeded with. It was used as an electioneering bait, and proved very successful, the Government being returned to office. An exactly contrary attitude has been adopted by the Government on the present occasion, but for the same reason. This measure has been introduced immediately following upon an election, two ancl a half years before the Government will again have to appear before the people. Realizing that tbe people have a short memory, the Government probably hopes that in two aud a half years' time the arguments now used against the bill, ancl tbe harm done by it throughout the community, will be forgotten. I propose to prove that the bill introtioneering purposes, if it was actuarially duced almost ten years ago made provision for greater benefits at less cost than are proposed at the present time. In connection with the previous measure, Sir Earle Page pointed out that it provided for no fewer than nine separate benefits, of which eight were applicable to male and six lo female contributors. The. amount to he charged was Is. a week in respect of each male employee and 6d. a week in respect of each female employee. Under ihe present proposal, the charge is to be Is. 6d. a week in respect of each male employee at the outset, to be increased to Is. Od. a week iu five years' time, ancl to scheme was actuarially sound? We on 2s. n week in ten years' time. employer, of course, will pay an equal amount. charge proposed by Sir Earle Page. J lis measure provided that females should contribute 6d. a week, whereas under this jiro]3osal the amount is to be Is. a week at tbe commencement, and Is. 3d. a week later. A further analysis discloses that the former measure made provision for all sorts of benefits which are not suggested at the present time. whether many Government supporters have concerned themselves very much about the relative benefits under this bill eompared with those of that introduced ten years ago. Under the bill of 1928 provision was made, for example, for a marriage allowance on a sliding scale to a contributing female. A girl who became a contributor at sixteen years of age, and married at 26 years of age, was entitled to a gift of £4. Mr Baker. This was a wedding present from the Government. There is no proposal in this measure for anything of that kind, although the contribution from females is from two to two-and-a-half times higher than that provided under the 1928 bill. At that time the Government of the day apparently thought it desirable that women who left their employment to undertake the invaluable duties of wifehood were entitled to some consideration. The sick benefit provided under the 1928 bill ""was at the rate of 27s. 6d. a week for adult malesand married male minors. Under this bill it is to be only £1 a week. It, must be kept in mind, of course, that the 1928 bill was, in the opinion of very many, drafted for elecsound, it is difficult to understand why the Government should now be able to offer only a very much lower benefit for a very much higher contribution. In the case of adult females, or married female minors, the benefit under the 1928 bill was £1 a week, but under this progressive legislation, it is only 15s. a week. Unmarried minors of either sex wore to get 15s. a week under the 1928 scheme; but under this scheme the unmarried male minor gets 12s. a week, and the unmarried female minor get3 10s. a week. AgainI ask, why the difference if the 1928 The this side of the chamber, after long experience and some appreciation of the That is exactly double the general attitude of the Government, have our doubts about the actuarial basis'which is adopted. We can understand that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer should desire the discussion of this bill to be expedited. No doubt they would like the measure to lie passed without any discussion. I am I doubt confident, however, that the cumulative force of the arguments of the Opposition will wreck the whole scheme, for. it is full of anomalies and inequities. The plan of ten years ago provided for a child allowance of 5s. a week in respect of each child under 16 years of age. Now, when no election is looming ahead, tbe proposal is that the child allowance shall be 3s. 6d. a week, and that it shall operate only until the child reaches 15 years of age. Have our children become stunted in their growth through malnutrition or neglect, that only 3s. 6d. is now needed to maintain them? The widow's allowance proposed under the 192S bill was SI a week. That proposed under this bill is 7s. 6d. a week. In fairness to the Government, I must direct attention to the fact that it has generously undertaken to increase the allowance for widows to 15s. a week in five years' time. But, of course, the contributions will also increase by 6d. a week in five years' time. The'1928 bill also provided thatSuperannuation allowances are to be made available to insured persons of both sexes upon reaching superannuation age. In addition it is proposed to apply them to the case of any pensioner whose wife attains the age of CO. Exactly what that means is not quite clear but doubtless the superannuation benefits under this bill have been diminished, as have practically all other benefits compared with those under the 1928 bill. 1 desire now to deal with one or two points which, in my opinion, must completely destroy the bill. The constitutional difficulties which face the Government in regard to the measure are almost overwhelming. The position is so hopeless in this regard that it seems to me that the Government is merely seeking to gain kudos through having introduced the bill, because it knows very well that the measure is one that could not withstand an attack befoie the High Court. The title of the measure indicates that it is intended to deal with health and insurance. wealth power to deal with health is extraordinarily limited. members to the following paragraph on page 168 of the report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution issued in 1929The Commonwealth Parliament h«s no power to legislate with respect to health except in so far as it may do so in the exercise of its as marriage, divorce, matrimonial causes, powers to legislate with respect to imports and exports, to trade and commerce between thu States, or to quarantine.. Nothing could be more definite than that. As a matter of fact, considerable doubt exists as to the constitutionality of the Commonwealth Department of Health. According to the reportto which I have just referred, the Prime Minister at a Premiers Conference in 1919advanced tentative proposals for the establishment ot"" a Commonwealth Department of Health. To these proposals each of the Stair Governments ultimately consented, and tindepartment was ercatt'ii by order in council on the 7ih March, 1021. It will be gathered from that brief citation that the Prime Minister had to obtain the consent of the State Governments before the Commonwealth could establish its Health Department. Section 51 of the Constitution provides that tbe Commonwealth Parliament may make laws with respect to "" (ix) Quarantine,'' but nothing more is said about health matters. It seems to rne, therefore, that it can hardly be argued that this bill has been introduced pursuant to the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with health. Under that beading it must surely be regarded as ultra vires the Constitution. Even graver doubt exists concerning the power of the Commonwealth to deal with insurance. Placituin xiv of section 51 of the Constitution provides that the parliament may legislate, with respect toInsurance other than State insurance, also State insurance extending beyond the limit,of the State concerned. I submit that this power has no relation whatever to health insurance or pensions, for insurance of that description wa.s scarcely known over 38 years ago when the Constitution was framed. The power relating to insurance is referred to in section 51, in a group of powers relating The Commonwholly to commercial matters. The matters immediately preceding placituin I direct honourable xiv relate to currency, coinage, legal tender and banking, and those immediately following it relate to matters of commerce, weights and measures, bills of exchange, promissory notes, bankruptcy ancl insolvency. Quite a new group of subjects begins at placitum xxi, such and invalid and old-age pensions, all of which deal with social subjects. I contend, therefore, that if the Government U relying on its power to legislate in respect of insurance to establish the constitutionality of this bill, it is skating on very thin ice. In the volume Judicial and Statutory Definitions of Words and Phrases, it is clearly shown in innumerhas been overruled, but not many years able reported cases that commercial ago these provisions would have been insurance parties. There is no suggestion in the bill now before us of a contract between parties. As a matter of fact the Commonwealth Government is seeking to posal to explain fully why I think that force this bill upon the community, old-age pensions should not be contribualthough clearly it has no authority under tory. I support the contention of my either its health or insurance powers to leader that they should be paid out of legislate on this subject. The Treasurer has referred to the principle to be observed is that the burden measure as insurance for collective of taxation should be shouldered by those security. We frequently refer to all sorts who are best able to bear it. Banking, of things as insurance.

Tbe tion they should be reminded that much insurance referred to in the Constitution of tbe money raised in this way is required unquestionably connotes contracts. seems to me, therefore, that even assuming investments. that this bill is passed, it will be possible for any aggrieved person to render it ineffective.

That the Treasurer has doubts about the matter is revealed by the fact that by taxation, and that the fairest method he proposes to introduce a separate is. income taxation. If the cost of measure to enact the taxing provisions of national health insurance is to be met by the scheme. Even in that regard the bill means of income taxation,, it will be is likely to come to grief, for it does not necessary to impose some burden on the provide for equality of taxation.

It is now over £SO,000,000 a year, and the wealth of the community has vastly increased. The Treasurer contends that, owing to the increasing number of people in the community of pensionable age, there will be -comparatively fewer young people to carry the old people who are receiving pensions; but that jn'esupposes no increase of the birth rate. The Minister's -own speech showed that there has been a slight increase of the birth rate in the last few years, because economic conditions have improved to a certain extent. If the Government would see that the requisite amount of purchasing power was provided to put all our people back into employment, and to increase the productive resources of the country, the birth even further than the legislation rate would increase at a more rapid rate than at the present time. Apart from that, however, it is not a matter of great wishes to do the best thing possible concern whether a smaller number of young people will have to carry a larger number of old people. The main question is-ho w many persons are in employment at remunerative rates of wages to carry the total financial burden of the scheme? All who are not in employment to-day are not helping to meet the cost of pensions and other services. tackle the problem is to put the productive the man who has been in good circumforces of the country into full operation. I do not suggest any wild scheme of inflaUnder this measure, without any contrition, but, under a more advanced financial system than that now adopted, all our people, except the few who are unemployable, could be given full time employment. Technological advance in the industrial world is so rapid that in 40 years' time we should be able to produce quite easily all the wealth required to enable us to pay £32,000,000 a year for old-age pensions. I have shown that this bill falls far short of the measure submitted ten years ago by Sir Earle Page, and I have indicated its limitations compared with the British act. It is also faulty by comparison with the pensions legislation of New Zealand. When the New Zealand Labour Government came into power two years ago, it not only restored the old-age pension from 17s. 6d. a week, to which it had been cut by an anti-labour government, to the sum of £1 a week, which had previously been paid, but also increased tbe rate to 22s. 6d. a week. The war pension in New Zealand amounts to 22s. 6d. a week. In regard to all pensions, the pensioner's wife receives 10s. a week, and, I understand, a similar weekly payment is made in respect of each dependent child. Instead of apologizing throughout the country for the payments to the old people, it should be a matter for pride that payments for old age and invalid pensions bave increased. The more the revenue is used in assisting people who are most in need, the more we are entitled to regard ourselves as a civilized community. The Labour Government in New Zealand is now contemplating the introduction of a national superannuation bill which will go already operative in the dominion. If the Commonwealth Government for the people, it will be well advised to wait for a short period until the New Zealand national insurance legislation has been introduced, and then to copy it in its entirety. One of the arguments put forward in the reports of experts in favour of this The best way to bill is that it leads to thrift. What about stances but has become impoverished I bution at all, he will be entitled to receive the pension. Surely that is a tremendous blow, under the aegis of this Government, to independence and thrift. Is thrift a thing of such high importance? Under the present unbalanced social system, thrift may be, not a virtue, but an evil. For the first year or two, during the last depression, the necessity for thrift was preached until there was an awakening to the fact that the only way to counteract the effects of the depression was to increase the purchasing power of the people. Accordingly, the policy of deflation was changed to what was politely referred to as one of ""reflation"", with the result that the people spent more readily, and the ship of State was once more placed on an even keel. Thrift is at all times an evil, unless there is a currency-controlling authority to. pump iu;o tlic community sufficient purchasing power to balance tbe wealth, hoarded up Leader of the Opposition, ou behalf of by the so-called thrifty patriots.

I have not met any working man or woman who has expressed any doubt as to whether or not he or she should be called upon to pay the Is.

IndeedI am convinced that the working men and women of this country are essentially suspicious of a political party that promises them something for nothing. a i the last election. recollections of the fate of those persons who, during the recent period of depression, were unable to obtaiu the amount of invalid or old-age pension which they previously received. They realize tliat if they pay the relatively small contribution provided for in this bill they w ill be able to command those benefits which it promises. That, I believe, is the view of every self-respecting working man and woman of this country. They do not svek charity. They desire to maintain tbeir self-respect, and to be sure of something for which they have qualified by payments made by tluem.

In? guaranteed during a. period of intense lUiemployment ? with under this measure to the greatest possible extent.

I said that 1 refused to delude myself that there was a difference between a contribution and a tax. man condemned the measure because "" it seeks to place upon a contributory basis the payment of pensions for old-age, invalidity, and widowhood, whicli should be provided as a matter of right without the exaction of individual contributions If the inference to be drawn from that statement is not that these benefits could be piovided fsom the Commonwealth Treasury without eon'rihutions by the beneficiaries, I do not understand the meaning of words. Mr CI'KTIK -Does the Treasurer suggest that the Commonwealth Treasury at present gets revenue without taxing tbe workers . l man would lead me along a by-path. No one win deny that his amendment seeks to make the workers of this country unbitter derstand that they can get all these benefits without paying for them at all by way of contribution. I do not believe that that could be done for any considerable period. I venture to think that, had the Leader of the Opposition been in my place at the Commonwealth Treasury for the last five or six years, he would share my anxiety-and , indeed, that of every member of the Cabinet-as to the future of social services in Australia. Any critic can solve an individual problem of government so long as it is not related to a'l the other problems; but the duty of a government, as I see it, is to do its best to solve at the same time all tbe problems that: confront it . The maintenance of social services is only one of many problems. Those honourable gentlemen who believe that we can continue for a number of years to pay these benefits out of Commonwealth revenue, should study the Commonwealth budgets for the last 25 years. In 1913-1914, the Oommonwoalth budgeted for a revenue of £21,000,000. Largely a& a result of heavier commitments due to the war, the amount budgeted for in 1919-1920 was £50,000,000. This year the amount is approximately £90,000,000. I did not say anything increased in the meantime. advanced but slowly. Moreover, the wealth of this country has not increased in proportion to the increase of its expenditure.

( Mr Lyons) cited some figures in order to reveal the position that would arise if contributions from both employers and employees were omitted from this scheme.

State and Federal taxes in this country to-day together represent a very high degree of taxation indeed. I do not say that this is the highest in the world, but it is not very far short of it, and the unused limits of taxation in this country are not great. They may appear great in times of relative prosperity, but it is necessary to provide for a taxation yield that can be maintained in good years and bad. I may say that I have had legitimate cause from time to time for anxiety on this score. The Leader of the Opposition asks that all these benefits should be provided from revenue, but I do. not believe that such a proposal, if given effect, would provide the workers with an adequate measure of security. They would receive their benefits in good times, but it is doubtful whether they would receive them in bad times. If this is to be really a scheme of national insurance, it must be something upon which the workers can rely in bad times as well as in good. antee that in a time of depression the workers will still receive the benefits for which they have contributed? be given much more easily under the Government's scheme than under that proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. From a governmental point of view, this is the most generous national insurance scheme in the world to-day. I believe that there is no government scheme, or any private provident scheme, that is nearly so generous as this scheme is to-day, and the government will continue progressively to contribute more to this insurance fund than is contributed by the State to any other scheme of which I have knowledge. The amendment of the Leader of the Opposition further statesTlie present bill is unacceptable because (6) it provides unequal benefits for men ancl women. That, of course, is true. It does provide unequal benefits for men and women, but the inequality is not where the honourable member believes it to be. The women are getting more out of the scheme than their contributions warrant. I do not say that that is wrong, but it is a fact that women, as compared with men, will obtain more than will be warranted by tbeir contributions. Moreover, in the course of not very many years, women and dependents will be getting more absolutely out of the scheme than men will be getting.

It is evident that there is nothing in the way of discrimination against women in this scheme. The Leader of the Opposition has himself admitted that women are not able to pay the same contributions as men.

We must remember that the amount of 15s. a week for sick pay or the old-age pension for women is only a base or minimum rate.

The British scheme provides supplementary allowances for dependent children of widows, but it does not provide similar allowances in respect of sick pay or old-age pensions. This bill does, and that is one of the many merits.

It is not tbe belief of the Government that the rest of the working population in Australia has made no provision for the future. All the evidence is to the contrary. Statistics relating to the various life insurance societies in Australia show that there are considerably over 3,00U,000 life policies in operation. There are also the very many provident funds established in connection with private industries. These funds are, in essence, friendly societies in that they perform largely the same kind of service for their contributors. Therefore, I may say of them that they are, in all but name, friendly societies. All use a somewhat harsh term, sutler by reason of the fact that the Government is endeavouriug to bring the whole of the Australian working population into a compuNory national insurance scheme with specified and guaranteed benefits for all of the contributors. But the vast majority of these organizations will suffer quite willingly for the sake of a widespread national insurance plan. Jt is appropriate that I should in this connection direct the attention of honourable members to the third paragraph in Sir Walter Kinnear's original report. It is to be found on page 21'Die experience of social insurance in most countries is that u national scheme stimulates a desire mi the part of the better-paid workers for further protection. It is not the function of any system nf State insurance to supersede every other kind of t h r if t . scheme should provide a substantial foundation upon which insured persons would be stimulated to make supplementary provision for themselves according to their means. In that way the virtue of t h r if t and the spirit amendment moved by the Leader of the of self-reliance would be encouraged. It is to be hoped, moreover, that many of the larger employers of labour who have been deterred in the past from formulating some pensions scheme for their workpeople because of the prohibitive cost, might see their way to make a more modest proposal which, in supplementing the national scheme, would be of practical value and would add immensely to the satisfaction and contentment of their workpeople. Experience of the national insurance scheme in Great Britain has shown that [48] . friendly societies have at least maintained their position on the voluntary side and, as regards the approved society side of their business, have actually gone ahead by leaps and bounds in the 20 years during which the scheme has been in operation. Therefore, it is true io say that, grouping the voluntary side of friendly societies' activities and the work of the approved societies, there has been a definite measure of progress. As regards life societies, it may be argued on behalf of life assurance companies that following the initiation of a compulsory national insurance scheme on a fairly broad basis, the workers will be less disposed to take out policies in respect of their own lives or of their children. But we do not believe that, once the national insurance scheme has got into its stride, this will continue to be the effect. We believe that after an initial these organizations will, to halt following the inauguration of the scheme, the volume of life insurance business in Australia will increase at least at the rate of recent years. Therefore any sacrifice which the Government might ask these various thrift organizations in Australia, to hear for a year or two will be small relative to tbe benefits to be conferred ou the community. In conclusion I would say, as the Prime Minister said this afternoon, that this bill does not seek to establish the millennium overnight, simply by the payment of Js. 6d. a week by employed male workers. That would be too much to expect of any project. Tho Government does not claim that all the ills to which mankind is heir will be cured by this measure, but I do venture the opinion which I expressed on another occasion A state that the bill, imperfect though, it may he, is a mighty fine start. |8.40J I desire briefly to support the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), and also to reply to some of the misrepresentations made by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) in the speech which has just concluded. As I understood the Leader of the Opposition, the intention of the amendment is not as described by the Treasurer.

170,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"pensions. He did not suggest that if we enlarged the sphere of social legislation to tbe shoulders of another section. include all the benefits now enjoyed by members of friendly societies throughout Australia, there would not have to be some form of contribution. Leader of the Opposition said he was in favour, as I am, of a really national scheme, and as I understand his argument, no scheme can be regarded as national unless it includes all the people. The bill now before the House does not do that. It is a hybrid proposal, and all the arguments and explanations in the world will not prove otherwise. It does not cover the whole of the people. It does not cover even all those who excludes thousands of working people whom the Treasurer, for the first time to-night, described as self-employeda new name for Australia! Many thousands of men and women, owing to a lessening of their efficiency, are unable to secure regular employment, with the result that they accept work on a contract basis which yields something less than the legal basic wage. I speak with some knowledge of this section of our work-people because of my experience of dealing with claims under the ""Workmen's Compensation Act. In endeavouring to frame amendments of that act we have always experienced difficulty in covering workers who earn their living in this way. tum of change of methods in the industrial arena large numbers of workpeople, particularly in the building trades, accept contracts in small sections. Some of them are specialists in their own particular class of work, and eight or ten small sections may obtain employment in this way in one building. These people are not classified as employees. Consequently they are not covered by this bill. The same applies to men engaged in agricultural and horticultural pursuits. scheme. the bill they are not, but I hope that the Treasurer will be able to overcome this defect. In my opinion the scheme has been introduced for the purpose of shifting the growing burden of old-age and invalid pensions from the shoulders of one section of the people, to Employees who are covered by it must make regular contributions or else lose its benefits. I know that the bill The contains reasonable provisions designed to ensure that the casual worker will be carried by the scheme as long as possible, but there is no escaping the fact that eventually practically the whole of the burden will rest on the shoulders of the employees. The businesses of some employers will be temporarily disorganized and they will lose money in the process, but in the last analysis the same practice will be adopted in regard to these contributions by employers as is followed in work for wages. It connection with the sales tax and all other taxes; the cost will be reflected in the prices charged for commodities. The Treasurer may reasonably advance the argument that the wages of the workers will be automatically adjusted in order to conform to variations of the cost of living. My rejoinder to that is that approximately one-half of the workers are employed under Arbitration Court awards which are subject to automatic adjustment, and even they have to wait until the cost of living has risen by a certain number of points in order to have the adjustment made. The process of adjustment is a lengthy one and the workers never make up what they lose. If the experts who drafted this scheme Because of the increasing momencould be induced to examine figures that could be suggested to them based on Australian practice, I am certain that they would come to the conclusion that at least 75 per cent, of the cost of this scheme will ultimately fall on those who work for wages. Therefore, it is a hybrid scheme from that viewpoint. It is not universal, nor is it national in character. I am sorry that whenever pensions matters are being discussed, the Treasurer, as nicely as he can, conveys the impression that he regards the invalid and old-age pensions as a charitable scheme. words. But the honourable gentleman always suggests that we should get away from such a scheme, thus implying that it is on a charitable basis. That is",45,Frederick Stew Abt Wh Y Not Medical Benefit Committee A Medical

174,Mr Holloway,"Not in thosenot true, nor is it fair to those who receive the pension. That scheme, as the honourable gentleman knows, has been in existence for over 30 years. The basis of it was that those who had served this country in industry for a minimum period of 20 years, should be given the pension as a right if their circumstances showed that they needed it. The honourable gentleman is not acting fairly when he advances the claims of the present scheme by suggesting that the other is on a charitable basis, and that this will remove that stigma. Air. CASEY I have suggested nothing of the sort. further. I suggest that the charity alleged by some people in connection with the existing scheme will become reality under the proposed scheme. Here we have a clear line of demarcation. In one case, a worker between the ages of 16 and 65 years will pay Is. 6d. a week or more to become entitled to a pension. On the other hand, a struggling shop-keeper or a worker who whitewashes walls at so much a piece instead of so much a week -thousand s make less than the basic wage-ma y not make one contribution up to the age of 65 years, and yet will receive a pension if he passes the means test. Surely it is obvious that the man who is forced to face the means test in order to receive the pension will be regarded as one who is receiving charity. What formerly was merely alleged to be charity is being made real charity. I object to the scheme on that account. I am not opposed to national insurance against unemployment; on the contrary, I have advocated it for years. We should first tackle those matters which are essential and most urgent, leaving those which have been handled really well, by the lodges of this country until the existing gap has been bridged. The Government has started from the wrong end. For years we have been promised insurance against enforced periods of unemployment, which are becoming longer and more regular each year. Temporary relief is being afforded at present by the operations of armaments firms. Everybody knows that, so soon as those operations slacken, the army of unemployed will become larger than it has ever been. Sir Walter Kinnear and other experts will,I think, agree that this period of orthodox prosperity is the appropriate time for the establishment of a scheme to protect us against this everrecurring evil. If this Government does not tackle the matter of unemployment insurance in a period of prosperity, when the conditions are favorable to the building up of a fund, when can we expect to have such a scheme introduced? I object to the proposed scheme because it is only partial in its scope. It omits to ileal with those matters which most urgently need attention and interferes with others that are already partially covered. It disorganizes those institutions which are catering successfully for a largo number of our people, and does not bridge the gap which will be caused by tbe withdrawal of persons from those institutions. Tliere are hosts of recognized friendly societies which have stood the test of nearly 100 years, catering for the requirements of thousands of unemployed families in respect of medical, dispensary, burial aud sick benefits. This scheme will not do that. It does not touch the women and children. It does not deal with the condition of' affairs which impels a man who has the responsibility of a wife and growing family, to join a lodge. It will undermine the lodges and make their position precarious for years to come. It does not say that the operations of the state shall be extended to cover all social services. It is a hybrid scheme which makes gaps and does not bridge them. It does not tackle the fundamental economic problem of unemployment. Eor these reasons I am opposed to it, and support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin); not because I object to asking people to contribute, either compulsorily or voluntarily, to a fund for the provision of medical attention, funeral expenses and sick pay. No mention of that has been made in the amendment. We blame the Government for not having included unemployment insurance in its proposal. We say that a widow's pension, which has been promised for so many years, should be given as a right,",46,Frederick Stew Abt Wh Y Not Medical Benefit Committee A Medical
175,Mr Holloway,"Let me go a littleand should have no association with a compulsory contribution scheme. All of the benefits which have been and are now being provided by the Australian Natives Association and other lodges of this country, should bo left untouched until tbe matters not already dealt with have been tackled. The Treasurer did not reply to the charge that this is a perpetuaupon attaining the age of 65 years in the tion of an evil whicli Anstraiia and all the advanced countries of the world have been endeavouring to remove, namely, the inequality of the sexes. I do not mean to suggest that he tried purposely to mislead. Thousands of women in this country do not get on the average more than 60 per cent, of the male wage, but we should all be pleased to know that, as the result of intensive educational work, the number of women who receive equal pay for the same work in both public and private employment, is increasing year by year here and in England ancl every other country world. not be examined in that way. It is not a matter of comparing the wage of a woman with that of a man. In considering the benefits to be given under the scheme, surely we do not take into account the fact that an engineer gets £7 a week ancl a labourer £3 10s. a week. The contribution of both is Is. 6d. a week. The question is, are the contributions ancl benefits in proportion to recipient? fixed at the lowest amount which will make possible the subsistence of a single individual, and should apply equally to male and female. Surely the £1 decided upon in the case of a male is not too much for a single woman? Should not the matter be examined in that way? No self respecting government should suggest that a female who has to keep herself should receive only 12s. 6d. or 15s. a week merely because she is a"" woman. The battle for recognition of equality of the sexes has been almost won. The cause will not be advanced by saying that.we shall take only Is. a week from a woman because she earns £3 a week and Is. 6d. from a man because he earns £5 a week, and require the woman to live on 15s., while recognizing that the man needs at least £1. or. Holloway. meivt's scheme because it introduces that element of sex inequality, aud also because it has the real stigma of charity, which is not attachable to the existing pensions scheme. I can recall the words of the Prime Minister who introduced that scheme. He said ""This is a right which we give to our pioneers case of men and 60 years in the case of women if they have served in industry in Australia for at least 20 years and have a clean record; this is their clue, no matter whether they live in a cottage or a castle, as long as it is their own domicile and they do not draw rent, interest or profit from it."" The sex element has never been introduced into the invalid and old-age pensions scheme of this country. I say in the presence of the English experts who are in the chamber to-night, that that scheme has been acclaimed all in the over the world as one which other But the question should countries could well follow. The Treasurer did not put the case fairly. He cited the highest figures of the Commonwealth for the last 25 years. The whole of the economic activities of the world have been changed. He pointed out how the cost of pensions has ri -en. Why did he not direct attention to the other side of the balance sheet and show how the national income has increased, and how the burden the amount earned by the of indirect taxation has been They are not. They are made heavier, in order to balance tbe ledger? During the last six or seven yeai-3 this Government has consistently hinted that something of this sort should be done in order to relieve it of the responsibility of defraying the cost of invalid and old-age pensions, yet at the same time it has repeatedly remitted taxes that were payable by the richest section of the community. Twice the amount of money that has been added to the pensions bill has been remitted in taxes to the wealthy people of this country; such remissions amount to millions of pounds, and because the Government has now found that it mu3t re-imposc the taxes, or take some other course to increase the revenue, it has seen fit to abrogate a principle that has been in operation in I am opposed to the Governthis country for more than twenty years. Tho Labour party is definitely opposed to any interference, or tampering, with the basis of our pensions scheme. Moreover, it considers that pensions should be provided for widows and orphans on the same basis as the invalid and old-age pensions. The money to provide these social services should be obtained by taxing the persons who enjoy high incomes in this country. The scheme of this bill is not national in character, it is not universal in effect, and it is not on a fair basis. Neither the burdens nor the benefits operate equitably. The wives and children of certain taxpayers are excluded. Some of the benefits sought to be provided will have to be paid for by the recipients while they are between 16 and 65 years of age, whereas benefits will be provided for certain other persons who will have contributed nothing to the general fund. If this scheme is put into operation many thousands of our people who are excluded from it will feel ashamed to apply for the invalid and old-age pension. The greatest objection is to shifting the burden from the rich to the poor. though I did not hear the Treasurer ( Mr been asked to believe. He eaid that in Casey), deliver his second-reading speech on tnis bill, I have read the report of it and I have listened to the speeches of other honourable members who have spoken in the debate. I have come to the conclusion that the purpose behind this bill is not to provide national health insurance, but to induce Parliament to take a step which will compel the workers of Australia to pay the whole cost of the social services they now enjoy. The words "" national health "" appear in the title of the bill, but in principle the measure contains nothing really effective to do with that subject. The Treasurer made this point clearer in tbe speech that he delivered this evening, than in the second-reading speech which he delivered on the 4th May. Unfortunately, the tendency so clearly noticeable in this bill has also been noticed in certain States in which non-Labour governments are in nower. I have New South ""Wales particularly in mind. The Government of that State has undoubtedly diverted the revenue, of the unemployment tax from the purpose for which it was intended to the provision of social benefits which previously had been paid for out of general revenue. The Commonwealth Government in this bill is now seeking to follow that vicious example. The Treasurer has frequently of late commented upon the increasing cost of the social benefits now being provided in the Commonwealth sphere. So far as I know, such benefits are limited to invalid and old-age pensions and the maternity allowance. It can hardly be said that war pensions and other commitments under our repatriation legislation are social services. This evening the Treasurer expressed the fear that, in spite of all the prosperity which the country is alleged to be enjoying, trouble lies ahead in regard to meeting payments for these social services. I do not know whether the honourable gentleman has information which is not available to the general public. implication in what I said. the Treasurer was seeking to inform the country that the stability which we are sometimes told has been restored is not nearly so solid as, ou occasions, we have the course of a few years tlie expenditure of the Government in respect of pensions would reach an alarming figure, which would perturb future governments. For that reason this Government is seeking to alter the policy of this Parliament by transferring the burden of social services from the shoulders of the whole community to those of the workers, for whom the benefits have been chiefly provided. If , in such circumstances, Labour men were to support this bill as it stands we should be untrue to principles which have governed Labour policy since the party first became a power in Australia. We believe that the workers have never been given a fair proportion of the wealth that they have produced. Eor that reason Labour has endeavoured, by certain legislative activities and other processes, to fashion the economic structure of the country so that the workers would ultimately enjoy a larger share of the national wealth. The setting-up of industrial courts and wage-fixing tribunals was one part of that process. The provision of social services was another part",47,Frederick Stew Abt Wh Y Not Medical Benefit Committee A Medical
176,Mr Beasley (Sydney) [9.3],Al,49,Frederick Stew Abt Wh Y Not Medical Benefit Committee A Medical
177,Mr Casey,There was no sinister,49,Frederick Stew Abt Wh Y Not Medical Benefit Committee A Medical
178,Mr Beasley.,"It seemed to me that of it. These social services might fairly be described as a national dividend to the workers. By means of pensions for those who need them, and child endowment for those rearing families, it is possible to give the worker a greater share of the wealth of the country than can be obtained through the medium of wages. Labour believes that this is the only way under * our present system that the workers can obtain anything approaching their proper share of the wealth of this country. Such a policy must inevitably be beneficial to the whole community, for undoubtedly it adds to the purchasing power of the people. By supplementing the income of the workers in this way we undoubtedly benefit society as a whole. Such a policy is much to be preferred to one which would have the effect of allowing an altogether undue proportion of the wealth produced to remain in the hands of those who are sometimes called "" the captains of industry "". When compulsion is necessary to provide for a more adequate distribution of wealth by means of various forms of social services it should be applied. Unfortunately, the Government is seeking to alter wholly the basis upon which our social services are established. During the life of this Parliament the financial powers behind the Government and its supporters have been drawing almost unceasing attention to the rising costs of our social services. We are continually being reminded that our pensions bill is so much higher than it was ten years ago, and so much higher than it was fifteen years ago. We have also been informed that at the end of this financial year the amount involved will be approximately £15,000,000. For this reason it is said that the Government should take steps to relieve the budget of a portion of. this burden. We complain, however, that insufficient attention has been: given by the Government to the basic causes of this increase. The general economic conditions of tbe country are responsible. During the last six or seven years we have seen a gradual change in the outlook of our people-a change due to economic pressure which has made inevitable the rising cost of pensions in this country. Until about seven years ago the average son and daughter in this Mr Beasley. country looked upon it as a responsibility, if they were capable, to provide for their parents when age or invalidity overtook them. I think it quite true that that sentiment was deeply embedded in the home life of the Australian people. Prior to that time many aged or invalid parents did not apply for the pension because they were being maintained by their children. But a change has overtaken the community since 1930. Adult sons and daughters upon whom the responsibilities of life have fallen are now finding that they are unable to obtain employment to provide even for themselves, much less to provide for their unfortunate parents as they would wish to do. In many instances they are unable to provide adequately for their own families. This has meant that many old and invalid people have applied for the pension, who, under the circumstances of other days, would not have done so. It is this radical change that-has caused the substantial increase of our pensions bill. The Government, however, has not seen fit to attack the root causes of this trouble, and make such adjustments as would permit our people to continue to observe the habits and customs of the last generation. We must, therefore, study this bill in the light of those circumstances. It is alleged that the bill is designed to provide national health insurance. I have yet to be convinced that this end will be achieved by the workers attaching themselves to the panels of local medical practitioners. Neither the extensive propaganda of those interested in. the promotion of this scheme, nor the speeches delivered by Government supporters in the course of this debate, have awakened any conviction in my mind that the scheme of this bill is either national or really beneficial to the workers. If the Government is genuinely desirous of bringing about a condition of national health in the true sense of that term, it is necessary to go into the homes of the workers, and to study seriously the conditions under which a large section of the people live, particularly the circumstances under which many children are being reared to-day. During the life of the last Parliament the then Minister for Health( Mr Hughes) declared that no fewer than 40 per cent, of the children of Australia were suffering to some extent from malnutrition. A similar assertion appeared in a report submitted by the nutrition committee appointed by the present Government. stand, has not completed its inquiry, but has presented a supplementary report regarding conditions in country districts, particularly in New South Wales. Therefore, we should not allow ourselves to be carried into the clouds in discussing this bill. There is no justification for trying to make the public believe that, by tbe introduction of this scheme, national health will be secured to an extent never previously experienced. Beginning with attention to the conditions under which children are brought up, and going into many other aspects of our social life, vitally necessary reforms should first receive earnest consideration at the hands of the Government. I could speak at considerable length about the conditions that prevail in my own electorate. The housing conditions in a number of centres there are deplorable, and tend to undermine the health of the people. Children need more fresh air than they are able to obtain under average housing conditions in crowded industrial suburbs. Bearing in mind all these factors, the whole matter should be viewed from an angle entirely different from that from which this bill approaches it. What medical benefits are proposed to be provided under this measure? Insured persons will have the right to be attached to the panel of a local doctor, or some other medical practitioner whom they may care to choose from a list that will be supplied to them. Possibly the panels of some doctors will have large numbers of persons and, according to information I have received, the conditions that prevailed during the early stages of the operaindividuals, and the burden of both tion of the scheme in Great Britain, will be experienced in Australia. I am advised that the way in which patients were dealt with by the panel doctor was even more rapid than the manner in whicli traffic cases are heard in metropolitan courts. The patients merely walked into the surgery and walked out again, and behind the scenes, provision was made for different kinds of medicines to be handed out in accordance with the decision reached by the doctor as the patientspassed through the room. I understand that four large jars of different medicines were mixed ready for use behind the That committee, I undercurtains in the surgery, and as the panel doctor was forced to deal in a stereotyped way with the patients who were lined up in hundreds, they were simply labelled to receive medicine from either one of those jars. I received this information from Australian doctors who had visited Great Britain for hospital experience and had also done locum tenens work. It is true that that condition of affairs has been remedied to a degree, but the British scheme does not ensure anything approaching the medical attention obtained in Australia under the friendly societies system. Here the medical man sees that the patient is properly cared for, and tries to discover his real needs. It is not always necessary for a doctor to prescribe medicine, as the patient may need rest or a change, or merely advice. I am informed that only by direct and personal relations between the medical man and the patient can national health be secured. Under the proposal in this bill, those who contribute to the cost of the scheme will not receive anything like the proper medical attention they need, or indeed the treatment many of them already receive to-day. The frequency of resort to hospitals was mentioned by the Treasurer in his second-reading speech. This matter of hospital accommodation and treatment has become a serious matter in New South Wales. Earlier in the evening, by way of interjection, I referred to the national debt. If the national debt is increasing as the result of expenditure by the States, as the Treasurer stated, we should remember that .the people in the States and in the Commonwealth are the same State and Commonwealth expenditure falls on their shoulders. My answer to the Treasurer was that if the debt of the Commonwealth is declining and the State debts are increasing, the States are carrying responsibilities which the Commonwealth should be willing to share. If the debt is increasing the Commonwealth cannot evade its responsibility by casting all the blame on tbe States. The hospital question is one of the responsibilities of tbe States, and at the present time they are not providing hospital services to the extent that they are required. Almost every medical practitioner says that delay is experienced, particularly in country centres, in getting X-ray treatment. may elapse before such can be obtained. Tbe present centralized hospital services deprive medical practitioners country of reasonable access to the most modern equipment. Local medical practitioners would have a better opportunity than they have at the present time to prevent the spread of disease and to maintain healthy conditions among the workers, if such readily available in country areas and even in suburban are matters to which the Commonwealth Government should give serious attention, if it sincerely desires to bring about national health. These things are the very basis upon which national health depends. Unfortunately, our Health Department does little or nothing in this connection. When an effort is made to do something, in it is the responsibility of the States, not of the Commonwealth. not satisfied that the workers should be lined up for medical examination on conditions similar to those which have obtained in Great Britain. A worker who in the early stages of tuberculosis requires X-ray treatment and careful attention, will be sadly disillusioned if he thinks that under this scheme he w ill get the attention that he needs. I have bere a letter from the Trade Unions Congressi n Great Britain, which contains the following:Sir Walter recommends for Australia the children and when their children show same kind of medical benefit as we have here, symptoms of illness tbey call in a doctor. namely, a general practitioner service as set Even though no prescription may be reout in paragraph 34 of his report. Our criticism of that service is that it is not by quired, the presence of the doctor gives any means complete. The practitioner has no confidence and removes unnecessary fear. link with consultants or specialists of any Regarded fro m the point of view of its kind and the range of services that he can effect upon family life, this bill is ungive is strictly limited. This again is, in our opinion, a very serious drawback in the satisfactory. Tbe Treasurer said that medical benefit, and although a royal commisthe Government will not call upon single sion as far back as 1925 recommended the men to accept responsibilities that should provision of a consultant and specialist service it has not yet been done. Mr Beasley. I draw the attention of the workers of Australia to the fact that under this scheme they w ill not get anything like the service that they are now getting from the friendly societies. In cooperation w it h the medical fraternity, the friendly societies throughout the country have done a most valuable From three to nine months work. I want tbe workers to know that, treatment with this legislation on the statute-book, they will not get the service that they now enjoy, even though they make greater and patients in the contributions than they have ever made before. The letter from which I have quoted emphasizes the importance of consultation. In fairness to the practitioners themselves, I say that it will be physically impossible for them to do what this bill imposes. The workers must not be misled. We are told that if we equipment were hold up the passage of this measure, we shall regret our action and we shall deny districts. These to many in the community the advantages of this legislation, but I remain unimpressed ; I believe that the scheme will not do what is claimed for it. It w ill not give the service that is now provided. I am, therefore, forced to say that behind this scheme is not a desire to give medical benefits but an attemj>t to shift the this House we are told that responsibility for social services from the Government on to the shoulders of those I am who later in life may need them. This fundamental change of policy on these matters must be strenuously opposed by Labour. I wish now to refer to the importance of the home and the family. Anyone who inquires from medical men w ill be told that most of the medical benefits of the friendly societies are enjoyed by the wives and children of the workers rather than by the beads of families. Young mothers are naturally inexperienced in training fall upon married men. In effect, he says that the Government intends to *' walk out"" on married men and their wives and children. If this country is to justify, amongst many other things, its occupation of so large a territory, it dare not walk out on its married men. A government's first consideration should be towards those who establish homes in the community and rear families. Many families have experienced hard times during the last few years, as every honourable member knows. If the Government washes its hands of its responsibility in respect of married men and their wives and children it will be disregarding obligations that are vital to the national well-being. Honourable members have only to call to mind the recent outbreak of infantile paralysis severe in New Zealand, and in Victoria, although, fortunately, not so severe iri° New South Wales, to realize that we cannot even contemplate a denial of the community's responsibility in respect of these children and their mothers. single man should be called upon to do more than bis share, but we must bear in mind that the single man of to-day may be the married man of to-morrow. It is the duty of the Government to take care of the wives and children of the workers in the community. The Treasurer may say that this can be left to the friendly societies, but I point out that every shilling taken from the family income is a shilling less to spend on the necessaries of life. After all, not many workers really receive the basic wage all the year round. It must be remembered that the basic wage is not a wage which must be paid in all weathers, wet and dry, and when men are unemployed ; it is a wage which men get sometimes, and nowadays very rarely. It would be safe to say that many workers receive not more than half the basic wage throughout the year. Since January of this year, I have noticed that large numbers of men in New South Wales have been in search of employment because of the cessation of road construction, and other State activities. Every shilling taken from the meagre earnings of men on or below the basic wage deprives them, or their wives and children, of things that they badly need. To them Is. means as much as does £1, or even £10, to others iu the community. A worker has many calls upon his scanty purse-the wages tax, the insurance tax, and so on. Some of them have taken out life assurance policies; the Treasurer will not say that they should be surrendered, or that the workers had no right to incur such liabilities. These policies retain their value only by the payment regularly of tbe-premiums on them. tioned that 3,000,000 policies are in force. Many of those provide no security for the family at all; they are taken out merely to enable probate duty to be paid at death. which was particularly the family budget of the average working man, and consider what his commitments are, we should more readily appreciate the difficulty he experiences in paying his way. When in the past the workers claimed higher wages, the argument of the employers was that industry could not I do not ask that any bear the additional burden; that factories would be forced to close. The working man, however, cannot close his home when additional burdens are placed upon him. He cannot walk out and leave his wife and family. If he bo a man at all, he must stand up to his responsibilities, and when extra burdens are placed upon him he must reduce his expenditure in other directions. Every man must pay his insurance premiums, his lodge dues, and his trade union subscriptions. It is necessary that the working man should belong to an organization so that, by association with his fellows, he may be in a position to defend his rights, and this entails certain financial obligations which must be discharged. Eor that reason, we disagree with the Treasurer, who stated that if the working man wished to make provision for medical services for his wife and children, he should do so through a friendly society. We say that to do so would be to take upon himself a greater burden than he should be asked to carry. We believe that the efforts of this Parliament should be directed towards reducing the working man's burden, rather than towards increasing it.

They should, realize that if they patient 10 or 15 miles away. He must are justified in rebuking the Leader of the Opposition on this score, they should also rebuke those numerous organizations throughout the country which have expressed disapproval of the measure for one reason or another. I refer particularly to the medical profession, hospital boards, ambulance associations, and friendly societies. At an earlier stage, I sought information from the Government regarding the regulations which would be made under this measure. almost as important that honourable members should be acquainted with these regulations as that they should have the bill before them. In fact, they should be supplied with a copy of the regulations at the same time as they are given a copy of the bill. According to the Prime Minister, certain and part-time workers. They will also arrangements were entered into between the Government and the council of the British Medical Association. It is fairly clear that whatever those arrangements might have been, no consulation took place between the council and the rank and file of the medical profession. I am ""open to correction, but it is my opinion that the advice tendered to the Government was given by the specialist section of the medical profession, and in no way represented the opinion of the ordinary practitioners, parand paragraphs which require a great ticularly those in the country. arrangement come to might suit the city specialists well enough, but it is evident that it is not satisfactory to the men who will have to do the actual work, and who will get very little for it. I am pleased that these men are standing up for their rights. with the Federal Council of the British Mr Beasley Medical Association, and one cannot get a more representative body than that. this instance, the council did not represent the opinion of the majority of members of the association. The Government Honourable members received certain advice from experts brought from England, but conditions here are very different from those overseas. I can understand the resentment with which the country doctors received the Government's proposals. A country doctor may be called upon to visit a make an immediate diagnosis, and accept responsibility for his decision. He cannot arrange for a consultation, nor can he send the patient for an X-ray. He must make tbe decision himself, and he is entitled to be adequately paid for the responsibility he has to bear. 1 am informed that, in the northern coalfields districts, the workers, while insisting upon good conditions for themselves, insist also upon good conditions for the It is medical men who look after them. I trust that when the bill is in the committee stage the Treasurer will be able to give us full information upon the various points that will be raised. Honourable members will want to know what is being done in respect of casual seek information regarding tbe position of workers already subscribing to superannuation funds, such as those in the railways and tramways services. I understand that employees who contribute to funds guaranteed by State or Federal Governments will be exempt from contributions, but what of those who contribute to municipal and private superannuation funds which are not guaranteed ? Many of tbe clauses iu the bill have a whole series of sub-clauses The deal of explanation. Some of them appear, to the layman, to be actually contradictory. The Treasurer, when speaking to the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, said that this scheme was the first in which provision was made for the payment of pensions to widows, and the first which provided for payments in respect of children. I remind him that widows'",53,Frederick Stew Abt Wh Y Not Medical Benefit Committee A Medical

182,Mr Beasley,"It is obvious that, inpensions have been paid in New South Wales for a number of years past. scheme ? scheme also provides for allowances to children, and Mr Lang introduced that also. These benefits have been enjoyed by the workers of New South Wales for many years; the recipients have not been called upon to make any contributions, and no conditions have been them. These payments become the right of persons eligible to receive them. I therefore repeat that the principle referred to by the Treasurer was established the previous insurance bill in 1928, the by a New South Wales Labour government in connection with its measures for social reforms, the purpose being to place is in the vicinity of £16,000,000. The greater purchasing power in the hands of a larger number of persons, and to cause the State as a whole to share the burdens find that, starting in 1909-10, there were and assist those whose position in life has been prejudiced by circumstances over which they had no control. Judging by the expressions of opinion ""which we have heard in this debate, I confidently believe that the wrong being done by this the payment per breadwinner was 18s. Government in the bill will in due time be removed by a future Labour government, which will put this legislation back on a basis which the people of Australia have supported for so many years and, I believe, wish to be maintained. proposal for the inauguration of a national health and insurance scheme has been on the programme of various political parties for many years. It was first spoken of in 1925 when the International Labour Conference at Geneva made a declaration that the only satisfactory scheme would be one that was contributory in character. Following the conference, Dr Earle Page, who was Treasurer in the Bruce-Page Government, framed the National Insurance Bill and moved its second-reading in this House in J928. Tho cost of that scheme was so staggering, the swing of the political pendulum was so sudden, and the depression so oppressive, that the measure was laid aside for the time being. The project of breadwinners to pensioners will be only has been remodelled and brought up to date by this Government and it is now before this House for consideration. The working man who is married and has a family and the young unmarried man who may be contemplating matrimony frequently ask themselves what would happen if they weTe to become ill or die. This bill will remove that worrying uncertainty from nearly 2,000,000 people in Australia. The increased cost of pensions is threatening national solvency. Since 1909-10 when the pensions scheme was laid down in respect of inaugurated, the number of pensioners has increased by 500 per cent, and the amount of pensions payable, by over 1,000 per cent. When Dr. Earle Page introduced pensions bill of the Commonwealth amounted to £8,250,000. This year it time has come to call a halt. If we examine these figures further, we shall 65,492 pensioners who received pensions amounting to £1,497,330. The breadwinners in the community at that time totalled 1,652,280, or approximately 25 breadwinners to every pensioner, and lOd. a year. In 1926-27 the number of pensioners had risen to 175,721 and the total pension payments to £8,252,387. The number of breadwinners was 1,945,000 and the ratio of breadwinners to pensions was eleven to one; the average payments per breadwinner bad increased to £4 5s. 5d. In this financial year, as the Treasurer has informed us, there are 311,000 pensioners, ancl the total payment is likely to be £15,850,000. The breadwinners in the community number 2,270,000, ancl the ratio of breadwinners to pensioners is ment per breadwinner will be £6 19s. 7d. The Treasurer estimates that by 1978. assuming that tbe present rate of increase is maintained, the number of pensioners will be 625,000 and the total pensions bill approximately £32,000,000. By that year breadwinners will number approximately 2,370,370, ancl the payments on account of pensions per head of breadwinners will be £13 10s., whilst the ratio four to one.

185,Mr Nock (Riverina) [10.2],"This1978, under the existing system, a much larger proportion of the national income will be necessary to provide the amount required for pensions. It has been estimated that it would take, on an average, 5s. a week from every breadwinner's wages to pay for pensions, aud there would be but two workers in the community for every person who had reached the age at which pensions were payable. National health is a national asset. The scheme contained in this bill will not only stabilize the pensions position, but it will also remove the hideous nightmare of fear from 1,S50,000 people who will be protected by the Government's proposal. It has often been said that hunianitarianism is the yard-stick of civilization and that democracy has decreed that all the good things of life are not meant for the wealthy favoured few. The policy of governments from time to time has been to take an increasing proportion by taxation from the wealthy persons in the community and distribute it in various social services. introduction of free education, pensions, hospitals, and other social services, the cost of which is nearly £50,000,000 a year or £7 a head of the population. In New South Wales, as the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) said to-night, there are additional social services such as widows' pensions and child endowment. The honourable member wa3 in error, however, when he said that these benefits were available without conditions. There is the means test based on much the same principle as the means test in connection with our invalid and old-age pensions payments. This bill provides an insurance policy by means of which the workers will be obliged to observe compulsory thrift to ensure a measure of medical attention, medicine, sick pay, widows' benefits and an old-age annuity. Since the cost of all social services comes out of production, we have to acknowledge that there is a limit to which governments may go in taxation. If , by its proposals, the Government takes from those who produce the wealth of this country an excessive share of their production, we shall eventually reach that stage when the law of diminishing returns will become operative. If the incentive to proifr. Nock. duce is taken away from the people who create wealth, and the production of wealth declines, the living standards of our people must decline to a corresponding degree. It is established that excessive taxation weakens the incentive to produce. 'Hence, we find that in this scheme the Government has had regard to the advice from Geneva, and has evolved a scheme embodying the principle of compulsory thrift, in addition to medical and sickness benefits. As regards the conditions, I think the proposal is a particularly good bargain for those who will come under tbe scheme. No insurance company and no friendly society could give anything like the same benefits for the same contributions. Actuarial calculations have been made on the basis of a sixteen-year-old life, but even on that basis only about one-third is directly paid by the insured, while on a 32-year basis, tbe average age at the commencement of the scheme, and with selected lives, the Thus we had the contribution for health benefits alone would be, in the case of a male contributor, Is. 3d., for pensions 5s. 9d., or a total of 7s. compared with the contribution of 3s. provided for in the bill. For females, the contributions on an actuarial basis would be Is. 2d. a week for health benefits, 4s. Id. a week for pension benefits, making a total of 5s. 3d. compared with 2s. in the bill. These figures, however, are not nearly so impressive as typical illustrations. For example, the man, at the average of 32 years, with two children, after paying for 26 weeks a total of 39s. is eligible, in addition to medical treatment for 26 weeks, for sick pay £26, and £9 2s. for the children, while the payments would continue at 22s. a week for the duration of the sickness. In the event of his death 19s. 6d. a week or £50 14s. a year would be paid to his wife and children as long as widowhood and dependency continued. Should he, as is likely on the law of averages, live to 70 years, his five years' annuity would be £100 more than his total contributions, with all his medical and sickness benefits thrown in. It is natural that the employer and the taxpayer should complain about the cost of these social services; but I fail to understand why complaint should come from those who arc likely to receive benewould be ill and would claim sick pay, fits under the scheme. Some criticism has been directed to those provisions relating to the position of insured females and unfair discrimination. I think the Treasurer put the position very fairly and clearly this afternoon, when he compared the relative benefits of male and female contributors. honourable members, let me cite figures relating to two specific cases, and direct secure them, would be: first five years, up their attention to the generous advantages to both, particularly to the insured female. We are told by insurance companies that with the average age of insured persons at the commencement of the scheme at 32 years, the expectancy of life will be 70 years for tbe man, and 73 years for the female. It is common knowledge that women require, or at any rate demand, more medical attention than men do; but let us disregard this and consider the position on the flat rate basis. In the 41 years from the age of 32 years to 73 years the average the community have no grounds whatever female would be entitled to 41 years medifor complaint in regard to discrimination cal and dispensary service, costing 15s. a year, or a total of £30 15s. obtained from British insurance authorities show that we can calculate that the average number of weeks during which a woman would be ill and claim sick pay until she reached the age of 60 years would be 56 weeks at 15s. a week, or £42. Her annuity between the ages of 60 and 73 years, at 15s. a week, would total £507. could possibly be secured from any Thus, the average service and payments to the women of average age entering the scheme at its inception would be £57S> 15s. Her contributions, in order to secure those benefits would be: five years, but 52 per cent, that of the male section, up to the age of 44 years at Is. a week, £13; 23 years between that age and the age of 60 years, at Is, 3d. a week, £74 15s.; a total of £87 15s. for a benefit more commensurate with their capacity of £579 15s. Will anybody dare to say that that is not a particularly generous scheme for the females who are provided for? It amounts to £6 12s. for every contributions and benefits. tribution of £1. Now take the case of a man of the same age. With an expectancy of life of 70 years, the 32-year-old male will receive medical and dispensary service for 38 years, which, at a cost of 15s. a year, would be worth £28 103. The average number of weeks during which he according to British experience, would be 3S. At £1 a week, he would receive £38, together with children's allowance for 38 there is a suggestion of weeks. Under this heading, a man with one child would receive £6 13s. His old age assurance from 65 to 70 years would be £260. These three services and benefits, to a man of 32 years of age entering the For the information of scheme at its inception, would total £333 3s. His contributions, in order to to 1944, at Is. 6d. a week, £19 103.; five years till 1944, at Is. 9d. a week, £22 15s.; 28 years up to the age of 65 years, at 2s. a week, £119 12s., a total of £161 17s. for a benefit of £333 3s. If we compare that with the women's privileges, we find that a man would receive £2 Is. for every contribution of £1-wit h an alternative provision, if necessary, should his wife become a widow-whil e his wife would receive £6 13s. for each £1 she pays in or a total of £579 15s. for her contribution of £87 15s. I maintain that the ladies of being practised against them. Bather is Figures the boot on the other foot. The Government is being particularly generous in providing an alternative voluntary scheme to enable them to contribute an extra 6d. a week, if they so desire, so that in their old age they may receive £1, instead of 15s. a week, as an annuity. These benefits are far ahead of what insurance company in the land. We have also to take into consideration the income of the insured person. As the income of the female section of the community is the Government is quite justified in making the provision that women shall be able to enter the scheme at a rate which _ is to pay out of the wage that they receive, instead of endeavouring to put them on tbe same basis as men in regard to conwages ? national insurance scheme, not with the wages of any section of the community.

188,Mr Casey,"In my second-readingprovision as will ensure that justice is done to those who are excluded by this proposal. against the proposal. The honourable member himself voted against it. MrN OCK -There is a certain way in which a thing should be done. Whether it be by exempting an employer whose income is below a certain amount, or by placing those sections of rural industry which are on export parity and have no home price for their product on the same basis as secondary industries, and other primary industries which enjoy the advantage of a home consumption price, the obligation rests on the Government to see that injustice is not done. The big employer, whether in factory, transport, large warehouse, or any other organized industry, will add his contribution to his overhead costs, as is now done with the sales tax, Avorkmen's compensation, and other outgoings. If a factory is worksider the income tax returns of these ing on a five per cent, margin of profit, the employer will pass on this additional burden. He will not be at a disadvantage, because his competitor also will have to pass it on. But the trouble is, that certain sections of the community will not be able to pass it on, and that is where injustice will be done. Tbe butter industry has an organization-it may be hanging by weak threads-whic h enables it to fix a home consumption price for its product. There is a home consumption price also for rice, sugar, dried fruits, and the secondary industries of this country. But the meat, wool, and wheat industries have not a home consumption price. Their returns are determined by export parity. As tbe honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) pointed out in this House last week, those producers receive less than export parity; they gerj world price less the cost of transport and marketing. Such producers are making a contribution to the consumers of this country. The report presented to this Parliament two or three years ago by the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry stated very definitely that there was no reason whatever why the wheat producers should not have a home consumption price for their products, in common with other primary producers. This is one method by which, I submit, the Government is obliged to protect those of the community who will be penalized by being compelled to pay House voted their employees' contributions to this scheme, but cannot pass them on by raising the price of their products. The following figures relate to classes of the community which will not be covered by this bill, but will be penalized by it : Employer fruit-growers .. 8,343 Employer dairymen .. .. 20,369 Pastoralists, dairymen . . 10,255 Employer wheat growers and mixed farmers .. .. 53,09<J Kice-growers .. .. .. 202 Poultry, tobacco and potato growers and others .. 19,464 Sugar producers .. 5,031 Total 110,450 Some thousands of these people would be unable to pass on the cost to them of this scheme. I now ask honourable gentlemen to conproducers. They will then realize how inequitable it would be to compel them to pay the contribution at present set clown as their proportion. Of these 110,450 people only 10,273 paid income tax in 1933-34. In other words, 90 per cent, of them had an income which fell below the range of federal income taxation. In spite of this injustice it would be adopting a dog in the manger attitude to vote against the bill, for its provisions would benefit nearly 2,000,000 people. whom the honourable member mentionett are an important section. gation rests upon the Government to deal justly with them. able member do so? allow me to discuss that subject. -Mi-.

Mr ""WARD asked the P r i m e M in is t e r , u p o n notice1. What arc the powers of the Commonwealth Government with respect to giving effect to international conventions. becoming operative, must they first be ratified by Parliament or can they be given effect to by regulation? 2. Does the Government intend to give Parliament an early opportunity of considering an international convention on broadcasting with respect to the censoring of broadcast talks on foreign affairs, which was adopted at Geneva in 1936? 3. Upon whose advice did the Government act in giving effect to the terms of this Convention, which constitutes an infringement of the inherent rights of every Australian citizen to freely express his, or her, opinions, without the people's representatives in Parliament being consulted? 4. What nations have adopted this Convention and what nations have been invited to do so .and have cither declined or failed to take any action. 6. What are the international conventions, adopted by conferences with which Australia was associated, which have (a) been applied by the Commonwealth Government by regulation, (ft) been ratified by the Commonwealth Parliament, and (c) been shelved because the Government failed to take the appropriate action to apply them? able member's questions are as f o l l o w s : 1. The first part of this question involves the interpretation of the Constitution, and it is not the practice to express legal opinions in answer to questions. part of this question, parliamentary approval is not always obtained prior to ratification of international conventions. approval may be sought in special circumstances. Where, however, changes in existing Commonwealth acts are required in order to give effect to the provisions of such conventions, the Commonwealth Parliament determines whether or not the necessary legislative action shall be taken. In the case of certain International Labour Ofiice Conventions, where the subject matter is the concern of the States, it is tbe practice of the Commonwealth Government not to r a t if y such conventions until their provisions are covered by State legislation or the Status have expressly agreed to introduce the necessary legislation. It is the practice to lay all conventions on the table of the House after ratification or accession. 2. The terms of the Convention were brought to the notice of Parliament on the 2.7th information is August, 1937. when copies of the Convention were laid on the table of the House. Its provisions arc designed to promote international friendship and understanding. These are the declared objectives of the CommonOF INTERNATIONAL wealth Government, and it is not considered that any good purpose would be served by a general discussion of the Convention at the present time. 3. The Postmaster-General's Department and tbe Department of External Affairs. 4. The Convention was signed by the repreBefore sentatives of 28 countries, including Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Spain, France, Greece, India, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Roumania, Soviet Union, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. So far the following countries have ratified or acceded to the Convention:-Australia , Brazil, Denmark, France, India, Luxemburg, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom. The Commonwealth Government is not aware that any country has declined to ratify or to accede to the Convention. 0. (a) Australia is a party to more than 300 treaties, conventions and other international agreements, including League of Nations, International Labour Offico, Extradition, Legal Proceedings, and Postal Conventions affecting nil Commonwealth departments. It is not practicable to answer which conventions have been applied by the Commonwealth Government by regulation as the provisions of an international agreement may be covered in Australia by existing legislation, or may be given effect to by regulations made under existing legislation, e.g., International Labour Office Maritime Conventions, or, in some cases, by administrative act, e.g., Drug Conventions. (6) No international conventions are "" r a t i fied"" by Parliament, although,.in special circumstances, parliamentary approval may be obtained prior to ratification by the CommonT h e answers to the honorwealth Government, (c) None. As to the second Defence, upon noticeW i ll he give, an undertaking that when the Defence Estimates for 1938-39 are being although such prepared, favorable consideration will be given to making an increase in the grant for rifle clubs so that additional clubs may be formed, and new members may be enrolled in districts where young men are prepared to give this form of voluntary national service?",61,Assistance For Primary Industries

Arc the fumes of petrol aud crude oil as emitted from n motor car or motor 'bus engine harmful to health? 2. If so, which of tlic two is the more harmful ? to the honourable members questions are as follows:1. Fumes of oil vapourized by heat from tiie outside of a motor car or motor 'bus engine arc unpleasant, but real danger to health is present in the fumes from the exhaust pipe of such motors. Gases responsible for this danger arc petrol vnpour and benzol vapour, where these substances arc used as fuels, but the greatest danger is due to the odourleRR invisible gas, carbon monoxide, which comprises from .2 per cent, to 15 per cent, of the exhaust gases. The proportion of carbon monoxide is increased when the motor is stationary, or when the air intake is insufficient (that is when the choke is used). The greatest danger from these exhaust gases has been shown to be in closed garages where a stationary engine iB running, and occasionally also in closed motor cars where there is a leakage into the car from the exhaust pipe, and there is otherwise poor ventilation. 12. The exhaust gas from a motor car or motor 'bus engine utilizing petrol is more harmful than that from an engine utilizing heavy oil, as the carbon monoxide content of the exhaust fumes is greater, and in addition unexpended petrol vapours are present. the Interior, upon noticeCan anything be done to prevent the exhaust fumes from the engines of the department's motor 'buses entering the passenger accommodation to the discomfort of the passengers and detriment to their health? honourable member's question is as follows:All 'buses have been checked for exhaust leaks between the engines and the terminal points of the exhaust pipes and have been found to be without fault. Large exhaust pipes are fitted to all the 'buse6 to allow the exhaust gas free escape, but all 'buses will have traces of exhaust Rmell when travelling in a following wind or when passing each othor. It is considered that the departmental answer to the 'buses in Canberra are less subject to exhaust member's question is as gas fumes than 'buses in most other centres. This matter is being closely watched by the transport officer. honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) asked the following questions, upon notice1. In view of the close proximity of the date when the first aeroplanes manufactured by the Commonwealth Aircraft Manufacturing Company must be tested, will he co-operate with the Victorian authorities to have the overhead electric current wires put underground, so that the flying tests can be made? 2. Js it a fact that the cost of the removal is estimated at about f15,000! I am now in a position to inform the lionorable member as follows:1. Tbe Commonwealth has no responsibility for the area and transmission lines, which are the property of the Victorian Government. As a satisfactory testing ground is an essential complement to the factory, the Commonwealth is taking early steps to seek a solution of this matter. 2. The Commonwealth has no official estimate as to the cost of removal of the transmission lines. honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) asked the following question. without noticeIn connection with naval recruiting, will tlie Minister for Defence consider the desirability of accepting .those older lads, who, as a result of the depression, are still unable to obtain employment in preference to engaging younger lads, as at present? I am now in a position to inform the. honourable member as follows:The normal maximum ages for entry ot recruits to the navy have already been increased: for example, ordinary seamen from IS to 204 years, with 21 for specially desirable candidates; and 18 to 21 for stokers, witli answer to . the 23 fur specially desirable candidates. Artisans are entered up to 25, and specially desirable artisans up to 28. fn view of the special conditions which prevail in the depressed mining centres of the Newcastle district, the Minister has directed that special consideration shall be given by the Naval Board to applications for enlistment from these areas. Arrangements have accordingly been made for the policy of preference to younger lads, that is, those under eighteen, to be applied with some latitude in regard to applicants from these areas.",62,Rifle Clubs
