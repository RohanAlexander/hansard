0,,"I have received from the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) au intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, ""the present serious position of those engaged in the dried f r u it s industry, and the attitude of the Government in relation thereto."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. -Last year the position of the dried f r u it industry was brought prominently before this Parliament. Owing to causes beyond the control of the growers, namely, the sudden increase in the export proportion of the f r u it produced, caused largely by the repatriation policy of State Governments, and the adverse drying season which coincided with low prices in the London market due to the competition of Greek and Turkish fruits, the industry was in a precarious position. As a result of inquiries made by the Ministry this Parliament passed two relief measures-the DriedF r u it Advances Act, ancl the Dried Fruits Export Control Act. The act relating to advances certainly saved the industry for the time being, for I doubt whether the majority of the growers would have been able to carry on without the assistance it gave. Unfortunately, t.he advances only applied to the 1924 crop, and the operation of the act ceased on the 31st December. The growers were then forced to approach packing houses and firms engaged in the selling of dried fruits in order to obtain assistance to pick and pack their products and get them ready for the market. There is also an Export Guarantee Act, wbich provides for advances to a maximum of SO per cent, of thc value of primary produce. advance has been of very little use to the growers, because the money is not made available until the f r u it is boxed and the shipping documents are completed. The position to-day is that those engaged in the industry are in a very serious financial position. On Friday last I introduced to the Prime Minister a deputation of returned soldiers engaged in the industry. It was an interstate deputation representing soldier settlers of Victralia. Unfortunately, the South Australian delegate was unable to be present. The deputation placed before the Prime Minister the serious position of the industry, and made certain requests, one of which was that the Government should guarantee the industry a bounty sufficient to pay the difference between the cost of the production of export f r u it and the price received. The reason that the growers did not arbitrarily ask for a £ 5 or £10 bounty Was because they did not desire the Government to give a bounty of, say, £ 1 0 a ton, if they were receiving £ 5 a ton over and above the cost of production. The Prime Ministeri n his reply definitely refused to entertain the proposal, giving certain reasons for his action, one of which was that it was impossible to fairly assess the basis upon which the cost of production should be ascertained. In other words, the difficulty to fix what would be a fair cost of production seemed to be insuperable. As the Ministry had already refused to adopt this course for the dairying and other primary industries, it could not logically, and would not, do so for the dried-fruit industry. He also stated, if my recollection is correct, that the Ministry was so determined in its attitude, that if this course was the only way to save the industry, he feared that it must languish. I shall state exactly in my reply what I did say. to endeavour to convey a wrong impression, or to misrepresent the right honourable gentleman, but I am giving what I considered the impression conveyed to me. and which certainly seemed to be conveyed to thfi deputation itself. I find in this morning's Argus the following paragraph : Unfortunately, that District growers are concerned regarding tlie reply by Mr Bruce to tbe deputation. Tliey do not believe that Mr Bruce has bad a favorable report concerning the industry from the Federal Dried Fruit Export Control Board. Certainly prices for sultanas overseas le:ive a slight margin of profit, but there is a loss on lexias, and a heavy loss on currants.

4,Mr Stewart,"J . should be the lasta most uncomfortable position financially, and the situation will be even more intense if the repayment of advances is insisted upon. These advances were made under the Dried Fruits Advances Act passed by this House last year. They total in all, £202,000, according to a return which was furnished to me yesterday in reply to a question. MrM . CAMEBON -Thos e are advances to individual growers ? subject to repayment. Section 10 of the act, which specifically relates to repayments, reads(1) Tlie grower shall repay the advance, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum; (2) The repayment of tlie advance and the payment of interest thereon shall be a charge on the proceeds of the sale of the dried fruits produced by the grower in the year One thousand nine hundred and twenty-five, after the costs of production and marketing (not exceeding such amount, as the Minister determines) of those dried fruits have heen provided for. The Prime Minister objected to the policy of endeavouring to ascertain the cost of production, but section 10 of the act itself, relating to repayments, refers to the cost of production, and provides that it shall be assessed .by the Minister. The growers, in effect, ask that the cost of production shall be ascertained by an impartial tribunal. body would be much more accurate than an arbitrary assessment by the Minister. The Prime Minister told the deputation that, as far as the repayment of advances made last year was concerned, it was proposed, according to the Governor General's Speech, not to insist upon them being repaid this year, but that they should be repaid half in 1926 and half in 1927. The Ministry seems to consider that this method of repayment will improve the financial difficulties of the growers, but I contend that it will do nothing of the kind. cial position of the grower is due to ihe fact that, although the 1925 crop was produced with the assistance of the Government, only a very small proportion of it has been sold, ancl the proceeds are not yet available. The growers have now to produce the 1926 crop. last year's advance is to be repaid out of the 1926 crop, it is already mortgaged to that extent. The banks and the ordinary financial institutions that usually make advances to the growers regard that [79] repayment obligation as a mortgage, and have closed right down on the industry. The growers of that portion of the 1925 crop which is still unsold w ill have to find means to produce the 1926 crop, and many of them cannot do it . Sub-section 2 of section 10 of the act actually says that the advance shall be repayable only after the cost of production and marketing of dried fruits have been provided for. Some of the figures which the Prime Minister quoted when refusing the request of the deputation were supplied by the Export Control Board, upon which, as the Prime Minister reminded the deputation, the growers have a majority of representation. It will place the representatives of the growers on the board in a very awkward position if they are to be made sponsors for a statement or figures from which ifc appears that the industry is prosperous and does not need assistance. which the Export Control Board is responsible is the price that is being realized for this season's crop. The rest of the figures were supplied by the departments. I want that to be clearly understood. that explanation, because otherwise the representatives' of the growers upon A decision by such a the board would be in an invidious position. The board has done excellent work. It has improved the packing conditions. The marketing abroad has been controlled, and there is not that senseless competition that formerly existed between firms and others in selling Australian dried fruits overseas. Undoubtedly the position has improved immeasurably as a result of the operations of the board. I do not for one moment wish to belittle anything that the Government has done. I am sure that the position will improve, and I am more confident than ever before The present finanthat this industry can be successfully carried on in the future. serious position? morning to go into that question.

The difficulty is with the export f r u it . imposed upon the growers by legislative action provide that they shall pay the ruling Australian wage for the production, not only of the 20 per cent, of fruit ' for local consumption, but also of the 80 per cent, exported. I do not wish for one moment to unduly stress the wages received by the working men in this industry, because I am well aware that the Customs taxation forces up the cost of living. I am sure that honourable members desire to be fair to this and other industries. to them that our laws provide that the growers shall pay to the employees in this industry a wage of £ 4 8s. a week for ploughing, pruning or picking, no matter whether the f r u it is for local consumption or export. The working hours are limited to eight a day. growers in an impossible position. The Prime Minister himself, in a speech delivered at the Stydney Showi n A p r i l , 1923, made some observations which go to the root of the problem. He saidTlie objective of the Government is the securing of markets for our primary and secondary productions. It is obviously inequitable, if the basis of our whole policy is to assist our producers to the markets they require, that we should render that help to those who can find what they want in the home markets, but s'hould do nothing to assist those who have to find their outlet overseas, and who are unquestionably handicapped in doing so by the assistance we are giving to their more fortunate fellow-producers. Surely it is equitable that to these industries which are benefiting the nation by increasing our national wealth by tlie export of their from all the various organizations and associasurplus production, a measure of assistance tions in the Mildura, Merhein, and Red Cliffs should be given equivalent to that which is districts, and therefore directly representing rendered to those who are supplying the reapproximately two-thirds of the dried fruit quirements of the home market. The Government, after thefullest consideraattention of the Federal and State Governtion of the. whole question, has come to the ments to the serious condition of those engaged conclusion that action in this direction should in the industry, and requests the immediate be taken. The Tariff Board recently made inquiry investigate into the price of farm implements, and reported that the Home market was generally the producers' main market, for certain products. 'three-wool, perhaps, wheat. But there was no "" perhaps "" about woo] and dried fruits. Now, the wool-growers are able to compete in the markets of the world, and therefore, on the authority of the Tariff there is but one industry that stands out as an Australian industry coming within Mr Stewart. the category mentioned by the Prime The conditions Minister. It is argued on behalf of the Government that it has already assisted this industry, but I point out that it has given no direct financial assistance other than in a form which makes it mandatory that the money advanced shall be repaid. The whole of the expenses of the Export Control Board are met by a levy upon the industry itself, and the irony of it is that'the chief competitor of an industry in which many of our returned soldiers are engaged is their late enemy, the Turk. In addition to the reButI would point out presentations made on behalf of the industry throughthe Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, a request that the Government appoint a tribunal to conduct an inquiry into the position of the industry, was made as a result of the resolutions of a conference of f r u it This places the growers' representatives held at Mildura. on the 2nd June last. The growers do not come as mendicants to the Government. They do not want anything \ in fair, but they ask that an impartial tribunal be appointed to inquire into certain matters which I shall enumerate. The request was presented by me to the Prime Minister, and on the 15th JuneI received an acknowledgment of its receipt, but the Government did not reply to it u n t il the other day. The motive that prompted the growers in making it is in keeping with the Prime Minister's insistence on the efficiency of an industry before it will be helped. The resolutions of the conference were as follow:That this conference, composed of delegates produced within the Commonwealth, calls the appointment of an impartial tribunal to fully the condition of the industry, as it is affected by the following points:{a) Can the cost of production on the block be reduced? If so, in what except way? The board named (6) Can the methods of processing and dried fruits, and it said, packing for market be improved, and the cost reduced? (c) Can (present transport charges, both local and overseas, he reduced? (d) Are the present methods of marketing and selling efficient? Board, {e) Is the present system of water supply for irrigation efficient and economical, and can improvements be effected? (/) I i i what way can the present unsatisfactory system of financing the industry, and of making advances and payments to growers, be improved? (<J) Are there any other directions in which greater efficiency can be secured in the industry, and costs of production decreased? That in view of the low prices ruling for lexias, walthams, currants, aud doradillos, the Federal Government is asked for a subsidy, on tlie lines indicated by Mr Bruce in his speech at the Royal Show luncheon in Sydney last year, such subsidy to be at least sufficient to bring returns to growers up to the cost of production. That in view of the urgent need of assistance to enable growers to carry on with the pruning and cultivation of their blocks for next season's crop, the Federal Government is asked to provide an immediate advance to the extent of £10 per acre on all sultanas, currants, lexias, walthams, and doradillos. K. A. GOODLAND, Secretary Representatives. The fruit-growers ask the Government to run a rule over them as individuals, and see if they are doing their work properly. Surely that is an obviously fair proposal. In summarizing the matter, I may say that the fruit-growers lay down the principle enunciated b'y the Prime Minister that, if they are to observe Australian rates of wages and conditions in producing dried fruit s for export, they should have the same guarantee as is given to the workers employed in the secondary industries-the guarantee of a living wage. If we lay down the principle that the employees in secondary industries, and also in thedried fruits industry, are entitled to a reasonable wage, surely it is equitable that the men behind the plough shall receive similar treatment. The Prime Minister admits, and has insisted, that we cannot he!"" one industry and logically deny assistance to others. A t the present time the freight to Great Britain on dried fruit s is £A 7s. 6d. a ton, although the vessels on which this commodity is conveyed to the Home markets carry cargoes of flour side by side with dried fruits, which occupy no more space than flour, for from 25s. to 30s. a ton. Government gave the growers a bounty or subsidy to assist them' to compete with their products in the markets of the world. Another point that the fruit-growers stress is that, even on the admission of the Prime Minister himself, the currant crop is unprofitable. Is .it unreasonable, therefore, to ask for a bounty on currants and lexias? These, in short, are the requests that the industry makes; and, as one who represents a considerable number of the growers, and who realizes that what they ask is reasonable and just, I have placed their views before the House. The"" Prime Minister, having regard to the speech he made in Sydney in 1923, when I was a 'member of the Government, cannot let this industry go to the wall. It is idle for him to talk about what the Control Board has done, and the improved price obtained for sultanas. It is useless for him to refer to this blessing and that blessing that the Government has showered upon the industry. The fact is that to-day the growers cannot carry on. The financial institutions have dropped them. Thev must observe Australian wages and conditions, and they must conto Conference of Growers' tinue to produce dried fruits.

Customs revenue is derived from the excise duties on distilled spirits, and some of the officials of the department have a good knowledge of the position in the industry.

15,Mr Bruce (Flinders,Prime Minis,18,Dried Fruits Industry Formal Motion Fob Adjournment
16,Mr Stewart,And any deductions,18,Dried Fruits Industry Formal Motion Fob Adjournment
17,Mr Bruce,"Quite. The board is inremedy that I addressed myself. I still take the view that to guarantee the cost of production will not be a remedy if the object is the permanent establishment of this industry as one of the great industries of Australia. First., a calculation would have to be made to determine the cost of production, and the produce would have to be taken over by the Government and realized. If in the first year there was a loss, as against the cost of production, it would have to be met by the Government; and, if, in the following year, there was a profit, the indebtedness to the Government would have to be repaid. Thus those engaged in the industry would receive a fairly uniform return, amounting to the cost of production, and a margin over. Apart from the difficulty of ascertaining the cost of production, to apply that remedy would be opposed to the principles of the majority of the people of Australia, who do not believe in having everything stereotyped and uniform'. The adoption of that policy .would eliminate the chief incentive to advancement. To reduce the rewards of the industry to a dead-level would strike at the root of all those things that have made for the development of this country in the past, and will, I am certain, make for its development in the future. In saying that, I do not lose sight of the point of view of the man in the industry, who feels the heavy burden on his shoulders. I have, on several occasions, spoken of the difficulties of those engaged in the industry. The man who sees diflSculties all-round him, and is struggling for an existence, naturally flies to the most obvious remedy that suggests itself to him; but the remedy that was proposed to me would not, in the end, be in the best interests, either of the producers or of Australia. A duty rests upon the Government not to attempt to gain momentary popularity by subscribing to every idea put forward. It should, instead, try to assist people along the lines that will benefit them most. I do not purpose to repeat the arguments I have used relating to the proposal to guarantee the cost of production. I see insurmountable difficulties in applying the principle, even if one could subscribe to it. There is, first, the difficulty of determining the one can now deny that that action tided cost of production. Should it be on the basis of the most efficient, the medium, or the least efficient production? Not one of those three would suit every one, or would be a complete solution of the problem. If the guarantee is given on the basis of the most efficient production, it will not remove the difficulties of many of the producers. On the other hand, if it is on the basis of the least efficient production, it will not be just or equitable to the consuming public of this country. I have made it clear on many occasions that I cannot accept this principle, and that I see'insuperable difficulties in the way of putting it into practice. In this industry, however, the proposal forguaranteeing the cost of production .can. be put aside as unnecessary, for 1 do not believe that the remedy is to be found in-that way. I hold that the difficulties of this industry can be solved, and I do not share the pessimistic view that it must inevitably go out of existence; or that, unless the Government guarantees the cost of production, the producer will never be able to recoup himself in thc oversea markets. The producer can recoup himself, and we are moving rapidly to the time when he will do so. The question was first considered by the Go-' vernment about fifteen months ago, and since then has been a burning and difficult one. It was then proposed, the industry being in difficulties, that the Government should pay a bounty not exceeding £10 per ton. I refused to accept that suggestion, because I said it would not solve the problem, and some honourable members may remember that for saying so I was very much criti-' cized by those interested in the industry. But no one who reviews the events of the past fifteen months can. truthfully say that the state of the industry would have been improved if the proposal had been adopted. The Government, instead of paying a bounty, made a thorough investigation, and discovered that the cause of the trouble was the system of financing the industry; and it went to the assistance of the industry by financing the crop uncier the Dried Fruits Advances Aet passed by this Parliament. Concurrently, legislation was passed for controlling the export trade and improving marketing conditions. No the industry over its difficulties, or that the Export Control Board has done much to revolutionize marketing methods aud dispose of the produce of the' industry oversea. hoard will be able to effect greater economies and confer even greater benefits on the producer in ths future. Surely that is a better position than that the industry should have remained without any control over the sales of fruit ? Unquestionably, the position is better today than it would have been had the Government yielded to the expressed desire for the payment of a bounty. bounty would not have precluded the appointment of an export control board. solution of their difficulties, those engaged in the industry proposed that a bounty should be given. The appointment of the export control board, which has proved of great advantage to the in-dustry during the last twelve months, was the result of the Government's investigation. The advances to which the honourable member has referred were made with the object of solving the problem which had arisen in connection with the finances of the fruit-growing industry. It had previously been financed iby -.merchants .and agents, the advances ^-gradually becoming greater, until those .making them became apprehensive. Howtever, as the alluring picture of British preference was continually before their eyes, they continued to assist the industry, but when that preference was refusedI shall say nothing at present about the reason for this, although I hold strong views on the matter-thos e who had advanced money to the industry decided that, in fairness to themselves, they could not continue to do so. The Government then came to the assistance of the industry, and made advances over the period of six months necessary foi the production of the next crop. Those advances amounted to £9 per ton, in . -he case of sultanas, and to 30s. per ton in respect of currants. Probably for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth the Crown stood behind individuals who subsequently made advances; 'but the action was justified because the -difficulty of financing the industry was -overcome. The honourable member stated -that the industry is again in trouble financially, and suggested that the advances already made should not be repaid immediately, but that they should be extended for a further period of two years. It is expected that the I point out, however, that, even if they are not to he repaid now, but are to be a charge on the next season's crop, it will again be impossible to obtain finance' for the industry through the ordinary channels. This difficulty the Government is prepared to meet, as it desires to give the fruit industry every opportunity to firmly establish itself. The Government is prepared to again guarantee any advances which may be made to assist the granting of a industry. of the cost of production come in here ? Is not the unascertained cost of production the measure of the liablity of the grower ? power to determine that. He has to give a ruling as to what, in hip opinion, is a fair figure at which to place the cost of production. The honourable member stated, further, that, even if granted another two years in which to pay, some of the fruit-growers would still be unable to meet their obligations. them are in that position. prepared to consider that aspect of the question also, and to appoint a board to consider all these matters. If necessary, the Government will extend to four years the period for the repayment of the advances. It will go further, and do what is now done in connection with the Income Tax Act. Where it is shown that hardship would be inflicted by insisting on the repayment of the advances, the Government is prepared to exempt such individuals from the necessity of making repayment. That is a fair proposal, and embodies the intention of the original act, that these advances were not to be regarded as a bounty to the industry. While it will meet all cases of hardship that might exist, it will not allow a man who is well able to repay the advance to evade his obligations. As to the position of the industry at the present time, I point out that the only matter with which I dealt, when replying to the deputation, was the suggestion that the cost of production should be guaranteed. That principle I could not, and do not, accept. The",18,Dried Fruits Industry Formal Motion Fob Adjournment

"" If you wish to save the industry can you see any other way of saving it than by guaranteeing the cost of production?"" ber's time has expired. regard this question as one of great importance, and commend the honourable memher for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) for having brought it before the House. It is well known that, in recent years, we have placed a large number of returned soldiers and others on the land, especially in the fruit-growingindustry, and that we have incurred heavy liabilities in consequence. Recently, we decided to forego £10,000,000 of the indebtedness of the states in connection with land settlement. As we have borrowed money, and are still borrowing money, in an endeavour to place settlers on the land, we have the right, as the custodians of the public purse, to take any action that we deem necessary to protect the people of Australia in regard to the liabilities that have body were appointed. AfterI haci been incurred, to say nothing of the men who, unfortunately, are unable to earn a livelihood. In this connection it is our first duty to see that Australian conditions are maintained in this industry. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr in view of the reductions mentioned by Stewart) said that the wages paid to employees by fruit-growers amounted to £4 8s. for a week of 48 hours. Similar conditions obtain in other industries in Australia, and I see no reason why they should nof apply to fruit-growing. Nevertheless, we should do all that is possible to ensure that the men who pay those wages shall market their produce profitably. That is the crux of the whole question. How are we to obtain markets? The preference granted by Great Britain may be of assistance that. But there is still a great margin between the price received by the fruit growers and that at which the fruit is sold in London. London last year, the, Australian Natives Association gave a dinner in my honour. On that occasion I pointed out that, whereas Australian fruit was then being sold in London at £52 per ton, the grower in Australia received less than £20 per ton. There is room for an investigation) into the reasons for that difference. The costs should be reduced. duced by about £10 per ton; that reduction includes the British preference. were made further reductions might be shown to be possible.

That question is worthy of investigation. Again, he asks, "" Can the methods of processing and packing for market be improved, and costs reduced?"" We have here a request by the fruit-growers themselves to be shown, if possible, how they can reduce their costs. The proposition of the honourable member is a legitimate one, and why the Government refuses to acquiesce in it is beyond my comprehension. The Government should help those who are prepared to help themselves. I cannot see how these men can be expected to repay their advances if facilities for obtaining a satisfactory return for their products are not provided. They are like a man purchasing his home. If he has not a sufficient income he cannot continue to pay his instalments. We should not be content to place men on the land, borrowing money for the purpose, and' even at great cost bringing out migrants, unless we can secure a market for their produce. If the local market is not sufficient, we must look abroad for a means of disposing of the fruit of their labours. Will any one contend that . we can successfully the, world's market with the products of countries where cheap coloured labour is employed ? It ' is impossible for us to do so. When we realize that 80 per cent, of the fruit grown in Australia must be exported, and that, unless it can be sold at a jn'ofit, the fruit-growers are faced with failure, it is evident that action mu3t be taken immediately to inquire into matters affecting the industry. an immigration scheme when thousands of good Australians cannot make a living ? of the House have said that for years. While it is admitted that we have large areas to be populated, we should not lose sight of the main essential-the necessity of finding adequate markets for our produce. Yet no efforts in this direction are being made. Not only in Victoria, but in New South Wales and South Australia also, there are hundreds of returned soldiers engaged in the fruit-growing industry who are unable to make a livelihood. The honourable Is it fair that they should be placed in that position? Have we reached the stage when their undoubted claims may be overlooked ? By placing 'so many returned men on the land to produce large additional quantities of fruit, we have placed the original fruit-growers at a disadvantage, and in rheir interests, also, efforts must be made to provide an adequate market. Otherwise there must be failure all round. I can quote the case of a relative of my own, whose stalwart sons worked hard on one of these settlement blocks. They put £1,000 of their own into it, and they have lost the lot. It was not because they did not work their block properly. The Government inspector said that their's was the best kept orchard in the settlement. All the reports of it were favorable; but they lost their all in their efforts to make good on a settlement block. I am more than surprised that the Prime Minister should offer any objection to the request that has been made. These people are asking only for .an inquiry enough. compete in if they are given the inquiry for which they ask the tribunal appointed will investigate the whole of the business, and when its report is presented to this House we shall be in a position to decide what it is necessary to do to preserve the industry. It has been clearly pointed out by the Tariff Board that this is one of the industries that is practically at the mercy of overseas markets. Other products of the country, such as wheat, flour, meat, and wool, can be profitably is the good of marketed abroad, because they are not produced in sufficient quantities in other countries; but dried fruits are produced largely in other countries with cheap labour, and we cannot hope to compete on even terms with them. We cannot ask those engaged in this industry to accept a lower standard of living than that enjoyed by workers in other industries in Australia. The people engaged in the fruit-growing industry are entitled to a fair return for their efforts in developing this country.

The Prime Minister has expressed the opinion that there is a great future before the f r u it industry of this country. I also wool-grower and the butter producer, canbelieve that; but if the people engaged in it are to succeed, they must have fair treatment meted out to them. In the fruit areas represented by the honourable member for Wimmera-Mildur a and Red Cliffs-ther e are produced some of the finest fruits in the world. I question whether the sultanas produced there can be equalled in any other part of this country, or in California. same district. We have in this country hundreds of thousands of acres of cheap land admirably adapted to fruit production. We are prepared to spend money in millions to bring immigrants to this «ountry to settle on the land. The only way in which to settle them successfully is to put them on fruit areas where the land is cheap. The reason why we have had recently to wipe off millions in the -soldier settlement areas is that high prices were paid for the land in boom times. If the same course is pursued in the purchase of land for immigrants, similar failures will follow. In the areas lieve that the Commonwealth Shipping along the Murray, from SwanH ill down to Renmark and along the River Darling, there are millions of acres of cheap land admirably adapted for fruit-growing. Western Australia is a great state, as the honourable member for Swan( Mr it should be accepted by the Government. Qregory) will know. ing many millions of people. there is cheap. If we have thousands of people engaged in fruit growing, their operations will give employment to many more. sands of men and women will be engaged in the harvesting season in picking the fruit, the revenue will be increased from railway freights and Customs dues, and the progress of the country will be promoted. When we find that those engaged in the fruit-growing industry are suffering, we should endeavour to find out the cause. The growers have asked for their position to be investigated, in order to find, if possible, -a means of averting losses such as they are at present incurring. The Government would be acting wisely if it granted their request. The fruit-grower, like the not pass on additional costs; he must accept the price ruling in the market. This Parliament should endeavour to thoroughly organize the markets for primary products. In the organization of markets Australia is very backward, but a good start has been made in connection with both dairy produce and dried fruits. The producer of dried fruits has to pay the Australian rates of wages, top prices for cases, and the usual railway freights, and there is no organization in connection with the disposal of his product when it reaches the city. The merchants take charge of the fruit and distribute it to retailers in the city and suburbs, and ultimately the consumer pays from 4d. to 6d. per lb. for apples for which the grower has received Id. per lb. That iniquity is due to the absence of orderly marketing. We must take action to protect the growers against exploitation. We must arrange for distributing agencies in the city and overseas, and utilize the Commonwealth steamers in order to reduce freights on both fruit and butter. I beLine could carry fruit at lower freights than are being charged to-day. The proposal made by the honourable member for Wimmera has no party significance, and Certainly no harm would come from an inquiry, and much good might result. keep on the land men who have spent many years in production, thus creating wealth and employment.

I believe that the outlook is bright, and that the industry can be placed upon a sound and firm footing. Australia, with its wonderful climate, abundance of sunlight and warmth, and the nature of its rainfall, can produce large quantities of fruit, equal in quality to the products of any other part of the world. Its quality at the present time is at least as good as that of American fruits produced under similar economic conditions. New hope has been given to the growers since the Prime Minister, when he was in England to attend the Imperial conference, quickened the conscience of the British people in regard to the wonderful possibilities of the dried fruits industry as a means of settling a large population along the Murray River and other irrigated and irrigable land. ter stimulate the appetites of the British mentary expression, which the honourable people? such an extent that the British Parliament has granted a substantial measure of unreservedly withdraw "" ? preference which will be of great benefit to the industry.

Dr. EARLE . PAGE It is obvious that any tribunal that investigates these matters must be representative of both the Commonwealth and the States. I have already pointed out that four of the seven points raised by the f r u it growers concern the States rather than the Commonwealth, but the latter is in terested in transport charges, marketing, selling, and finance. The other matters are essentially matters for State administration, regulation, and control. The Government is at present in negotiation with State Governments to ascertain whether a satisfactory board can be appointed, and whether a satisfactory method of investigation can be adopted. This industry is to-day probably more flourishing than it has been for three years, but it is hamI t is making pered by an accumulation of past troubles. If the growers had nothing else but this year's difficulties to overcome, it is quite possible that they would not be now making a request to the Government; especially as it has done much to improve their position. The trouble goes back to the land boom, and increased interest since the war. The cost of settling on the land has increased, and taxes and water charges have also in creased-. There has been a steady increase of charges, which havefinally accumulated and become too great for the industry to bear. What is necessary is to find some permalations of debt. This is as important almost as the guaranteeing of the cost of production. The Government attempt last year to assist the industry by means of the Dried Fruits Advances Act was a step in the right direction. The Prime Minister stated this morning that the repayment of the advances due next year would be discussed and considered when the time arrived for settlement. The Government is prepared to consider any constructive suggestion to help the industry. There is a good outlook for the and investigation of these industry, and I believe that it will be which, though primarily able to carry on if the control is within State concern, might be in the industry. Buti f the cost of production were to be guaranteed by the Government, and government control prevailed, the industry would eventually languish. rather remarkable to hear two ministerial statements on a motion to adjourn the",25,Dried Fruits Industry Formal Motion Fob Adjournment

68,Mr Gabb (Angas) [12.48],"-It isHouse. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) has asked for bread and has been offered a stone. In other words, the Prime Minister has administered the pill but omitted to put sugar on it , and the Treasurer, instead of putting sugar on the pill, has coated it with bitter aloes. That sums up the position. I agree in the main with the honourable member for Wimmera, but not with his statement about the undesirability of stressing the position of returned soldiers in the dried fruits industry. it. If we make claims on the Government for assistance for one industry, we must show that it has special circumstances as compared with those of other industries, otherwise the Government will meet any request for assistance with the statement that if it assists the dried fruits industry it will have to do the same thing for every other primary industry. I shall give six reasons to show that the circumstances of this industry are different from ' the bulk of other primary industries, and, therefore, it deserves special consideration. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), and other honourable members, asked how the present position had developed. statement was made by the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) that prices had fallen, and the honourable member for Wimmera interjected that production costs had increased. ments are all correct. I want to emphasize, first of a l l , the reason why -returned soldiers were settled along the' River Murray. cipal reasons was to prevent any interference with the big landed in terests in South Australia and Victoria. It seemed to be an easy way of repatriating returned soldiers without subdividing large estates for mixed-farming purposes. The honourable member for Barker( MrM . Cameron) shakes his head. I refer him to a measure that was passed by the South Australian House of Assembly for the subdivision of large estates. Wheni t reached the Upper Housei t was mutilated beyond recognition, and was in consequence useless. I reiterate that one of the reasons that returned soldiers were placed upon the River Murray vas to prevent conflict with the big landed and pastoral interests of this country. speaking, that subject does not relate to the motion. into the dried fruits industry was pushed a higher percentage of returned soldiers than into any other industry, in proportion to the number of primary producers engaged in it . dustry is one of the best industries to enter. will prove a true prophet. This industry above all others deserves more consideration from the Government than is at present given to it . My third point is that the result of pushing the soldiers into the dried fruits industry has been to cause increased production in an industry that has to export the bulk of its product. For this reason the Government sbould accede to the request to guarantee the cost of production of the export quota. Dried fruits, except in the years 1918 to 1921, have always been exported at a loss. These are special circumstances, and the dried fruit s industry should, therefore, receive special The treatment at the hands of the Government. My fourth point was advanced by the honourable member for Wimmera. He stated that the Tariff Board had.reported on this matter, and that there were two, Those stateperhaps three, of the primary industries of Australia that had to export a greater quantity of produce than was consumed locally. He mentioned wool and dried One of the prinfruits, and on behalf of the latter he made his request for assistance. The fifth reason is that the Commonwealth GovernT ment has already realized its general responsibilities regarding the repatriation and assisting of returned soldiers. First of all, it has reduced the amount of in terest to be paid by the States to the Commonwealth for five years by 2£ per cent. It has written off £10,000,000 of loans made to the States to help in the repatriation of soldiers. That is a general recognition of the responsibility of the Commonwealth. This industry is peculiarly affected by the repatriation scheme, and as there has been a recognition of the general responsibilities of the Government, there should also be arecognition of its special responsibilities.

In this industry, in the' Murray Waters scheme, and in the settlement of soldiers along that river, duction in this country has been growing much government capital is involved. We have been told to-day that settlers are leaving their blocks, and that many of them are contemplating similar action. The honourable member for Wimmera has asked only for a tribunal to inquire into the position of the industry, but if the Government makes available the finances necessary to avert a crash upon the river Murray, its action will be a form of insurance to save some of the money that has been invested. am afraid that the time at my disposal is not sufficient for me to discuss f u l ly the position of the dried fruits industry, and I should like to know whether the Government, w ill permit an extension of the time for one hour.

The Prime Minister has merely moved that an appropriation of revenue be made for certain purposes. is entitled to know what the Government's intention is. What is the reason for the bill ? Are honourable members to be treated as if they were children rather than men occupying responsible positions? vouring to bludgeon persons outside the House, he will find that he will not be permitted to treat honourable members similarly by the means he is now adopting. I have never before witnessed such a high-handed my occupancy of a seat in this chamber. I do not know whether honourable the action that is being taken by the Government. ter was discussed and settled prior \o their entrance: intothe chamber; but if they know what is in the mind of the Prime Minister, honourable members on this side have no such knowledge. an unprecedented course of action to depart from the business agenda at 2.30 p.m. on a Friday without giving the slightest information to the House as to the reason for it. are being treated with the utmost contempt. shown the usual courtesy expected from the Leader of the Government, and to be told exactly why he is taking this action. Do honourable members opposite think they are aware of the Government's intentions, which have .been kept secret from the time it was determined to introduce this measure, honourable members of the Opposition were also in possession of the facts ? I appeal to honourable members opposite to say whether their Leader is acting fairly to honourable members on this side in refusing to state the reason for this motion. Why should honourable members on this side, without any knowledge of the facts, agree to an appropriation for a purpose of which they are ignorant? The time has arrived to object to this sort of procedure. On many occasions in the life of this Parliament honourable members on this side have asserted Mr Clmrlton. This is Pritheir right to full information, but on the present occasion they have not had a scintilla of information. knows that it will be more convenient for me to give him the information on the second reading. the Opposition has every right to object.

Surely when the Government departs from the regular procedure of ParIf the Prime Minister is endealiament, and sets aside the business paper, the Leader of the House should inform honourable members, and the country generally, what he has in mind. I am not prepared to agree to the motion until I know something about it. Honourable action during members opposite may be .bound to support their Leader, but they cannot justify his action. Members of the Opposition, members opposite agree to as representing a large section of the people, have some rights. I have no Perhaps the whole matofficial information regarding the purpose of the motion, and all I know about it is a word that was recently passed across the table.

We are entitled to it at this stage. This action by the Government that because will probably mean honourable members missing their trains, and, unless it can be justified, should not be tolerated. I am prepared to do much to assist the Government while it carries on its business in a reasonable way. This party has given evidence of a similar willingness, but no one can say that we are being treated fairly now. Honourable members had anticipated that certain subjects would come up for discussion this afternoon, and had prepared themselves accordingly, but they now find that other business is thrust upon them.

No one can say that I am making this request for information in order to block business, because the bill will have to be discussed on its merits later. If the Prime Minister thinks it sufficient for members of his own party to know the nature of the business of the House, I differ from him. I have the recollection that when the Labour party was in power honourable members opposite expected that all the information on a subject about to be discussed should be made available to them. Labour governments always made that information available; but honourable members are now expected to accept blindly every proposal put forward, on the promise that it will be explained later. ber's chance will come. what will happen in the future, but the sooner we have a chance of finding out whether the people approve of this sort of thing the better.

I suggest to the Prime Minister that he bring down a three months' Supply Bill and, when that has been passed, we will go to the country on any question he I have no doubt likes, and allow the people to decide between us. I cannot put the position any clearer, but I repeat that this is not the proper way in which to conduct the business of the country.

104,,"I would rather see Mr Charlton -Whil e my remarksrecently passed by this Parliament. believe that the people of Australia 'will resent it, and that this Government, when next its actions come up for review by the people, will go the -way of all governments that have attempted to introduce coercive legislation. I am not afraid of the grand jury-the people of Australia. The Government has the support of influential newspapers throughout the Commonwealth; in fact, the men behind the inkpot are ruling the country. The right honourable gentleman has not done justice to his party, to this House, or to the country. he is only a marionette. the right honourable gentleman to expect us to acquiesce in his proposal? remind him that neither of the parties forming the coalition has an absolute majority in this House, and it is evident that the Government has no fixed policy. Apparently, something of importance has happened during the last few hours, yet the House has no information concerning it. should appreciate the Government's action. adjournment the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) asked the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) to be good enough to resume his seat, in order that he might have an opportunity to speak. But he allowed the Government to coerce him. suggestion for the extension of the adjournment debate, because to do so might have jeopardized the Government which he supports. Yet he says that we should appreciate the Government's action. He is one of those members who have no opinion of their own, but unthinkingly follow where they are led. Such blind following as has been exhibited during the life of this Parliament by honourable members supporting the Government has no precedent in this Chamber. The business of the country has not been satisfactorily conducted by the present Government, yet some honourable members want to prolong the life of Parliament. I say that the sooner the voice of the people is heard the better. If the Prime Minister is not prepared to acccept my challenge, I hope that those honourable members who sit behind him and have just I said "" Hear, hear,"" will bring sufficient pressure to bear upon him to make bim do so. Fancy a Minister asking a deliberative assembly to agree to a resolution in the absence of any information concerning it ! The Prime Minister is treating the representatives of the people as children. He seems to imagine that he has but to ask, and his request will be granted. I remind him that the Labour party in this House is as strong as any other party. The last Senate election was won by the Labour party by a big majority, and also seven additional seats in this House. Moreover, in five of the states of the Commonwealth, Labour governments are now in office. Yet, in spite of that evidence of the desire of the people, the Government has given members of this I party no information whatever concerning the matter now before us. We are not prepared to accept that position without protest, and intend, so far as possible, to assert our rights in the interests of the people whom we represent. Had the Prime Minister made a brief explanatory statement, his request might have been granted before this; but we do not know what is in his mind, and we are not prepared to vote for something concerning which we have no information. If the action contemplated by the Government is justified, it will have the support of honourable members on this side. Were our positions reversed, the Labour party would not treat the Opposition as the Prime Minister is treating us. Such treatment would not be tolerated in He did not attempt to press his a public meeting. It is only because of bhe Standing Orders that the Government has taken this course. If the Prime Minister is prepared to let us know now the purpose for which this money is required his action may clear the .atmosphere. I should be sorry if the Prime Minister's obstinacy hangs up the business of the country over the week end, as there is no necessity for it. knows that I am pursuing the ordinary course, and' the one most convenient to the House. in regard to honourable members on the other side, but the course adopted is not convenient to honourable members on this side. of the Opposition first hear of this proposal ?",31,Railways I N Committee Consideration Of Gover

Subsequently, a tribunal was constituted; its personnel was announced yesterday. Last night I sent to Whether they are"" sufficient the Premier of New South Wales the following telegram:Following thc issue of the Proclamation by the Governor General that there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening the peace, order, or W it h a view to constigood government of the Commonwealth, a board has been appointed under sub-section 2 of section SAA of the Immigration Act 1901-25.

141,Mr Bruce,"was to deport Australian, citizens. I have referred is as follows:"" I am prepared to see that the laws of the Commonwealth and of the state are observed,"" said Mr Lang to-day, *' but I am not prepared to identify this state or the Labour party with any Nationalist attempt to deport its political and industrial opponents. fullest expression of opinion on all public questions. The press and the representatives of employers claim this right, and I see no reason why it should be denied to the leaders of unionism by threats of deportation. The passage of the deportation section of the Immigration Act which it is now proposed to bring into operation in connection with a dispute of foreign origin was' denounced by me at the time of its introduction. I regard the act as one of the most iniquitous measures ever passed in any country, and I will firmly refuse to permit state instrumentalities to be abused for the purpose of deporting political or indusbers to consider where that principle, if trial leaders. There is no need for the Federal Government, in . pursuance of its deportation policy, to invoke the assistance of any Government. means at its own disposal for the execution of its own policy, and I am determined that it shall carry its policy into effect with the abundant resources at its command. I have no desire to embroil New South Wales in any deportation proceedings. It appears to me that the Federal Ministry is seeking to force upon the Labour Government of this state some of the odium which must inevitably follow the execution of Federal policy. Moreover, I helieve that there is considerable doubt as to the legality of the act in so far as it affects British subjects who have been here for many years and who have reared families of Australian boys and girls. To cast such families out of their own country is not to deport them in the ordinary sense of the word; it is to exile them to a foreign country. The power which the Federal Government claims under its industrial deportation. legislation is monstrous. Any Britisher expressing sympathy with any body of men engaged in industrial disputes is liable to deportation for life and his family to exile. He has only to say that he thinks that the men are in the right and he instantly comes within the scope of the act. As a good deal of misapprehension appears to exist regarding the views of the New South Wales Ministry towards the present industrial situation, it is, perhaps, desirable that our position should be clearly defined. When Mr discussion on an important and controBruce asked that protection should be afforded to those seamen who desired to work on British vessels I was rather surprised at the request, as there had not been the slightest sign of lawlessness in this state. The British seamen who have left their ships are models of good conduct, and have occasioned no trouble -whatever. It is hardly necessary for me to say that the methods of the Federal Nationalist Government in dealing with industrial troubles seldom commend themselves to the Labour party. The practice of flying to every available means of repression and coercion has become chronic, with the result that very few industrial leaders place tbe least confidence in the impartiality of the Federal authorities. They are regarded as merely the agents and instruments of the employers. This is unfortunate, because the influence of the Federal Government for peace should transcend that of any other public or private body."" Such a statement, made in reply to the T believe in the request of the Commonwealth Government for State assistance in enforcing a Commonwealth law must give every member of the Federal Parliament deep cause for thought. In it Mr Lang proceeds to criticize, from a party point of view, -a law passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, and indicates that, because he does not agree with it, he proposes to render no assistance whatever in enforcing it. I ask honourable memfollowed generally, would lead us? The Commonwealth has all the Minister and those sitting behind him in their proper place. member for Darling must not interject. to recognize their legal obligations to enforce Commonwealth legislation only when they agree with that legislation? Are we prepared to abrogate our legislative powers, or to allow the State Premiers to he the judges of our legislation, and to say that only for the enforcement of legislation of which they approve will they render assistance ? Honourable members opposite may disagree with the legislation which has been passed by this Parliament, but they are failing in their duty as members of the Federal Parliament if they do not resent the attitude adopted by the Premier of New South Wales. Honor-able members interjecting, members to restrain themselves. The versial matter such as that now before the House demands care and restraint, and I ask honourable members to assist in preserving order during this debate. be drawn from the reply of Mr Lang, the first being that he does not admit the obligation of the State to assist the Commonwealth in carrying, out legislation which has been duly and properly passed by this Parliament.

148,Mr Bruce,"Thre e conclusions ma.yhe considers that, as a State Premier, he has the right to scrutinize Commonwealth legislation, rendering assistance only if he agrees with it, and refusing assistance where he does not agree with it. The third conclusion is that Mr Lang thinks that in no circumstances shall any man be deported from Australia. The only way in which a person advocating the wildest communistic ideas may be deported from Australia is under the legislation passed by this Parliament. order to give effect to that legislation, the is to be given the same authority as that appointment of a tribunal is necessary; yet Mr Lang is not prepared to allow the Commonwealth Government even to approach a Supreme Court judge of New South Wales in the matter. own judges? Cannot you trust them? Or are the High Court judges not low enough to do the job? able member for Darling. this tribunal might be called upon to consider the case of a man who was regarded by the whole community as a menace, and whom every one thought should be deported; but it is clear from Mr Lang's statement that he is not prepared to rid the country of a person of that description. If that is also the attitude of honordeavouring to control one individual, able members opposite, I absolutely disagree with them. I am not prepared to see this country made the dumping ground for men of wild ideas, who are prepared to destroy everything that we hold dear. Apparently, honourable members opposite hold different views. The Commonwealth Parliament has passed an act under which a tribunal has been appointed. Before that tribunal, men who are considered to be inimical to the peace, order, and good government of this country may be brought. If its decision is that the men so brought before it are a menace to the peace, order, and good government of Australia, the proper Minister has power to order their deportation. To give effect to the decisions of the tribunal, the assistance of the police is essential for the service of the summons required by the act, and if necessary, to' take the individual concerned into custody after the decision of the tribunal has been given. But we can receive no assistance from the Premier of New South Wales in these matters Consequently, the Government has had to bring down this bill, which is one it had no desire to introduce. This action has been forced upon us by the refusal of the Premier of New South Wales to give effect to a Commonwealth law which' is binding upon the whole of ' the people of Australia. The bill is a very short one, and its provisions are more suitable for consideration in committee than at this stage. It authorizes, the Commonwealth GovernIn ment to appoint peace omcers, to whom of the police constables of the states. It is a serious thing that the Commonwealth Government should have to appoint officials for the enforcement .of the laws of the Commonwealth, but this is really the final stage of a situation which has been gradually developing. During the last few months we have been subjected to constant industrial upheaval. We have had in our midst persons who have putforward the most revolutionary ideas, and have defied the principles of trade unionism. Time and again extremists have defied properly constituted irade unionist leaders, and have dragged the great trade unionist movement at llieir heels. No one who has studied the occ«rrences of the last few months can dispute what I have said. During the shipping upheavals in December last, and since, we have seen the trade unionists enbut they could not do it . To-day the attitude of honourable members opposite, and that of the leaders of the trade unionist movement in Australia, is such as to fill with shame every trade unionist in this country. In former disputes there has been at least this excuse for industrial leaders, that, although the extremists have dragged them at their heels in a way which no one would, have believed possible, at least it could be said that the disputes were between workers and their employers. But to-day the dispute that exists, and concerning which honourable members of the Labour party have not a word to say, is a dispute between a properly constituted trade union in Great Britain and members of that iinion in this country who have been misled and drawn away from their allegiance by a few extremists. To-day we have in our midst men whom, honourable members opposite, by their silence, are supporting, but who are defying theiT own union, and striking a vital blow at the principle of trade unionism.",40,Second Reading

On Monday last I made a statement to the press in plain words, in which I suggested a certain course of aetion. I invited honourable members opposite to maintain constitutional government, to constitute themselves the champions of legitimate trade unionism, and to support the men in Great Britain who control the British seamen's organization. I suggested to them that they should advise the seamen in our ports to do what every responsible trade unionist leader in Great Britain expects them to do. But they did not utter one word. The Government was then compelled to take this action. Its hands have been forced to a great extent because the trade unionist leaders have not performed their duty. They can discipline these men better than any one else. It is their responsibility; but they have made no attempt to shoulder it. They have not done anything.

The Government has taken the power to deport from Australia meni who are doing incalculable harm. That was a necessary step, and one by which I am prepared to stand. This further step which has been forced upon us is necessary for the welfare of the whole people. We have accepted the challenge and are going on. We have put our hands to the plough, and have no intention of going back. The position in Australia to-day is such that unless definite action is taken against these men who are undermining our national life everything which we hold dear may be lost.

We have a right to deal with our own citizens within our own borders, if they have rendered themselves liable to punishment. If these men have committed a crime they should be punished here according to our own laws. This marks the difference between the Government and honourable members on this side. We say that there' is ample law in Australia to deal with men if they have done wrong. The Prime Minister, in his speech, would make it appear that honourable members on this side have aided and abetted these men. He has practically said as much. He knows very well that if there is any one in this chamber who has failed to try to do what was best in the interests of the Commonwealth it is himself, because, a few weeks ago, when -a deputation waited upon him and asked him to intercede in connection with an industrial difficulty, he absolutely refused to do so. trouble; but the right honourable gentleI ask honourable members tocontrast the right honourable gentleman's action on that occasion with the action of Mr be a good battle cry with which to go to Baldwin, the Premier of England, a week or so later.

Immediately, industrial trouble arose he stepped in to try to bring about a settlethe interests of the Commonwealth, and ment. What did the late Alfred Deakin do when he was Prime Minister? I remember that on an occasion when there was industrial trouble he sent for me, desiring to know the circumstances connected with it, and whether he could do anything to bring about a settlement. It is the duty of the Prime Minister, as head of the Commonwealth Government, to try to bring about a settlement of industrial strife when requested to do so. But the righb honourable gentleman absolutely refused to do so when representatives of labour unions waited upon him and asked him to intercede. Instead of doing so, he passed legislation to deport the people about whom he talked so much to-dayRight on the eve of the passing of this legislation I told honourable members on the other side that the shipping dispute Do not honourable members was within measurable distance of being settled. Efforts were being made outside to bring about a settlement, and I was, myself, endeavouring to do so. I conceive to be right to bring about a better condition of things in Australia. That is the attitude I adopted as leader of the party on this side. After the deportation legislation was passed, the trouble with which it was intended t.o deal was settled, but, if the Prime Min=ister had intervened when he was requested to do so, the settlement of the recent shipping trouble in Australia would have been effected nine or ten days before it was. Here were two parties differing on certain points, and with no one to guide them. A man in the position of the Prime Minister, occupying the chair, as he should have done, at a conference of the parties, could have taken the statements of both sides, have pointed out the necessity for compromise and endeavoured to bring about a settlement. It could have been effected, and there would have been no more man preferred to pass legislation to deport people, believing that it would the country. That is what is behind the action of the Government. The Government knows that it has no chance in life of success at the next election unless it is able to go before the people with some special cry. Rather than consider first do what he could to settle the shipping dispute, he brought down his bill to deport certain people. No matter how objectionable the actions of those people may be, we should deal with them according to the laws of our own country.

Why should the Government go to the length of passing special legislation to deal with those who arc said to have committed a breach of the law, and then ask a State Government to give effect to legislation which it does not approve? get a court in Australia to convict the men. has the Government gone to the courts of a State and asked for the assistance of a State judge? Why did it not appoint a Commonwealth judge? Evidently because the Commonwealth judges would have nothing to do with the matter. We have machinery of our own, as Mr Lang has stated, to deal with these people if they have done wrong, but the judges bf the High Court had too much sense to be drawn into a matter like this. Not one of them would touch it . When the Prime Minister was unable to secure the services of a Oommonwealth judge he asked the New South Wales Government to permit of the appointment of some one ix. the Public Service of the State, notwithstanding the fact that it was entirely opposed to the legislation proposed to be enforced. If the Government had asked that some one should be appointed to inquire into a breach of our law involving punishment within this country, the New South Wales Government would have responded to the request. That would have heen very different from giving its consent to measures taken to deport people. The action of the Federal Government, as I have said before, and now repeat, is a direct blow at the trades union movement of this country. There is no disputing the fact that that is theobject of it. The Government holds up the actions of two or three men to show that it is justified in the course it is taking. May I say that, so far as honourable members on this side are concerned, we did everything that we could for the settlement of the recent shipping dispute?

The Government has placed upon the statute-book a measure which provides that any person not born in Australia who becomes involved in an industrial dispute that is likely to interfere with trade and commerce may be brought before a board, and if convicted, deported to the country of his birth . That, and that only, must be the issue on any appeal to the country. The legislation referred to will make it possible for the Government to deport every trade union leader who may be concerned in an industrial dispute. Evidently the Goto our own laws and, if vernment expects these leaders to desert their men; to turn their backs on fellowunionists lest they be deported.

No attempt has been made to put into operation the provisions . of our arbitration, or other statute or common law, whichever may be applicable. The Government clearly wishes to get r i d of certain men, and, because there is so much turmoil in connection with certain industrial organizations, Ministers imagine that feeling is running strongly against these men.

The Ministry, without appealing to the people, wishes Mr Lang, the Premier of New South Wales, to take a certain line of action, notwithstanding that he differs fundamentally from the Commonwealth Government as to the cause of this industrial trouble. I had intended to quote Mr Lang's statement so as to have it published in Hansard. I am glad the right honourable the Prime Minister has done this for me. We could not have a better statement of the case. Mr Lang's speech will be perused by every one who reads Hansard, and I am satisfied it will meet with their approval.

If the request made to Mr Lang had and if he had then refused to support the Commonwealth Government, he would have stood condemned by the people throughout his own State.

But no; the Government preferred to appeal to a Labour government in New South Wales, and ask it to place its officials at the disposal of the Commonwealth. I know of no reason why the Victorian Government was not asked to accept this responsibility. From statements that have appeared in the press concerning the origin of the dispute, it appears that British seamen resented a reduction in their wages agreed to by their union leaders in England, and, upon arrival at Australian porta, refused to work. They then appealed to representative trade unions in Australia for sympathy and support. The press have made it clear that Australian unionists did not instigate the strike. Much of the trouble appears to be due to the fact that many people are suffering from an aggravated form of hysteria in connection with industrial affairs.

I prefer to work quietly in the interests of the Commonwealth rather than to pose as a mediator, and get kudos from the press. If the Prime Minister had done likewise, there would not have been half the present trouble. But Ministers and their supporters want a political placard. They are looking for trouble. Apparently they think that if they can create the right atmosphere they will succeed on an appeal to the people. In my opinion, this trouble can only last a week or two at the most. It is sure to ""peter"" out, because it is not officially recognized by the British Seamen's Union. It is"" an unofficial strike.

It may not be all plain sailing for the Government. Do honourable members supporting the Government realize the consequences of this action? Apparently it is left for me to point to the danger, and to warn them of the pitfalls which the Prime Minister is digging for them.

Although no Australian union is involved in the trouble, the Government proposes to go to the length of deporting men, who, if they had offended against the laws of the Commonwealth, could be dealt that is the right policy; but the Commonwealth Government desires the Labour Government in New South Wales to assist in doing something that is repugnant to it, and also to the people of Australia, as they will clearly show if they have an opportunity of pronouncing upon it during the next few weeks. The statement has been made that the Government realizes that it cannot successfully appeal to the people unless an electioneering bogy is created, and it is making the most of this industrial trouble as a means of gaining support at the ballot-box. I have to-day challenged the Government to go to the country immediately, and I hope that gage will be taken up.

The State Government is not asked to affirm that it approves of any Commonwealth law which it is asked to execute. The execution of a Commonwealth law is not dependent upon the approval of any State Government; otherwise we might have in the six sovereign States, whose Governments change according to fluctuations of public opinion, three governments in favour of a Federal law, and giving effect to it, and three disapproving of it, and refusing to co-operate with the Commonwealth in enforcing it. Thus the law would be operative in three States, and inoperative in the other, three. In this democratic country, the will of the people, as expressed in this Parliament, should be sufficient warrant for the enforcement of a law by a State authority. When we ask why the New South Wales Government refused to support the Federal authorities, the Leader of the Opposition, whose ability as a debater is a guarantee that the case he stated for the State Government is the best defence that is possible, declared that that Government was entitled to refuse to enforce the Commonwealth law, because, firstly, it was passed through this House by means of the guillotine; and secondly, it is repugnant to the Government of New South Wales. who are elected by the constituents to represent them in this National .Parliament are the only persons who, in law, right to say that. are capable of declaring what is the will of the people.

That shows how utterly illogical their position is The Government of the State of New South Wales may have acted within its rights when it refused to give to the Commonwealth any assistance to carry out a Commonwealth law. It may have acted within its constitutional right, but certainly not in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution. It is in essence a wrong action to take. The action of a State Government in declining to assist the Commonwealth to enforce its laws is practically an incitement to the citizens of Australia not to observe those laws. When a State Government says, "" This law is repugnant to us, and we will not enforce it,"" a spirit of disobedience is He quotes two well-known United States inculcated.

Sir LITTLET ON GEOOM -When the Premier of a State whose governments have for years enforced the laws of the Commonwealth declines to assist in the enforcement of a particular CommonweaUh law because it is repugnant to him, what feeling must that create with regard to that law in the minds of the citizens who are asked to obey it? It is thc duty of every one to obey the laws which have been passed, even though they may be distasteful to him. Is the national Parliament and Government to be placed in a position of impotence? Is Australia, which holds a place amongst' the nations of the world, to be incapable of enforcing its own laws? I wish That is the position.. Fortunately the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to pass this law is beyond question. Under section 61 of the Constitution the executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the King, and is exercised by the Governor General as the King's representative. That power extends to the execution and maintenance of the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth.

Under the Constitution the Commonwealth is divided into legislative, executive, and judicial departments. The judges of the High Court have to pronounce upon the distribution of j>owers between the Commonwealth and the States, and to preserve the balance of justice evenly between all sections. As they may have to decide an appeal touching the constitutionality of any procedure, in this country, men from whom one it would be unwise to ask them to* undertake this duty, which is merely one of investigation and recommendation. Mr O'KEEFE -The Minister admits then that any decision of this board may be appealed against in the High Court? say anything of the sort. The Leader of the Opposition said that it would be opposed legally at all stages. I accept his statement. It is proper, therefore, to reserve to the High Court the function of pronouncing judgment upon anything that has been done. The Government has acted rightly throughout. Mr O'KEEFE -Fo r the information of the country the Minister ought to say .whether there will be a right to appeal to the High Court. who invoke the assistance of the law will have plenty of legal aid. My function as Attorney-General is to advise the Government in the administration of the departments, and to assist this House in the passing of laws. Because an honorablo member chooses to question me on a point of law, on behalf of any person, I am not bound to answer him. I maintain that the position ""of the Government throughout has been legally and constitutionally correct. An attempt has been appear impotent before the people of Australia. We decline to allow the Government to be placed in that position. As a matter of law we are bound to take this step. The Canadian Government has upon its statute-book a law similar to this. cannot deport a Britisher. Sir LITTLETON. GROOM I am referring to the police. I say that the Government of the Dominion of Canada has been given precisely the same power that we are seeking. The Leader of the Opposition did not give the slightest justification for the attitude of' the Government of New South Wales, and he did not meet the issue which was so clearly and forcibly raised by the Prime Minister as to the duty of a State Government to assist the Commonwealth in the execution of the laws of the nation. We have had two speeches from men who occupy very high and prominent positions would expect a little sanity and calmness in handling such a matter as this. The bill really means nothing; it is merely the result of certain legislation that has already passed this chamber. It was refreshing to read in the newspapers, and to hear repeated by the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), the message which was sent by the head of an important State in the Federation. The Government of the Stata of New South Wales, with a due sense of the responsibilities of its high office, and as the mouthpiece of the people of that State, has made a certain declaration, which is far-reaching in its importance. It has said, iu effect, that it refuses to be the "" wood and water joey "" of a political organization, or of a Government that, for political purposes, is carrying out the behests of a political organization. There is still, in New South Wales at any rate, a little sanity, even though the virtue has departed from the members of this Government.

I would inform honourable members opposite, who are temporarily in control of the government of this country, that this is panicky and hysterical legislation, and therefore cannot live long. There is a natural laAv transcending all man-made , laAvs, that if legislation is not acceptable to the people it must die. Bunning down through the ages, laAvs such as this have been introduced by puppets representing this or that interest, for political and other purposes. These laws live for a time, and then disappear like insects that live for 24 hours. The Leg Irons Act of New South Wales was introduced by Charles Gregory Wade. Where is that 4 laAv to-day, and how long did it live? It was on the statute-book for only a short time, because the people of that State would not support it. That measure was passed with great acclamation and with great political kudos from vested interests and the tory section of the community. It Avas introduced to the people of Australia as a great piece of legislation to be used on every possible occasion to bring about peace, order, and good government. I do not desire to be unfriendly to honourable members opposite, or to make them downhearted, but.

It has gone the way of all legislation that does not meet with the approval of the people.

If the deportation of our citizens is to be the election battle-cry, we are prepared, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, io accept it. placed upon all governments, and a very grave responsibility, too. The very fact that a State Government, representative of the people, takes the extreme step of refusing to act for the Federal Government in this matter, should give those who are supporting it cause for serious reflection before bringing the powers of the State and the Commonwealth into conflict. such a quarrel ? It would mean that the whole force of a sovereign State would be pitted against the power and laws of i he Commonwealth. If there is a responsibility upon the State of New South Wales, there is a-greater responsibility upon the Commonwealth Government. It should not precipitate a crisis merely to further its political desires. This legislaing the lead of the conservative newstion goes further than the appointment of a sergeant and a couple of constables. I, for one, am not prepared to allow the Government to pass legislation which may bring about a crisis between State and Commonwealth. Is the whole of bhe brains of this country on the front benches opposite? this community other than the wealthy? tion provisions of the Immigration Act are class legislation, and aim exclusively at the representatives of the trade unions of this country. It is doubtfid whether the Government, by introducing this legislation, will achieve the object that it has in view. It would be pitiable to deport citizens of perhaps 30 or 40 years' residence in this country for inciting a strike, when another man, guilty of the same offence, would be allowed to Mr Blakeley. go scot-free. If I cause a strike I cannot be deported, because I am an Australian-born citizen;, but if another causes a strike, he may be deported if he is not Australian-born. When a. Government sanctions such an anomaly, it makes one doubt its fitness to govern this country. I entirely agree with the declaration made by the Premier of New South Wales. He made it, fully realizing the and are gone. responsibility of his action. His Cabinet and the whole Labour movement of Australia are behind him. When the Labour movement stands behind the action of the Premier of New South Wales, it shows clearly that the majority of the people are also behind it. This fact must not be lost sight of by honourable members There is a responsibility opposite. The Prime Minister to-day endeavoured to introduce the old communist cry. A t the beginning of federation it was the usual method of tory politicians to use a bogy. Many, weird, and various were the bogys which were brought to light by those wbo then led the reactionary forces of Australia. Atone election the cry of the tory forces was the socialistic tiger. When that was What would be the result of battered, torn, worn, and useless, it was decided thab the members of the Labour party were advocates of free love, were out to destroy the home life and the marriage tie. They were accused of all kinds of ridiculous, foolish, and futile things. That cry was short-lived and unsuccessful. The Prime Minister and his supporters from, time to time, followpapers, have used the communist bogy. We are quite prepared to meet them on that bogy, if it is to be another of their election battle-cries. The Australian Labotir movement has made its attitude quite clear. The Prime Minister, in a burst of patriotism, threatens to send Is no section of our undesirable citizens to England. to be represented Where are .we drifting ? What a ridicuThe deportalous and fatuous thing it would be for this Government, because it could not control its citizens, to select two, three, or four of them, and to send them t.o England. If these men are not sufficiently good for Australia, surely we would be playing England rather a dirty trick to send them there. Where is the patriotism of the Government when it proposes to send our alleged undesirable citizens to England, a country that it professes to hold in reverence, and whose example it says we can follow with great profit to ourselves? The strike now in progress is essentially the British seamen's own concern. is their protest against a reduction in wages which brings their remuneration down to a starvation pittance. Under the new conditions a seaman who has to maintain a wife and three or four children in England on £9 a month cannot send home more than £2 per week. Thc men have decided tliat they will not accept this reduction from the Inchcape combine. Honorahle members know perfectly well that 90 per cent, of the British shipping that comes to Australia is controlled by the Inchcape combine. Is there one of us whp will have the hardihood to justify this reduction of £1 per monthwhicli will make the payment of some of the seamen £9 instead of £10 pei' month? Mr O'KEEFE -Thei r hours of work have also been increased. service has been reduced, and not one honourable member who has a semblance of love of fair play can justify it. This bill provides for the establishment of a police force, and, like another measure we recently had before us, it indicates that the Government lacks the courage to state its intentions openly. It is really party. They are either permanent memcamouflaged legislation. passed an immigration bill, but its immigration provisions have not been put into operation. It was never intended that they should he. blind, or, so to speak, a sugar coat to the deportation provisions. There is not an act on our statute-book that has the word "" deportation"" in its title, and the Government had not the courage to describe the so-called immigration bill as a deportation bill. Possibly it thought that the people of Australia would not realize its significance if it was incorrectly named. The purpose of this bill is to establish a police force for arresting and placing before a tribunal certain citizens of this country. It purports to provide for the appointment of oflicers to administer the laws of the Oommonwealth. orable member for Swan says, ""hear, body. Its members are-Algernon Strathear,"" he is not so unsophisticated as to ford Canning, of Sydney; Frederick think that this police force will be used James Kindon, of Sydney, accountant; to administer the whole of our laws. He and Norman de Home Rowland, of knows it is being created for the sole purpose of facilitating the deportation of certain citizens. It is before us under It false pretences. It is called a peace bill, but it ought to be called a war bill. These officers are to be appointed to do the dirty political work of this Government, which no State Government would do. I wish the Government well in its endeavour to "" put over "" this political stunt, but I believe that before the uniforms for these officers are made the need for their appointment will have vanished. It will be a Gilbertian force of the same calibre as that appointed by the Bight Hon. W. M . Hughes during his panicky and hysterical reign as Prime Minister. Without desiring to hurt the Prime Minister's feelings, I direct his attention to the fact that the Eight Hon. W. M . Hughes is politically dead and gone.

Why this great fear on the part of the honourable members ? Why are honourable members opposite so anxious that the Government and the party behind it shall not do something that will lead to its destruction?

If they do, what answer can they give to those who advise members of Australian organizations to flout their leaders ?

I should like to ask, Mr Speaker, what These British seamen this matter of the pilot service in Western Australia has to do with the bill before the House. a matter with the honourable the Assistant Minister, I did not hear the reference of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). I should like the honourable member to connect his remarks more intimately with the hill. I realize that the P i -ime Minister had to give very extensive reasons for the introduction of the bill, and I have allowed considerable latitude in the debate in consequence. I hope, however, that honourable members will confine themselves as nearly as possible to the issue before the House. for the appointment of peace omcers to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth Parliament. When the TJustoms and quarantine officers in Fremantle desired to visit ships they were prevented from carrying out their duties. It is essential that the Commonwealth Government should have peace officers if the States will not carry out the laws of the Commonwealth. The pilot service was certainly a State service, and I mention the incident only to show the extreme action taken at that time. The Leader of the Opposition suggests that there was no serious dispute at that time, but honourable members will remember the enormous losses sustained by Tasmania, as well as by Western Australia. The policy of allowing matters to drift has been oontinned too long. One cannot help admiring the self sacrificing loyalty of those unionists who, at enormous loss to themselves, are standing behind the strikers. The Government has a sacred duty to perform to see that the laws of the Commonwealth, and, incidentally, the laws of the States, are faithfully observed.

Collier are the opinions of many honourable members opposite. that honourable members of the Opposition are in a cleft stick. As the Government is taking this action very close to an election, it obviously does not fear the consequences. The only fault I have to find with the Government is that it has waited too long before taking action. I wanted it to act long ago. No person should be permitted to defy the law of the land. Are we going to allow one or two individuals to put themselves above the law of the land, and to say that they will do what they like? to be proceeded against in the ordinary courts of the country. Opposition has not denounced the attitude of these agitators. He has not gone among the Labour organizations and told them thatthis policy can end only in chaos and injury to the workers. ber has not the slightest idea of what I have done. fidence in the Leader of the Opposition; but if instead of. speaking in the secrecy of his own organizations he had publicly voiced his disapprobation, he would have won the popularity that the Prime Minister is winning to-day. If he will show to the people of this country that he is prepared to take steps to administer the laws of the Commonwealth without fear or favour, whether the persons concerned are representatives of large organizations or are rich or poor members of the community, the people will respect him. Now that the Government has taken the matter in hand I hope it will not falter. Its honour is at stake. The peace, order, and good government of Australia must be upheld, no matter what the cost. The Government cannot allow any man, woman, or organization to defy the law.

His last words were that the honour of the Government was at stake. With that I entirely agree. find that before this question is settled whatever political honour it may have had will have been lo3t. The honourable member said that we on this side seemed concerned about the defeat of the Government. We are not. We will welcome its defeat, because we regard it as one of the worse governments that this country has ever had. We are, however, concerned that the Government's action will mean disaster to many people in this country. talk a great deal about the effects of strikes, and of the suffering they cause to men, women, and children, but we on this side know more about that than they do. have experienced the struggle of the working classes of the country. mind honourable members opposite who talk so glibly about the loss and suffering due to strikes that unemployment causes ten times more distress. Yet what have they done to relieve the sufferings of the unemployed? done a great deal to create suffering and loss during the last two or three years. They work themselves into a panic whenever a dispute arises, and talk about the suffering of others, yet they do nothing to establish our industries^ or to provide work for the workless. When they speak . in this manner they do so with their tongues in their cheeks. have us believe that they are in earnest, but if they would prove that earnestness they should make an attempt to deal with the unemployed pifoblem. The honourable member for Swan laid stress upon the necessity for constitutional authority, and the upholding of the law. Every bonorable member on this side believes that the law should be upheld; and we want the laws to be so framed that they will be upheld because they are respected by all self-respecting citizens. That is the basis of our objection to the legislation which was passed recently. There is a limit to the endurance of law abiding, self-respecting citizens. This Government has tried the law-abiding people of this community beyond the limit of endurance. If the laws of this country are disobeyed, the responsibility will lie not with the Opposition, but with brings down legislation that would hardly have been tolerated 500 years ago. The honourable member for Swan, together The Government will with the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, emphasized the need for upholding the laws of this country, but I remind them that when I stood in my place, supported by honourable members on this side, and urged that the taxation laws of the country should be put into effect, I did not receive their support. There was documentary evidence in existence at the time-it could be laid on the table of the House within ten minutes-to show that for seven years a Honourable members opposite millionaire otf this country, who i's a strong supporter of the Government, defied this country's laws. I want to refer to what has been the main contention of the Prime We have been in the fight, and Minister, the Attorney-General, and I rethe honourable member for Swan. A bill has been introduced to establish a Commonwealth Peace Force, and the only reason.* for its introduction is that the Labour Government of New South Wales did not accede to the request of I know that they have the Federal Government to permit one of its Supreme Court Judges to sit upon the board to be appointed! to deal with the deportation of Australian citizens. That was the basis of their case for the establishment of a police force and of their attack upon the Labour Govermnent of New South Wales. What has the establishment of a police They would force to do with the appointment of a judge as a member of this tribunal? There is no connection between the two; yet it was used as an excuse for a tilt at another Government in order to try to discredit it in the eyes of the people. I remind those honourable members that the New South Wales Government has come fresh from the elections, with a mandate from the majority of the people of the State, which is more than can be said of the present-Federal Government. Wales Government has not the majority of the people of that State behind it. It was elected by a minority. time in answering that interjection. The facts are on record. We witnessed this",61,Pairs

312,Mr Sctjllin,"I shall not waste myafternoon a display by the Prime Minister of anger, petulance and of hurt pride. Mr L-ISTKR -That'is most unusual for him. Minister may place a veneer over it, hut it is there. The one thing that stood out among his remarks to-day, and impressed itself upon the minds of his hearers, was that this bill has been introduced because of the refusal of the Premier of New South Wales to do the work of the Federal -Grovernment. Every honourable member knows that the Government could have appointed men to do this nasty work without new legislation being introduced, but its introduction has provided the opportunity to try to discredit the New South Wales Labour Government. Let us examine the request of the Federal Government and the answer of the New South Wales Government. The request was that a Supreme Court judge of New South Wales should be appointed to this board. The answer was as courteous as the request. The Premier of New South Wales said that the Federal Government possessed the very machinery to do its own work. I ask the Prime Minister and the members of his Cabinet why they did not use the judges of the High Court instead of asking a State to set aside one of its judges, thus creating a breach between the Federal and State authorities. The Prime Ministei* and the Attorney General should know that one of the most extreme actions that a Federal or a State Government can take is to precipitate a crisis between constituted authorities. Since the beginning of federation in this country there has been but one instance of a similar character-the frenzied act of a frenzied Prime Minister, who, during the frenzied period of war, endeavoured to introduce conscription. There havo been instances in other federations; honourable members may remember one striking example that led to one of the greatest civil wars in history. This Government is prepared to precipitate a crisis of that nature because a State Government will not lend one of the members of its judiciary to do work that the Federal Government would not ask its own High Court judges to do. judges of the High Court should be in a no more rarefied atmosphere than the Supreme Court judges of the States. asked to do the work, and refused. members of the Governmentshould pour the vials of their wrath upon the High Court judges, and not upon the Government of New South Wales. That Government is just as anxious to keep its judges free from the political atmosphere connected with this board as the Federal Government appears to be to keep its High Court judges free. By its refusal to use its own judges the Government is guilty of the very offence for which it blames the Government of New South Wales. The Government, disregarding the possible consequences, has been prepared to precipitate a clash between the biargest State of the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth itself.. The responsibility rests upon the Federal Government. In view of what has taken place, all the talk of the honourable member for Swan as to the supremacy of the nation over the State goes by the board. I believe in the supremacy of the Federation, but while the States have sovereign powers, those sovereign powers should be respected. What is all this trouble about, and what is the necessity to appoint special police, and to cause a clash with, another Government? It is all due to the fact that half-a-dozen boats are held up in the ports of Australia. There have been industrial disputes in Australia before _ which were greater than the one existing to-day. The present dispute is not even an Australian dispute. . Some seamen on British boats, rightly or wrongly, have left their boats, and have asked an Australian union for support in their fight against a reduction of their wages. Will any honourable member contend that even without that reduction in wages those men would be adequately remunerated? I shall not proceed further with that aspect of the question, or refer to the reason for this display of force by the Government. One would think, from the inspired articles in the press, that a civil war was pending. An attempt is being made to create the impression that there is a communistic risThe ing in ^ Australia, and that the Labour party is behind it. Any one with any knowledge of recent events, and possessed of common sense, can see through all this camouflage. There is only one thing",62,Pairs

It sees in its three years of administration a long black record, and its members and supporters are afraid to appeal to the electors. They have, therefore, taken the gambler's chance, and introduced this legislation. From the inspired paragraphs which we read daily in our newspapers, it would appear that four men are supposed to have misled 2,000 British seamen. No move to touch the men who have actually left their work is contemplated, although under the law the British ship-owners could proceed against them, as has been done in New Zealand. not help the Government politically, and it would have no significance at the next election. The British seamen are therefore left alone, and the Government proposes to place its hands upon four Australian citizens who have lived half a lifepeace the Government desired, it could time in this country, and raised families here. These men will be treated as aliens and deported from our shores. While they talk of constitutional methods and a respect for law, and condemn strikes, I say that honourable members opposite are guilty of direct action by their proposal to deport men whom, for the sufficient reason that they cannot prove them guilty of any offence, they dare not bring before any judicially constituted court in Australia. If these men can be proved guilty of an offence, why is it not done? These Australian citizens should be dealt with in Australia, instead of being deported from the country. The Prime Minister says, "" See .what these men have done. Look at the position in which we find ourselves."" What is it? As I said before, there are half a dozen boats tied up. The right honourable gentleman said that he had asked the Le.vder of the Opposition to do something. Opposition says that that is not correct, been assailed, and because of that the and we are told that the Prime Minister Prime Minister rushes to the rescue, and published in the newspapers that he all the forces behind the Government are wished the honourable gentleman to do eager to save trade unionism from these something. This is the course adopted people who are defying it ! Does the by this model of courtesy. He wanted Government expect reasonable people to the Leader of the Opposition to do somebelieve that it is in earnest in making a thing, and instead of asking him personally to do it he makes a statement through the newspapers that he wishes that he would do something. I remind the right honorahle gentleman that when a few weeks ago we were on the verge of a seamen's strike, which eventually did take place, the Leader of -the Opposition asked him to approach the shipowners, promising that he would himself approach the other side, with a view to bringing them together. When the Prime Minister was asked by the representatives of trade unions to intervene at a time when Australia was threatenod with a serious strike, what was his answer? It was ""No."" Then he went Action of that kind would down to a fashionable club and made a speech, in which he said, "" It will be a fight to a finish."" All through the piece it was shown that the Government did not want the good order about which it mouths so much to-day. That would uot suit its book. If it was industrial get it. The little trouble which exists to-day, owing to the action of British seamen, will probably disappear next week or tbe week after, and let me warn the Government, with a full sense of my responsibility as a public man and a member of this House, and with 20 years' knowledge of industrial movement in Australia, that if it dares to put into operation the deportation law against men whose only offence has been to try to assist men who are fighting for better wages, it will precipitate one of the greatest industrial crises that this country has ever known. It will rally round the men it condemns to-day all that is best in the trade union movement in Australia, not because everything those men have done is approved, but on the principle that men should have the right to take part in an industrial struggle without being penalized by deportation from the land in which they have lived for many years.

We know its histhe union and by the Leader of the party tory and record, and the history and record of those behind it, the great forces of the Employers' Federation, Flinderslane, the banking and commercial institutions, and the whole of the tory press that is backing it. We know that none of these forces has ever fought for trade unionism. They have never fought for active and . militant trade unions. Their idea of a trade union is one that will do what the bosses tell it. When we are told by honourable members opposite that they are putting into operation the machinery of government and the forces of the law to punish men because they have committed the crime of defying the trade unions, we say that tliey are talking with their tongues in their cheeks, and we cannot accept their statement. We know that they have been driven by the powers behind them, the moneyed interests outside, who wish to strike a blow at trade unionism in this country and at the whole of the Lahour political organizations. If there is anything manifest to thinking men and women in this country, it is that the present Government is politically doomed. .A Labour Government is coming. It can be seen on the horizon, and the present Government must .do something to divert public attention. It is trying to do so by these means. How much it regrets the opportunity lost when the seamen's strike was on. We know how the Nationalist press criticized the Prime Minister for his great failure. We know how enraged the right honourable gentleman was when Admiral Clarkson signed an agreement with the meu of the Commonwealth Line which had much to do in bringing about a settlement of the seamen's, strike. We know how annoyed he was when the Leader of the Opposition, with other able men in the trade union movement, brought about peace where there had been industrial war. Did honourable members opposite congratulate the Leader of the Opposition or the Disputes Committee of the Trades Hall upon the result of their efforts ? Was there one generous word uttered by the Prime Minister concerning the action of those who saved the country from the turmoil of a serious industrial crisis? Government refused to intervene when asked to do so by the representatives of on this side, and yet' it pretends to-day to be taking action in order to bring about industrial peace. Do honourable members opposite imagine that the transportation for life of three or four men will end this business? No one more deeply regrets the occurrence of industrial disputes than do the members of the Labour party. No one has fought harder or longer to establish machinery for the peaceful settlement of such disputes, and no one has done more for maintenance of industrial peace in Australia than the organized unions of the political Labour movement. When honourable members opposite talk ahout stirring up strife, and ask the Leader of the Opposition to he always on the platform, as leader of the Labour party, denouncing labour leaders, I ask them how many times they have mounted the platform to denounce the stirrers up of strife amongst the employers in this country. When have they tried to restrain employers in order to maintain industrial peace ? We on this side believe in arbitration and the peaceful settlement of industrial disputes, but we know that such disputes will occur from time to time, and we cannot take away from men the right to refuse employment under conditions that are hateful to them. To return to the main question, because time is limited and other members desire to speak, I ask the Government to take warning, and not to set their authority in conflict against the authority of an independent State and its Government of able and sincere men who represent the people. The Commonwealth Government is buying into a very serious conflict, and is doing so because the Premier of New South Wales and his Government refused to lend their judges and officers to do the dirty work which the Federal Government wanted them to do. Many members of the Opposition appear to be very much concerned ahout the future welfare of the Government. They have in their addresses warned the Government against the disaster which will overtake it if it passes this legislation. Not a word. TheI t is interesting to find such concern for the continuance of the Government manifested by the Opposition. A t the same time that honourable members on this side",64,Pairs
318,Mr Latham (Kooyong) _ [9.10],"are told that they are ruining themselves and that the Government will inevitably be driven from office, as the result of legislation of this kind, members of the Opposition charge the Government with introducing this legislation for political purposes. can only be regarded as a charge of inl-i sanity against the Government. matters dealt with in the bill are simple, but the principle which it represents is very important. It is the principle that the laws of the Commonwealth shall be maintained and put into operation and that their enforcement shall not be dependent upon the will of any one or any Government that is not responsible to this Parliament. Thab is a sound principle. ney-General has already said that that is not so, there is nothing wrong about the honourable member's statement. ral has pointed out that, under the Constitution, laws passed by this Parliament are binding upon all people in Australia, and upon all the States of Australia. constitutional. to say something on the question whether a law for the appointment of a. force of police officers is constitutional or not. Laws passed by tins Parliament in pursuance of its powers are binding upon the courts, judges, and people of every State of tbe Commonwealth, notwithstanding anything in the laws of any State. These are the words of covering section 5 of the Constitution. forcing the laws against the people, in the courts, but there are no means of compelling the States to carry out duties which are constitutional rather than legal. Accordingly if a State is not prepared to itself obey and assist in enforcing the paramount laws of Australia, that is to say, laws made by this Parliament, then it is necessary for this Parliament, in the discharge of its responsibility to the people of Australia, to provide means for the enforcement and execution of its laws. If the States refuse to do the work, then this Parliament must take the necessary steps to have it done. As the Attorney-General has pointed out. it is intolerable that the enforcement of any laws of this Parliament should be dependent upon the will of any one or more States. As the honourable gentleman has already shown, one State might say that a particular law is repugnant to it , and it will not therefore enforce it within its territory. Another State might object That, in the circumstances, to some other Commonwealth law, and if such a condition of affairs were perThe mitted to arise and continue, the administration of the law would be impossible. I should have thought that, on the principle of the maintenance and execution of the laws of the Commonwealth, all members of this House would be at one. It is true that we have varying opinions of different laws of the Commonwealth. I think some of them are bad laws. Other honourable members regard other laws of the Commonwealth as bad laws; but it is a principle of our constitutional existence that all Commonwealth laws, because they are Commonwealth laws, shall be obeyed and enforced. The alternative to the enforcement of Commonwealth laws is that the Commonwealth, instead of being a governing authority, should become a sort of advisory body to the States. It would have to go cap in hand to the States and say, "" Are yon prepared to put into force within your boundaries this law which the Parliament of Australia has passed?"" That is an impossible position., When a law has been passed hy this Parliament, it is the law of Australia, whether it is approved by any State Government or not. Up to the stage of the passing of a law, it is a question, of politics, but after a law has been enacted it is then a question There are means of enof the maintenance of government. And all parties, those at present in power and any party that may come into power in the future, should be united in insisting upon the enforcement of the laws made by this Parliament.

That argument is too ridiculous to be seriously defended. The Premier of New South Wales has declared that there is a doubt concerning the validity of that particular act. have had too much experience to guarantee the validity of any act unti l the High Court has positively pronounced to that effect. sults accrue from litigation, and a provision which has long stood unchallenged is declared to be unconstitutional. I have had personal experience of judicial decisions which, to say the least, were unexpected. Accordingly, one can do no more than express his own opinion, the worth of which depends upon his experience, the amount of consideration he has given to the subject, and the material at his disposal. It happens that in regard to the constitutional question now under discussion, quite a lot of material is available. popularly known as "" the Irish envoys' case,"" the validity of section 8A of the Immigration Restriction Act was challenged. That section provided that persons not born in Aiistralia, but arriving in Australia, might within three years of their arrival be deported if they did certain things, and the particular disqualifying circumstances alleged in the .Irish envoys' case was that certain persons had "" advocated the overthrow by Therefore, the State's duty force or violence of the established goin these cases constitutional vernment of the Commonwealth or of any State."" The Irish envoys were brought before a board, on whose recommendation the Minister signed an order its laws. The amending I m for their deportation. The validity of the act was challenged on various grounds, and one of them was that it purported to authorize the deportaThe tion of British subjects, which the Irish envoys undoubtedly were. But the court overruled the objection, and held that the self-governing attributes of any Tlie British Dominions included the right to exclude from their territories British subjects of other communities of the Empire. I quote from Volume 32 of the Commonwealth Law Reports, page 531To this extent the British subject's right to enter freely into any part of the King's Dominions may bo modified by statute law. It is not, and cannot be, disputed that the right Honourable unrestricted at common law of all British subjects wherever born outside Australia to enter the Commonwealtli is made subject to the provisions of the act. Where their physical or moral conditions would constitute them a public peril they aTe excluded, no allowance being made for their common nationality. Therefore, the amending Immigration I Act, which has been discussed to-day, is not invalid, by reason of the fact that it authorizes the deportation of British subjects. Buti t has been said that the Sometimes Unexpected reGovernment cannot, under legislation relating to immigration, deport a person who has'settled in Australia and made his home here, even though' that person was uot Australian-born. Upon that point Mr Justice Isaacs was very clear and definiteExcept in the case of a person Australian-born, who having abandoned this country as his home, is re-admitted and so restored to his original status, an ""immigrant""-that is, a person whose original home was elsewhere, and who comes into this country for any purpose-remain s an "" immigrant"" as long as he is in Australia. As to him, while in Australia the rule holds "" pnce an immigrant, alNot long ago, in what is ways an immigrant,"" . and the parliamentary power is never abandoned, and cannot be abandoned. In the judgment in this case four judges of the H i gh Court concurred. It will be seen, therefore, that the H i g h Court has already held that if a person who was not born in Australia enters Australia as an immigrant, the Australian Parliament can legislate for his deportation by reference to either his physical or moral quali-: ties. I hope that that statement meets the objections which have been raised in this debate to the validity of the amending Immigration Act. In regard to the bill now before the House, the same questions have arisen iu America as are now arising here in regard to the execution of the Pederal law. It was argued ih America that the Federal legislature could only pass laws and leave to the States the responsibility of putting them in operation, and that Congress had no power to authorize persons to use physical force for the purpose of giving effect to its laws. Upon that point the Supreme Court of the United States of America in a well known case heldWe hold it to be an incontrovertible principle view, to raise an objection to such an that the Government of the United States of admirable course, whatever I may think America may, by means of physical foree. of it politically. I should not approve of exercised tlirougli its official agents, execute on every foot of American soil the powers and such action from a political point of view. functions that belong to it. Similarly, the Government of the Commonwealth is entitled, and, indeed, bound to execute upon every foot of Australian soil all powers and functions that belong to it. Therefore, from a constitutional point of view, there can be no objection to this legislation. wealth enforce its laws without passing special legislation? be appointed to any office which does not exist, it is necessary to create that office, and provide money for it in the regular manner. If the Government had attempted to appoint, "" of f its ""own bat,"" as it were, without consulting this Parliament, a police force, the objections of honourable members opposite would have been even more vigorous than they have heen to-day. Some of them have asked, "" Why not appoint a Federal judge to the board ""? body in the sense of exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth. Federal judges are appointed for the purpose of exercising that judicial power, which the Constitution declares is vested in the High Court, and in such judges as are appointed by the Commonwealth, and in such courts as are invested with Federal jurisdiction. The amending Immigration Act requires that one member of the board shall be a person of past or present judicial experience. Judges of the High. Court should be restricted to their constitutional functions in exercising the judicial powers of the Commonwealth, and in the immigration case from which I have quoted, the High Court held that the board before whom the Irish envoys appeared, was not exercising any judicial power of the Oommonwealth. That is a first and sufficient answer to the suggestion that a judge of the High Court could have been appointed to that board. It has been stated in the House by the Leader of the Opposition that any proceedings taken because of a recommendation of this board would be challenged at every stage, and that every possible legal objection would be raised. It is not for me, from a professional point of Mr O'KEEFE -The honourable member may have to defend these men. with that duty I should do my best for them. If the exercise of the power were challenged, it would be for the High Court to determine the matter. There are various sound reasons for not seeking to place a member of the High Court bench upon this board. The board only makes a recommendation, and it is for the Minister tb act upon it if he thinks fit. The lin), speaking of some Australian residents who have very obviously been engaged in fomenting shipping trouble, said that they were men whose only offence was that they were trying to get better conditions for the workers.

If any persons are summoned before this board, nothing further can be done unless the board recommends their deportation upon the ground, in substance, that they are a danger to Australia. There is no judgment in advance at all. The board considers the evidence and makes a recommendation, and then the Minister has the responsibility of taking action. There is no judgment in advance in this case, any more than in any case where men are served with a summons. I ask honourable members to consider the present position. Here we have a considerable number of British ships held up in Australian ports. stopped, while foreign vessels are getting the freight. The Leader of the Opposition, for some reason, which he has not condescended to put before the House, claims that he had something to do with the settlement of the last shipping strike. shipping industry. If seamen strike One is always willing to learn; but I happen to know something, in common with other citizens of this country, about the settlement of the last strike. We know that many conferences were held in Melbourne between the shipowners and the representatives of the seamen, and that the settlement was worked out at those conferences. tiations that led up to the conferences? as the Leader of the Opposition well knows, to lay down any general rule for the settlement of industrial disputes. Sometimes it is a very good thing for politicians, and even for statesmen like the Prime Minister, to keep aloof from them. The settlement of the dispute was reached at conferences between the employers and the seamen, and what hastened the settlement was the fact that the Government had shown in this House that it was determined to govern the country. This produced a profound change in the psychology of the situation, because it was recognized that the people of Australia as a whole were behind the action of the Government. It was because of that change in the atmosphere, and probably because the matter was left in the hands of the parties themselves, and others were kept out of it, that there was a settlement. This particular dispute when examined is very simple. The British seaman are objecting Jo a reduction of their wages. That is very natural. We sympathize with any one whose wages are being reduced. But it is necessary to consider the circumstances of the case. These men before they left England on their voyage to. Australia had signed articles containing a clause providing for the adjustment of pay. Any one who is familiar at all with shipping practice knows that the articles are read over by the shipping master or an equivalent officer, and explained and expounded to the seamen. It is also known that some of these seamen left England British trade has been after the date for the reduction in wages had been arranged. The reduction was made in pursuance of the terms of their own agreement by a National Maritime Board representing the unions as well as the employers engaged in the when a reduction is being made in accordance with their own signed word, they break their word and dishonour their own agreement It is rather singular that men who had signed that agreement left England without striking. Those who sailed recently knew that the reduction was to take place, and thc date of it. Yet they did not strike. Many of the vessels en route called at ports such as Aden and Colombo, and no strike occurred there. The vessels called at Melbourne, and there was no strike there, although the seamen knew of the reduction. Then a strike occurred in Sydney. Where did the cause operate that brought about that strike if not at Sydney? It was an Australian cause, and we know perfectly well what it was. There are some persons here who* thought the opportunity a good one for bringing about trouble for reasons of their own. Of course, every one understands the theory: It is that it is not a good thing to have industrial peace; that the proper thing is to have constantand continual unrest, commotion, and disturbance in order that the "" wage slaves "" may become properly discontented, and always hear the rattling of their chains.",68,Pairs

334,Mr Latham,"It is quite impossible,That is the deliberate policy of some persons in Australia. It is not a policy embodied in the legislation of the Commonwealth. Government is justified in bringing down legislation to defeat. The result of holding up British ships is that the transport of all kinds of produce is suspended. This is really an attack upon Atistralians of all classes. Our wool and other produce cannot be shipped overseas. These hold-ups greatly reduce the possibility of that reduction in freights which so many Australians} and particularly those engaged in primary industries, desire, because the suspension of shipping means a very serious loss to the shipowners. This hold-up must fail. These poor, misguided men cannot reap any advantage from their action, because they are party to a world's agreement, which will not be upset by trouble in this corner of the world. They have been misguided and misled to their own detriment. going to foreign ships, on which the wages paid are less than those on British ships. Unemployment is thus being caused, not only among the 2,000 odd British seamen who are left here and hardly able to get a meal, but also among our own people if the strike continues. It is the duty of the Government to protect all classes of the community, because all are equally interested in a contingency such as this. It is rather remarkable that we hear uo condemnation of this behaviour from the Opposition. We hear only aimless generalities, such as the statement that the Labour movement stands for arbitration and for constitutional means of settling disputes. We never hear any definite and personal statement directed at the individuals who are responsible for these unconstitutional stoppages.

All laws should be enforced thoroughly and automatically, apart from and not with regard to politics. It is only the rigid enforcement of law that brings Parliament face to face with realities.

I am iu favour of the enforcement of the It is a policy which the Jaws of the Commonwealth, whether they are laws of which I approve or not. If I do not approve of them. I shall try to get them altered or repealed hy constitutional means, but I shall not say in the meantime that, because I do not approve of them, I shall not obey them. I recognize that along that path lie anarchy and chaos. The position in Australia to-day is that a few men, by misleading others, are controlling effectively many of the activities of the Commonwealth. They are men who cannot get into any Parliament in Australia. They cannot obtain a seat in a single House, Federal or State, and yet they arrogate to themselves, above this Parliament, the right to determine in effect the industrial and political policy of Australia. A small minority such as that should not be allowed to think that they have that In the meantime, the trade is power. I approve of this bill, and 1. am. not at all inclined to diminish my approval of it because honourable members opposite do not appear to like it. Last year memhers of the Opposition were very cheerful because they thought they saw political victory within their grasp, but with legislation such as this in view they see that victory slipping from them. At the present time, although they profess so frequently to speak in the name of the people, forgetting that they are only a minority in this House, they fear, for political reasons, the result of legislation such as this. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has charged the Government with bringing this bill in for political reasons. That means that, in their hearts, they know that the majority of the people of Australia support the action of the Government. It is very refreshing for me to rise in this House to address myself to a question I have a with a sense of moderate security, and the feeling that there is a reasonable prospect of the motion ""That the question be now put"" not being so put within, say, ten seconds after I have commenced my address.

However, for the moment I take him at his own estimate, and remark that he has just been pouring out a not very palatable stirabout of law and politics, mixed unconvincingly together, half of which is intended to tickle the ears of the groundlings who support him on the floor of the House, the other half being submitted as good law. member for Yarra on the ground that that gentleman had complained that the existing laws of the Commonwealth were not put into operation, and went on elaborately to argue that the present proposal represents an attempt to give effect to a Commonwealth law. Now the argument of the honourable member for Yarra still stands. It is a simple statement to this effect: that there being laws on the statute-book, to deal with malefactors in this country--if there are any -thos e malefactors should be dealt with in the courts of this country according to the established practice and procedure, and not be made the puppets of an indigent political party. The honourable member for Kooyong has favoured us with an. elaborate disquisition on the law as decided by the High Court, and I give him credit for being an authority on those matters when his views are not vitiated by party interests, or perhaps modified by the fact that in this House his brief is not marked so generously as it would be in another place. The honourable member says that, in the, matter known as the Irish envoys case, it was decided by the High Court /that ihe Commonwealth Parliament had ample power to make laws for the deportation of persons such as those. gentleman seems to draw no distinction between a decision of the High Court as to what we have power to do, and what as political representatives of the people it is right or proper that we should do in Parliament. which should be the more properly and clearly understood, having regard to the fact that we are a Parliament and not a High Court. I come now to consider this bill. It deals with the appointment of a police force. member for Moreton has remarked, it is called a peace force. If it was unnecessary to write across this measure the legend ""Evident hypocrisy "" it was because, instead of writing that upon it, the Government has chosen to call it , "" A bill to create a peace force."" Honourable members will recollect the history of the creation of a police force by the Commonwealth Government. It ' originated in a well-directed egg thrown at Warwick, He attacked the honourable in Queensland. It is not for me to say that the projecting of that missile was either according to law or calculated to uphold *the good government of this country. unsound. the honourable member for Forrest, is distinctly good. We know, at all events, that that was the point of time at which the police force originated. Born as it was in tragedy, and cradled afterwards in derisive laughter, it eventually went to its doom, and there was no one to drop so much as one tear upon its grave to fertilize the green grass growing thereon. That was, we hoped and believed, the end of the Commonwealth Police Force. After that there remained not policemen; not even peace officers. But whenever one called attention to the fact that there were certain suspicious sums set aside in the Estimates for the payment of mysterious officers, he was met with the stereotyped explanation that these were certain officers charged with duties of investigation under the.Customs Act. There was none so mean' on any side of this House as to do homage to the lately departed police force of the Commonwealth. We hoped, The .honourable and some of us even prayed, that we had seen the last of it, but it is not to be so. Now,Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill arises out of the shipping troublea strike. Some few months ago there was acute trouble on the water-front.

While the distinguished right honourable gentleman was threatening, understood the situation much better than While the right honourable man was making himself a partisan, others were pointing out that industrial troubles of that kind were not to be settled by force, and not to be elided by a display of partisanship. After these negotiations had proceeded for some time, the right honourable gentleman, pricked on as usual by his press supporters, and the moneyed influences outside that keep him where he is, found it necessary to make a public announcement. He made it known to his press friends that the conference had gone on long enough, and thab he was there to guard the interests of the public, in whose interests he had done nothing and was incapable of doing anything. done nothing, and being incapable of doing anything, others eventually brought the strike to an end, and on terms, let me say, that were not altogether disadvantageous to the strikers. matters upon which they had insisted were conceded to them, and they came out of this difference with their colours flying and their honour untarnished, establishing beyond all doubt that there was no law of the Commonwealth or a State to compel men to work under conditions or rates of pay that were unacceptable to them. When the right honourable gentleman addressed bis letter of protest to the representatives of the seamen, on the one hand, and to Mr Holloway, the representative of the disputes committee on the other hand, against the delay, he got what he deserved-a snub. Each of these gentlemen said, '' We came to you and offered to accept you as a mediator at the beginning. You refused, and showed yourself a partisan. We will settle this matter in our own time."" That was the Prime Minister's part in the shipping trouble of that time. The only Mr Brennan. other part he played was on that memorable occasion when some of us were proposing to proceed down Hobson's Bay to meet the American Fleet. It was rather unkind of the right honorahle gentleman, who had an inkling of what was likely Othera to happen, to remain closeted in his office, The Leader fearing to go down to the ship that was to take us and board her, because he knew that, having insulted the seamen, they would not convey him. Others, howothers who ever, ran the risk. The right honourable gentleman had said, "" Our he did were conciliating. threat of legislation put an end to job gentlecontrol,"" but that was an example of job control he could neither anticipate nor cure. I express no judgment on the merits of that dispute, but I point out that he emerged from it with a very much damaged reputation as a leader and legislator. The present dispute originated in a strike in England, not in Australia. Ships were held up in England before they were held up in Australia, and they are still being held up in England. While British seamen now in Australia were on the water, their wages were reduced from the munificent sum of £10 to £9 a month, and when they reached Australian ports, in protest against this reduction, they did the most natural thing The Prime Minister, having in the world-the y conferred with their brother members of the Australian Seamen's Union, they held meetings, and they unanimously, in their thousands, without any coercion or direction from any AusImportant tralian seamen's representatives, came to a certain decision. We are not for the moment concerned with the merits of the dispute, although the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) would draw us into a discussion of them. But we are concerned with the Commonwealth laws relating to deportation, with which this bill deals. We are not concerned with an involved dispute regarding wages; that is an industrial matter, and can safely be left to the representatives of industrialists to deal with in their own way, and in their own time. This reduction, then, of £10 to £9, is the basis of the national legislation of this Government! The inspiring slogan of this great Australiau party is that it stands for law and order against the men who protest against their wages being reduced from And they did so. £10 to £9 a month. This is done, moreover, at a time Avhen, according to the figures on the subject, the value of the ships belonging to the ship-owners concerned, has increased from £170,000,000 to £500,000.000, and after profits as large as the last-named figure have been earned by the companies during the war period. We all know, of course, that this is a political move. point that out. honourable gentlemen opposite, tottering, as they are, upon their last legs, feeling their props falling from them one by one, and seeing the writing on the wall in every State of the Oommonwealth, should shake at the knees: nor do I marvel that they should recognize the well-known principle that self-preservation is the first law of nature. When, as at present, there is a little local strike in Sydney, when a' certain number of British ships are tied up, when a certain limited number of British seamen are out of work, and when, our Australian coastal and other shipping services are running unhindered and unimpaired, and while o there is no apparent danger of the strike extending, it is pandering a little too much to political necessity to propose, by this measure, to throw the whole of the Commonwealth into chaos, disorder, and disaster. That is what the bill means, and supporters of the Government know it. well that, although there is a difference of opinion on the merits of tins strike, that although there is said to be a difference among members of the Seamen's Union in Great Britain and Australia on the merits of the question, there is no difference in the trade union movement or the Labour political movement of this country, on the iniquitous proposal to snatch from this country men who are carrying on industrial propaganda on behalf of their own class. They know that we are united on that matter. They complain about our silence on the industrial conflict, but they will find that there will be no silence on this side of the House, or in the industrial world in Australia, on the question of deporting industrial leaders for industrial agitation or advocacy. They will find, if they try to do this thing, that they have bitten off more than they can chew. They will find that we will speak, not only in this House, but also on the platforms outside this House. I shall be one to call upon the Labour Premiers of the States, so far as my voice is of any consequence to them, t.o encourage them as rulers and Australians to use every ounce of power they have within the Constitution of the Commonwealth and its laws to frustrate this iniquitous proposal. The right honourable the Leader of the Government I am not the first to ' spoke of "" the sacred principles of trade I do not wonder that unionism."" He is the gentleman who emerged from Flinders-lane recently with his friends and colleagues grappling with each other for the spoils of the 3tolen woollen mills and other Commonwealth property which they had appropriated, things which were the legitimate property of the people of this country. Having come here, he talks to us of "" the sacred principles of trade unionism."" And why is the principle sacred ? It is sacred because the suggestion is that the British Seamen's Union consented to a reduction of the wages of these men. and that a section of the union has revolted against that reduction. Suppose the position had been reversed, ancl that the men who have broken away from their union had been ready to "" scab"" on the majority for a lower wage, would they not be proclaimed, by members opposite, as heroes and men of independent thought and action ? Would the Government not then be ready to appoint Commonwealth police They also know very officers to protect the "" scabs "" and assist them in undercutting their fellow unionists? The answer can only be that history tells us what they would have done in those circumstances. They have done it a score of times, but "" the sacred principle of trade unionism "" must be upheld when it involves the cutting down of wages from the mangy scale of £10 a month to £9 a month for Australiansfor these men are Australians when they work in Australian waters-or , at least, they deserve to be treated as such. from the other side. about it.

This is entirely a British matter, involving Lord Inchcape, and not only "" the sacred principles of trade unionism,""' but also the sacred principles of imperialism, are wound up in it.

The decadent remnant opposite is where it is by virtue of a trick, and a compromise with the traitors to their movement who support them. That is the difference between the Labour Governments of the States and the Government in this Parliament. The Attorney General this afternoon, when discussing the legal position, was largely in conflict I am with the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham). I kenow that it is characteristic of legal gentlemen to be in « conflict; it is for that reason that I so confidently disagree with both of theim The Attorney-General was asked why a High Court judge was not asked to officiate in this matter. He replied, in effect, that it was considered impolitic to ask a High Court judge to act, because the judges of that Court have to adjudicate on matters between the Commonwealth and the States, and it was considered inadvisable to place them in the invidious position of appearing to exhibit partisanship on behalf of fhe Commonwealtli. Attorney-General said that. lo quote his remarks word for word. In view of the Attorney-General's remarks, it is a wonder that the High Court judges are not limited to adjudicate upon such local matters as insulting words and common assaults, which are dealt with in the At this police courts. Surely the Attorney General has forgotten that one of the duties reserved exclusively for High Court judges is that of adjudicating upon matters affecting constitutionality as between the'States and the Commonwealth.

Federation would have been impossible in operation if the States had not sympathetically co-operated with their machinery, their courts, and their omcers in the administration of Commonwealth affairs. That much is granted. It is worth nothing that in the 25 years of Commonwealth history there has heen but one case-and that in war time-of serious conflict between the Commonwealth and the States. ahsence of conflict has been due to the nature of the legislation passed hy the Commonwealth, and to a recognition of its possible effect upon the States. The States are sovereign bodies in the same way that the Commonwealth is, and it is an act of indecency for the Commonwealth Government to pass a measure of an industrial nature which runs counter to the views of the Governments of the States which have so recently been endorsed by the electors. Government to the Government of New South Wales was that the latter, in order to give effect to Commonwealth laws within the limits of that State, should run counter to the mandate recently given to it by the people. Government rightly refused to comply with the request. Mr Lang agreed that the Commonwealth laws should be enforced, and that the Commonwealth itself should enforce them. What, after all, is the purpose for which these police are to be appointed? pose are the bodies to be snatched? This afternoon the Attorney-General read again those sections, of the act recently passed which set out the offences for which the bodies of men may be snatched. I repeat what I have said before in this House, that any member of a trade union who, since the proclamation that a serious industrial disturbance exists in Australia, attends a meeting of his union, and votes either with the majority or the minority, renders himself liable to deportation under the terms of that iniquitous act. That being the case, to expect the I agree Labour Government of New South Wales to put that act into effect is an affront to the intelligence of the people of this country, as well as to the Government to which the request was addressed. The Attorney-General said that the powers of the Commonwealth are clear and definite. If that be so, the Commonwealth Government should exercise those powers, and not ask the States to do its "" d i r t y work."" The Premier of New South Wales pointed .out that the Commonwealth already possesses all the necessary powers, and suggested that the Commonwealth should exercise those powers if it desired that That they be exercised. It is my hope that no taint of having been a party to the deportation of any Australian citizen shall ever attach to a Labour Government in Australia. The act recently passed to provide for the deportation of Australian citizens has rightly been described as an iniquitous law. No doubt this bill will be passed. member for Fawkner says "" Hear^ hear."" The request of the Federal Evidently he is like the boy who whistles to keep his courage up. He knows that the Prime Minister is shaking at the knees, and that, after every step taken, the members of the Government offer up a devout prayer that the strike will be The State over before the forces behind them compel them to arrest any man. They are between the devil and the deep sea, the devil pressing at the rear, the deep sea the consequence of their deporting any man from this country, in front. I sympathize with the Government in that regard, and realize the reason for the various steps taken in connection with this bill having been taken so deliberately. First, there was the proclamation of' a condition of unrest. On the second day we were informed that the SoHcitorGeneral had gone to New South Wales, and had conferred with some one there.

We have not yet reached the seventh day, on which we should rest. this afternoon that I hoped that if there had been any men in this country who wanted to do unpleasant work in the police force, they had already accepted the invitation of the Victorian Government to supplant that splendid body of police strikers who were driven from their employment by stupidity such as that which characterizes the members of this Government to-day. No doxibt some men will become members of this new police force, not as investigators, but as peace officers clad in white raiment, with wands in their hands and halos around their heads, crying, ""Blessed be peace."" Some day, no doubt, the strike will end; no one will have been deported, but the names of the members of this Government will go down to posterity as the liberators of an oppressed people. [10.28] I do not know the reason for the excitement of honourable members opposite at my rising. I want to discuss this matter calmly. Honourable memhers opposite are making a great fuss about a little piece of legislation which is being put through this House to enable the Government to do something to prevent the disorganization of trade and oC the essential services in Australia, and to put an end to those disturbances, strikes, and other upheavals which of late have been so prevalent. one after the other, and lash themselves into a fury over this legislation, but I do not think that their fury is genuine. Nord o ' I think that the advice which they offer to honourable members on this side is genuine. If they believed that the carrying into effect of this legislation would mean the downfall of the Government, they would encourage the Government to proceed until it ran headlong to destruction. But honourable members say. "" Don't do this, because to do it will ruin you."" I do not think that we are quite so green' as to believe that. If I had the authority I would have done this long ago. I think this legislation has been too long delayed. The gentlemen who are causing industrial trouble in Australia should go to other countries, where they would meet with congenial companionship. That is where they ought to be. They have no proper place in this free land of Australia. It is not I said Australian workmen who are to blame for what has taken place, but these agitators who are determined to create strife, wherever they are. They are nothing but communists, and disturbance is their stock in trade. They desire to keep the country in a state of continual industrial ferment. I know what they are. I have had any amount of experience of them. I have come in contact with them in the shearing shed. Eor twenty-five years I was over a shearing shed, and I know the wiles, cunning and methods adopted by these agitators who go amongst peaceful men and bring about disturbances. One might have the best lot of unionists to be found, pay them full award rates, give them the best food procurable and good housing accommodation, and everything would be going on swimmingly in a. manner satisfactory to the men and the boss, and then one afternoon a fellow would come pedalling a bicycle along, and that is the end of the satisfaction and contentment. Every one becomes surly, grumbling and threatening to strike; the meat is too fat or too poor, it is objected to either way: and there are not sufficient plums in the pudding. That is the condition of affairs which is being brought about on a larger scale by the' gentlemen who have been referred to in this discussion. gentlemen tell us who they are ? I want to know whether this is a personal Honourable members rise matter. name of Blakeley is not mentioned.

We know that if honourable members opposite had the appointment of such a board, they would see that there was no Nationalist upon it, and would appoint only their own strong supporters. We have had a very stirring speech from the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin). him on his very lucid address. But he went a little too far, because he threatened honourable members on this side with dire consequences if this legislation were put.into force. Let me tell the honourable member for Yarra and other honourable members opposite that their threats will not carry the slightest weight with the Government, or the party on this side. Threats need not be confined to one side of the House, and I say that honourable members opposite had tetter keep their threats to themselves. I warn them that if they persist in bringing about the great industrial upheaval to which they refer, as they will do by supporting these bolsheviks and communists, they must put up with the consequences. It is not for them to threaten us; it is for us to say that the party responsible for bringing about an industrial upheaval-and we are threatened with the greatest that this country has ever known-mus t accept responsibility for it . We have had a veiled threat of civil war in Australia; but I have too much respect for the intelligence of the people of Australia to think that anything of the kind will occur. They are too prosperous to countenance anything that savours of revolution. We are absolutely safe in this country from anything of the kind, because our people are too prosperous and have been too well governed. Batman( Mr Brennan) treated us to a fine pantomimic display. He delivered a very fiery oration, and was at times overcome by his sentiments. His voice, like his arguments, gave out at the finish. He told us that British sailors in Australia have struck because of a reduction in their wages. We deplore that such a reduction should have been considered necessary, but we know how it was brought about. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) gave a very In the Old Country the British Maritime Commission, composed of representatives of the sailors and the ship-owners, came to an agreement that when there was depression in the shipping industry wages should come down, and when it was flourishing they should go up. Last year the wages of the seamen were increased by £1 per month; hut honourable members opposite have said nothing about that. I compliment Their sliding scale slides only one way. They talk of give and take, but with them it is all take and no give. We have been told that these British sailors, being dissatisfied with their wages, held meetings and went out on strike. We were not told by honorahle members opposite that the men who are the centre of speculation at the present time decoyed these unfortunate British sailors from their jobs. We are told that the British sailors acted on their own initiative at a meeting in Sydney, but I have the best information that they did nothing of the sort. They acted at the instance of the agitators, one of whom took the chair for them and put everything into their mouths. We know that the British sailors did not want to strike. There are thousands of men in Australia who have uo time for Walsh and Johannsen, and I undertake to say that if these men are deported many of these people will say, "" Thank God the cows are gone."" We have had threats from members of the Opposition, and I now give them warning that if they persist and bring, about a great industrial upheaval the primary producers will come down from the country in their thousands and take a hand in the business. We have had some experience of this before, especially in New South Wales. I tell honourable members opposite that if they persist in backing up this trouble-making, and bring about The honourable member for a great industrial disturbance, they will have to reckon with the country boys, .the cowpunchers, the wool-growers, the sleeper getters, the boys from Snowy River, who will take means to protect themselves.

Instead of honourable members opposite warning me, I now warn them, that they will get it well and truly, fair in the neck. honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat is the man tie country needs. The man at the head of the Government is the wrong man for the position. Here we have the strong-armed, two-fisted man, the man who can solve the problem. It is unfortunate that he is not a member of the Government; but he was pushed out of it. The honorahle member has talked of cows, and I would remind him that I have heard talk of cows before. One gentleman talked of "" cow cockies,"" and ruined Mr Massy Greene politically by doing so. I remember another story of cows, when the Prime Minister spoke of the members of his party as the salt of the earth, and was reminded by Senator Gardiner that the "" cows outside were waiting to lick them."" The honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie) has referred to the good old times. We remember the good old times when employers could increase the hours of work of their employees as much as they pleased, and give them as little as they thought fit, when they could take a motherless child and make him work for 2s. 6d. per week and then take the money back in fines. We remember the time when the agitators who tried to put a stop to that kind of thing were harried from court to court until a venal jury could be got to convict them. were the times for which the honourable member yearns, but, unfortunately for him, those clays have gone for ever. It is said that some British seamen are dissatisfied with their conditions, but the trouble is not confined to Australia; it is found in New Zealand, and in the ports of England. It is quite true that the seamen's organization in Great Britain agreed to certain things, but it is also true that a very large number of British seamen are not satisfied with the conditions agreed to. Does the British Government come forward and propose a policy of deportation against dissatisfied seamen in London and Liverpool! Hasi t set about the creation of machinery such as this Government has evolved and threatened to put into operation? It has not. The seamen in Canada also are out on strike, and the officials of the British Seamen's Union are hurrying across the Atlantic to ask the men to return to work. In South Africa, too, the men have left British ships, and at Durban officials went aboard the vessels and vainly endeavoured to induce the seamen to go to sea. munist talking. drought, the overflow of the rivers, excessive rains-for everything that happens on this earth the communists are responsible. This strike has extended to British ships in every part of the Empire; the men are breaking away from their union and refusing to accept lower wages and worse conditions, but nowhere outside Australia-no t even in Great Britain-ha s the Government made an effort towards coercion as the Commonwealth Government is doing. Why is it adopting that course? The reason has been clearly demonstrated; it is hot that the emergency is greater in Australia than in other parts of the Empire, but that the Government is exploiting the situation for political purposes. It has .no other justification for its action. We have been told that the Government of New South Wales was asked to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in the enforcement of the deportation laws. In another emergency not long ago, when the Commonwealth wanted the services of a judge, it did not seek one from the Those Government of Victoriai n whose State the case would have to be tried, because that. State was at that time under the control of a Labour Government; it sought a judge from New South Wales, the one State in which Labour was not then in power. In the present trouble the Government -has reversed the process. If it had been sincere and consistent it would have applied to Victoria for the services of a judge, but that course would not have suited its purpose.

361,Mr Anstey,"Quite right For the Federal Government would select the other two, knowing full well what the verdict of the board would be, and then it would be able to implicate the State Government and make it share the responsibility and opprobrium for the trouble that would ensue. The legislation that is before us can bring no benefit to this Government, and it cannot in any way affect the men who have gone out on strike. Those men deliberately left their ships in New South Wales ports in the belief that they could force the overseas owners to meet their demands. The ship-, owners have refused to do so. It is inevitable that in such circumstances the men should seek help, and it has been accorded them. Now the Commonwealth Government, in order to serve the political ends of the Nationalist and Country parties, proposes to deport two or three men. But if it does not act quickly it will be too late; the trouble will be ended. It is easy to see that this bill is merely a political weapon forged by the Government for its own purposes. the last shipping strike in which Australian vessels and seamen were involved, the Prime Minister refused to intervene or to collaborate with the Leader of the Opposition and responsible trade unionists to bring about a settlement. He appeared at a function in this city and declared that there was to be "" a fight to a finish."" reported to Parliament that the GovernApparently he believed that the aggravation of discord would assist him in his political campaign, but that effort failed miserably; the strike was settled in spite of the Government. Now Ministers are again seeking to gaiu a political advantage from the striking, not of. citizens of this country, but of the employees on ships from abroad that are visiting our ports. or more unscrupulous scheme could be concocted by a Government. But if action is not taken promptly the trouble will be settled, and in a day or two the seamen will have returned to their ships-no t because of any threat by the Government, but because of other circumstances, and among them the efforts which are being made by members of the Labour party to restore peace. Proof of the anxiety of honourable members opposite, and of the press which supports them, to promote a fight is contained in the leading article in the Herald to-night. That journal wants to -[81] know what the members of the Labour party are doing. It says they are acting in secret. What for? To stop the strike! Asi f that were a crime. If we are doing that either openly or secretly, we are making a contribution to the peace, order, and good government of this country; but because we are acting quietly and secretly, without the beating of drums or the waving of flags, or shouting our loyalty, but quietly, and in a business-like way, we are said to be the enemies of our country. We are told that it is the duty of the Labour party to link itself up with the Government, not for the purpose of settling the strike, hut in order to keep the strike going by trying to coerce its leaders. That is the desire of the daily press. The Labour party, however, is the judge of its own conduct; it is not to toe driven into any course of action. The Leader of the Government does not accept the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, or frame his policy In according to suggestions from industrial organizations. On the contrary, when the trade unions suggested a policy of mediation, which would promote industrial peace, he refused to act, because he did not desire peace. Now, he and the press expect this party to follow at his heels. Last year the Auditor-General ment had expended £250,000 without the sanction of the legislature. But he said that he had no power to criticize such expenditure,' because the Treasurer had authority to expend money as he pleased within the limit of the Treasurer's Advance. From the same source the Government could, if it were really in earnest in the proposal under consideraNo bolder tion, obtain funds for building up a Commonwealth police force, and putting the law into operation. If . it could legally take £250,000 from the Treasurer's Advance for another purpose, it could similarly appropriate £500, or £1,000, or £2,000, in order to bring a police force into being. But the Government is not so anxious as it pretends to ' be to give effect to this proposal; it is not too sure of the ground upon whichi t is treading. Had the honourable member for Warringah been Prime Minister, he would have rushed in like a bull, regardless of whether or not he made a mess of things. He would have shown no hesitation, or weakness, or vacillation. He would have simply said, "" This is the law. I intend to secure peace."" If need be, he would have butted in like Buck Fanshawe, with a brick in one hand and a spanner in the other. He would not have waited for the trouble to develop;, he is the sort of general who would settle the war before the enemy had time to put up his hands. SoI can imagine him saying, ""These men are to be deported, and we must have a police force. money is in the Treasury. Here are your uniforms, swords, pistols, shields, and bucklers. Now, go out and swat these fellows."" for industry to be paralysed and primary products io pile up on the wharfs. cious days whilst the country was suffering. He would have declared the existence of anindustrial disturbance which threatened the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, and would have' rushed in to settle the emergency, and so prevent the dangers that were threatening him and the country. With all the power aud authority of the Government behind him, the noble general would have used the Treasurer's Advance, created a police force, and deported the offenders. That is the proper course for a Government that understands its business, and is prepared to act accordthat, although it has at its disposal the ing to its convictions. I have looked at this problem in various ways; There are times when a man must put his couutry before his party, and I wish to serve my King, my country, and, above all, my trade unions. not the sole custodian of the rights, powers, and prerogatives of the working class. primary producers are at stake, 'but I know also that a Government which has abused its powers to make a grant here and a concession there, by placating its supporters and utilizing services to allay the public hostility which it has aroused, would not hesitate to incite industrial discord if that would serve its end. So it has been battening politically upon two insignificant men, and proposes to exploit public passion against them in the belief that in that way the parties now in office will be retained there. Mr Anstey. individuals who walk down to the British ships and fix their venomous gaze on the brave seamen who have risked their lives time after time? Although we have been told that the seamen are brave and courageous men, who have done deeds of valour in the interests of the Empire, and who are, if not interfered with, willing to obey the orders of their officers, yet when one of these men merely glances at them they become as putty in his hands. He is another The Svengali, who mesmerizes them until they become so many little Trilbies, without a soul they can call their own. Moreover, this demon is supposed to incite the men He would not wait and call up their worse passions, until all become his dupes and victims..

He is in communication with Russia. .'Every day ships are bringing to Australia communists-vil e disseminators of the doctrines of disorder, and this Government, which is so well equipped with intelligence ancl power, permits the country to be overrun by ship-loads of imported agitators. It knows their habitations and habits, it knows where they sleep and live, but it does not lay hands upon them. It is remarkable that the Government should permit such men to enter the country week after week, and law and the police, and is supported by the press, it is still Avithout capacity to protect the interests of the Commonwealth. These communists are said to receive funds from overseas, yet The Prime Minister is the Government never attempts to prevent the inflow of those resources. The Government does not say that these I know that the interests of persons are criminals, and disseminators in this country of foreign odious doctrines, and should, therefore, depart from Australia to the land of their origin. In no case has the Government charged these the public men with disseminating communistic documents. I leave that subject there. The Governmentnow proposes to bring into existence a new body of police. It has introduced a bill to confer on it a power that it already has. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), when Prime Minister, demonstrated, when he wished to Who are the two protect himself from the violence and aggression of some one. witli an egg. that the Government could under existing legislation bring into existence powers and instrumentalities for the maintenance of peace, order, and good government. It is not that we have no power to act. The Government to obtain office at the next election is introducing the bill to incite turmoil in the community, and thus prejudice the public mind against the trade unions of this country. I believe that the Government's efforts in this direction will be absolutely futile. The bill will serve no public interest. It is merely a political instrument, and the Government already has the power sought for under this measure, which, if passed, will not achieve the object that the Government has in view, but will rather increase immeasurably the sufferings of the community. feel that it is somewhat unnecessary for honourable members on this side of the House to continue this discussion much longer after the very clear and capable statement of the position from a constitutional point of view that we have had from the honourable member for Kooyong (Mi\ Latham), and the breezy common sense statement that we had from the honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Eyrie). But there are one or two points I should like to mention before the debate closes. One wonders what is the reason for all the furious eloquence that we have had from members of the Opposition. I do not think that there has been before this House previously a bill that has excited the orators of the Opposition to such flights of eloquence as has this bill. After all, it is a simple document when one examines it. Mr O'KEEFE -We are always eloquent when we have the truth behind us. behind honourable members opposite, but it is a very long way behind. This bill should command the support of every in which the Government proposes to use honourable member of this Parliament. It that law. simply provides means by which the Commonwealth Government may give point. effect to the laws passed by the Federal have been expressed in this debate. One Parliament. Every speech that has heen has been given to understand that the delivered from the opposite side of the Opposition holds that no law passed in House to-night convinces one of the necesthis Parliament, unless it has the unanisity for the bill, and for the means promous consent of the members of the vided in it. We have heard a great deal from the Opposition about the refusal of the Government of New South Wales to lend its aid to this Government in carrying out the provisions of a particular act. The fact that the State Government has acted in that way should surely convince us of the necessity for providing ourselves with means to carry out our own laws. Hitherto, we have relied on the States for their co-operation in carrying into effect the laws of the Commonwealth. Now that this necessity has arisen, and what looks like a crisis has come about, we find on application to the ""States that we cannot rely upon them as we thought we could. Therefore, the Government, very nattirally has introduced this bill to enable us to have our own officers whom we can trust and on whom we can rely, should the necessity arise, to carry the laws of the Commonwealth into effect. It is not this bill that has incited the fury and eloquence of honourable members opposite. Their objection is to a law that has been already passed by this Parliament. The other day we passed a certain bill, and it became the law of the Commonwealth, and, like every other law, it has to be carried out. We did not put it on the statute-book to remain a dead letter. It was passed in order that ifc might assist the Government to preserve law and order in the Commonwealth. We find that the necessity has arisen for putting that law into operation, but that we have not at our disposal the necessary means to do so. The members of the Opposition contend that we have, without this bill, power and means to carry that law into effect. If that is so, why do they-make such a fuss about passing this bill? Their attitude is practically an admission that this bill is necessary. They object, not to obtaining means to give effect to our laws, but to the enforcement of a particular measure to whioh this bill, if passed, will give effect. Some most extraordinary views",78,Pairs

That may he so, but while it is alive it must be obeyed and respected, because the very foundation of our life as a community is respect for the expression of the will of the majority of the. people. . This bill is necessary if we are to have the means of putting the law into operation. charged by honourable members opposite with sympathizing with the reduction in the wages of the British seamen, but that is simply one of numerous red herrings that they have attempted to draw across the trail. Our resentment at the interference of certain individuals in this seamen's strike, and our disapproval of the action of the seamen themselves in striking, involve no expression of opinion regarding the reduction of wages in respect of which the strike has taken place. that reduction, but the patent fact is that the men on strike to-day in Australia have been misled. British; seamen belongs to a trade union, and this union was a party to an agreement which was.embodied in the articles signed' by every individual seaman who is now out on strike. Under that agreement the seamen accept any rise or fall in wages during the currency of their articles. These men came to Australia, and as was pointed out by the honourable member for Kooyong, only when they reached Sydney did they go on strike. There is overwhelming evidence that certain individuals who are not British seamen, but aliens resident in Australia, if they did not originate the strike, have sinde its origin directed and controlled it. Honourable members who have followed "" carefully the development of this Mr Maxwell. strike must have noticed that those indiThat viduals counselled the seamen to leave ""We are their ships, and told them that they A law would be hot-air merchants if they went back to them. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) said, "" Fancy all' this fuss being made about the influence of one or two puny individuals !"" But these individuals have told these misguided British seamen that they have behind them the whole force of the great seamen's federated union of Australia. They undertook to speak for that union, and to pledge it to support the strikers. Does any honourable member mean to say that the poor British seamen, 2,000 of them, would have taken the stand that they did, and left their ships, if they had not believed that they had the support of the union? A t the first meeting in the Communist Hall in Sydney one of these individuals said to the seamen, "" Whatever steps you take we are behind you."" We have been That was a serious statement for a man representing a great union to make to men who were out on strike in breach of a solemn agreement. Immediately afterwards one of the British seamen said, '' Boys, to a man we shall be out on strike to-morrow; those who do not come out we will drag out.""

What we say is, that the necessity for legislation such as this will not cease when the, present dispute ends.

After listening to the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, I can only come to the conclusion that he is now, as he was a. few weeks ago, obsessed with, a fear of communism which is groundless. He thinks that some great danger menaces Australia and will bring about its ruin. He expressed that opinion when we were discussing the measure designed to give power to deport certain citizens, and to-day he shows that he is still obsessed with the same idea. How. then,can we expect to obtain from the honourable member, aud those who share his opinions, sane legislation making for the peace, order, and good government of the country? The obsession of this honourable member clearly indicates the general idea of Ministers and their supporters. same obsession. obsession, but a clear realization of his duties as the custodian of the rights and liberties of the citizens of New South Wales. And he will show the honourable member and the Government he supports that they cannot lightly interfere with the privileges of the people of a sovereign State. They will have tlie Government of New South Wales, the Australian Constitution, and the High Court of Australia to deal with. suited to the middle ages than to the twentieth century is not likely to be accepted by the people of Australia. No reform worthwhile has ever been obtained unless men were prepared to stand up against unjust and inhuman laws. The history of the world teems with illustrations of actions similar to that now being taken by the Government. Time after time the passage of coercive legislation has been attempted to take from the people their ordinary civil rights, but on every occasion it has been defeated and the rights of the people have been upheld. I want to know what will happen when this bill passes into law, and the Prime Minister sends his ""bullies"" to New South Wales. Mr Lang, as the custodian of the rights and liberties of the citizens of New South Wales, will be obliged to Their opposition is all a take action to protect them;, if he does I agree with the not do so, he will fail in his duty. He must protect the citizens of that State against the enforcement of a law which not only violates the Constitution of Australia, but also is repugnant to the good sense of the people. It is quite easy to see that when these "" bullies of Bruce '' proceed to New South Wales, and attempt to interfere with the police of that State in the discharge of their constitutional duties, they will be placed under arrest. The same thing will happen to the Attorney-General, or any one else, who goes across there on the same errand. Members of the Government think that, they can send emissaries to interfere with the rights and liberties of the citizens of a sovereign State, but that is not quite so easy to do as they may think. In the first place, it must be proved that this Parliament has a right to pass this legislation. I doubt whether it has, and, not only I , but also some of the most eminent legal authorities in Australia, doubt it. The citizen of a sovereign State has his comhas the mon law rights, and the Government must show that he is actually doing something detrimental to the peace, order, or good government of this country before it can interfere with him. The mere issuing of a proclamation by the Government does not create a state of industrial unrest. To print a notice in the Government Gazette, saying that something is threatening the peace, order, or good government of the Oommonwealth does not make the statement a fact. The Government may issue a proclamation, Legislation more but unless the proclamation is based on reality, it cannot be effective. If that were not so, it would be competent for a despotic government to turn out proclamations from a printing machine declaring that in the opinion of the Governor General a 3tate of war, a state of chaos, a state of anarchy, a state of unrest, or a state of anything else, was existing in this country. There might, in fact, be no disturbed conditions, the proclamation being issued merely to enable the Government to seize by the scruff of the neck, and cast out of Australia, a dangerous political opponent.

374,Mr Mahony,"He has no such""'Upon what basis of fact was the proclamation issued?"" Is there a state of industrial unrest existing in Australia? Let us examine that question for a moment. Certain members of the crews of British ships have had their wages reduced. Upon examination we find that the shipowners, who built up huge profits during the war, who are paying bigger dividends now than ever they paid before,' legislation like that in force in the who are building bigger ships, and placing more money to reserves than ever before, are reducing the wages of seamen to a lower level than they have been on in the history of the British mercantile marine. Who were the men who took risks during the war? Who saved the heart of the Empire? the submarine blockade was beaten, England would be starved, the Empire would fall to pieces, we would all be ruthlessly crushed under the heel of the German oppressor? Who saved England from starvation? manned the ships to carry food to Great Britain? Who braved the German submarine menace ? It was not the shipowners, not the men who made the huge profits, but the British seamen, the men who to-day are opposing legislation intended to force them to work seven days a week for£2 a week. One might naturally expect the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) to support such legislation. true to form, for when he was chairman of a board for determining the wages of white workers, he gave a casting vote in favour of 14s. a week. to the question before the House. the attitude of the honourable member. upon whom it throws a fierce light. He formerly favoured long hours and low wages for whiteworkers, and to-day he supports low wages and long hours for the men who saved England from starvation. As far as I am concerned honourable members opposite may cast any names at me they like-the y may call me a communist, and say that I am supporting Tom Walsh-bu t I am not afraid of anything they may say, because I stand for decent, honest, conditions for the men of the British mercantile marine. The wealthy combine that controls the mercantile marine of Great Britain decides the freights that the primary producers of Australia shall pay for the conveyance of their products to oversea markets. That great combine has wrung huge profits out of the Australian primary producers, and yet we find members of the Government, and men who call themselves the representatives of the Country party, rushingto introduce middle ages to assist the combine to rob Australian farmers and Britisli seamen. I do not stand for that. I care not for the accusations of honourable members opposite. I , and all honourable members on this side, stand for Australia and for good conditions for its people. I hope that the people of AusWas it not said that unless tralia will realize that this move by the Government is an attempt to make political capital; but, so far as' we are conand cerned, the Government has a free hand in that direction. The Leader of this party challenged the Prime Minister to go Who to the country when he liked, and if he does so the Labour party will be returned with a big majority. I hope that when the Prime Minister sends his ""bullies"" to New South Wales, Mr Lang will take proper action to protect the citizens of bhat State, and will either deport them or place them under arrest. I hope that the Government of New South Wales will protect the people of that State, so that the matter may be tested in the He is only running courts of this country. If that is done the Commonwealth Government will find that the pedestal on which it has rested its proclamation will be knocked away. By that time there will be no strike on British ships, for the dispute will be settled within a few days. In submitting this bill to the House the Government is placing itself in a ridiculous position. It has appointed a biased board to deal with certain people, and before the board can function, ' the conditions upon which the' charges rest will cease to exist, for there will be no. industrial upheaval, no industrial unrest, and nothing to menace the peace, order, or good government of the Commonwealth. I am not worrying about the position in which honourable members opposite are placing themselves.

The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), when describing the position, pictured the Govern' the last eight or nine months can ment as aghast with fear because of a couple of communists who were causing some industrial disturbance. Buti t is the leaders of the party to which the honourable member belongs that are "" sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought"" because of the existence. of these communists who are leading this industrial turmoil, while the political leaders of labour in this country fail to show the strength that they should -exhibit in a crisis such as exists in Australia at the present time. This legislation has been rendered necessary by the weakness and the cowardice of the leaders of the Labour party. For many months the Government has given the Labour leaders every opportunity and encouragement to rid their unions of these extremists who are bringing them and the country to ruin. In not rendering assistance to give effect to the law which has been passed by this Parliament, the New South Wales Government has failed to carry out its constitutional obligation, thus rendering necessary the action taken by the Federal Government tb enforce its legislation. The Attorney General and other legal members have dealt at length with the constitutional aspect of this question, and have shown that the Federation cannot continue to exist if the attitude adopted in this instance by New South Wales is to be followed generally by the States. One Can scarcely imagine the damage that can be done by an inflammatory speech such as that of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony), who practically incited his followers to civil disturbance. [Quorum formed.] Some months ago a strike occurred at Fremantle in Western Australia, which was roundly condemned by the Labour Government of that State, yet"", when that Government was asked to render aid in carrying out essential national services such as quarantine, health, and customs administration, it failed to assist the Commonwealth Government by refusing police protection for Commonwealth oflicers. By that refusal to assist the Commonwealth Government, the health of Australia was seriously imperilled. The position which has arisen in connection with the shipping .dispute is similar to that"" which occurred in Western Australia. No one who knows what has taken place during accuse the Commonwealth Government of having acted hastily in . this matter, or of having endeavoured to make it a political issue. The Prime Minister, as the Leader of the Government, has repeatedly asked the industrial unions to get together and endeavour to bring about a satisfactory settlement of the dispute. The Government appealed to all the industries involved, and to the labour leaders, to make efforts to secure permanent industrial peace, but apparently that appeal fell on deaf ears. The Labour' party maintains that the communist element in its ranks is very small, but that element seems to completely dominate the unions and the Labour leaders of this country. Honourable members opposite have had a week in which to discuss the position which has arisen. On Monday morning the Prime Minister approached the Labour leaders in the matter, and later in the day a proclamation was issued. To-day, Friday, is the first occasion on which they have spoken on the subject, and they have spoken on it to-day only because the introduction of this legislation has forced them to do so. ister has repeatedly given the unionists the opportunity to take control, but because of .their inaction the Government has been forced to deal with this industrial dispute in the interests of the people generally. In this connection, one would naturally think that the Federal Government would be able to command the State Government's resources. Because the present dispute has its seat in New South Wales, the Government made application to the Premier of that State for assistance. It should be remembered that on the 27th July last Mr Lang, the Premier of New South Wales, said with reference to the men who are the. leaders in this disturbanceThe reappearance of the I.W.W. in our midst, and the cordial reception extended by Mr Garden and his Moscow friends to these",85,Pairs

The I.W.W. is essentially hostile to the Labour movement. Its aims are repugnant to all responsible, sane wage-earners, and it seems to me that it now shows its. ugly and disreputable head simply to try to injure the chances of the Federal Labour party at the coming Federal elections. The miserable weakness of the Communist party was well demonstrated at the last State elections, so it is now thought that a revival of the I.W.W'ism may put a bolt in tbe Labour party's machinery. New South Wales should not be made a dumpingground for the industrial refuse of the British Empire. More care should be taken by the Federal authorities in the admittance of undesirables. Yet when we asked for his assistance to prove whether certain men were undesirable or not, that assistance was not forthcoming. organization with which they are associated, also saidIts record in this and other parts of tlie world is infamous, and leads us to but one conclusion-that it is 99 per cent, criminal. Notwithstanding that utterance, he refused to grant the Federal Government the assisance of the New South Wales police to deal w it h men whom, he says, are 99 per cent, criminal. His statement of the 27th July continuedI t is reported that one of the first speaker's that organized trade unionism is behind on behalf of the I.W.W. in the Domain declared that he was here to propagate strife, strikes,, and job control. All these weapons are opposed by the unions and by the Australian Labour party, and so far as my power extends it will be used to protect the public interests and the good name of our industrial population. . Men who come here deliberately to set class against class and to embitter social relationships will highly deserve all that is coming to them, and I can assure them in advance that the Ministry will not allow criminality to flourish in our midst, whether it masquerades under the name of I.W.W. or any other. Those remarks were made by Mr Lang a month ago. Since then it seems that he, like members of the Opposition, has been carpeted, and now will not even allow his officers to carry out Commonwealth laws. why the Commonwealth Government has received no assistance from the Premier of New Sbuth Wales? The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) pointed out this evening that, notwithstanding that the bill we passed recently was not carried unanimously, it was passed by a majority of both Houses, and, therefore, is now the law of the land. Was the refusal of the Premier of New South Wales to make available the ordinary instrumentalities of justice due to a fear on his part that this Government would appoint a partisan board? He was approached with a request to make available one of the judges of the New South Wales Supreme Court. He should, therefore, have been satisfied as to the non-partisan composition of the board that it was the desire of this Government to appoint, and could have assisted, in insuring that the board was non-partisan by acceding to this Government's request. His refusal, therefore, was not on that ground. Nor was the request refused for constitutional reasons. The statement which the Prime Minister read showed, that the refusal was based on political Mr Lang, speaking of the reasons. MrA . GBEEN -He knew that the proposal of this Government was a political move. ago Mr Lang said that Australia should not be made the dumping-ground for undesirables from other countries, but when the opportunity presented itself to r i d this country of such people, he failed to accept it . The reason that the State Premier will not act is not due to the fact the strike. The action of the men here is opposed by the leader and 75 per cent, of the members of the British Seamen's Union. The whole of organized labour in Great Britain is stated to be solidly opposed to this strike. The strike is unauthorized and unofficial.

The Commonwealth Government should seek to work in harmony with the State authorities.

How long will the Federation last if this Parliament passes legisthe bill is an interference on the part of lation that trespasses upon the rights of the States? What would he the position of the Commonwealth, if, because of legislation of this kind, the large State of New South Wales seceded from the union? Why should the Oommonwealth be deliberately offensive to the State of New South Wales? There is no doubt that the bill is directed against that State. I cannot conceive of peace being promoted by legislation that is hostile to the party .in power in any State. Apart from that, the right of the Commonwealth to create this force is questionable. There, is already in existence a Commonwealth In vestigation Branch, which is in reality a police force. It was brought into existhow will the peace of a State be affected? ence at the time of the Warwick eggthrowing incident. Thousands of pounds of the taxpayers' money has been spent upon it, but, so far as I know, it does nothing.

When I walked Charlton) knows full well that it is the King's peace, whether in the States or the Commonwealth, that has to he preserved. It is a term that we derive from the United Kingdom. Halsbury, in his volume dealing with this subject, saysThe modern system of police forces has been slowly evolved from the succession of peace officers who, at different times and under varying titles, have safeguarded the internal peace of the United Kingdom. The Leader of the Opposition has, under cover of the short title of the bill, referred to its substance. He says that tlie Commonwealth with the sovereign rights of the States. But all that the hill seeks to provide for is the enforcement of the laws of the Commonwealth. The honourable member admits that the New South Wales Government has refused io put its instrumentalities at the disposal of the Commonwealtli, and, because we are seeking the' power to appoint our own instrumentalities, he says that this is interference on our part. It is not interference in the slightest degree. There should not be any want of harmony between the Commonwealtli and the States. If we appoint Commonwealtli officers, Any interference with a State's peace will arise, not from Commonwealth action, but from action having its source outside Australia. It is the interests, not of New South Wales, but of Australia that must be safeguarded.

I have not the temerity to declare myself a constitutional authority, but, after listening to the learned disquisition of the honourable memher for Kooyong( Mr Latham) and the arguments advanced hy the Attorney-General( Sir Littleton Groom), I wonder whether there is anything in the Constitution to give to this Parliament power to pass a bill under which peace officers are to be appointed. The bill is declared to be necessary to carry out certain provisions of the Immigration Act whichwas recently passed. Section HO of the Constitution states'The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and, if the offence was not committed within any State, the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes. The Attorney-General, who claims to be one of the leading constitutional lawyers in Australia, and the honourable member for Kooyong, who also takes credit for being a constitutional authority, endeavoured to prove the constitutionality of this bill and of the Immigration Act. Section 51 of the Constitution says that the Parliament shall, subject to the Constitution, have power to make laws "" for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth."" Then follow a number of subjects on which the Commonwealth shall have power to legislate, the first being trade and commerce with other countries and between the States.

Mr O'KEEFE -The act which gave rise to this bill must, to be constitutional, have a legal standing. That matter will probably be fought out at a later stage. This measure is called the '' Peace Officers Bill,"" yet any attempt to put it into operation will produce anything but peace, because it will practically mean a declaration of war against the State of New South Wales. The Attorney-General stated, this afternoon, that it was not expedient to appoint a judge of the High Court to the proposed board, because the High Court might be a court of appeal. I asked him, by interjection, whether he would permit any person who might be convicted by the board, to appeal to the High Court, but he refused to answer. During the course of the debate, it has, been said by members supporting the Government that nothing unfair will be attempted under the bill. Several speakers went so far as to claim that the board will not be partisan in its deliberations. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Ryrie) tried to suggest that, the board could be relied upon to be impartial.' Buti t must be recognized that if the board did not receive its orders at the time of its appointment it certainly obtained them this afternoon in the speech of the Prime Minister. I suppose that each member of the board will be furnished with a Hansard report of that speech. It is unthinkable that the board could give an impartial decision after the Prime Minister's remarks. It knows what it is expected to do, and honourable members know what it will do irrespective of what evidence is submitted to it . Dnder the particular clause before the re-' committee one is not allowed to discuss many aspects of the bill, and I shall therefore conclude my observations on this clause by saying that I oppose it, as I shall oppose every other clause, on the ground that every citizen of Australia is entitled to trial by jury. offence ?

I should like to hear the honourable member for Fawkner defending the persons against whom this measure is supposed to be directed.

The persons against whom the bill is directed may have been gtiilty of errors of judgment, but thousands of persons who have no sympathy with their particular views, when they find that men are to be deported, and deprived.of the right of trial by jury, will rush to the support of the Australian Seamen's Union. This measure will be resented by the whole of the industrialists of Australia, and the Prime Minister and every honourable member opposite must realize it . The honourable member for Fawkner said that he would have pleasure in voting for the bill. HaveI not. heard him on other occasions declare that he does"" not believe in force, but stands for the liberty of the subject? Now this gentleman, who knows the laws of the country, condones the action of the Government. for the deportation of certain persons from Australia was under consideration, an agreement was arrived at that made that bill futile. At that time honourable members on this side could plainly see signs of intense disappointment on the faces of honourable members opposite that industrial peace had been brought about. In fact, the honourable member for Fawkner stated this evening that the agreement then arrived at was a farce. Does he not know that the seamen of Australia are working under that agreement to-day, and that British seamen in all parts of the world are in a state of unrest. Numbers of ships are held up by British seamen in the ports of Great Britain. The statements that have been made in the Australian press that certain men in this country are responsible for that are utterly false. It is well known that the British seamen, whose wages have been reduced, are suffering under a deep sense of wrong. The Attorney-General knows well that the result of this measure will be indusknow nothing of the sort. I can Officers Bill could be more appropriately termed "" The Incitementto Industrial Disturbances Bill."" The Australian overseas trade, at any rate, is so far uninjured. A number of ships are held up in Sydney Harbour to-day, but they could be manned by Australian seamen, at Australian rates, of wages, in order to carry our wool and. wheat'overseas if the Government so determined. It is a question of wages, however, aud the Government does not want vessels carrying Australian commerce to be manned by Australian seamen in receipt of Australian rates; it wants Australian commerce carried at the .sweating rates of wages that are being forced upon a section of starving seamen in Great Britain. It wants to take advantage of the necessities of those men, and for that reason there is unrest. This bill will be regarded as an attack on the Australian seamen, who are in a state of industrial peace. Once industrial leaders have been seized, no industrialist in Australia, who was born in Great Britain, will feel safe. There will be in the Labour movement a general call to arms, not only of the When the bill designed transport workers, but also of the industrialists all over Australia.

It aims at settling an industrial dispute. The Government says that the cause of the dispute is that some of the industrial leaders in the Commonwealth have incited men to strike, and it has formed a. board for the purpose of deporting them. This alleged inciting to strike has occurred only in Sydney. Why,, then, are the British seamen in Melbourne on strike? They hare had no communication with the seamen in Sydney. able member know that ? dence of my own eyes and ears, and by reading the signs of the times. The Melbourne men acted on their own initiative, without consulting Walsh, Johannsen, or any one else. The same statement ' is true of the seamen in Brisbane. There is also a strike in New-Zealand, and another in Great Britain. I make no apology for justifying the men who. are on strike. A conference was held iu Great Britain to decide the wages dispute. ence; it was the National Maritime Board. The comMrE . EILEY My interpretation of what has occurred is that a conference was held, and while these men were at sea, and without consulting them, a reduction of their wages The honwas decided upon. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) says that these men are disloyal to their union, but they had no voice in the decision, and when thej' lauded and heard that a reduction of their wages had been made, they objected to it . They have every rightWe are unfortunate in having a to object. We do not know Avhether they signed on iu England for the f u l l rate of £10 a month, for the newspapers have been silent on that point.

This bill will provoke a fight, and if a fight does take place, every coal-miner in the country may down tools, and every railway man may refuse to carry on.

South Wales is justified in the stand it has taken. It was a trick on the part of this Government to get the Government of New South Wales to do its dirty work. If I were a member of the State CabinetI would defy the Gommonwealth Government to put any New South Wales citizen into jail. New South Wales is the largest State in Australia, and contributes more revenue to the Commonwealth than any other State. Althoughi t has the largest representation in this House, the Government is challenging it to a fight. If that and are quite ready to let the electors State withdraws from the federation, the federation will fall to pieces. I know that the word ""indissoluble"" is in the Constitution, but if we try to force the State Governments .to do a thing they do not want to do they will justifiably rebel. In this matter the people of New South Wales will be behind their Government. When this bill becomes law, the Commonwealth Government will be the laughingstock of the country. Mr Walsh, and have never spoken to him, but if I were he I would go to the Premier of New South Wales, and 3ay to him, "" I am threatened with arrest. I ask your protection, as you are the Premier of this State, and I throw myself on the State Government."" What would take place? Suppose the State Government said, ""We will not allow you to be taken out of this State. You are one of our. taxpayers, and you have broken none of our laws, or any of the laws of the Commonwealth."" a law of the Commonwealth. not a striker. A man does not make himself liable to the penalties of the law merely because he addresses a meeting. If he did, every trade unionist in this country could be deported! The honourable member for Warringah ( Sir Granville Ryrie) said, "" If you threaten us we will threaten you, and we will bring the boys from the Snowy River to man the ships."" I should like to see "" the boys from the Snowy River"" taking charge of our ships and going to sea, or going down the coal-mines and taking the place of the coal-miners. They may be capable of doing outdoor work, but for skilled work, such as that performed by seamen, firemen, engineers, and stewards, the boys from the Snowy River are no good. I congratulate the Government of New South Wales on its attitude, and I say that it should go further, and not allow one of its citizens, who has committed no offence under the laws of the State, to be arrested. I am sorry that the Government has no cry on which to go to the country. It m.ay think it can go to the country and win the elections on this bill. That would be a fair fight. Members on this side stand behind the challenge of the Leader of the Opposition, decide the matter. I ask supporters of the bill to read the industrial history of other parts of the world. There are industrial disputes in other places, but nowhere except in Australia has a Government taken power to deport people for making speeches in connection with a strike. This trouble isdue to an attempt to reI do not know duce the wages of British seamen, who are now asked to work seven days a week and accept £9 a month. Not so long ago they received £21 a month, but because of the huge, army of unemployed in the Old Country, their rates have been reduced considerably. The profits of tbe companies have, however, not been reduced. The luxuriously appointed vessels of 21,000 tons which come to our ports have not been constructed out of JoSSGS.

I regret that as my attention was otherwise occupied I did not hear what the honourable member for Reid was saying. that the title of the bill should be altered, and to support my argument I was reading a certain extract from a manifesto issued by the Premier of New South Wales. The bill is unnecessary, because he has already definitely said that he is prepared to see that the laws of the Commonwealth and of the State are observed.

The Government does not desire to bring such people to the Bar of Justice. Honourable members on this side do not endorse breaches of constitutional authority, but, as an honourable member on this side said last evening, there comes a time when the patience and endurance of law-abiding respectable citizens are exhausted. a law-maker, it would ill-become me to advocate law-breaking; and it is with the idea of preventing law-breaking that I object to concede to the Attorney-General the powers set out in clause 2. This bill brings to my mind legislation that was passed on another occasion to establish, .on a very flimsy pretext, a Commonwealth Police Force. something of the waste of public money occasioned by that force. The sei vice if it can be called such, that the force rendered did not iu any way tend to preserve the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, but rather to disturb the minds of the people, and make them feel that they were beiug subjected to tyranny. of . intimidating feel that that experience, for which Australia paid so dearly, will be repeated. The people are about to be deprived of Mr Makin. certain liberties, and to suffer a restriction of their right to freely express their thoughts and ideals. Honourable members opposite haye endeavoured to picture a degree of unrest which, they allege, prevails in Australia, and requires the services of the peace officers. It is remarkable That unrest exists only in their own imagination. The people of Australia will not be deceived by their wild and exaggerated speeches, but will seek ito know what prompted the British seamen to strike. The strike is no concern of the Commonwealth; but this Government has been requested to do The Prime Minister said the bidding of certain interests abroad, and is doing it in the hope of obtaining thereby a further tenure of office. This action of the Government is not in the best interests of the Oommonwealth. Representative government has vanished from Australia, the country is ruled hy a capitalistic junta,! and tyranny reigns supreme. There is grave danger in giving to the Attorney-General added powers which will enable him to appoint men who will be likely to further imperil the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth. Regarding the British seamen who to-day, in various Australian ports, are protesting against unfair treatment, it should be stated that their conditions are among the worse experienced by any white workers in the shipping industry. I am concerned that these British seamen have been forced to take this As action to secure redress of their wrongs. When they left Great Britain they believed that they were to be paid the rates which then prevailed. The oflicials of the Australian Seamen's Union have not precipitated this trouble; they were approached by the British seamen for advice and protection against the great shipping combine. A report presented to the We kuow Canadian Parliament by Mr W. T. R. Preston contains some illuminating figures and statements concerning the ramifications of this great octopus-like combine, which slowly but surely is getting its tentacles upon the social and industrial life of Great Britain, and will, if not checked, do the same with Australia.

Every decent man would be delighted to know that British seamen were obtaining better pay and better conditions, and I believe that when Great Britain emerges from her present troubles, which are the result of her taking up the cause of civilization, better conditions will prevail. I regret that it is necessary to pass a bill which provides for the appointment of these peace officers. That it is necessary is a disgrace to some of the States of the Commonwealth.

I shall be glad to have an explanation of this clause from the Attorney-General. Downs-Attorney-General) [4.25 a.m.]. -The Leader of the Opposition( Mr Havelock Wilson's statement that EngCharlton) stated that he had not seen the phrase ""for.want of reciprocity"" in any statute previously, and I can quite understand his position, because tlie phrasing is unusual. In this particular instance the actual phrasing of the clause is almost in the very words that appear in sections 11 and 12 of the Queensland Police Regulation Act. That act states thatEvery person taking and subscribing any such will need to be well informed of what it oath shall be deemed to have thereby entered into a written agreement. . . . 'Provided that no such agreement shall be set aside, canappointed under this bill will probably be celled., or annulled for want of reciprocity. The necessity for the words "" for want of reciprocity"" arises from the -fact that every person subscribing the oath shall be deemed to have entered into a contract. To make the contract binding there must be what is known as reciprocity of assent between the two parties, and this is deemed to be a contract between the constable or peace officer and the Crown. There is a mutuality of consentbetween the Crown and the consenting party. The word ""reciprocity"" in the clause has nothing to do with agreements between the State and the Commonwealth, or between bodies within the State. I was pleased to hear the explanation of the Attorney-General, but I consider it to be as clear as mud. The Attorney General told us that the clause was copied from the Queensland Police Regulation Act, hut he did not say what the word "" reciprocity "" meant in regard to the annulment of an agreement. member could not have been listening to my remarks. am afraid that I did not understand the sense of the Attorney-General's remarks. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) gave only one side of the story of the seamen's dispute. He read a cablegram from Mr Havelock Wilson, stating that the wages of the British, seamen had been reduced under au agreement entered into by the National Marine Council. I ' believe, a banquet took place to celebrate the occasion, aud much was made of the fact that no industrial dispute had occurred in Great Britain for the last eight or ten years. The honourable member for Wakefield omitted to read land was losing its trade, and that foreign vessels .were carrying its commerce overseas. Who is it that gives that trade and commerce to foreign bottoms instead of to British bottoms? It is those people who lend money to the peoples of foreign countries, the loan being effected by the transfer of goods. When entering into an agreement under this clause a policeman contains. The duty of the peace officers to arrest union leaders who. are involved in industrial disputes, aud advise their unions to resist a reduction of wages, such as that which has brought about the present conditions in Sydney. It has been suggested that the British seamen are taking a stand that they would not have adopted had it not been for the part played by certain union leaders, but the press reports for the last week or more show clearly that British seamen in every part of the world are protesting against the reduction of their wages. There is no Thomas Walsh in South Africa, New Zealand, or Canada; and to those countries the seamen's grievance has extended. The oflicials of the union in Australia have come to the assistance of the British seamen in the hope that they may obtain treatment that will",103,Pairs

The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr the duties are defined in any part of the roster) did not say one word against the clause under discussion, but went into the circumstances that have brought the seamen to the present position. The history of trade unionism shows that what is happening to-day has happened before iu various ways on many occasions. There is no need for this clause. bill is un-British, and it will not appeal to the average Australian. This placard has been introduced by the Government with the idea of much being made of it a few months hence when honourable members go before the electors. But the Australian community is too enlightened on political matters to be caught by chaff of this description. The Labour party, however, would not be worthy of its name if it did not make a fight against the sting contained in the measure. The deporta. tion of a member of the community toa strange land would mean exile for himself and his family. I might, on my return to Adelaide, say something which would bring down upon me the wrath of the Commonwealth authorities, and which 'might be regarded as against the peace, order, and good government of the country. If I were brought within the pale of this provision, and were deported, it would mean exile for my wife; and if I took with me my daughter and her three children, it would mean that six Australians would leave the country. bill is reminiscent of the dark ages.

The honourable member may not discuss the whole scope of the bill. The clause under consideration refers only to the oath taken by peace officers. honourable positions in the community could have been deported in the past under such a provision as this.

Will the Attorney-General tell the committee what the agreement will provide for. I presume that the duties will be prescribed by regulation. I challenge honourable members opposite to show that bill.

The Avhole bill is too ambiguous. I thought that' the Commonwealth police force had been brought to an irreducible minimum, consisting of an investigation officer in the Customs Department. Before appointing other officers, we should ascertain whether the one already employed by the Government can do the job. The oath referred to in clause 4 should be more stringent than that set out in clause We 2.

I hope that clause 4 will never have to be reenacted, and that future governments will be more sane than the present one. The Government has shown its impotence, its want of capacity, and its ineptitude to control a situation that would control itself if left alone.' Clause4 is panicky legislation, panicky in its conception, and panicky in its construction. Instead of subscribing to an oath for the purpose of this bill, the people of Australia should swear that they will never again vote for the representatives who are responsible for such legislation.

I doubt whether that provision is wise in a bill of this kind. If a man is dissatisfied with his job, the sooner he leaves it the better, because a dissatisfied man will never give satisfaction. Why a man should be compelled to remain three months in a job if he does not want to, I do not know.

If a man is appointed to some remote part of the country, who is to say that he is doing his work? Generally a man has to give or take fourteen days' notice. The provision in this bill is unreasonable. I am not particularly concerned about the individuals who may accept' these positions, but I am concerned about their being paid for doing nothing. Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [5.5 a.m.] I am not concerned with the fate of any man who may accept a position of this kind, because he will be a man lacking in manliness. But if we read this clause in conjunction with clause 4, we have evidence of the callousness of the Government regarding the rights and privileges of ordinary men. Clause4 gives the Attorney-General the right to discharge any of these men at a moment's notice, but clause 6 does not permit a man to leave the service unless he first gives three months' notice, or is relieved by the Attorney-General. For three months he may be kept practically a prisoner. [5,7 a.m.] I know nothing of the reasons for this clause, but it seems an excellent one. It may happen that, for some time after these omcers have been appointed, they may have little or nothing to, do, and it is very desirable that, having been paid for that time, they should not be able to relinquish the position when called upon to perform the duties of their office. As the honourable memher for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) interjected, they will . know the nature of their duties, and the conditions pertaining to their appointment, before they agree to accept the position. If they do not carry out their duties, a penalty is. provided. The Leader of the Opposition objected to these men being retained for three months and paid their salaries for doing nothing. I suggest that it is unfair for a man to accept a position, and after a period for which he has been paid, although he has performed little or no work, to ask to withdraw as soon as he is required to perform ' the duties for which he was appointed. This clause seems to provide a necessary safeguard. -The honourable member for Boothby that he knew nothing of the reasons for the inclusion of these clauses, proceeded to try to show that he knew a good deal about them. Evidently the Government is determined that, having once obtained these men, it will keep them. The men may find that the work is obnoxious to them, but they will not be able to relinquish their positions without first giving three months' notice of their intention to do so. The Government does not seem to care that it may pay men for doing nothing. The consolidated revenue may be drawn upon to any extent to pay them, because those who control the Government have said that they must be appointed. For the men who are low enough to do the Government's dirty work, I have no concern. same position as every police constable in the Commonwealth. policeman joins the police force under constitutional government to do certain things, but these men are to be appointed to carry out the Government's political purposes. Any man who is prepared to do this work is a ""scab."" Perhaps the Government considers that those who, because of unemployment or economic pressure, join up, are entitled to some form of guarantee. If the Attorney-General can dispense with the services of these men at a moment's notice, they should have the right to resign at any time, should they consider their duties obnoxious. a.m.]I do not know whether the Attorney-General is in a position at this stage to give the committee any idea of what this force is likely to cost the country.

I trust that even at the eleventh hour the Government will exercise some common sense in this matter, in view of the fact that those charged with the maintenance of the peace, order, and good government of the different States report that at present all is well. Tn passing these clauses we are writing parliamentary history which at no distant date another government will take extreme pleasure in expunging from the statute-hooks of this country. One of the pledges which honourable members oh this side will make to the people will be that obnoxious legislation of this character which besmirches the statutebooks of the Commonwealth will be removed from them. We have had in connection with this bill a message from the Governor General recommending in a general way the expenditure of the money necessary to give effect to it. But we have not had one word from the Government as to what is likely to be the total annual expenditure under the measure. Surely the Attorney-General can give the committee some idea as to what this force will cost the country for the present financial year. vides that a member of the force desiring to retire from it must give three months' notice of his intention to do so. No private individual would retain in bis employ any man who expressed a desire to relinquish his duties. Why should an officer of this force be retained for three matters discussed by the honourable memmonths after he has expressed the desire to retire from if f The Attorney-General has said that this is a matter that Avill be within , his discretion, and I have no doubt that regulations covering many pages will be issued setting out the duties of these officers and the salaries to be paid to them. They will certainly not be paid wages as low as £9 per month. We have not been informed as to whether .the appointment of these officers will be left in the hands of the Public Service Board. to call for persons willing to carry out the very distasteful duties which members of the proposed peace force will have to perform? Is their appointment to be left to the Attorney-General, or to be regarded as a matter of Cabinet patronage affording opportunities for the Afr. Fenton. Will they later exercise of influence? I have not the slightest doubt that influence was used in connection with the appointment of the members of the board that, will he called upon to consider the cases of persons whom the Government desires to deport. I have asked the Attorney General for information as to the probable ajinual cost of the peace force, but he sits like a stone image, and is as silent as the Sphinx. I do not know why the honourable gentleman should be so discourteous as to refuse to reply to a reasonable request for information. I hope that the request of the honor-' able member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Eenton) for information will be complied with. The. honourable member for Cook( Mr C. Riley) has informed us that there is on the estimates for the present financial year a vote of £9,860 for the Commonwealth Police Force. I should like to know how many extra policemen are to be appointed under this bill? Mr 0. RILEY -There are 35 Commonwealth police in New South Wales, including a sub-inspector. would be able to arrest four men. The Clause6 proGovernment has power to instruct the Commonwealth police to do this work. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I again remind honourable members that I have given them very great latitude in this debate. The clauses before the committee are clauses 5 and 6. The ber for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) aud in clauses that have already been disposed of. I must ask honourable members to keep to the clauses under discussion. about what may happen to these bodysnatchers; but I suppose that, as their work becomes distasteful because of its unpopularity, there will be frequent resignations from the foree. If the peace officers are dissatisfied, the CommonIs the Public Service Board wealth will not get good service from them, but they will be a heavy drain upon the Treasury.

The same warning applies to a lot of the men who have been appointed to fancy jobs by the present Government-. If Casey could be appointed to a job in London without legislative authority, the Government can similarly appoint police officers, without forcing this House to sit all night. Apart from arresting three or four men, what will be the duties of the proposed force? Does the Government expect continuous strikes and deportations? God knows what the 35 Commonwealth, police, who are already in New South Wales, are doing. I ask the Attorney-General to be as courteous as is possible at this hour of the morning, and give the information for which the honourable member for Maribyrnong has asked. a.m.] -The clause before the committee declares that any person other than a peace officer who wears or displays the uniform of a peace officer, or acolorable imitation of it, shall be guilty of an offence, and liable to a penalty of £50, ""or establish an entirely new scheme of deimprisonment for three months. What is to be the character of the uniform that no common civilian may wear? Is it to be a gorgeous military outfit designed to lure youths into the force ? I can imagine that if the uniform is to be of a drab character the recruiting of the police will be less easy. Yesterday, I saw Major General Sir Granville De Laune Ryrie perusing a war map in the library. Is he to command this force? A. gorgeous uniform, such as the honourable member for Warringah sometimes wears, would appeal to vain men in the community. I can imagine the Commonwealth police strutting in feathers and gold lace, and bedizened with a lot of medals, such as the Major-General displays on his chestat any rate. corations are gained very easily. As a matter of fact, they are mainly of social origin. How much more attractive would the foree be if titles were promised to the pictures of Zulu warriors with spats recruits. Nothing appeals more strongly than titles to certain minds. Consider' some of the wonderful titles borne by members of this chamber. from Mars, reading the list of members, would think that he had come upon an armed camp. For instance, there is, "" The Right Honourable Captain Stanley Melbourne Bruce, P.C, M.C."" I suggest that this force might be made much more attractive to some men if they were told that there was a possibility of getting similar titles without too close an inquiry as to how they were acquired. In the Military Forces to-day a man's deeds in the field are of less importance than his social position. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN . I suggest that the honourable member should not pursue that line of argument. pertinent to the uniform to be worn by the Commonwealth police. Another title that appears on the cover of Hansard is ""' Major-General the Honourable Sir Granville De Laune Ryrie, KCMG., C.B., Y.D."" What does "" V . D . "" mean? I conceive it possible that the prospect of becoming a "" V . D . "" might induce a certain type of man to join this wonderfully patriotic service, which is designed for the smashing of trade unionism. The Government is asking this committee to fence and offence. The popularity of the MilitaryForces is beginning to wane. Here is another opportunity to indulge the martial spirit, and, by a liberal use of feathers and patriotic colour's, create more of what Mr King O'Malley used to term "" gilt-spurred roosters."" We see birds of that kind attending the Governor General at the opening of Parliament. The members of the Commonwealth police force would be able to strut in their war paint, not only on the King's Birthday, but on every day in the week. If inducements of that kind are to be offered, the cost of the scheme will be considerably increased. No doubt, the Prime Ministei-, who is away from the chamber, is even now consulting his tailors as to the design' of the uniform to be worn by the new force. Will the Honorary Minister throw some light on the subject? Spats form part of the usual military dress in some countries.

I used to strut before the f a i r sex in Albert Park on the 24th of May, the Queen's Birthday. really thought then that I was playing an important part in the defence of the Empire.

These new officers wil l be the "" Pinkertbns"" of Australia, their principal duty being to assist in the quelling of industrial disturbances. , That being so, we should be very careful in choosing their uniform. The old idea of a red uniform was that a wounded man would be unable to see that he was bleeding, and would, therefore, not lose courage. I am satisfied that a gaily caparisioned uniform would be a great attraction to the opposite sex. It is a wonderful fact that girls are attracted by young fellows in uniform who, in civilian attire, would not stand a dog's chance with them.

I do not say that he is doing wrong, according to the commercial ideas of to-day, and if he did otherwise he would probably find himself in the Insolvency Court. He has to adopt the commercial code,and go on strike, without regard to the interests of the community. An instance of striking is furnished by the flour millers of this country. A baker in Footscray, who sells bread at a price lower than that charged by the other bakers has to adopt subterfuges to obtain flour. The millers of Victoria will not supply him, and he has to order from the other States. Is there any suggestion of deporting those individuals? Hasi t ever been proposed that we should deport the He evidently forgets profiteers, including the directors of a woollen mill, that started with a capital of £35,000, and during the war watered the stock to the extent of £480,000 -me u who sent the price of shares up from 5s. to30s., and foisted them on the public at the inflated price? It cannot be said in their extenuation that they did it for bread and butter; they did it to obtain a few more of the luxuries of life. Nothing has been said about that form of strike. But when a few unfortunate seamen, on their own initiative, refuse to work, they are immediately denounced. The Government dare not appoint a judge of the High Court to try these cases. Had that been done, the men who are to be arrested would be found innocent of having caused this strike. I should not have had much respect for Tom Walsh or Johannsen if dissatisfied British seamen. What a change has come over this House during recent years! Time passes quickly, and we soon forget the events of a few years ago. Many of the men who are now striking for a living wage for their wives and children braved the hardships of the North Sea during the great world tragedy of 1914 to 1919. They were great heroes then, but to-day the Prime Minister had the impudence to call them "" scabs,"" although they shed their blood and risked their lives for the Empire. The bill will be like a boomerang to those who support it. I know the working classes of Australia, and I say candidly that they do not stand for strikes. "" Conciliation and arbitration "" is a plank of the Labour party's platform, and by every legitimate and constitutional method we seek to promote it. We try to give the working classes confidence in the Arbitration Court. We advocate that access to the court should be made easier, that lawyers should be prohibited from pleading there, and that the cost of arbitration should be reduced. If this Ministry, by means of one of its policemen, lays hands on and attempts to deport any individual in Sydney, it will be a case of "" God help the Ministry!"" It will be more than that it will be a calamity. Doss the Ministry want to bring about an industrial upheaval in Australia merely to achieve its own political ends ?

546,Mr Speaker,"Orde r ! The honorhas exhibited great patience during the past'seven or eight months, during which time there have been repeated attempts by certain elements in the community to disturb the industrial life of this country. Finally, the Government, in order to save trade unionism, has been compelled to take action. unionism effective, and why have workmen united ? They have united in order to makeeffective collective bargaining with their employers. But if there is to be collective bargaining, there must also be the honouring of collective contracts. Mr Havelock Wilson, the President of the National Sailors Union, comprising 50,000 members, has pointed out that the Australian intervention was unwarranted, and constituted an act of treachery to the whole trade union movement. That statement was supported yesterday by the whole trade union movement in England. The honourable member for Ballarat has suggested that this trouble has been caused because of the desire of the shipowners to reduce the pay of the men. But what was the cause of the shipping strike in which the Australian Seamen's Union was concerned ? It was not lower pay in their case. A certain award was made by the Arbitration Court, but Mr Walsh and his colleagues induced the Seamen's Union not to observe it . They advocated that action because the award was drawn up by the Arbitration Court, not because they directed rates of pay or conditions. So long as they were not made by the court they were willing to accept even worse terms, because there was then no tribunal to deal with the dispute: It is well that it should be placed on record that in that dispute it was not a question of wages -[Qiwmm formed'] -The action of the Government will tend to promote industrial peace and bring about equity. There is, however, a'much larger question involved in this inatter. We are entitled to ask why the Premier of New South Wales did not see fit to allow the State instrumentalities to be used for the common good. It may be that his action was an indirect attempt at unification, that he would cause the people to become so tired of dual control that they would bring it to an end. Yet, surely, if unificathe moment demanded that they should do so. tion is his desire, it should be sought in a straight-out .manner. The action of the New brought the Federal system into contempt, in that it has been found necessary to appoint a second set of police officersWas the refusal of the New South Wales Government to afford assistance to the Commonwealth Government due to a belief that the work that has to be done would be done by seamen reWhat has made trade ceiving higher wages? Unfortunately, not only will the work not be done by men at higher rates than were paid to the British seamen, but, as a result, these men receive only two meals a day and have nowhere to sleep. From our newspapers we see that the German motor ship Konitzberg is unaffected by the disturbance, as are also Dutch, French, and Italian vessels. According to a recent cable from London giving a comparison of the numbers of the crews and the monthly wages paid on vessels of about 8,800 tons, Norwegian boats pay £25 1 monthly in wages, French boats £ 3 0 1 , Dutch vessels £370, and British £407. The action of extremists in Australia in forcing this strike of British seamen will ensure, not that they w ill get higher wages, but that their work will be performed by men of other nationalities at lower rates of pay. Is the action ofthc New South Wales Government, which renders the passage of this bill necessary, due to its desire to uphold the principle of arbitration.? On the contraiy, these extremists desire to destroy arbitration. I have already shown, onanother occasion, that the operation of the arbitration principle in the Commonwealth has led to a continual increase in the number of unions and in their membership, until today Australia is industrially one of the most highly-organized countries in the world. Yet we find that tliese extremists, whom the New South Wales Government w ill not assist us to take action against, are men who have been continuously opposed to arbitration. Mr Walsh saidTlie seamen would not have arbitration, maintaining that there wns nothing to arbitrate ubout. The seamen recognized the class struggle, and only accepted such compromises as they were driven to, holding to agreements as long as they were suitable and determined to break them as soon as the circumstances of That is the attitude of these men towards the arbitration principle, which is a part South Wales Government has of Australia's industrial life, and to",114,Ththd Reading
547,Dr. Earle Page,"The Governmentwhich the honourable member for Ballarat has told us the Labour party subscribes. No question of deportation of people from Queensland has been raised, and yet we find that the men with whom it is intended to deal under this legislation -are talking to the employees of the Queensland railways exactly as they have talked to the seamen. opposite suggest that the present industrial unrest is due to certain action of the Gommonwealth Government; but what action of the Gommonwealth Government is accountable for the Queensland railway strike ? We say that these strikes are due to the continual fomentation of disturbance by these men, who are trying to destroy the constitutional forms and traditional liberties of the British people. It may be suggested that the reason why the Premier of New South Wales has been unwilling to render the Commonwealth Government assistance in this matter is due to a desire to uphold the White Australia policy. But these men wjho bring about industrial turmoil in Australia are totally opposed to the White Australia policy. They regard it as of no value at all, and pillory Labour politicians in Austr.alia because they stand for that policy. According to the official report of the Australian Workers Union of the proceedings of its annual convention, Mr Walsh saidHis union would not stand for any race exclusion, and before the seamen would go in with commerce is being drained away. British the Australian Workers Union there would have to be an alteration in the Australian Workers Union constitution to admit to membership natives of any country-Japan, China, or elsewages.

One could understand the government ol a State taking up an attitude for the maintenance of the purity of our ideals, but one cannot understand why any government in Australia that stands for the White Australia liberately encourage the retention in Australia of men who seek to break down and bring to nothing our institutions and ideals. It may possibly be urged that the New South Wales Government, in refusing its assistance, desired to help the producers of the country, but what are the facts? The fact that these men are being encouraged-and the action of the New South Wales Government may be regarded as passively encouraging themwill result in closing the main arteries of Pr. Earle Page. trade, and preventing the transport of our products overseas. Our butter is just about ready for export,and the fact that the British seamen are out on strike will materially interfere with its export. Our wool is almost ready to be moved, and our wheat will be ready for export in a few months' time. If Honourable members we are going to have the whole of our transport services disorganized-and there have been threats of a general industrial paralysis-the holding up of the export of our products will enormously penalize our producers and will bring about a tremendous amount of unemployment. Surely the importance of our export trade, and the necessity for selling our goods at the earliest moment at the best prices, should have enabled us to appeal with confidence for the assistance of the agencies of any government and every authority in Australia. It may be urged that the action of the New South Wales Government, in refusing to assist the Commonwealth in this matter, is due to a desire to help Great Britain. Only the other day, when we tried to induce the New. South Wales Government to enter the Loan Council, it refused to do so on the ground that it would not do anything to injure the Mother country. It would not join with the Gommonwealth and the other States in the matter of the Anglo-American loan and yet it stands idly by whilst the life blood of British shipping has to compete with the shipping of other nations paying lower British seamen aTe anxious to secure the continuance of trade to British ships, and they are prepared to make certain concessions to enable British ship-owners to compete with foreign shipowners. Despite this fact, the New South policy should deWales Government refuses to render-assistance to the Mother Country in the noble struggle she is making to recapture her hold on the world's markets and her share in the carrying trade of the world. In view of these considerations, it passes my comprehension that we should find at this time in Australia any government unready and unwilling to assist in putting an end for all time to these constant and continual attempts to disturb the whole industrial life of Australia. We must do it now. We have put our hand to the plough, and -we must go on because we are quite satisfied that these extremists, with their 'doctrines imported .from Moscow, who, 'according to Mr Lang, are 99 per cent, criminals, are preventing the Australian worker and his employer from establishing those cordial relations with each other, which would lead to uninterrupted progress and prosperity in the Oommonwealth. [6.55 a.m.J -We have become so accustomed to hear the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) attempting to speak on every subject, that we are not surprised to find that he knows very little about any. I would advise the honourable gentleman to concentrate upon one thing. He may make a success of it if he keeps at it long enough. When he indulges in observations concerning trade unionism, he must expect to become a laughing stock. He must know that he can only excite ridicule when he says that the object of tlie Government in the action it has taken is to assist trade unionism. What the honourable gentleman has said will appear in Hansard, and I desire that some comments on his observations should be put on record, side by side with them. He said that the last shipping strike was brought about because certain trade union leaders requested their fellow-unionists to defy the Arbitration Court. The honourable gentleman has made that statement deliberately, and I want to tell him now that he knows that that statement is false. the Treasurer to contradict the statement. I am about to make. He said that the strike was due to the seamen being asked to defy the Arbitration Court, and he knows that before that stage was reached the ship-owners had applied for the deregistration'of the Seamen's Union. honourable gentleman knows that it is so. It cannot be denied that the ship-owners applied for the de-registration of the Seamen's Union. had refused to obey the award. step taken by the ship-owners led to the recent shipping strike. applied for the de-registration of the Seamen's Union. so; and the government was doubly guilty. It is right that the attempts of the Treasurer, and other honourable members opposite, to cover up the facts, should be exposed. The primary producers of the country will be told the facts about the Treasurer and his attitude with regard to the present and the previous strike. The previous strike, which affected Australian coastal shipping, would not yet have terminated were it not for the fact that there is a Labour government in New South Wales. There were never more disappointed men than the members of this Eederal Government when they learned that that shipping crisis was terminated. The Labour Premier of New South Wales got into touch with Admiral Clarkson, of the Commonwealth shipping line, and the seamen, and, at a round-table conference, got down to brass tacks in bringing about a settlement. The action taken by the authorities of the Commonwealth shipping line practically settled the strike, because, after it, the other ship-owners were unable to hold on. Whilst Mr Lang was settling the dispute the Prime Minister was talking about "" a fight to a finish."" The newspapers supporting the government, took the Prime Minister to task because he dilly-dallied too long, and allowed the Premier of New South Wales to step in and settle the strike. The Government was concerned only about the political capital it was going to make out of the strike. They were thinking not of the possibility of a peaceful termination of the trouble, but of how it could be exploited to benefit them in the constituencies. As the honourable member for Ballarat tersely said, "" The Government is discredited, and is looking for a means to save itself."" Its record is more discreditable and besmirched than that of any other Ministry in the history of the Commonwealth. Its sins of omission arid commission cry aloud for punishment, and Ministers"" have rightly concluded that their chances in the constituencies are negligible.

But he knows that if the Commonwealth Government had acted as the Premier of New South Wales acted in the recent strike, the present disturbance also could be terminated. The man on the land has too much sense to believe the considered statements that are put forward for the sole purpose of deceiving him, and he will be asked to contrast Mr provide the Government with a battle Lang's action with the policy of the Commonwealth' Government, which is doing nothing but introduce legislation that is calculated to aggravate industrial trouble.

His remarks have been wide of the question on several occasions, and I ask him to confine them to the motion. endeavouring to show that the Government desires the passage of measures of this kind in order to cover up its past wrong-doing. kind will be permitted; a long speech on the subject will not. examples. f"" -* Not having a war to. use for political member for South Sydney incites the honourable member for Hume to disorder he too will incur the displeasure of the Chair. vernment has at last, been forced by the Labour party to increase the invalid and old-age pensions, but its repentance is too late; the people can see through that in anoeuvre peat that this legislation is not introduced for the purpose of terminating industrial strife, but merely in order to cry for the next election. If any ill effects to the primary producers or anybody else arise out of this proposal the blame must be laid at the doors of the Government. I was amused to hear the honourable member for Pawkner( Mr Maxwell) and others asserting the necessity for enforcing the law. What a recent conversion! We well recollect that five years ago certain individuals built coffin ships, in respect of which they were liable to refund £120,000 to the Commonwealth, but the Government has not raised a little finger to recover that money. Had they The put to sea, those ships would have caused the loss of thousands of lives, but we hear no word from the Government of enforcing the law against their wealthy friends, the builders. When, however, men are opposing a reduction of their wages from £9 to £8 a month, the honourable member for Fawkner suddenly discovers that he has a conscience, and that the law must be enforced. His conscience functions only when it can be used against the poor, as he used it against the white-workers of the country years ago, when he declared that 14s. per week was an ample wage for a woman. Sir Sidney Kidman and others were allowed to default for eight years in ' respect of their taxation; the Government never discovered that those men should be compelled to recognize their obligations, as any poor farmer has to do.

Ministers to deny that Mr They are only too recently acquainted Archdale Parkhill came to Melbourne to consult with the Prime Minister regarding the appointment of the board. I surmise that the right honourable gentleman was assured that the persons suggested would give the sort of verdict that the Government desired.

Postmaster-General need not attempt to look innocent. The appointment of the board is surrounded by suspicion. The fact that Mr Archdale Parkhill had a conference with Ministers has leaked out, and, of course, more will he heard of it. The fact will stand to the eternal shame of the Government that, even in the appointment of this farcical board, it was hot prepared to be fair, but violated every principle of British justice, including the right of an accused person to trial by a jury of his countrymen. Trial of a person before any jury with a view to his deportation would be bad enough, but the consultation with the head of theNationalist organization in Sydney, regarding the constitution of a board which would have the power of recommending the deportation of an Australian citizen is the most discreditable act/committed by this discredited Government. Even a goThat appointment is vernment with a good record could not survive the crime which is proposed against men who have reared families in Australia. Ministers speak of the primary producers.

I asked the honourable member for Hume if he had a shred of evidence on which to base his statement. I am anxious to know whether he made the statement recklessly and wilfully. He has not yet said whether he has any evidence. If he says he has, I challenge him, and tell him that he cannot have any, because there is nota shadow of truth in what he says. right honourable gentleman in consultation with Mr Parkhill? Will he answer that simple question? has asked me whether I ever consulted with Mr Parkhill about this matter. In reply, I tell him that I did not. I did not mention it to him, nor did he mention it to me. That the honourable member could have made such a suggestion is an indication of the type of mind he has. I have heard many similar charges by honourable members of the Opposition, and they are totally untrue. They merely indicate the kind of minds that conceive and utter them. Everything that the honourable member has said suggesting that there is anything improper in the appointment of this board is totally and absolutely without the slightest foundation in fact. of the board are members of the Prime Minister's party. ber has the slightest respect for his repureply to them? tation, he must recognize that the obligation is upon him to produce evidence in support of his statement. Honourable memhers opposite make these statements, and afterwards run away from them. They never pursue and prove the things they say. They are privileged in making accusations in this House, and they do not scruple to make them under cover of that privilege. The honourable member has done himself very little credit by the charges he has made. His statement is discredited by the fact that ho has previously made many similar charges which, so far from being substantiated, have been proved to be without justification. Mr Parker Moloney interjecting, member for Hume persists in taking no notice of the calls of the Chair, I shall have him removed from the House. immediately the honourable member is faced with his statement, he adopts an attitude which shows that he has in him those characteristics which generally excite the greatest contempt in the people of Australia.
