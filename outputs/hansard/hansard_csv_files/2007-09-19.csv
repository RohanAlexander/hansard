267,Mr Mcgauran To Move:,"Wednesday, 19 September 2007 ----Health communities of Lyons at the moment. The Howard government have failed the people of Lyons on this matter-in fact, they have failed the people of Australia. They continue to blame the states for the result of their handiwork. We see the Liberals blaming the states for hospital waiting lists yet there are an estimated 2,000 older Australians waiting in hospital wards who have been assessed for residential aged care. The average daily cost of a hospital bed is $967-nine times the cost of a residential aged-care place. Residential aged care is fairly and squarely the responsibility of the federal government. Labor recognises this, and a Rudd Labor government will examine whether additional transition or step-down care would assist, along with other measures, to increase the speed at which aged-care bed licences are made operational. Recently the Tasmanian government announced as part of its health plan the closure of aged-care beds at the Ouse hospital. On 12 July 2007 the Acting Tasmanian Minister for Health and Human Services, Steve Kons, announced: The State Government has been effectively subsidising each aged care bed at Ouse-last financial year by $114,000, which is well over twice the Australian Government bed subsidy. This is an appalling circumstance and one wonders how this can occur when the Prime Minister is boasting about his skills in economic and financial management. Labor has a $2 billion national health reform plan. This compares with the doubling of outof-pocket costs to see a GP since 1996. This compares with figures that show that 65 per cent of Australia has a health workforce shortage. This compares with the policy on the Mersey hospital-and we still do not know if this is a one-off or part of a planned national takeover. The Howard government are running scared in the lead-up to the election and so they have no policy but to apply bandaids in whatever seat they seem to be in trouble in on the day. Labor has a plan for health infrastructure. Recently Labor announced it will reform the Rural Medical Infrastructure Fund, which is clearly not working under the present Howard government. Many regional communities are facing difficulty in accessing health services. The Howard government promised $15 million at the last election for this fund, but since 2004 only $3.5 million has been spent. Promises, promises, promises. It is time to have some delivery, is it not? Haven’t communities suffered enough? It is time for new leadership on health care and new leadership for Australia-it is time for a Rudd Labor government.

More recently I have been able to continue progress for our local area and we have had quite a number of achievements on the Sunshine Coast and in the electorate of Fisher in particular. I was pleased to be able to obtain a Medicare office in Maroochydore while retaining the offices at Kawana Waters and Caloundra. We were able to score the ex HMAS Brisbane as a dive wreck off Mooloolaba. This project is currently delivering some $40 million a year to our local economy. Over $33.5 million has been spent on capital funding for the University of the Sunshine Coast, including $5 million for the recently completed sports stadium. We have been able to attract more than $34 million in funds specifically for local school projects and capital works to improve the learning environments for our young people. As we all know, young Australians are our nation’s future. The new family relationship centre at Maroochydore will assist coast families to work out the best possible outcomes for their children, and they will be able to get all the necessary advice. Over $14.6 million has been obtained from 2003 to 2006 for local small business operators to assist apprentices. We have been able to attract countless Work for the Dole and Green Corps projects for the regions. We have just recently been able to announce $2.9 million for a major broadband project with the Maroochy Shire Council and the University of the Sunshine Coast. These are social dividends as a result of excellent economic management during the period the government has been in office, since 1996. We have repaid Labor’s debt and now, instead of spending money on paying interest the way Labor had to, we are able to deliver positive social outcomes. This superior economic management has resulted in unemployment at a record 33-year low, lower personal and company taxes and significant superannuation reform. It is not time for a Rudd Labor government. There is more to be done. The coalition government deserves to be returned at the election, whenever it is held-it is pretty clear that it will be held soon. When you look at the quality of the team behind the Prime Minister and the Treasurer compared with that of the team on the opposite side, it is clear that the Labor Party is extremely thin on the ground when it comes to experience and competence. It would be extremely dangerous were Labor to be elected later this year. (Time expired) Annandale North Public School Housing Affordability Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (9.36 am)-I wish to speak today about Annandale North Public School, a wonderful school in my area that has been celebrating over the weekend and early this week the centenary of the school. The school was established in 1907. At the weekend they had a wonderful fair and invited students from the past to revisit Annandale. They had visitors from all over Sydney and all over New South Wales, coming from far afield to return to their school. They have done a magnificent job of getting photos of past classes and past students. Their beautiful library was covered in photographs of students from every era of the school, old school reports, documents, and advice to teachers about what they were allowed to do and what they were not allowed to do. It was a fantastic historical trip. It also included a book, A Century of Reflection, by Mary Hare. There was a cocktail party in the evening. On Monday they had student performances about every decade of the school’s existence. I am so sorry to have been in Canberra and missed that, because I know that the AnMAIN COMMITTEE nandale North Public School students would have done a marvellous job in those performances. On Tuesday, yesterday, they were wearing clothes of different periods of the school. The school has an enormous amount of parent involvement. They have done a fantastic job of expanding the playground into the neighbouring street after many years of campaigning. They have also started a campaign for a hall for Annandale North Public School and, with the support of the parents, the local community, the teaching community of the school, their local government representative, the Mayor of Leichhardt, Alice Murphy, their state representative, Verity Firth, and, of course, me, I am sure that they will eventually be successful in their campaign. Just before I finish, I want to comment on the fact that we are told in a marvellous article by Patricia Karvelas in the Australian today that 50 government MPs in a marathon policy debate yesterday said that housing affordability is an issue that this government should be tackling. I am pleased that MPs are listening. I hope that eventually the Prime Minister and the Treasurer will stop ignoring this. We know that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have said that housing affordability is not a big issue. In fact, the Prime Minister says it is great-he has never heard people complain about the value of their homes going up. That is true. They are pretty worried about their kids and their grandkids ever being able to afford a home. We know the ordinary family cannot afford the ordinary family home anymore, and that is a shocking state. (Time expired) Darkinjung Local Aboriginal Land Council the Darkinjung Local Aboriginal Land Council in my electorate. The Darkinjung are a proud people who have been working towards self-reliance, but they were unfairly targeted by the New South Wales state Labor government when it decided to appoint an administrator over the land council. The administrator was appointed by the disgraced former state minister for Aboriginal affairs, Milton Orkopoulos, under the guise of concern over their financial situation. Mr Peter Hillig, a mate of Orkopoulos and state Labor, is bleeding the funds dry. A few years ago the Darkinjung land council contracted for a sale of land for $42 million in two lump sums. They set up trusts to create a number of companies to provide ongoing community support for their local people. Through hard work, some good fortune, astute investment and excellent management, they were able to become independent of government grants and move away from welfarism to become a model of self-determination. The Darkinjung people have shown they are able to successfully operate a diverse range of innovative programs, including the establishment of a funeral fund and a housing scheme, as well as investing in a cattle company. This cattle company sold more than $1 million worth of cattle a year to Japan and was in the process of negotiating contracts with Canada and North Korea. However, the New South Wales state Labor government’s interference and the decision to take over the land council has caused these vital initiatives to cease, with the administrator freezing assets, and now he is actually conducting a fire sale. The state member for Terrigal and I have been meeting with the representatives of the Darkinjung because we are deeply concerned by the damage state Labor is doing to the local Aboriginal group. State Labor is quickly reducing the Darkinjung land council from a financially independent, multimillion-dollar corporation to a debt ridden organisation surviving hand to mouth on New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council funding.

271,Mr Ticehurst (Dobell) (9.39 Am),"I rise today to convey my continued support forland council is premised on helping people to help themselves, but the Labor state government is penalising it for delivering this independence. The former state minister for Aboriginal affairs justified his decision to appoint an administrator by stating that it was in the best interests of Darkinjung. I call on the New South Wales state government to conduct an inquiry into this matter. The Premier needs to get involved because some of his cronies and hangers-on are really causing heartache for these people. Considering that the former state minister for Aboriginal affairs is currently facing 36 child sex and drug charges, his decision to appoint an administrator over Darkinjung must be reassessed as a priority. They are bleeding the funds dry, and they are destroying the bloodline of the cattle that had been built up over 20 years to produce the highquality beef that was able to be sold internationally. The cattle are now being put to market and sold for hamburger mince. It is an absolute disgrace. I call on Morris Iemma to get in there and sort it out. (Time expired) KU Starting Points the distinct pleasure of working with a range of different groups that do nothing other than help serve our community. On Saturday night I attended KU Children’s Services charity night for KU Starting Points-Macarthur. Starting Points is an organisation that services communities from Liverpool through to the Southern Highlands. It provides child care and respite care for families with children with disabilities that range from mild to severe. When I see the work that is undertaken by this organisation I think our communities are very fortunate to have the committed professionals, such as Dr Freelander and other paediatricians in our area, and the various volunteers who act in these programs. KU Starting Points was formed by KU Kindergartens and Macquarie University some 13 years ago. At the moment the organisation is involved with 50 to 60 kids whose disabilities range from mild to severe and include down syndrome, autism and Asperger’s syndrome. Their families have received the benefits of this organisation. Those benefits are not just child care. This organisation goes about setting up various support groups for families, including fathers groups and mothers groups. In other words, it is out there catering for the interests of the families, including the siblings of the kids with disabilities. I would not necessarily say this is a unique organisation but it is certainly staffed by very good and conscientious people, such as Lorraine Brown, who is the CEO. By the way, Noelene Brown is the patron. The organisation serves the community in south-west Sydney, which, unfortunately, has an overrepresentation of people with disabilities. As a member of parliament, I feel that it is incumbent on me and my colleagues to do as much as we can to support people who dedicate so much time and effort to looking after their communities. We are indebted to them for their efforts and to the professionalspaediatricians, psychologists, counsellors and speech therapists-for their assistance. All these people give a significant amount of their time, and their motivation is to serve the community. I have great respect for this organisation.

273,Mr Baldwin (Paterson,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourisma public hospital. So dire is the situation that years ago the community set about raising money to build a hospital, and build a hospital they did. The state government refused to lease that hospital to provide services to the people of Forster-Tuncurry. They were forced to put it out to a private contractor. So what we have is a hospital built and funded by the community and run by a private interest. They do an outstanding job. Karen Devenish, the CEO, does a tremendous job. On3 September it was great to announce an after-hours GP service that will be established at that hospital. This program provides funding of $600,000 over three years and will provide great community benefit, particularly during the holiday season, when the town grows. For a number of years I have been lobbying New England Health-now Hunter New England Health-in particular, their CEO, Terry Clout. I had meetings with him on 9 July 2004, 20 September 2005 and finally on 13 July this year, which was when he let me know that, after all the lobbying by the community and me, 20 beds would be leased to this hospital for the provision of services to the public. That was reinforced on 3 September in a telephone call from the Acting CEO, Nigel Lyons, who stated that those beds would be available. There is a sting in the tail for the community in Forster-Tuncurry-that is, those beds will not be provided until the end of the financial year. This is a community from which people have to travel some 34 kilometres to Taree to access a public hospital. This is an ageing community, and the transport links between ForsterTuncurry and Taree are marginal at best. I say to the state government: ‘You have now made the commitment to lease these beds. Provide those beds now. We are ramping up services and the federal government is committing more funds, but we need you to provide those beds now.’ There is no difference in cost between providing a bed in Taree Base Hospital and leasing that bed in the community in Forster-Tuncurry. But what we see is a continual dragging of the chain. I will not believe that these beds have come to fruition until they open on day one. The community demands and, more importantly, deserves these beds as part of their health care. The community is continuing to raise funds. There are further expansion plans for the hospital. Indeed, it was only a couple of years ago that the second floor of the hospital was built so that it could cater for further patients. We have had no real response. It was only because Reba Meagher, the New South Wales Labor Minister for Health, was cornered that she had to admit that the beds would be made available.

TodayI am going to talk about an issue which is very important to the people of Western Sydney. I am delighted that the Chief Opposition Whip is in the chamber, because he has been campaigning against Badgerys Creek airport for the last 25 years.

276,Mr Bowen,"Honourable members opposite hate to talk about federal issues, for undertorate in Kemps Creek, Mount Vernon, Cecil Park and Horsley Park as well as Bossley Park, Minchinbury and St Clair. I noted a letter to the editor in today’s Fairfield City Champion from Peter Cork of Horsley Park. I know Peter quite well. I served on the Fairfield City Council with him. He is certainly no supporter of the ALP and we certainly had our differences over the years, but he has been a very strong and powerful campaigner against Badgerys Creek airport. He starts his letter by saying: It seems absolutely remarkable that the Liberal Party could allow Badgerys Creek airport proposal to remain on the books. He goes on: When Mr Vaile quarantined the Badgerys site until 2009 he and John Howard effectively placed a ‘poison’ sign over our land and our local community. This is an issue which will not go away for the government because they will not rule out building an airport at Badgerys Creek. As I reported to the House previously, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services had written to Western Sydney councils confirming that there would be another review. The government apparently do not like reviews, but when it comes to an airport in Western Sydney they embrace them. There will be yet another review! The last review was done in 2005-it has been and gone. Now we have another one coming in 2009 and they say they cannot make a decision until the 2009 review. Furthermore, it gets worse. I am sure the Chief Opposition Whip will be very disappointed to hear that the Prime Minister’s principal private secretary wrote to the Western Sydney Alliance Chairman, Councillor Mark Pigram, this month saying an inquiry into the deeply unpopular second Sydney airport would reopen in 2009. He went on to say: [The] Australian Government is retaining the Badgerys Creek site as a contingency for possible development of an airport should one be needed in the future as there are no other suitable sites within 80 kilometres of Sydney. So this is the true view of the federal government from the Prime Minister’s principal private secretary. The members opposite from Western Sydney masquerade around town saying that they will oppose an airport-the member for Lindsay has made an art form of it-and yet we all know that this government will not rule out building an airport at Badgerys Creek if it is re-elected later this year. We hear constantly about state issues. Why don’t members opposite stand up on a federal issue which affects Western Sydney, oppose Badgerys Creek and rule it out? A Rudd Labor government will not build an airport at Badgerys Creek. (Time expired) Queensland Government sharing the dividends of the strong economy that we have been able to create for the benefit of all Australians through hard work and effort and without any assistance from the Australian Labor Party over the last 10 or 11 years. RecentlyI had the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources visit Graceville State School and we told the students there about the fact that they as a school are able to access up to $50,000 in green vouchers to help them install solar hot-water panels, water retention systems or water tanks. Given that the Queensland government had in fact abandoned its rebate on solar hot-water panels and this government has doubled its rebate, it is pretty obvious who has the greater commitment to the environment.

277,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (9.52 Am),"The Howard government believes strongly ining a 200,000-litre tank system. Yeronga Bowls Club have done the same thing. Graceville Croquet Club want to do it as well and I am fully supporting Jim Bakker and his team there in their efforts. But of course the big concern I have-and given that something like 80 per cent of the year 6 and year 7 students who met Minister Turnbull and I put up their hands when we asked the question: ‘Do you have a water tank at home?’ and there would be a lot of people in my area who would be very concerned about this too-is that the legal opinion is very straight. The Queensland government can seize the water that comes off people’s roofs, store it in water tanks and use it as they see fit. There is no clear guidance from the Queensland government about the ownership of the water. The legal advice is that it actually does come under government control, so it is absolutely important that Anna Bligh, the new Queensland Premiernever elected but nevertheless anointed-in fact clarify very quickly what is going on there. The other failures of the Queensland government to properly invest in our local schools are breathtaking. I now have schools seeking money to expand their administrative blocks because the Queensland government will not do that work. We have already had things like the covered walkways installed at Graceville State School for $136,000. Sherwood State School received $150,000 for air conditioning. Tennyson Special School, which looks after kids with difficulties and disabilities, received $132,000 for special learning areas. Rocklea State School, a country school in the middle of the city, has received the best part of $100,000 for everything from upgrading their sporting facilities to computer equipment and air conditioning-and this is a school of only 70 kids. Parents would never have been able to contribute that money. Milpera State High School received $149,000 for air conditioning and fixing up their canteen facilities. Yeronga State School received $73,000, and the Yeronga State High School received $135,000 for air conditioning. Money also went to ICT. The point I make is that the money that has come from the Australian government’s Investing in Our Schools Program is being invested in our schoolchildren, invested in our future. As the federal Labor Party plans to expand the road network and put more trucks and traffic on Oxley Road and Fairfield Road, I am going to stand very firmly in the corner of local residents against Labor’s stupid plans. Grandparents firstly, I want to praise an aspect of a state government’s program and highlight concerns that I have about the national government. Parents as Teachers have provided some funding for grandparents who parent. I have met with the group a couple of times. They meet at the Madang Avenue Public School, and it is a great little group. What is unusual about them? It is just not that they are parents of orphans. Often these grandparents are in their twilight years and are accepting very young grandchildren and the responsibility for bringing them up. Why is this so? It is mostly because of alcohol abuse, substance abuse or domestic violence and sometimes because these children have been sexually assaulted. They often have very complex behavioural problems. I would be critical of DOCS-I think DOCS could be doing a lot more to support these grandparents-but I also think that there is a role for the Commonwealth. This is a hidden group in our community that is doing a sterling job. But they are old, they get tired and they need a break. Often, respite is not available or they cannot afford to pay for it. They are doing MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Statements By Members
278,Mr Price (Chifley) (9.55 Am),"Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I want to shock you but,a sterling job but it is very hard for them. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I are grandparents and it is a joy. We have all the time and patience but we know that our grandchildren will go back to their parents. These grandchildren stay with their grandparents and I think the grandparents should be supported. The federal government needs to look at giving them additional assistance. In my electorate some of the grandparents have worked but, unfortunately, they are now all dependent on social welfare. I do not think social welfare is meeting their needs, much less their grandchildren’s needs. I say to the federal government: let us put politics and the argybargy of an election aside. This is a very small but growing group in our community who are taking on a huge burden. The government should be grateful for the good work they are doing, but they need more assistance. I have mentioned respite, but these grandparents also run up all the sorts of bills that parents do but without the income of parents. (Time expired) Education activities of the teachers unions peddling political propaganda in our public schools. They are doing this at the school gate by handing out political material. In some cases they are doing it in schools by putting the ‘Your Rights at Work’ posters up as well as other political information and, in some cases, by even spreading this material inside schools. There are three fundamental problems with this. The first is that our teachers ought to be promoting critical thinking and presenting both sides of every argument, not taking a deliberately and blatantly party political line on any particular issue. They should not be using their position in the classroom or the schools to support the Labor Party or to push any political view. The second problem I have with it is that their activities are unfair to other teachers who are professionally doing the right thing, are committed to the education of their children and are not abusing their position in the classroom to push a particular political point of view. The third and perhaps the greatest problem I have with this is that the campaign by the Teachers Federation, supported by the silence of the Labor Party, is blatantly dishonest. Their argument that the Australian government has somehow cut funding for public schools is blatantly and clearly wrong. The facts are these: in the last 11 years, the Howard government has increased direct government funding to state schools by 120 per cent-in real terms, by 70 per cent-despite an increase in student numbers of only 1.2 per cent. So there has been a real increase-70 per cent-in funding despite an increase in enrolments of only 1.2 per cent. The Australian government has increased direct funding for state public schools far faster than state governments have increased funding for their own schools. Look at the New South Wales budget in the last year alone. In the last year, the Australian government increased direct funding for state public schools by 10.7 per cent; the New South Wales government increased funding for its state schools by a miserable 3.9 per cent. If state governments had matched the rate of increase the Australian government has delivered, our schools would have a lot more funding than they currently have. Where is Labor on all this? Have we heard Labor criticising the dishonesty of the Teachers Federation’s campaign? We ought to have. Have we heard the Labor members of parliament criticising Labor’s and the unions’ hit list of non-government schools? This government is committed to choice in education-it is committed to supporting our public schools as well as our non-government schools.

(Time expired) 193, the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 September, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time. (Child Sex Tourism Offences and Related Measures) Bill 2007. There can be few offences that are more harmful to the fabric of our society, to our families and to the things we all hold dear than child sex offences. I have no doubt that every member of parliament, whatever their political persuasion, regards offences of this kind as the most the egregious and is supportive of any effort that the parliament can make to protect the innocence of young people, whether they are Australian citizens or young children elsewhere in the world. Sadly, we know that in some parts of the world there has been trade in child sex activities. This bill goes, in some measure, to addressing that. The bill has the support of the Labor Party, and I would anticipate the support of all members of parliament. The bill amends the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, the Crimes Act 1914, the Criminal Code 1995, the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access Act) 1979. The bill will amend the definition of ‘serious and organised crime’ in the Australian Crime Commission Act to expressly include child sex carriage service offences. It will repeal parts of the Criminal Code that deal with child sex tourism. It will insert those provisions into the Criminal Code, with some updating of the language and the structure of the offences. I am pleased to say it adds a preparatory offence to capture the behaviour of people who are preparing to commit a child sex tourism offence. It adds new child sex tourism offences to capture the procuring and grooming of a child for the purposes of child sex overseas. It improves the operation of carriage service offences for grooming persons under 16 years of age for sexual activity. It adds a new offence that would make it illegal for Australian citizens and residents to possess, control, produce, distribute or obtain child pornography and/or abuse material while overseas, and it addresses a gap in the current legislative regime by providing for the forfeiture of child pornography and child abuse material and equipment containing such material that is used in the commission of a child sex offence. Child sex tourism provisions that are currently in the Crimes Act are being moved in line with the general transfer of criminal offences from the Crimes Act to the Criminal Code and the modernisation in the drafting of those offences. The notes on the clauses in the explanatory memorandum identify the corresponding Crimes Act provisions to be replaced, and this is a modernisation process which Labor supports. The new preparatory offences capture the behaviour of people who are preparing to commit an offence under the proposed division 272. The offences capture a wide range of preparatory behaviour. The inclusion of an offence of this kind will enable a person to be arrested prior to a child under 16 being harmed.

280,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),Order! In accordance with standing order,179,Crimes Legislation Amendment Child Sex Tourism Offences And Related Measures Bill 2007
281,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (10.01 Am),"I rise to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendmentboth inside and outside Australia and addresses a gap in the coverage of the existing child sex tourism offences. It is important for all Australians to comprehend that the will of the parliament on this is strong and that whether offences are committed against citizens here in Australia or against children overseas is of no account. This bill quite rightly does not only allow people in one country to be prosecuted with child sex offences; it also makes it an offence for these activities to be undertaken outside of Australia. Currently the Crimes Act prohibits a person from benefiting from or encouraging conduct which would amount to a child sex tourism offence being committed overseas. These offences are targeted at child sex tour operators. It is a sad reflection on circumstances that we actually do have what I would loosely describe as an ‘industry’. They are targeted at people who think they should be able to profit from operating child sex tours. At present it is an offence for those operators rather than the child sex client. There is nothing in the current offence provisions which clearly prohibits any preliminary steps being taken by a person who wishes to participate in a child sex tour. This bill will address that issue. The object of the new grooming and procuring offence is to capture people who groom or procure a person under 16 with the intention that the person under 16 will engage in or submit to sexual activity. These offences will capture the grooming of a young person in a foreign country as well. The proposed amendments address that existing gap in our legislation. They are modelled on existing provisions within the Criminal Code which deal with the use of a carriage service to procure or groom a person under 16 for sexual activity. However, the new offences are not limited to conduct involving the use of a carriage service. The new provisions will make it an offence to possess, control, produce, distribute or obtain child pornography or child abuse material whilst overseas. The proposed offences will apply to Australian citizens or residents of Australia who may be living, travelling and/or working outside of Australia. This too closes a gap in the existing legislative framework and makes clear again the view of the parliament that this activity is abhorrent and unacceptable wherever it may be perpetrated. The conduct is clearly offensive and, if it occurred within Australia, it would be captured by either Commonwealth or state offences. These proposed new arrangements cover the situation where a foreign country does not have specific laws to deal with this behaviour or is unwilling or unable to prosecute. It should be clear that the Australian parliament will ensure those people are prosecuted. I want to make reference to a couple of items in the bill more specifically. Item2 amends the Crimes Act to provide a scheme for the forfeiture of child abuse and child pornography material or an article that contains material that is used in the commission of a Commonwealth child sex offence. At present, child pornography or child sex abuse materials or articles containing such material can be forfeited after following the full processes under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Such material is clearly inappropriate to return to the owner under any circumstances, so the amendments create a streamlined process for the forfeiture by order of a court either immediately after a conviction or following a separate hearing. Items3 to 7 in the bill are also worthy of comment. They ensure that special protections for children in proceedings for sexual offences that are set out in the Crimes Act will continue to be available under the provisions of the Criminal Code. The special provisions will also apply to proceedings for offences against the proposed division 273. MAIN COMMITTEE Items 10 and 11 deal with section 474.27 of the Criminal Code and make it an offence to use a carriage service to groom a person under the age of 16 for sexual activity. Currently, an element of the grooming offences is that the person uses that carriage service to transmit a communication to a second person and that that communication material is of itself indecent. That is a limiting factor in the pursuit of cases of child sex abuse. The requirement that the communication include material that is indecent does limit the types of communications that can be captured for the purposes of making a charge of grooming offences. Indeed, grooming activity may well involve the transmission of other communications designed to capture the confidence of a victim or a potential victim. Items 10 and 11 amend section 474 to ensure that these provisions operate as effectively as possible to capture persons who groom children for sexual intercourse or indecent contact by removing that requirement that the communication itself includes indecent material. This will make the offences consistent with the proposed grooming offences elsewhere in this bill. Again, the opposition-the Labor Party-supports those measures. Item 18 of the bill enables a law enforcement officer to apply for an emergency authorisation for the use of a surveillance device where there is a risk of loss of evidence in relation to the investigation of an offence against these provisions in the Criminal Code. The parliament and the public quite rightly expect tight controls on the use of surveillance devices in our community, and that is appropriate. In a society such as ours we do not lightly give to the authorities and the government the right to interfere with what we would otherwise regard as our right to privacy and liberty; but we do acknowledge, in a range of areas, the need for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to be able to gather intelligence through the use of surveillance and interception devices. The changes that are proposed in this bill are, I think, consistent with what the public would regard as a fair and proper thing in order to ensure the safety of young people here and abroad. Similarly, there are amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act. These amendments ensure that the warrants that are issued under this act may be issued in relation to new child sex tourism offences and dealing in child pornography overseas. The act currently refers to child sex tourism offences in the Crimes Act. As these offences are being repealed, it is necessary to repeal various references to them as consequential amendments. As a result of the changes that are being made in the bill, telecommunications interception warrants will be available for the investigation of a child sex tourism offence or overseas child pornography offences without any further requirement that the offence have an element of organisation or planning. This is different to the current arrangements, in which such warrants are only available for the investigation of a child sex tourism offence where the offence involves, amongst other things, two or more offenders and substantial planning and organisation. I think the government proposal in this area is also correct: there is no reason for that restriction to apply. As I said, we on this side of the House support this bill. I anticipate all members of the parliament would support the bill. As a parliament, though, we do need to also be confident that the resources are available within the policing and other agencies to properly implement the powers that are set out here. Previously, as shadow minister for homeland security, justice and customs I raised my concerns about the resourcing levels available, particularly to the Australian Federal Police. We have seen a number of media reports about the Federal Police being MAIN COMMITTEE unable to pursue child sex cases. Indeed, we have seen reports about the Federal Police having to pass on requests to state police to pick up the investigation of these matters because of inadequate resourcing. It is one of the reasons why Kevin Rudd and Labor have committed to the employment of an additional 500 sworn police officers should we win the election. My attention has been drawn to an article only a couple of months ago, on 18 June this year, in the Herald Sun. It said: In one alarming case, a NSW man who “groomed” a 14-year-old boy in the US for sex on the internet and confided he had molested 100 children was not picked up by NSW Police until four months after the case was handed over by the AFP. “This matter was originally referred to an operational area of the AFP, however due to operational and resource issues, no investigational activity was able to be commenced at the time,” an agent from the AFP’s online child sexual exploitation team wrote .... The article went on to quote the Police Federation of Australia Chief Executive Officer, Mark Burgess: “These delays-or in some cases failure to investigate-are unacceptable and the public expects crimes where children are involved to be a top priority,” ... I agree with Mr Burgess. I think the whole parliament would agree with Mr Burgess. We do expect the investigation of crimes involving children and the abuse of children, particularly sex offences against children, to be of the highest priority. There are resource implications. It is not good enough, though, for us in this parliament just to give impassioned speeches and vote for legislation which may be good and proper. That is of little consequence if we do not also ensure that the agencies charged with implementing these laws have the resources they need to do that properly. Clearly, the Australian Federal Police have found challenging the range of duties that they have been asked to perform both here and abroad, and their resources have not enabled all of those important tasks to be done. Sadly, what we now know is that in some cases child sex offences have been the ones that have fallen off the bottom of the list. We should make sure that does not continue. We should make sure that the Australian Federal Police and the other agencies involved in these matters are fully resourced to properly implement these laws. Child sex offences are abhorrent to all people in our society. It is not good enough that their priority is so low in the system that policing resources are not available to deal with them. It is not satisfactory that any child suffers sexual assault because there are inadequate resources within our policing agencies to do the task. These laws are an improvement. They close a number of loopholes. They extend the reach of current laws to make it clear that Australian residents and citizens who behave in this way, whether here or overseas, will fall foul of the law. They make it clear that we will not allow people to bring back into this country child sex abuse material. That is all good and well. We need to ensure that we couple that intention with equal vigour in resources to have the job done properly. Whomever happens to win the election some time over the next couple of months, I think it falls to them to very seriously and earnestly address this issue and to ensure that the Australian Federal Police and the other policing agencies are well resourced to address this problem, to stamp it out and to make it clear that it is unacceptable here in Australia. They should ensure Australia is a leader in the world, stating forthrightly that we will not tolerate child sex abuse, whether it is perpetrated here or abroad, and that we will use every avenue available to us to protect young people. MAIN COMMITTEE Debate interrupted. could I welcome visitors from the Thai parliament to the Main Committee of the Australian parliament. Welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Debate resumed. Amendment (Child Sex Tourism Offences and Related Measures) Bill 2007, as I am sure every member of the Australian parliament will do. It is a particular passion of mine and I have been doing this for some time. It is a shameful fact that children are being brutalised every minute of every day due to child trafficking both into the sex industry and into the slave labour industry. It was interesting to note in my involvement with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, my involvement on the international Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians and my liaison with UNICEF that, in many of the countries that have a national plan of action against commercial sexual exploitation of children, child sex trafficking is at its highest level. So it is not good enough for any country, including Australia, to have in place obligations and legislation if this legislation is not going to be enacted and people are not going to be provided the opportunity to take legal action against those who would perpetrate crimes against children. In particular through the Inter-Parliamentary Union forum, my colleague Judy Moylan and I decided that we would be instrumental in forming a committee. It was initially going to be called ‘Women Against Abuse of Children’. We then decided, because there was a lot of interest from our male colleagues in that forum, that we would call it ‘World Against Abuse of Children’. We have had some 25 parliamentarians from different countries register their interest in being part of this committee that we are trying to pull together at the moment. The committee is to determine what legislation is available in countries, but my specific interest is in how people can access legal retribution for the abuse of children. When I was in Cambodia and Indonesia recently, I went around the communities where significant child sex trafficking is taking place for the purpose of getting money into the family. I found-and it has been demonstrated by UNICEF many times in their publications-that in many parts of the region, usually in more traditional areas, children, and girls in particular, may be viewed as a commodity by their family. I quote from a UNICEF brochure, Child Protection: This makes it seem acceptable to some families that they “sell” their children into the sex industry, and acceptable for men to purchase children for sex. Moreover, sexual activity is often seen as a private matter, making communities reluctant to act and intervene in cases of sexual exploitation. That is the way many of the communities described things when I spoke to them both in Cambodia and in Indonesia. In my visit to the Asia-Pacific region with UNICEF, representing the women’s coordinating committee, I went to Lombok, where parliamentarians were exposed to a variety of different MAIN COMMITTEE",179,Crimes Legislation Amendment Child Sex Tourism Offences And Related Measures Bill 2007

283,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (10.19 Am),"I rise today to support the Crimes Legislationissues that were confronting islands such as Lombok. It was an emotionally enlightening visit. I met with the Mataram Children’s Council. There was leadership in young children. Some of these young children had been exploited; some of them had been involved in prostitution through the sale of their bodies by their families and some of them had great promise. Many families are given inaccurate information. They are told that their child will get money for their family by doing house duties and duties that would be acceptable, and yet, when they are taken from their family, they might go into begging. They can be deliberately maimed and disfigured, have acid burn out their eyes and have their figures and faces distorted by acid and burns. They can have limbs physically removed. These things are in order to make them more appealing to the general tourist, who will provide more money for a child with more deformity in their looks. This is being done purposely by traffickers of children. On this visit with the Mataram Children’s Council, the young people were absolutely inspirational. It was up to me to provide a report to the IPU general assembly in the closing ceremony. In it I talked about the Martaram Children’s Council and how these young children aged 15 to 17 were an inspiration in their articulate delivery of the issues that were confronting the children on the island of Lombok, but they were representative of islands and areas all over the world. I was drawn to the children’s drawing on a child’s tree of life. It was a mind, body and soul map. Let me tell you: there was not one out of the 14 parliamentarians on this visit that could deny what this child’s body was screaming. It said: ‘When you beat and abuse my body, you are not only leaving scars and broken bones on my physical self; you are destroying my mind and my soul. They were saying to me that my broken bones and my bruises may heal. But my mind and my soul are lost to me forever.’ The plea from this youth group to the visiting parliamentarians in such a passionate and articulate way was memorable and will never leave my mind. They said: ‘We want to be children. We want to play as children. We do not want to be afraid of being sold into slave labour or being sold into the sex industry. Just let us be children, please. Please listen to us speak and then go back to your parliaments. Be the voice of the children in your parliaments.’ It is up to all of us to do that: be the voice of children in the parliaments of Australia, in the parliaments of the world. This is a fabulous initiative between UNICEF and the Italian parliament. It is a joint cooperation building walls of protection. It is a collaboration between governments-fabulous, and I cannot speak highly enough of it. Here is a typical ad that is on many of the buses. This one in particular shows the situation in Indonesia and talks about the commercial sexual exploitation of children. This little girl is saying, ‘Although I’m still alive, in reality, I’m dead inside.’ That is what takes place in the lives of not 10, not 20, not 100, not 1,000, not even 100,000 children. We are talking about millions of children across the world who are being used and brutalised in an ongoing fashion. That is why it is important to stand up and support the ever increasing vigilance and powers of cooperation as an Australian citizen and as an Australian member of parliament, to improve the operations of the AFP and other bodies in cross-border agreements and ensure that governments, departments, agencies, police, protection can work together to outmanoeuvre those who would abuse our children. It is not good enough to put in place MOUs or national plans if we are not prepared to provide access to legal aid and legal services for these children and their families. In those sigMAIN COMMITTEE nificantly poverty-stricken islands and other areas, you can have 1,000 laws in place. You can have every piece of legislation laid out and put on the table, but if those families and those children cannot access legal aid to legally prosecute the perpetrators of crimes against their children then what will we have achieved? We will have achieved a feel-good and a dogooder inspirational piece of legislation, but some countries are not prepared to enable people to prosecute through providing legal services. As most of these people are in such poverty that they cannot even put one meal a day on the table for their children-a simple meal of ricehow are they going to access legal aid and legal services to prosecute somebody who told them that their daughter was going to be helping in a household and instead was placed in a brothel? When we were in Cambodia we met the inspirational Sister Bernadette at a CARITAS program. While there, we also met men and women with HIV. We spoke with a 21-year-old young girl who weighed about 40 kilos. She had been trafficked into the sex industry and into a local brothel at three years of age. She then became infected with HIV and developed AIDS. Of course, she then had no opportunity to earn money for her pimp-her owner-so she was thrown out onto the street. She had been in that place since she was three years old. This is the plight not only of one little girl but also of thousands and thousands of little girls and little boys across many countries. This girl went to the CARITAS centre and they were able to help her, but this is happening every day. This insidious crime is being perpetrated not only by Australian men but also by men of many nationalities. You see it time and time again when you are doing this kind of work in this area. This is taking place on a day-to-day basis. This young lady needs to be provided with access to legal action against the person who ruined her life. If there is a rigorous legal prosecution process in place to make examples of the people who commit these crimes, then you will start to get to the bottom of the situation. I have been trying for some time now-and it is gaining momentum-to get a group of international lawyers together who will do pro bono work to make examples of the people who commit these crimes. Unless we provide access to legal services and legal aid, then we are simply not going to overcome this problem. Many national plans of action against the commercial exploitation of women have been put in place and this issue has led to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Child Sex Tourism Offences and Related Measures) Bill before us today. I give credit to UNICEF because they do a magnificent job in child protection, but governments need to recognise and respond to the problems. UNICEF’s Child Protection report says: Governments need to show commitment to creating strong legal frameworksand that is the point I am makingthat comply with international legal standards, policies and programmes, and to enforcing and implementing them to protect children. Laws that adequately punish people who sexually exploit children need to be in place and enforced. Organized crime, corruption and bribery need to be properly addressed. A legal framework that protects the survivors of sexual exploitation also needs to be in place. The hideous fact is that when an eightor nine-year-old child is trafficked from Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia or one of the islands into another country-such as Thailand, the Philippines or wherever-when that child is found it is the child who is put into detention. It is the child who is locked up because they are in the country illegally and so they most often become the victim again. This child has had no choice in life. It has been taken away, brutalised, used in a MAIN COMMITTEE fashion that is abhorrent to every upstanding Australian and world citizen-and so it should be-and become a victim because it is in the country illegally and will be treated as such. Honestly, that hideous thing is taking place in the world today. That shameful experience for children is going on every day across the world. We are a country trying to combat every move that a predator might make on a child. This bill starts to move onto the child pornography issue. The statistics on the commercial sexual exploitation of children show that child pornography occurs on a lesser scale than prostitution or general trafficking but is becoming more aggressive, more prominent, more likely to be taking place. There are countless stories of men travelling to countries, paying young children to come back to their accommodation, committing indecent sex acts on these children, photographing and videoing themselves whilst this is taking place and then selling these off to the world in pornography. In the many years I have been looking at the internet I have wondered how healthy the internet is for the people of the world. It seems that perverted, sick and twistedminded people who commit shameful acts on children can now, with the flick of a switch, get in touch with millions of other perverted, sick individuals who want to do the same. It then becomes almost normal or almost acceptable because there seems to be so many of these people. The more power, the more influence and the greater the ability to prosecute these perpetrators of crimes on children, let it be, so be it. Whatever the crime, let there be a punishment that fits the crime of taking a child’s mind, soul and body, and leaving that child walking around totally dead inside. Does anybody in this world have a right to do that to a child? No. People are standing up now and being counted. There are fabulous organisations providing child protection but they need support-they need support from the Australian people, from governments and from international law enforcers and they need the support of the international legal framework in order to do their job properly. We intend to, every time we can, put something forward in the Australian parliament that demonstrates that we are there monitoring and coming to get those who commit these crimes against children. I congratulate the minister and support this vitally important bill, as I am sure everybody in this parliament will. I would like to see more bills come in in order to block any avenue or effort that anyone might go to to exploit or abuse a child. ment (Child Sex Tourism Offences and Related Measures) Bill 2007 and follow that very passionate speech by the member for Riverina. Child sex tourism, in anyone’s language, is a contemptible practice and it is a particular problem in Third World countries whichperversely-do not have effective laws in place to deal with the problem nor the capacity or inclination to enforce such laws. It should be of no comfort to parents in Australia that paedophiles go overseas to satisfy their perversion-they are only emboldened when they return and, arguably, pose an even greater threat to children on our own shores. It is no great comfort that a significant number of Australians, I would argue, play a part in the child sex industry overseas, notably in Asia and the Pacific island countries. More than a decade ago, the Crimes Act was strengthened to provide jail terms for Australians who engage in sexual activity with children in foreign countries. Since these changes, a number of prosecutions have been successful; in fact, there have been more than 20 prosecutions, with some 15 convictions. It simply shows that, by strengthening our legislation to deal with these apMAIN COMMITTEE",183,Crimes Legislation Amendment Child Sex Tourism Offences And Related Measures Bill 2007
284,Mrs Mirabella (Indi) (10.39 Am),"I rise to speak on the Crimes Legislation Amendpalling offences, we can more effectively combat the problem. With this in mind, we debate this amendment today. The bill enhances the Australian government’s ability to deal with child pornography or other child abuse material overseas. Importantly, it creates new child sex offences to augment existing child sex tourism provisions. Furthermore, the legislation ensures that Australians who do commit child sex offences overseas will be prosecuted, even when a foreign country does not have in place specific legislation to deal with this contemptible behaviour or is unwilling to prosecute. Some other components of the bill include amending the child sex tourism offences to add a preparatory offence to capture the behaviour of people preparing to commit child sex tourism offences, adding to and introducing new child sex tourism offences to capture the grooming of a young person for the purposes of sex acts overseas, improving the operation of carriage service offences for grooming a child for sex, addressing a current loophole in the legislative framework by forfeiting child abuse or child pornography material used in the commission of child sex offences and repealing part IIIA of the Crimes Act 1914, which deals with child sex tourism, by inserting these provisions into the Criminal Code Act 1995. Child sex tourism, child sex offences and related matters are not edifying subject matters for debate but, as unpalatable as they are, it is necessary to debate the issues and to confront them in legislation. These abuses are not limited, as we well know, to children overseas; they also affect those children living within our own borders. Quite often we hear that children are our greatest asset and that children are the future. Yes, that is true, but such motherhood statements need to be backed up with actual and real protection. Anything that governments in the Western world can do to strengthen legislation and to provide assistance to rein in some of the preparatory activities and the industry of using and abusing children not only is most welcome but also is a fundamental responsibility of a great Western democracy such as our own. I am very proud to be part of a government that has a very strong record in protecting children from predators. We have done much as a government to protect and shield children, both in Australia and overseas, from the evil perpetrated by child sexual predators. It is not just about the recognition of the basic evil of such activities but also about the recognition of the damage-the physical, emotional and mental damage-to those victims and also their families. That damage cannot be calculated in any real or monetary terms but it is enormous. All we need to do to understand that is to speak to or read some of the stories of some of the victims of child sex offences. Only this month, many local members would have participated in the activities of National Child Protection Week. It was great to see local communities embrace this campaign. It was a great opportunity for local communities to break the silence and encourage people to speak about these issues, because speaking about them within particularly small communities is often the first step in helping those who have been victims and in addressing related social problems. White balloons, carrying a powerful message against child sex abuse, were on display in many communities, including Wangaratta and Wodonga. I was privileged to help the volunteers, who had put in so much time, distribute material and the white balloons with their message. I congratulate those who gave their time and continued to pioneer this new campaign. This important week aims to increase individual and community awareness and responsibility for the prevention of abuse and neglect of children, which may still often be a taboo subject in MAIN COMMITTEE some communities or within some families. That is something we need to work on within our own country to ensure that we break down the walls of silence and encourage people to speak out. The Australian government takes child abuse and neglect very seriously and makes a significant contribution by focusing on prevention and early intervention strategies in a very real and practical way in local communities. We have the $490 million Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, which is a major commitment to early intervention and prevention initiatives. Returning to some of the other amendments in the bill, the definition of ‘serious and organised crime’ within the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 will be amended to include existing child sex carriage service offences. This will enable the Australian Crime Commission to conduct necessary operations regarding such offences. These important amendments, we are told, have no financial implications for the Commonwealth, but they quite correctly enhance and strengthen our ability to more vigorously deal with child sex tourism offences along with matters pertaining to child pornography. They ensure comprehensive coverage of child sex offences in areas of traditional Commonwealth responsibility. They are most welcome. I commend the minister and the department for continuing to reform our laws to ensure that we can do whatever is in our power as a nation in this part of the world to try and assist those who are in the most vulnerable position, not only those in Third World or developing countries but also those without an advocate, without any assistance. While assisting those who are incapable of helping themselves-children-we should also turn our minds to those who are the perpetrators-those in privileged positions who have the wealth and the ability to travel and to exploit children sexually-and ask how we deal with this particular problem within our own communities and within our own country. How do we deal with the mind of a person who could seem quite ordinary, quite normal and quite successful and who could be a participant in various communities around the country yet be so systematically abusing children? Unfortunately, those are questions that we will need to deal with for as long as we are on this earth, because this problem is very difficult to eradicate. What we can do is do everything in our power to provide legislation with real teeth to try and bring some of these people to justice. Surely that is the first step, instead of allowing them to have a relatively free rein for their perversions. I commend the minister and I commend the bill to the House. leagues the members for Brisbane, Riverina and now Indi for their support for this measure. The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Child Sex Tourism Offences and Related Measures) Bill 2007 does make important amendments to the law by enhancing the existing child sex tourism regime, including the creation of new child sex tourism offences, particularly extraterritorially. The amendments introduce new overseas child pornography offences and provide a mechanism for forfeiture of child pornography and child abuse material used in the commission of a Commonwealth child sex offence. In relation to the matters raised during the debate, the government welcomes the opposition’s support for the measure. The bill does deserve widespread support. There is no higher priority, of course, than protecting children from predators, particularly serial predators. MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Crimes Legislation Amendment Child Sex Tourism Offences And Related Measures Bill 2007
285,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Attorney-General) (10.49 am)-in reply-I thank my colConcern was raised that the AFP may not be adequately resourced to investigate child sex tourism offences. Let me put that beyond doubt, if I may. The coalition has massively increased AFP resources, particularly during its recent budget. Over time, it has essentially doubled the AFP resources, which has many challenges, particularly in relation to counterterrorism as well as child sex matters, and it is dealing with new issues in relation to copyright piracy and related questions, for which it has been specifically resourced. Only last month, as part of the Protecting Australian Families Online initiative, we announced a further $43.5 million for the AFP to deal with online child sex exploitation and to establish a special team to deal with those matters-and that funding is for four years. It will allow the employment of an additional 90 new AFP officers in the team by 2009-10. The announcement also included increased funding for prosecutions. It is important to recognise that, if investigations produce evidence that warrants prosecutions and leads to an increase in prosecutions, the DPP be adequately resourced to follow up on these matters. I think this is an illustration, just one of course, of our funding commitment to fighting these very important crimes. I thank my colleagues the members for Riverina and Indi because in their comments today they highlighted their personal commitment to dealing with this issue, and I thank the member for Riverina for her promotion of the stronger efforts internationally. Her first hand experience of the nature of the problem, along with the Australian parliamentary delegation that visited South-East Asia, strongly informed the government’s approach in relation to this matter. The central purpose of these laws is to ensure that we have capacity to prosecute in Australia where there are no frameworks to do that in the country where the crime may have been committed. I support my colleague’s efforts to encourage legal practitioners to act pro bono for child victims in poorer countries. The question of international trafficking and abuse was also raised. The government is dealing with these issues internationally as well as domestically. In 2003, the government provided $20 million to combat people trafficking, including trafficking of children. In 2007, it provided a further $38.3 million to this cause, and this included specific funding to enhance AFP capacity in investigating these matters. I thank my colleagues for their comments and interest in this matter-I think it is important. By advancing this bill, we are ensuring that Australia has strong and comprehensive laws on sexual offences against children overseas. Enhancements to Australia’s existing child sex tourism offence regime will ensure that our laws comprehensively and effectively target those who travel abroad to engage in child sex tourism. It is something that is totally abhorrent, I think, to any sensible and well-meaning person. Those who organise such activity for others are equally reprehensible in their conduct. New offences relating to child pornography material overseas will prevent Australians who travel to countries lacking effective laws to deal with child pornography from escaping prosecution. Further, forfeiture orders will provide an important mechanism to prevent child pornography being returned or retained by those who have had it in their possession. The government is committed to the protection of children from the threat of sexual abuse. The bill will complement other current initiatives by the government in relation to the protection of children, including the measures in the Northern Territory, which have been commented on in the debate on other legislation that has been supported, as well as our efforts to protect children online. This is part of a comprehensive approach in dealing with these issues and, I think, conMAIN COMMITTEE firms our commitment, particularly to children both here and abroad. I commend the bill and thank members for their support for it. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 August, on motion by Mr Billson: That this bill be now read a second time.

In 2003, Labor initiated a Senate inquiry to hear evidence from ADF personnel and their families about the military justice system. The current process of military justice reform is largely a result of the inquiry’s report, tabled in June 2005, the Howard government’s response to it, and other reviews thereafter. In respect of the summary justice system, the original inquiry report stated its importance to the daily operation of the ADF and criticised its lack of impartiality, which it found threatened service personnel’s rights to fair tribunals. It said: The committee considers that reform is also needed to impart greater independence and impartiality into summary proceedings. Summary proceedings affect the highest proportion of military personnel. The current system for prosecuting summary offences, however, suffers from a greater lack of independence than courts martial and Defence Force Magistrate processes. The committee therefore recommends an expansion of the right to elect trial by court martial before the permanent military court, and the introduction of the right to appeal summary decisions before the independent permanent military court. This bill goes some way to addressing those concerns. It represents the next stage of reform, following on from reforms such as the establishment of the Australian Military Court, due to begin on 1 October 2007, and reform to the administrative processes for the handling of grievances. The bill reforms the summary discipline system, which relates to a range of minor offences and matters affecting the operational discipline and efficiency of the services. Labor’s view is that this bill is a step in the right direction and is supported. The bill provides some key reforms, such as establishing a right in all cases to appeal a summary authority conviction, order or punishment to a military judge of the Australian Military Court and establishing a right to elect trial by a military judge of the AMC for all but a limited number of disciplinary offences. For the remaining offences, the bill would limit available punishments, provide a right of appeal and ensure an automatic review. It also provides an automatic review by a reviewing authority of proceedings that result in conviction of a service offence.

287,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Hatton),"Thank you. I have enjoyed serving with you,",190,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2007
288,Mr Griffin,"I rise today to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2007,However, while these are positive and important measures, the bill falls far short of a full response to the need for reform to the summary discipline system and, therefore, Labor’s support is not without caveat. For example, the bill seeks to simplify proceedings by allowing that the summary authority is not bound by the rules of evidence, on the justification that this will enable the more expeditious conduct of military justice. Labor supports this in principle, noting that various safeguards will complement this provision, but cautions that the devil is in the detail. We will need to scrutinise carefully the regulations once they are drafted, and monitor and review their implementation. I will come back to Labor’s concerns and, indeed, concerns raised by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Law Council of Australia in a moment. Labor’s approach is to ensure that the military justice system competently balances dual objectives. First, it must ensure that the ADF’s operational needs for effective and efficient discipline are met and, second, it must uphold objective and independent standards of justice that the public has confidence in. These high standards are required to protect the rights of defence personnel and ensure their fair treatment. Thus, in respect of this bill, Labor is prepared to be both principled and pragmatic. This, I believe, would be the approach of a Rudd Labor government. I refer to the explanatory memorandum of this bill, which states: A summary discipline system, by its very nature, will not have the status, level of independence or the judicial attributes of the AMC, established by the Defence Legislation Amendment Act 2006. However, while a summary discipline system should have as many of those attributes as practicable, its primary purpose, as discussed above, is to facilitate operational effectiveness and, through the maintenance of discipline, support ADF operations. Consistent with the British and Canadian systems, the ADF summary discipline system forms one part of the military discipline system which, taken as a whole, must provide the safeguards necessary to protect the interests of ADF members. The Bill’s comprehensive system of elections and appeals in respect of summary authority proceedings provides a direct link to the statutorily independent AMC and in so doing enhances existing safeguards. I note that the committee’s view was likewise realistic. The committee noted the need for the bill’s speedy enactment, concluding that concerns about the bill need not impede its passage, subject to an amendment to the rules of evidence provision, which the government will move today, although not in the exact form proposed by the committee. The committee made three recommendations. The first was to strengthen the recognition of the rules of evidence by providing statutory guidance that the summary authority rules should simplify but not depart from the fundamental principles contained in the rules of evidence. This is mostly met by the government’s amendment. Labor supports the intention of this amendment, which is to reinforce the application of the fundamental principles of the rules of evidence in summary proceedings. The second recommendation was that the government comprehensively consult on any future proposed legislation that makes significant changes to the military justice system. This includes consultation with the Law Council of Australia. On this point the committee observed the need for close monitoring of the legislation and of the operation of the Australian Military Court. These are important points supported by Labor. If this government is serious about reform and about doing it well then it will take this recommendation on board. It is not in the interests of defence personnel for the government to speedily cobble together legislation and rush it through parliament without proper consideration. The third recommendation was that, subject to the first recommendation being implemented, the bill be passed. MAIN COMMITTEE Labor will continue to be vigilant about a range of concerns in this bill. The provision that states that the summary authority is not bound by the statutory or common-law rules of evidence is the most problematic. The government is introducing today an amending note to proposed section 146A that the summary authority must comply with the rules of natural justice and other basic principles of the rules of evidence. The Law Council understandably is concerned that this note in the bill does not go far enough. However, for now, Labor is prepared to offer careful support, noting that complex rules of evidence being carried out by often nonlegally trained summary authorities is not an ideal balance of the two objectives I referred to earlier: efficient operational discipline and fairness for the individual. There are also procedural safeguards-namely, the automatic review by a reviewing officer and the right of appeal to the Military Court. Labor is committed to monitoring this issue. There will be a couple of bites at this cherry, and further down the line we will need to review how effective the simpler evidence framework has been in practice. It has been suggested that a future reform could be to consider whether the full evidence framework should again apply upon appeal to the Military Court. I would suggest that this holds some merit. The Law Council has also expressed concern that the bill does not provide a right for the Director of Military Prosecutions to appeal an interlocutory judgement or order to the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal. Mr Willee of the Law Council has said that this is ‘a simple thing’ and would ensure procedural fairness. This proposal is also worthy of future consideration, and relevant, in light of the issues raised in August this year in the case of the senior army officer charged over the alleged loss of highly sensitive Commonwealth Games security plans. The Federal Court refused the government’s application for a declaration that would reverse an earlier ruling by a court martial judge advocate that the officer’s record of interview was inadmissible because it was conducted by civilian investigators. There is also a concern that some disciplinary offences will remain outside of the right to elect trial by the Australian Military Court. I want to briefly discuss the committee’s findings so far on the progress of military justice reform. The second progress report, tabled on 29 March 2007, noted some progress with reform of the ADF discipline system, including the establishment of the Australian Military Court and improvements to the redress of grievance process, but criticised some continuing problems that were brought to light by reports into the ADF’s investigative capability and the learning culture in training establishments and by inquiries into the sudden deaths of Private Jacob Kovco and of Trooper Angus Lawrence. The committee’s third progress report, tabled very recently, in September 2007, found that some long standing problems continue but allowed that these will require time to address. It also commended some progress on complaint management systems. I flag these progress reports for two reasons. The first is to emphasise that Labor recognises that there is still much more to be done and this bill is just one step along the way. Arguably it could have gone much further. The second is to draw the House’s attention to additional comments by Labor committee members in the committee’s most recent progress report about a broader aspect of Defence Legal’s conduct that has so far escaped proper examination. The growing tendency of the Department of Defence under the Howard government has been towards protracted and expensive legal proceedings. Its litany of litigation is in disarray, and MAIN COMMITTEE opinion is growing that the government is pursuing a vexatious approach to Defence litigation cases. The third progress report highlights a number of cases that grossly fail the government’s own so-called common-sense test, such as the discrimination case involving the suicide of Eleanor Tibble, where the government’s cost as at 6 February 2007 had exceeded $1.24 million, or the case involving the Albany Port Authority whereby, after a long and drawn out dispute, Defence admitted liability and agreed to pay $5.25 million to the authority for the cost of removing unexploded bombs plus $1 million towards the authority’s legal costs. Justice Templeman in the Western Australian Supreme Court expressed strong concern about the Commonwealth’s conduct, noting that it was unacceptable that the Commonwealth ‘should be profligate with public funds’ rather than seeking to resolve a practical problem efficiently. In another area, there has been some recent media attention about HMAS Melbourne cases relating to the naval collision in 1967 of the HMAS Voyager and HMAS Melbourne which killed 82 people aboard Voyager. It is considered the worse peacetime naval accident in Australia’s history. A court recently awarded a HMAS Melbourne claimant $1.24 million in damages. A firm that is currently acting for 29 plaintiffs recently estimated that the average length of trials to settle matters is seven years, and the total legal costs of these trials are between $750,000 and upwards of $2 million. This is a significant and unacceptable budget risk and frankly an area where the government is failing to meet its responsibilities to the public as a model litigant. In February 2007, approximately 65 per cent of Defence’s litigation cases had been active for more than one year. More than 140 cases had lasted for more than five years. These cases involve such matters as asbestos litigation and F111 deseal-reseal compensation. Yet, when asked at Senate estimates in February 2007 to report on the average cost of litigating matters and the percentage of cases finalised before judgement, Defence replied that it was unable to devote the time and resources to collect this information. Surely resolving these compensation cases in a fair and timely fashion is in the public interest. In short, Labor remains vigilant about ongoing reform to the military justice system. There is still much to be done to provide a best practice military justice system and the onus is on the ADF to implement these reforms effectively and swiftly, and to demonstrate that military justice can and will be conducted in a transparent and fair way. A Rudd Labor government would be committed to continuing this process of reform and making adjustments as the need becomes clear. As a broader issue, Labor is concerned that Defence dispenses justice in a range of ways that impact upon the lives and well-being of former and serving Defence personnel. All of these processes must be open to rigorous public scrutiny. Defence personnel deserve no less; the public deserves no less. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (11.08 am)-It is with great interest that I speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2007. As a former legal officer in the defence forces I have watched a number of Defence matters now from both sides, within the military and subsequently from within the government. To give you one example, when I was first elected I was on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, and at that time that committee was finishing off a performance audit from the AudiMAIN COMMITTEE tor-General’s Audit report No. 31 of 1995-96, looking at the environmental management of Commonwealth land, site contamination and pollution prevention. I had actually been working at the coalface on a number of those issues in terms of paint shops that had spilled over onto neighbouring land and various other issues where the Commonwealth could have been liable. What we wrote up as legal officers and what was eventually presented to the committee to me as a member of parliament were extraordinarily different. Obviously, in the chain of command, a lot of things happen in order to mitigate blame within the Defence Force. The Defence Force has a culture of ‘can do’. It likes to be permanently right. It is very difficult for someone in uniform to say that an error was made, and I think the member for Bruce iterated a number of those cases where there are still some outstanding matters. In fact, one of the outstanding matters is in respect of Russell Vance. Just to give you a picture of this, I will quote from a Bulletin article from 2005: Vance was once a high flier. The son of a distinguished naval officer, Vance did what came naturally and joined the Royal Australian Air Force as an apprentice Scientific Instrument Maker at 16. He was Apprentice of the Year, later matriculated and, at 24, proudly became a commissioned officer. His career trajectory continued steeply skywards until in 1993 he was appointed executive officer (second in command) at the RAAF’s 10 Squadron (P3C Orion base) at Butterworth, Malaysia. He soon became acting Commanding Officer. RAAF colleagues recall Vance as a “tough bastard” and a stickler for defence rules and regulations, though honest and brutally straightforward. He could be abrasive and his style was not for the fainthearted. But that’s why his superiors valued him. Indeed, they had sent him to Malaysia to sort out 10 Squadron, which had gained a reputation as something of a “holiday camp”. Having served at Butterworth myself, I can say that it was not exactly a holiday camp but it certainly had a large surge capacity in terms of the work available for the people deployed there. The extraordinary thing in the Russell Vance case was that, outside of the chain of command-coincidentally-his subordinates made a complaint to a social worker, which somehow made it to his superior officer without his knowledge and he was counselled. He took objection to that and said: ‘I don’t know what I’m being counselled for. CanI see the allegations made to the social worker?’ Lo and behold, after that tiny incident, we ended up having a board of inquiry, which at last count cost something like $6 million. In my capacity as the squadron legal officer at air command, I remember being astounded when the fees for the legal officers exceeded $50,000. This matter went on. Even after my election, I appeared before that board of inquiry again, in 1996, and it was still ongoing years later. That high-profile case and a number of others iterated by the member for Bruce brought about the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the effectiveness of the Australian military justice system. The committee did a major inquiry, and that report was tabled in June 2005. This government made some substantial changes to ensure the independence and effectiveness of our service tribunals. The Defence Force magistrates and the court martial systems were abolished and the Australian Military Courts were introduced. These are outside the chain of command. They have five-year appointments and there has been a real effort to get some independence into the military justice system. MAIN COMMITTEE This bill constitutes a second major step in restructuring those service tribunals, and it reflects the government’s commitment to a fair, transparent and accountable disciplinary system. I welcome the member for Bruce’s monitoring of this system because, on my departure from the parliament, I am happy to know that someone is still watching this issue. Rest assured that our very effective minister in this area will be ahead of the Labor Party, on most counts anyway. It is an interesting piece of legislation for me because a lot of my constituents have said to me over the years: ‘In my day, we used to put all of these vagrants and graffiti artists and all of these young people with criminal records who go in and out of juvenile detention centres into the Army. Put them in the Army. There should be compulsory military service. Sign them up.’ In fact, a lot of the crotchety old warrant officers that I know openly admit that they have saved many a young man from himself and from a criminal career by beating some sense into him in the military. When I was in the Air Force we had 15,000 people. Today we have 11,000 people. The entry requirements to get into our military today, with the equipment that we use, mean that every one of them has to be highly skilled. This government has finally fitted out this Defence Force with equipment that will sustain them in defending Australia. One of the real motivating factors of my election into parliament was the standing joke in the Air Force in 1996, when I was elected, which was: ‘Don’t let the war be longer than three days because we are fitted with but not for.’ I think today we have probably gone for the reverse-we are fitted for, but not quite with, so we might have to have a look at our Defence personnel numbers. Every single one of those personnel has to be fully trained, fully capable and really highly skilled. The Defence Force is not a reform school. It is not a place into which, as my constituents say, to put our vagrants and knock some sense into them, and give them a good career and the ability to pay a mortgage and raise a family. Consequently, the ‘behind-the-hangers justice’ that used to happen-that clip over the ear by the warrant officer-is just not on. If you are asking someone with a university degree or a trade or that sort of thing to serve in the Defence Force, military justice has to move on, has to get with the professionalism of a modern defence force. So, too, must its disciplinary system because, at the end of the day, the chain of command must still work. The chain of command is fundamental to the functioning of any military. So how do you discipline someone for a breach of that chain of command? I think it starts out with major education, right from recruit training, in the following: ‘What is an order?’, ‘What is a lawful order, an order that must be obeyed, and what is an order that does not have to be obeyed?’, and ‘What is an order outside of the rights of your commanding officer?’ We have heard, for instance, the story of young British soldiers patrolling a border to Ireland. On seeing a car on approach to the checkpoint, one of the soldiers fired at the car-and that was perfectly legitimate under the rules of engagement. The minute that car went through the checkpoint, the bullet he fired, which killed a young person in the car, came from the rear-and that was against the rules of engagement. That young soldier was consequently charged and had to defend himself. That is the split-second difference between right and wrong in a military situation. Our young people need to be aware of their rights and the obligations that go with the awesome power that they wield. We hope that the military justice system is never used. But, if it is used, it may be on the unique ground of ‘disobeying a lawful order’, to which there is no MAIN COMMITTEE civilian equivalent. I do not think you can ask a civilian court to even understand the culture. When someone in a superior command position says, ‘Jump,’ you say, ‘How high?’ It is not a situation in which one might question; it is not a situation in which one might get legal advice. We are looking for a tribunal that can deploy. It must be able to respond to the needs of the military, whether they are going to Timor, Afghanistan, Iraq or wherever. Wherever we are putting our people, this court needs to be able to go with them and act effectively. One of the amendments that we have made is to have a new time limit, of up to three months from the time a member is charged to the date of trial by summary authority; that is to avoid delays. You have a three-month window in which to charge and try people. I think that is a huge improvement on what used to happen in my day. I used to see some matters that would take up to two years to go through the system. At the end of the day the person charged might have been found innocent, but by that time they would have put in their discharge and be separating from the Defence Force and would have been very browned-off with the services. In this day and age, where we are looking for our recently exited Defence personnel to be part of our reserve forces-they have the training, they have the capability, they ought to be part of our defence of the nation-we do not want people separating from the Defence Force in a state of anything other than good humour and affection towards their old employer, such that they would come and help out should the need arise. As it is, far too many of our defence people, as the member for Bruce pointed out, separate very acrimoniously. That is something that, by working through our grievance and disciplinary procedures, we certainly hope to remedy and thus reduce the angst over time taken, transparency, fairness and the way they see they have been dealt with. It is important that they see that it is accurate and that they feel they have had justice. Then, even if they do subsequently separate from the Defence Force, it should be with good will. The member for Bruce named a number of cases, but I will take him to task on one-that is, the Voyager versus Melbourne incident. I think the Commonwealth is on very strong ground there. I am appalled at the legal company that induced one of my constituents to run a case. At no time was he told he would be liable for all of the legal fees. This law company convinced this fellow to go all the way to the High Court, where he lost, on a case that is 40 years old. He had to get over the initial problem of the delay of 40 years. That was very unlikely to happen. The legal company has told my constituent in writing: ‘Don’t you worry about it. You’ll die before the Commonwealth chases you for that debt.’ There are some lawyers out there who add to the angst and financial detriment of ex-defence personnel. This person was a self-funded retiree. He had his own home, and he and his wife were managing independent of the government. Since this legal matter they have become quite destitute, and they are beyond the age of ever working again. He is over 65. Some of the examples of the member for Bruce need to be taken with a grain of salt, but others we could have dealt with a lot faster. One case I mentioned earlier is that of Russell Vance. I just cannot believe that matter is still going on after all this time. If Russell had had the opportunity, under the current AMC system, he would not have separated from the defence forces in such an acrimonious circumstance. Also, you would have seen these procedures enhancing his right to command rather than substantially undermining it. With the vagaries of everything that went on, we had a MAIN COMMITTEE situation in Butterworth where P3C Orion operational aircraft were unable to function. A functional, operational part of the Defence Force was not able to operate in the chain of command. That can never occur. At all times there must be someone in charge making decisions and making orders, with systems in place, rather than personnel having personal issues and problems and chewing up resources and time. These matters need to be resolved expeditiously, very quickly, transparently, fairly and with everyone’s rights respected. The member for Bruce made an interesting point about our ability to collect information on the numbers of matters that we have resolved. That is something the Defence Force should possibly look at. It will probably come through in the various progress reports on reforms over time. This is our second instalment. It is something that I have always had an interest in, although contesting three by-elections in my first term and then being a minister in my second I never really had as much time to devote to it as I would have liked. It is great now, in the twilight of my political career, to see that something is being done to remedy a lot of the conflict of loyalties that legal officers feel towards their chain of command, the uniform, the operational imperatives and making sure that their clients get a fair trial. We have gone a substantial way to making sure that this is effective. I will go to some of the key points. There is the right to appeal to a court martial or Defence Force magistrate following a summary trial. That is one of the amendments we have made. Currently there is only a right to petition a reviewing authority. Again looking at and tightening up a lot of the offences, one of the key offences-most frequent offences-that I dealt with in my time as a legal officer was the unauthorised discharge of a weapon. That is something that has no civilian equivalent. Men are on a firing range. You are legitimately firing at targets but if you do not do so according to an order that is something that is taken incredibly seriously and you will be charged for it. I do not know that on any other firing range anywhere in Australia that is an offence or even comes close to being one. There are a lot of unique situations to our military that justify a separate tribunal, that justify something that is unique for them that also does not impede their operational imperatives or training objectives. One of the other things that I like about this bill is the automatic disqualification of a summary authority to try offences where that summary authority has been involved in the investigation of a service offence, the issuing of a warrant or the preferring of a charge. I know in my time in the Defence ForceI was frequently preparing the charge, appointing the defending officer and the prosecuting officer and probably giving advice to the CEO as well. It probably can be done a lot more transparently than that. The other thing we have done is strengthen the rights and duties of legal officers in particular to ensure that the exercise of their legal duties is independent of undue command influence. That is another important thing, because often the commanding officer before whom your various prosecuting and defending officers are referring is also writing the officer evaluation report of the legal officer. I think that is a very important change that we have made as well. There are a number of excellent changes in the second tranche of restructuring our service tribunals to give our modern, effective, very skilled and highly effective Defence Force the similar and same military justice system that it deserves for the 21st century. I commend the bill to the House. ter for Defence) (11.27 am)-in reply-I thank the members for their contributions today. The MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2007
289,Mr Billson (Dunkley,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister Assisting the MinisDefence Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 represents one of the most wide-ranging reforms to the ADF summary discipline system since the introduction of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982. I particularly thank the member for Lindsay for her welcome contribution to this debate and the earlier debate on the Australian Military Court legislative framework. Her background as a former serving Air Force legal officer has placed her in an excellent position to add value, practical insight and experience to this process, and I commend her for her remarks and wish her well with her post-parliamentary career. I hope that it is as satisfying and fulfilling as you hope it can be. Good luck with that. I also thank the member for Bruce for his contribution. There is a welcome air of cooperation and collaboration between the opposition and the government on this measure. His encouragement to maintain an observation about how the system actually operates in practice is well understood. We have a periodic reporting framework for the whole military justice implementation package that the government has introduced, and he can be assured we will be closely observing how it operates. The bill introduces far-reaching reforms to the ADF summary discipline system flowing from the government’s response to the 2005 Senate report on the effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system. My colleague the member for Lindsay has touched on a few examples where it certainly was suboptimal and there was considerable room for improvement. This bill enhances the summary procedures by introducing a number of significant safeguards such as the automatic right of appeal for summary trials to a new Australian Military Court, yet still enables commanders to maintain effective discipline while recognising the need for timeliness, which is critical in operational circumstances, and the need for fairness to protect the rights of individuals. Again, the member for Lindsay has accurately characterised those unique demands within the military context and the regimental demands of service-a very helpful insight again. I also alert members to the fact that I will, at the conclusion of this speech, in the consideration in detail stage, move an amendment to further enhance the compliance with the rules of natural justice and other principles of the rules of evidence in proceedings before the summary authority. That has been alluded to by the member for Bruce, and I welcome his support for that amendment. As I said when I introduced this important bill, commanders use the summary discipline system on a daily basis. The system is integral to their ability to lead the people for whom they are responsible in order to ensure their welfare and safety. It is fundamental to the Australian Defence Force’s success in operations, success of which every Australian can be rightly proud. In addition to the right of appeal to the new Australian Military Court on conviction and punishment, the bill also introduces an equally important reform in the right of a defence member to elect a trial by a military judge of the Australian Military Court for all but a limited number of certain disciplinary offences. If the right of election were completely discretionary on the part of the individual member, it is not too difficult to imagine circumstances in which the exercise of that right could have the potential to affect the operational effectiveness of a unit. It is therefore necessary for some limitation to be placed on those circumstances in which such a right can normally be exerMAIN COMMITTEE cised. This has been done by listing in schedule 1A a number of offences, essentially disciplinary in nature, in relation to which a member has no initial right to elect trial by the AMC and which must be dealt with by a summary authority in the first instance. For example, it would be anomalous if an absence of two hours could not be dealt with by a commanding officer on the spot. That absence has implications, particularly when there is scope to deal with the issue on the spot. This recognises the imperative that discipline must be maintained within Australia and overseas, in peace and in war, and that relatively minor matters of a disciplinary nature ought to be dealt with as speedily as possible. The list of offences to which this provision will apply meets the requirements of the services and recognises that summary discipline, by its nature, has to be quick, fair and as simple as possible, while at the same time providing the safeguard of an unlimited right of appeal should a member convicted under this arrangement wish to exercise it. Additional safeguards have been included for these offences, such as limited punishments and a requirement for summary authorities to offer a right of election if, prior to making a finding of guilt, they determine that the more severe punishments that are available to them might apply. If there is a very profound impact of the likely action then the process provides further avenues for the accused person. These additional safeguards for the accused will be further supported by the right of a convicted member to appeal a conviction or punishment to the Australian Military Court and the automatic review of all summary trials. The review of the proceedings of summary authorities not only is a means of ensuring accountability but provides additional safeguards for members of the ADF. Where there has been a technical error, such as the imposition of a punishment which is not authorised, the reviewing authority may refer the matter back to the summary authority for it to be reopened and corrected within the authority. This is an important safeguard and will further protect the rights of defence members who are tried and convicted by a summary authority and who may not exercise their right of appeal to the Australian Military Court. Certain more severe punishments will also not take effect until approved by the reviewing authority, which may quash a punishment or impose a less severe punishment, which will then be subject to an automatic right of appeal. The bill also introduces a number of other significant enhancements to ensure the right balance is struck between maintaining effective discipline and protecting the rights of individuals. I canvassed all of these enhancements when I introduced the bill, but I would like to quickly touch on and emphasise a number of them, which include: enabling service tribunals to deal with offences in respect of a more contemporary range of illegal narcotics up to the trafficable amount in Australia, to support the enforcement and the application of the ADF’s no drug policy; allowing the suspension in whole or in part of a greater range of punishments under the DFDA, which will enable the part suspension of detention where the circumstances of a case or mitigation establish that this is appropriate; removing the separate and more severe scale of punishments for the Navy, which is no longer relevant and which will provide for consistency with the other two services; providing that the status of a summary conviction is expressed to be for service purposes only so that members of the ADF are not unduly affected by disciplinary infringements long after they have left the services; and having a new time limit, which the member for Lindsay touched on, of ‘as soon as practicable within three MAIN COMMITTEE months from the time the member is charged to the date of trial by summary authorities’ to ensure the timely handling of summary trials. Another major reform is the introduction of a simplified evidence framework. The evidence regime currently applicable to summary trials is overly complex and not easy to apply by persons without formal legal training. It includes both Commonwealth and ACT evidence legislation, in addition to extensive policy guidance. The bill will make it clear that a summary authority will not be subject to the same formal rules of evidence that apply to the Australian Military Court but must not depart from the fundamental principles underpinning the rules of evidence. The new evidentiary framework is based on the successful system which has been in use for many years by the Canadian forces. The requirement in the Commonwealth Criminal Code-as applied by section 10 of the DFDA-dealing with the principles of criminal responsibility, including the burden and onus of proof, will remain applicable in summary trials. The very important protection against self-incrimination is also being enshrined in the DFDA to avoid any doubt about its continued application, notwithstanding the exclusion of the formal rules of evidence. The summary trial process must be fair and be seen to be fair. Although summary authorities are not courts in the ordinary sense, it is important that the requirements of natural justice and procedural fairness are adhered to. These include the absence of bias and the ability for a person to know and be able to answer a case made against them. To further strengthen the recognition of the rules of evidence, and as I have already stated, I will be introducing an amendment to the bill today, as recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in its recent report on the provisions of the bill. As recommended by the committee, the amendment will strengthen the recognition of the rules of evidence but not mandate their application. Additionally, the bill provides for the making of the Summary Authority Rules, which will be ‘legislative instruments’ as defined in the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and be subject to parliamentary scrutiny via the registration and disallowance provisions in that act. In proceedings before a summary authority the summary authority shall act in accordance with any rules made by the statutorily independent chief military judge. The safeguards provided by the rules may include the compellability of witnesses, the manner of taking evidence and such other matters as considered necessary or appropriate by the chief military judge. The overriding safeguard, however, is that nothing in this proposal will affect a member’s appeal or election rights to the Australian Military Court from a summary trial. In summary, the bill, together with the proposed amendments, introduces significant enhancements to the ADF summary discipline system that give effect to the agreed recommendations of the 2005 Senate report while allowing it to operate quickly, to be as simple as possible and to be capable of proper, fair and correct application by commanding officers where it is necessary to deal with misconduct that could undermine command authority and impinge on successful military operations. I commend the bill and the proposed amendments to the House. I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. MAIN COMMITTEE Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. ter for Defence) (11.38 am)-by leave-I move government amendments (1) and (2): (1) Schedule 3, item 8, page 32 (after line 17), at the end of subsection 146A(1) (before the note), add: Note 1: The summary authority must comply with the rules of natural justice and other basic principles of the rules of evidence. (2) Schedule 3, item 8, page 32 (line 18), omit “Note:”, substitute “Note 2:”. These amendments strengthen the evidentiary protections available to an accused person in a summary trial, as reflected in the proposed evidence provisions in new section 146A of the bill. Amendment (1) will insert note 1 to section 146A to state that a summary authority must comply with the rules of natural justice and any other basic principles of the rules of evidence in proceedings before a summary authority. This amendment will further reinforce the application of the principles of the rules of evidence in summary proceedings. Amendment (2) changes the existing note to section 146A to note 2 to reflect the proposed amendment. I commend these amendments to the Committee. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House with amendments. Family and Human Services Committee Report Debate resumed from 13 September, on motion by Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: That the House take note of the report. about The winnable war on drugs and the impact of illicit drug use on our families. Firstly, I would like to sincerely thank the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, Bronwyn Bishop, for her valuable time and expertise in taking a down-to-earth and honest approach towards a genuine attempt at winning this growing and serious war, which involves our vulnerable Australian drug addicts. All members of the committee were committed right from the beginning to having a workable position and making recommendations that could make a real difference in winning this enormous battle. We are all very grateful to the hard working, efficient secretariat, who were so dedicated to reaching such a positive outcome. A big thankyou to each and every one of you. We received 188 submissions, and I personally want to thank all the people who made those submissions for their contribution to the positive outcomes of this report. It was a very humbling experience to listen to the witnesses who gave evidence at our hearings. I have great admiration for the many family members and reformed and current drug addicts who bared their grief and real-life experiences so we could see first hand the enormous struggle they have each and every day. We owe it to them to ensure that this report makes a real difference in helping them to win this battle. I will do all I can to see the government of the day adopt all 31 recommendations. MAIN COMMITTEE",197,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 2007
290,Mr Billson (Dunkley,Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minis,201,Committees
291,Mrs Elson (Forde) (11.40 Am),"I am very grateful to be given the opportunity to speakIn taking evidence, we found there was clearly an issue that has to be addressed very urgently, and that is the need to have a nationally based helpline so that family members, when they know they need help urgently, can ring a given number and be given a list of help groups within their own area. As it stands now, when you want to make that first phone call, there is not too much positive information about where you should go next and who can help you. Having a national helpline would help those families who need to access urgent support straight away. People who want to get off drugs may only have a window of opportunity that lasts 24 hours. If they do not get help within the first 24 hours, they may go back to their drug taking because there was no-one there to give them instant help and say, ‘Go here and get this done straight away,’ or, ‘Here are the numbers that you should access to get that important assistance immediately.’ An important recommendation of the report is the call for medical studies of babies of drug-using mothers. We have never had any extensive studies that show the ongoing health and mental effects of drug taking on our next generation-innocent young babies who are brought into this world by mums heavily on drugs. Another important recommendation is random breath testing to check for people driving under the influence of drugs. We have had an enormous increase in accidents on our roads, and evidence has proven that we need to take this issue of drug use and driving very seriously, so I highly commend that recommendation to the House. An important aspect of this inquiry was that there were a lot of submissions and a lot of words spoken on harm prevention. I am 100 per cent certain that all across Australia we have to send a very clear message from our governments to our children about the importance of harm prevention. We do not want to send the mixed message of harm minimisation, because a lot of young kids think that means that you can take drugs on weekends but not through the week. They think that, if you try drugs, especially party drugs and recreational drugs-those awful terms we hear-you can actually leave them alone through the week. But we all know that that is the start of being a full-blown drug addict. SoI highly recommend that we look at that. Some rehabilitation centres have a policy that you cannot rehabilitate an addict and you cannot let one come into your facilities unless they want to be rehabilitated. Anyone who has had drug problems within their family knows-and we heard this evidence before our committee-that those poor addicts do not have a mind of their own. They are being controlled by a drug, so they do not really know whether they want to be rehabilitated or not. We should be giving them the opportunity of being drug free for a couple of weeks while they regain some of their thinking, not denying them access to drug rehabilitation centres. We owe it to our young Australians not to fund a drug industry which promotes harm minimisation. We should be sending a very clear message that harm prevention and treatment are the ultimate aim for making a person drug free. The most potent messages from this report are the personal stories submitted to the inquiry, and they reflect the struggle, the hurt, the damage and the hope. TodayI want to reflect on some of those personal messages because I think they tell the real story. It hits home that it is not politicians giving a message but people actually crying out for help. This one young drug addict mum, when talking about her six-year-old daughter, said: MAIN COMMITTEE She must have witnessed me using, she made gestures of putting a pen into her arm, like a syringe. She was found to have an old break in her right leg, broken elbow in three places, depressed skull fracture and a broken wrist before starting school. There are the grandmothers who are left looking after their grandchildren at a time when they should be retiring and enjoying their life after raising a family. One grandmother said: Imagine you are three years old. You wake in the morning and your mother is in bed asleep. You cannot wake her. You are very hungry. There is no food in the cupboard or the fridge. Your brother and sister have gone to school. You eat dry dog food from the bowl on the floor. You get out all your toy cars. These are the only toys you have so you sit in your room for the next 4 5 hours playing obsessively with the cars. … Your mother and her boyfriend are in the kitchen. You are not allowed in there. They are smoking dope. You do not like the smell. You play in your room with the cars. Your mother brings you some burnt food for dinner. It tastes awful but you are very hungry so you eat it. Later you will get some more dog food when your mother is asleep again. The dog food tastes good. A teenager said: Imagine ... You have grown up and lived with violence since you were born. Your mother delivers drugs to people in the neighbourhood and to schools transporting them in your stroller … You watch your mother through three drug addict, abusive and violent partners. You see her bashed and abused time and again. You watch pornographic videos and see pictures of your mother and her partner naked on the walls of the house. You are forced to live in a caravan in the backyard with drug addict men, friends of your mother and her partner. They abuse you but you can’t tell anyone. … By the time you are 18yrs you will have been expelled from three schools and have been in and out of a Juvenile Detention Centre several times. You will be addicted to drugs, petrol sniffing and alcohol. You will have a criminal record. At 18yrs old you will be treated in the Courts as an adult. No one has ever taught you how to be one. This is from a drug addict-and this is a very clear message on harm minimisation-who said: I survived harm minimisation, because it literally threatened to destroy my life and my family’s life through the messages that it can implant into that structure and the way it threatened to tear us apart, literally. It was almost like that was its objective; it did not want me to escape my addiction, it wanted me to stay stuck there. I think the final quote hit home. This is from a parent-and a lot of parents go through this silently-who said: Through conflict about the drugs and the subsequent lifestyle including some criminal activity my son chose to live away from the family home. At the time we were relieved and grateful for the peace until eventually he was brought home by friends who could see his downward spiral and knew he needed to be cared for. He weighed 45 kgs, by now the father of a one year old son who I was helping to raise. The heart break of watching his toddler son try to rouse his dad as he lay drug riddled on the couch was too much to bear. My son would slowly raise his arm and tousle his son’s hair, the deep love fighting against the grain of the addiction. I learnt to live with my fear. I was fearful he would die; he would be bashed, hurt in an accident, attacked by other drug users, jailed, bashed by police or just disappear. My body jarred with the sound of a siren, a newsflash, a sudden thud ... MAIN COMMITTEE My grieving began. I grieved for his lost potential, his lost personality, his own peace, and my wants for him as a person. Constantly I have had to re-evaluate my own values, I have let go of my need to have a house with walls intact, furniture that matches, and my own career and I have peeled back the layers to value the person, to value keeping him alive at all costs. I would like to close on that particular remark because this is what this report is all about: winning the war on drugs. I hope that all governments around Australia take the time to read this. It is a most positive report and one that could make a big difference to all families and drug addicts in Australia. in changing the order of speakers today. I would like to speak to this report because it is such an important issue in the community of Wakefield and in fact across Australia. I would like to make a few opening remarks dealing with the sentiments that have been raised by various witnesses throughout the progress of the inquiry but also the responses from some people looking at the recommendations from the inquiry. First and foremost, I would like to say that the tone that came through consistently, from most witnesses and certainly the people that we talked to who have been affected by drugs, is that this is about being tough on drugs and not tough on users. It is about being tough on the dealers, the people who are pushing drugs, tough on the smugglers and tough on the people who, for whatever reason, would actually promote the use of drugs in some manner. But it is about dealing with great compassion for the people who are trapped in drug use and for those who are affected by drug use and all of the associated issues in our society. This inquiry very clearly highlighted the fact that the effects of drug use touch so many people-first and foremost the users themselves. There was ample evidence about the destruction to their lives-not only their lifestyle but the quality of their lives, their potential for the future, their health, their mental health and their relationships, most importantly. Secondly, there are their families. This is not just their immediate family members, such as a spouse; particularly we heard from parents who are bearing the brunt of still loving their child, trapped in the addiction of drugs, and trying to balance providing support and love for their child whilst managing the, in some cases, almost unmanageable violence. There is the use and abuse of families that so often seems to accompany people who are trapped in an addiction that they cannot control. There is the effect on siblings where one child is using drugs-the effect on the remainder of the family as they seek to live a somewhat normal life while the parents are trying to fight that battle and hold that balance. Very disturbingly, as my colleague has just mentioned, there is the effect on children of drug users and the debilitating start they have to life when all of those factors start coming to bear in an environment that, while it should be supportive, nurturing and setting them up for the rest of their lives, is actually destroying the very foundation that normal, balanced children should have at the start of their lives. At a broader level, there are many victims of crime. There is much crime that is associated with drugs, and the Australian Institute of Criminology just this year has shed some further light on that. It has highlighted that people in police detention for various offences are four times more likely to be illicit drug users than the general population. That is a huge number of people, and includes users of drugs such as cannabis. Well over half of the adults in custody have tested positive to cannabis, whereas a quarter have tested positive to methamphetamines MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Committees
292,Mr Fawcett (Wakefield) (11.49 Am),"I thank members opposite for their considerationand about 10 per cent, or just under, to heroin. There is a high degree of connection between people who are using drugs and the crimes that they commit. If you look through the range of crimes, you can see that there are crimes of violence and property theft which come from the addiction and the desire to obtain more. In some cases, particularly with ice, there is the violence that comes purely as a result of the drug. So there is a large effect on society which is directly impacted by drugs. Lastly, there is the impact on the taxpayer, who is increasingly footing the bill that is coming from the mental health impacts on those who have been using drugs. This is even for drugs that, going back a couple of decades, many in our community were pushing and advocating as quite safe. There are even some today who are still saying that those drugs are safe, yet the evidence is clearly against that. The high proportion of people in our jails who have that link to drugs means there is an additional drain on the taxpayer for supporting the policing, the justice and the jail system. Lastly the need for rehabilitation and work on the health of these addicts means that there is a large amount of funding and resources required just to treat the results of drug use. BeforeI get on to the recommendations of the report, I would like to thank the witnesses who were prepared to come forward, particularly those who were drug users themselves and families who have been affected by drug use. It is no easy thing to come before a formal committee, people who are strangers to you, and to bear your soul about the things that have affected you and your family. I commend them and thank them for being prepared to do that. I would like to turn briefly to some of the recommendations from the report. Recommendation 1 states: The Commonwealth Government continue its allocation of significant resources to policing activity as a highly effective prevention method. I strongly support this recommendation. I particularly support the fact that we have increasingly seen high levels of cooperation between the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police, state police, state crime commissions, the Taxation Office, Australian Customs and AUSTRAC. I think it is important that we continue to see this high degree of combined activity across levels of government so that we can tackle the scourge which is the illicit drug trade in Australia. It is important to see that out of that come the initiatives like the proceeds of crime funds which go back into the community to try and help overcome some of the problems. I welcome some of the money that has come back into South Australia, for example, into the Baptist Community Services, where the Westcare Drug Intervention Program has been able to train Indigenous workers to help them target people with a history of abuse and the effects that flow from that-the family breakdown, the homelessness and the mental health issues. Recommendation 4 talks about funding going to organisations which support a drug-fee outcome versus a drug use or management outcome. There has been a fair bit of controversy around this and I think sometimes people have been in vehement agreement but have been working with different definitions of terms. The one comment I would like to make is that this recommendation is identifying in clear terms that there are some individuals and some organisations who genuinely believe that drug use can be managed. They see that management as being a long-term outcome. Some of the recommendations and some of the evidence that came through from witnesses highlighted the incredibly damaging effect on their preparedMAIN COMMITTEE ness to say no to drugs when they had a body, purportedly a professional body there to help them, telling them that they could make the choice if they wanted to use drugs occasionally or on a regular basis and that it could be managed. They provided that message and that message took away and undermined many of the other messages which are being sent out to people in our community, particularly our young people, that say drugs are damaging and they are addictive. I think it is important that we do work with organisations that are prepared to use a range of methods. They may include some methods that provide substitutes or support for people to keep them healthy and alive, but the end aim of those organisations must be to see people come off the drugs and be drug free. I think that is the important message to come out of that. Recommendation 5 deals with the difficult issue of care for children and the balance that has to be achieved between what is in the best interests of the children and, where possible, maintaining the connection between the biological parent and the child. There is a huge network of people in our community who selflessly give of their time to provide foster care for children. I would like to take this occasion to bring to the attention of the House Susan Buckskin and William Sansbury, people in Wakefield who have been fostering for over 21 years and have just recently been given a Foster Carer National Recognition Award. The feedback I get from people in Wakefield and from broader South Australia, where I have been working with foster carers for a while, is that the long-term impacts of frequent moves and relocations-going back to the parents, then back to foster care and then back to the parents-is damaging for children. I have spoken to a number of foster carers who are strong advocates of reconnecting children with parents wherever possible, where it is safe and in the child’s best interests to do so. But they also tell me about the need for an acceptance of the fact that longer term foster care arrangements or indeed adoption must be considered in the mix. We must not exclude longer term care for these children, because for some of them that will be the only option that gives them a start in life that is fair and reasonable. Recommendation 16 deals with education. I think it is disturbing when we look at reports such as the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime report, which looks at some overseas evidence, and the Drug Advisory Council of Australia report, which looks at the fact that the use of drugs by teenagers in Australia is some four times higher than in countries like Sweden and that some 29 per cent of Australian teenagers between 14 and 19 in 2004 had tried drugs. We got evidence from young people who were witnesses saying that they experimented. There is that natural teen desire to go outside the bounds and do something that is perhaps frowned upon, and part of it is because they do not have compelling evidence that says: ‘This will damage you.’ As we look at some of the campaigns which have been run overseas that highlight issues that are important to young people-things like their appearance, their health and their ability to participate in activities that they want to participate in-that kind of very hard-hitting education campaign is something that we, as a matter of priority, need to invest in so that our young people are equipped with the knowledge that they need to make choices about their own health and their own future. Recommendation 17 talks about a consistent message. This just builds on recommendations that came out of the ministerial council on drugs back in December 2006, where one of the resolutions adopted was to discourage the use of terms such as ‘recreational’ and ‘party MAIN COMMITTEE drugs’. YetI notice that as recently as last week the media in particular were still referring to people taking recreational and party drugs. I believe that this recommendation and the one following it are sound in that where we can exercise authority we should do, to constrain government funded bodies from using those terms and to seek earnestly the support of the broader media organisations to refrain from those uses because it sends a mixed message to our young people. If we are serious about telling young people that, based on the evidence, based on the life experience of so many people here in Australia, drugs damage them then why do we accept that people in our community, particularly in the media, are sending messages that these are party drugs or recreational drugs? They are messages that say: ‘These things are okay to use because we say recreation is good for you. We say that it’s okay to let your hair down occasionally, have a party.’ Those terms are completely at odds with the facts and the outcomes that these young people will experience. I cannot emphasise strongly enough the need for the media to come on board in the interests of our young people and our community and in the interests of the children to come who will be affected by young adults who become drug addicts and then become parents-they have a role to play in this and they cannot just step back and continue in their current practice when the results of that are so clear. I commend this report to the House. I commend it to the government and to the broader Australian community. I ask them to look at the fact that this is about being tough on drugs but it is also about having compassion-real compassion-that says we are prepared to take some action and put some resources individually, as a government and as corporations, including the media in Australia, to get a better future for young people and those who have been affected by drugs in Australia. opportunity to say a few words about what has been a somewhat controversial report. At the outset, I acknowledge in the background four members of the secretariat-I should put my glasses on-who have travelled along the road with us, have been there, have heard our discussions, our concerns and our internal debates about whether this recommendation or that recommendation should be unanimous and have seen three members of the Labor Party put forward a dissenting report on six of the recommendations. I would also like to acknowledge the chairmanship of this committee: the honourable member for Mackellar has done a wonderful job in bringing all this together. The winnable war on drugs: the impact of illicit drug use on families report has an illustration of six faces before and after. It is a bit like those cigarette packets where you have this big warning, ‘Don’t participate.’ Just looking at this and some of the other photos of people who sadly have fallen victim to substance abuse is horrific. As the longest serving member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, having been a member since 1993 when I first entered the parliament, I have seen many excellent reports. This is another one of those. This committee has a wonderful reputation for dealing with issues that are important for and to Australian families. Despite our different experiences and backgrounds, the 10 members of the committee have worked cooperatively to produce this fine but somewhat controversial report. We heard extensively from witnesses, received I think 188 submissions and travelled not quite the length and breadth of Australia. As I said, I have been on this committee longer than MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Committees
293,Mr Quick (Franklin) (12.04 Pm),"I, like other members of this committee, welcome theanybody and I was there when it produced the Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities, an inquiry which went across two parliaments. To her credit, the chairperson said: ‘That report was about drugs, licit and illicit, and the impact on Australian society. Why don’t we look at the impact of illicit drug use on families?’ We saw it, warts and all. Sadly, I think people on both sides of politics have recognised that the government’s response to the Road to recovery report was a pretty pathetic response to an issue that governments of all persuasions, both state and federal, are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on. It is not an easy issue to resolve, because, once you are addicted, quite often you do not succeed in getting off the drug the first time. You are a repeat offender in the nicest way. As someone who has dealt first hand with many families of drug addicted young people and, in some cases, drug addicted parents, I have seen them wanting to get off, trying and failing. Sadly, in my state we have the great number of six detox beds for the whole state. If you do want to get off drugs, you cannot get into a detox bed, let alone get into rehab. In the 31 recommendations, we are urging all the participants, both state and federal, the agencies and the NGOs that are involved in picking up the pieces of these people-there were some wonderful ones that we received evidence from-to work collectively and collaboratively to ensure that those who do want to get off drugs can enter a service as soon as they want to try, rather than be told, ‘Come back in three months and perhaps there will be a detox bed for you,’ or where you may have done your detox, but you cannot get into rehab for another couple of months and you re-offend. I think it was in Darwin that we had someone come in off the street-a young chap if I remember rightly-explaining just how hard it is to succeed. I guess there are two sides to every story, and we have heard evidence about the arguments between the zero tolerance and the harm minimisation advocates. As the chairperson has said, there is a bit of an industry out there, and it is interesting to see both sides of the spectrum. One of the things I have tried to do in my almost 15 years here is to listen to both sides of the argument, because we are arguing about people’s lives. If we are going to expend a huge amount of money, we need to ensure that that money is spent wisely. I would like to think that none of us have all the answers. We need to work to ensure that not one child in the future decides to pop that pill or to stick that needle in their arm. We need to provide the resources to ensure that those young people-in many cases, young adults and mothers and fathers-do not try those things, because, once you are addicted, it is a huge battle for you to get off drugs. We heard some horrific evidence in Western Australia-from people who work in the King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women in Perth-about young drug addicted babies. The chairperson and I were the only two members of the committee to go over and hear that evidence, of hundreds of babies born to drug-addicted mothers. I could never imagine anything worse than a helpless child being brought into this world drug-addicted because of drug abuse by the mother. I think that is about the worse case of child abuse you could ever have-a child being drug-addicted from its first breath in this world. One of the good things about being on this committee is that you hear things first hand. I would like this report to be in most people’s bookshelves so that, when they think the whole world is going along swimmingly, they can just pick it up and have a read of some of the evidence. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the contentious issues is the default option for adoption of children of drug addicts. We heard some wonderful evidence. If people read nothing else in this report, they should read the last 23 pages of the report, and the evidence from Mrs Rowe, one of those people who pick up the pieces and try and give these young children a start in life. All credit to hersomeone who has not just done it once or twice but has fostered in three states as she and her husband have moved around. I would like to read a couple of quotes from our report. The first is from page 79, where a grandparent-another group of people who pick up the pieces-says: Our daughter fell pregnant and gave birth to a still born child 16 months ago at 20 weeks gestation… During this pregnancy I tried to alert welfare officers at [a medical centre] of my concerns as to the suitability of the couple as parents given their lifestyle however I was reminded of the privacy act and the fact that it was none of my business… My daughter once again was pregnant and gave birth to a premature baby three weeks ago. This child is still in intensive care and all medical expenses are being covered by the public health system. Once again an attempt was made to make welfare aware of the situation and concern as to suitability as parents. This time they did give us a hearing as they too had been building up their own picture at regular check ups and were also concerned. However, the matter was reported by the hospital welfare officer who was told that not enough evidence was available to raise concerns at this stage. I am assuming therefore that until some physical evidence of abuse is available nothing will be done. This child is extremely small and our concern is that a death may occur. On page 81 there is evidence from Dr Judith Cashmore of the University of Sydney Law School, who states: Unfortunately, what tends to happen is a lot of children get lost in the foster system. Unless the birth parents relinquish their rights to the child, many children end up in foster care, going from one foster home to another, because the parents do not want to sign on the dotted line to give up their rights but do not want the kid, either. These children would do amazingly in a permanent family but there is such a ‘blood is thicker than water’ mentality out there…. I do not know if it is blatantly anti adoption or just pro blood relation. I personally feel that some of this may be a swing back from the stolen generation pendulum. It was so extreme 40 or 50 years ago-I have a close friend who was one of the stolen generation-and, to me, it is like it has swung so far the other way. Now you put the kids back with their biological parents regardless of the child’s safety. Mrs Rowe, also on page 81, states: They just think blood is thicker than water, that the kids should be with their parents. I think they need to know their history. It is not necessarily good for them to be there; in most cases it is not. I cannot see that it is good for children to be with parents in a situation that means you do not know when you come home from school if you are going to be fed or not. This default option is a contentious issue but I-unlike the other three Labor Party members-agree: I think the child’s interests are paramount. I have seen it first hand, in my former life as a teacher and now, as a federal member who has an electorate office in what I lovingly call the ‘ghetto’ in Bridgewater, a pretty low socioeconomic area. I have seen first hand the intergenerational impact of neglect and abuse of children, especially in this area, and I think it is incumbent upon us as members-national legislators-to get it right. Sadly, in a way, this report is being tabled at the end of a three-year term when we are about to have an election. This probably will not be one of the key issues on the front pages of the papers or on television or radio, but I would like to think that whoever comes back as a government after this election will look seriously at this. I know the honourable member for MAIN COMMITTEE Mackellar and other members of the committee who will return-I know they will-will ensure that, whoever the minister is, either Labor or Liberal, this report will be addressed, its 31 wonderful recommendations will be taken on board seriously, and discussions with the state governments and the agencies will see that fewer and fewer of our young people and our families are impacted on by the scourge of illicit drugs. This will probably be my last speech in this place. I would like to thank, once again, the wonderful members of the secretariat, who have been there a long time; they are the unsung heroes. To the other members of the committee: I thank you for your generosity and your support. As I say, I look forward with interest to seeing that lots of these 31 recommendations are implemented. Thank you. closing the debate. Leave granted. mittee, including Mr Quick, who has just spoken so passionately, and by acknowledging that the majority of the committee who worked on this report are speaking to it. It is a report that is full of some of the saddest stories I have ever heard. The secretariat have worked very hard on this. I think the report we have produced is one that is going to have a long life, because it has truly exposed issues that I think governments themselves would not necessarily raise. During a committee meeting this morning, we heard Mr Quick’s words, but also those of Mr Cadman, the member for Mitchell, who said that perhaps part of the value of the work of these committees is that we tackle issues which governments and oppositions might like to leave behind, and we put the spotlight on areas which are, indeed, very upsetting to individuals but which, nonetheless, must be addressed. I would like to begin by reading an extract from one piece of evidence given to us. Many of the other members who have spoken have quoted what witnesses have told us, because noone can tell their story better than they can. This one begins: She started doing ice and the effect of the psychotic drugs over the past three years has been devastating. Paranoia, delusions, madness. I wasn’t living too far from the Cross then and I’d be [walking] in the street and there would be my daughter, my daughter in this crazy out of her head state digging in a park. With a shovel digging for buried treasure … That is a daughter who has been lost to a mother. In the evidence to the committee, the strains put on the families of drug users came up again and again. What we found is that much of the drug debate up to this point has put the accent on the drug user, the drug addict, without properly assessing the impact and the collateral damage to families and, particularly, to small children. We heard evidence in Western Australia which Mr Quick mentioned. We heard that out of 5,000 births in that particular hospital 350 children were born to drug addicted parents. We heard that something like 120 of them were heroin addicts and were fed methadone through the course of the pregnancy. So when the children were born they were addicted to methadone-25 of those children did not go home with their parents and another 30 of them were taken back three months later. But there is no longitudinal study to see what the impact on MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Committees

295,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop,"I would like to begin by thanking the members of the comthose children is. Nobody knows what has happened to them. I will quote again from Anne Bressington, who gave evidence to us. She said: ... five years ago I took over the care of a little boy who was born addicted to drugs. His mother was a chronic drug addict and prostitute ... She came to me knowing she was unable to care for this child. ... He is now five years old and the first nine months of his life were absolute hell, absolute hell. We do not hear about how many babies are born addicted in this country. Now he was not just a heroin baby; he was a methamphetamine baby, a methadone baby, a dope baby, a pill baby. God knows how he turned out normal. ... He is five now and twice a year now he still wakes up with his sweaty little hands and feet and he does not feel well: his appetite changes, his behaviour changes and do you know what? He has learned to manage that. He says to me, ‘This is not one of my good days.’ At five! There is evidence from the United States that we really need to get access and circulate here that these children are genetically changed, that their DNA now is different. They will not have the opportunity of their parents to muck around with these drugs for a little while before they become addicted; they are born addicted. They live with that central nervous system disorder. If he has one cone when he is 12, 13 or 14, he is gone. If he has one drink, he is gone. If he has one shot of heroin, he is gone. What are we creating? We heard stories of children who come home not knowing whether they are going to eat, whether they are going to be fed-stories of children who go to foster parents and the foster parents have to teach those children that it is normal to have three meals a day, to eat at a table and to have a shower once a day. There are children who knew none of this. We heard of the child who would come home and look after its parent who was a drug addict and of children who are forced back to those drug addict parents because within the bureaucracy there is an aversion to adoption and there is this ‘biology first’ principle that somehow children must be forced back into these circumstances. We took evidence from one foster carer of some 24 years experience who is foster caring for two little children who have disabilities. These are two of six children born to a drug addicted mother, with five fathers. The eldest child is 15; the youngest is one. They are cousins because two of the fathers were brothers. One of the children is dead-the mother fed it methadone. The court said there was sufficient evidence to prosecute but no prosecution came. In November that mother will reapply to get those two children back because the magistrate has the power to grant it. The fact of the matter is that these two children have been in and out of care-to and from the mother-any number of times. It is always the children who suffer. When those children were last put into care, through the network of foster carers the foster carers who have them now sought to find them because they wanted continuity in the children’s lives, and they managed to get those two children, to foster them again. She told of seven children who are in foster care where the foster care parents want to adopt them. There is a caseworker in the department who is very sympathetic and who is going to try and let that happen, but she knows she will come up against this bureaucratic attitude that adoption is bad, that biological parenting is the best. It is not. When we were doing our inquiry into overseas adoptions, we took evidence about what was the case in the United States in some states, where, if it was shown on the best evidence available that the parent was never going to be able to parent their child properly, the child was surrendered for adoption. So we have recommended that, where a child is so identified by child protection agencies, there should be a default position, which is that the child should be MAIN COMMITTEE surrendered for adoption-unless the protection agencies can come up with a plan which can be shown to give a better outcome for the child. In other words, we really need a policy which is in the best interests of the child. of not as a prop to help the addicted parent get over the addiction or have a better life but as deserving to have some hope of having a good life and not becoming part of the future generation of addicts. We found that there is out there what we have called the drug industry elites, who have captured those terms ‘harm minimisation’ and ‘harm reduction’ and think it is okay: ‘Drugs are here. Get used to it-and if we reduce drug usage that is an end in itself.’ They say that by doing this you remove the moral judgement about whether drugs are good or bad. They promote an amoral system where they can have counsellors or other folk who advise people that they can have drugs; just manage them better. It is in their evidence to the committee. It is in the Hansard. What we are saying is no; there needs to be a harm prevention policy, and the prevention policy needs to prevent young people becoming addicted in the first place. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has shown that 77 per cent of people who first start on drugs do so out of curiosity. But, up until the recent spate of commercials that the government has put to air, where has been the counteradvice to kids to say it is not okay? One person who is part of the drug industry, Mr Dillon, is an advocate who goes around talking to schools, even in my electorate, giving the soft option message. It has got to stop. Kids have to be informed that what they are risking is their mental health, their appearance, their teeth, their skin, their very fibre and indeed their DNA. They have to know the truth of it. The Lancet, which wrote in 1995 that cannabis, no matter how much you smoked, would not affect you, have now finally said that they were wrong. On 28 July this year they wrote: In 1995, we began a Lancet editorial with the since much-quoted words, ‘The smoking of cannabis, even long term, is not harmful to health.’ They say: Research published since 1995 … leads us now to conclude that cannabis use could increase the risk of psychotic illness. They say now: … governments would do well to invest in sustained and effective education campaigns on the risks to health of taking cannabis. People who advocate the legalisation, taxation and regulation of cannabis are stuck, like Dr Wodak, back in 1991, when he wrote an essay talking about available heroin and that you can best deal with things by regulation and taxation. Stuck in that old thinking, he was still giving it to us in his testimony before the committee. It is wrong. It is the people who are prepared to admit they were wrong in the Lancet who are the people who are prepared to give kids a break. We know that kids who are lost from overdose, kids who are lost because of drug use, are loved by their parents. On Friday, when I went back to the office, I did not leave until quarter to seven in the evening because I was returning calls to heartbroken parents who were saying, MAIN COMMITTEE",210,Committees

297,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop,"Children first. But every individual child has to be thought‘Thank God the message will go out.’ We have a moral obligation. These policies that we have put forward are based on higher principles. They are morally based. We have a moral obligation to let people know what will happen to them. For those who do slip, we need to have access to detox and to rehabilitation in a timely manner. So often, they will ring up and be told, ‘Ring us back in a fortnight or three months,’ and it is too late. So we have advocated that we set up a one-stop number, an 1800 number. It is modelled shamelessly on the system I put in place in aged care called Carelink, where you break the country into regions and task an NGO with keeping alive all the services that are available in that region. When you ring up, you say where you live and you will be transferred to the person who is responsible for that information, and you get immediate contact. We have recommended that naltrexone go on the PBS. We visited Dr George O’Neil’s clinic. It is a way of detoxing quickly with an implant, not tablets, which allows people to then go into rehabilitation, because you cannot have rehabilitation unless you are detoxed, and the two have to be put together simultaneously. We know that parents continue to love their children but we know what impact a child who is a drug addict has, not only on the parents but on their siblings, and the appalling effect on babies just has to stop. This report is a plea from the heart. This report is very specific about what needs to be done to prevent harm-not just to reduce it or minimise it but to prevent it, with the ultimate aim of always making the individual drug free and not sentenced to a lifetime of methadone, which will probably take 46 years off your life expectancy, and not turned into a hag with their teeth falling out. If you think the mouth of a tobacco-smoking person is hideous, look at the mouth of a methadone user. We need an anti-drug campaign-which we recommend-which is of the same reach, intensity and spend as the anti-tobacco campaign. We must get that message across. This is a report which has a life and must live, whoever wins this election. drugs: the impact of illicit drug use on families by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services is apt, because I believe that the war on drugs is winnable. The recommendations from this report provide a frame of reference for changing the future direction of how we tackle the challenges of individuals and families as a result of addiction to illicit drugs. I stand today with a degree of credibility, having worked as a social worker for 25 years in Western Sydney. For 10 of those years, I spent a considerable amount of time visiting prisoners on a voluntary basis. I worked face to face with families and individuals who had this challenge. Over the course of the inquiry, what became evident was that the rhetoric, the language, the communication of many people who are trying to help people get off drugs-‘harm minimisation’ and so on-is setting a bar that does not place value on individuals and families across this nation. We had a young man by the name of Ryan present to us his story. After a 12-month rehab program and long support by his family-and the broader family of his church-he is now living a healthy lifestyle. He is married, he is working and he has a great future ahead of him. But he told us about the number of times that he had tried to access services-hospital, detox or rehab-and time and time again he was told: ‘Methadone is an option. This is an option. Try this.’ He was basically told, ‘This is not something that you’re going to break.’ We need to recognise that people actually have a future and there is hope for every individual and family. MAIN COMMITTEE",212,Committees
298,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (12.32 Pm),"The title of this report The winnable war onNo-one ought to be put on the scrap heap. No-one ought to be told that there is no way for you to become free of your addiction and develop a healthy lifestyle and a healthy future, where you can work, have a family and enjoy all the benefits that most of us take for granted. I want to focus on a couple of the recommendations, starting with recommendation 2. I think a longitudinal study is definitely overdue, particularly focusing on the comparisons of outcomes for alternatives to methadone, including buprenorphine, naltrexone and supervised detoxification and withdrawal, with regard to which options are in the best interests of the child. When this inquiry was beginning, I had the opportunity to speak to some policemen who work in my local community. One of them, a homicide detective, brought to me a story of a baby that had died as a result of drugs-and it was not the first incident that I had had related to me. That four-month-old baby did not make the choice to ingest those drugs itself. A fourmonth-old baby cannot do that. An adult, a parent, gave that child the drugs. That baby is dead. Its future, its potential, is completely removed off this planet. That is the most important thing: our children. What are we going to do? Are we going to continue to relegate our children to this lack of future? Recommendation 3 focuses on the need for the Minister for Health and Ageing to disallow the provision of takeaway methadone through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for drug users who are parents and have children living in their household. I heartily agree with that. It needs to happen as soon as possible. We need to save our children. We need to give them an opportunity for a future. Recommendation 4 focuses on the Department of Health and Ageing, as part of the next funding round for the Non-Government Organisation Treatment Grants Program, giving urgent priority funding for residential treatment services to provide for children to live with their mothers. I hear from so many single mothers that have challenges fighting addiction to drugs. They desire to come off drugs and there are very few places available. In fact, in Sydney there is only one place, Jarrah House, and the waiting list is very long. I may have a single mum in my office or be visiting them, and I ring Jarrah House and it takes months to get them in. In many cases when that person has come in, they want help, they are ready to do something there and then, and that is when they need the help. The help needs to be available at that point in time. Many of the recommendations here focus on the importance of a one-stop shop. I think there should be an integrated service, where people not only come and ask for help but then get the detox. There are not enough detox places. We need to have sufficient places. From the detox, people need to be linked directly into rehab. Right now it is just a battle for people to get any kind of help when they want help. It is just not good enough. Recommendation 6 says that the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs should include in the legislative instrument covering the implementations of the income management provisions of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Payment Reform) Act requirements that the child protection authorities must notify Centrelink when a child protection substantiation detects any illicit drug use by a parent and that this notification shall activate the income management regime provisions. MAIN COMMITTEE I think this is critical. While I have a great deal of compassion for many parents who are struggling to get off drugs, I think it is not good that their income support is used to supply their habit and the child is left without food or a roof over their head. I think it is important that we make sure that the child and their needs are a No. 1 priority. Recommendation 8 includes the following: The Commonwealth Government develop and bring to the Council of Australian Governments a national illicit drug policy that: replaces the current focus of the National Drug Strategy on harm minimisation with a focus on harm prevention and treatment that has the aim of achieving permanent drug-free status for individuals with the goal of enabling drug users to be drug free; It is about setting goals for the best possible future. That has to be the goal of every funding contribution we make. The goal has to be for them to be drug free, not drug dependent for years. Recommendation 10 is to: amend the National Pharmacotherapy Policy for People Dependent on Opioids to specify that the primary objective of pharmacotherapy treatment is to end an individual’s opioid use; and renegotiate funding arrangements for methadone maintenance programs to require the states and territories to commit sufficient funding to provide comprehensive support services to meet the revised National Pharmacotherapy Policy for People Dependent on Opioids objective. While for some methadone is a form of treatment that helps them to maintain their lifestyle and then be able to step off drugs, for many that is not the case: after a decade or, in some instances, two decades or longer, they are still taking the same high dose of methadone: 110 millilitres. I have had so many people like that in my office over the years and there has been no sign of reduction. Having talked to their treatment supervisor or to the clinic, I have noted there is no plan in place for that individual to actually reduce their dose. While they are on methadone, often they engage in use of other illicit drugs and this further erodes not just their health but the health and lifestyle of their family and the safety of their children in many instances. SoI think it is absolutely critical that we focus on encouraging, where there are methadone programs, those programs that actually focus on reducing a person’s dependence on the drug and providing them with those additional services and support, including those from their family, so that they can reach the goal of a drug-free lifestyle. Looking at further recommendations, recommendation 22 focuses again on strengthening families through treatment: The Department of Health and Ageing include, as part of the next round of illicit drug treatment funding agreements, requirements that: treatment organisations collect and report data on their success rate in making individuals drug free after they have completed their initial treatment; and give priority to funding those treatment approaches that demonstrate their success in making individuals drug free. I acknowledge here that, for many people who have managed to secure that drug-free lifestyle and have to fight and work for it, it takes great determination and an incredible amount of support and resources. For many of those people it has required more than one attempt. The first attempt does not always work, but I think there needs to be some measure to ensure that, through the programs that are supported and funded, that is their goal. MAIN COMMITTEE Finally, I would like to make a comment about recommendation 5. Having worked in the child protection area for a number of years, I think the statement needs to be made that the state is not the better parent. In many instances, permanent care orders are not effective. With permanent care orders, the parent can take the state department or the foster family back to court, and time and time again the child gets moved in and out of care, from a stable family environment back to their parent and back to the state. If you talk to any foster care body, whether it be a state or non-government organisation, you will find there are not enough foster care placements available for all the children who are impacted by their parent’s use of illicit drugs. I think that the option of adoption needs to be carefully looked at. Obviously, we need to be certain, as much as possible-as much as anybody can be certain-that the parent will not be able to provide a long-term, safe, secure, healthy environment for their child and that it is in the best interests of the child that an adoption be pursued. That is a good recommendation that focuses on the child. Every individual and family can live free of the impacts of illicit drug use. These recommendations provide an opportunity for us to set a framework for the future that will improve the chances for individuals and families to achieve that outcome of a drug-free lifestyle. If even some of these recommendations are implemented, it will head in the right direction. We cannot sit by. After all my experience, I think we cannot remain silent. Families, individuals and children do deserve much better. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Danby) adjourned. Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee Report Debate resumed from 17 September, on motion by Mr Baird: That the House take note of the report. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.48 pm)-I rise to speak on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia Annual Report 2006, which deals with the public hearing held in August on the Gold Coast. It was our second public hearing with the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Glenn Stevens, who was frank and open with the committee and also, to the regret of some of us, very adroit at avoiding the politically partisan questions of the committee. However, Governor Stevens took the opportunity at that hearing to strongly reinforce some important principles of the Reserve Bank’s operation. When asked if he would increase interest rates during an election, the governor stated his independence and reinforced the independence of the Reserve Bank from the government when he said: If it is clear that something needs to be done, I don’t know what explanation we could offer the Australian public for not doing it, regardless of when an election might be due. I don’t think there is any case for the Reserve Bank board to cease doing its work for a month, in the month the election’s going to be. Governor Stevens also reinforced the Reserve Bank’s strict adherence to an inflation target of between two and three per cent in applying monetary policy. He said: My statement is a statement of long run tendencies. Our job is to anchor inflation at two to three per cent. I think both sides of politics agree with that. We are independent to do that. If we are successful in doing that, the nominal interest rate would be driven by that. Again he said: MAIN COMMITTEE ... as a long run proposition, the rate of interest goes with the rate of inflation. Interestingly, his comments reflected the bipartisan approach to monetary policy-and I think that was strongly welcomed by all parties. His statements certainly dispel any election myth about returning to the very high interest rates that were experienced by both major parties in government prior to the economic reforms of the Hawke-Keating era. When asked if it was fair to say that we were unlikely to see those types of very high interest rate rises and that end point again, Governor Stevens responded: I would not promise that every increment will be 25 points, but it strikes me as not that likely that we will have 100 point increments any time soon. Something very dramatic has occurred if that needs to be done. The hearing with Governor Stevens took place at a very interesting economic time following, as it did, the Reserve Bank’s decision in August to increase the cash rate by 25 basis points to 6.5 per cent-the fifth interest rate rise since the 2004 election. In the context of our August public hearing, problems had also emerged in the US subprime lending market. I had the great fortune of being in America at the time when those problems emerged. It was fascinating to watch that play out and to see the very cautious comments of the Federal Reserve, the US equivalent of our Reserve Bank of Australia. It was interesting to see the confident comments of President Bush and the speculation by economic commentators on just what might happen in terms of credit risk and what impact that might have on the US economy. To be reading about it in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times et cetera was an amazing experience. That aside, Governor Stevens took the opportunity to explain the interest rate rise by saying that it was due to strong economic conditions putting increased pressure on inflation-in spite of the dampening effects of the higher exchange rate and indeed other factors. He said that: ... ongoing strength of demand in a fully employed economy might leave us with inflation pressure that is harder to manage than expected. He continued: If you face an economy in our circumstances, we are clearly very fully employed. We are getting a stimulus from the rest of the world which is quite powerful and which is, I would say, beyond in some sense the normal cyclical ups and downs of our terms of trade. So there is quite a big set of forces at work there. I think you would have to be feeling that, in that world, you have got to be on the look-out for inflationary pressures. So, if that is the world we face and that is the world we are assumingly facing in putting these forecasts together, we are at a point where we are certainly more worried about inflation being too high than we would be about growth being too low. Of course that was the situation then. A month is a long time in economics as well as in politics. When discussing the possible dampening effect of the US subprime market then he also commented that if the US economy slows then it could be anticipated that that slowing would be counterbalanced in the global economy by the continued increased growth of China and other major economies. Interestingly, though, he also made the point-and I thought this was an amusing one: As I have said to many people in the past year, if you took a selection of central bank governors, supervisors, securities regulators and people responsible for stability around the world, put them in a room and asked them, ‘What is it that you keep awake at night about?’ it would have been that people are underappreciating risk and taking more risk than they realise and at some point in time that will do some damage MAIN COMMITTEE I suppose we are at that point in time right now. Governor Stevens also said that, if the subprime pressure were to have a dampening impact on Australia’s economy, it would be due to a decrease in the availability of credit. At that time, it was the very early days of the subprime situation. He said: I doubt that we are likely to see a big impact on the confidence of mainstream businesses from this financial volatility in the near term. The longer term risk would be if there were a serious tightening of credit conditions globally that then led to a withdrawal of credit provision in the real economy. I do not think that is happening at the moment. Clearly, that is a risk one has to be on the alert for, and we are. Certainly, he is alert to that risk and his comments yesterday suggested that he is considering a heightened risk at the moment. He commented yesterday that the risk has increased and that credit has tightened. A report released yesterday on mortgage stress said that mortgage stress was rising at alarming rates, with eight per cent-or 600,000 households-likely to experience at least mild mortgage stress by the end of the year. I take this opportunity, then, to recommend to the House the economic committee’s recent report on housing and lending. But, clearly, risk or credit is being repriced. We have witnessed just this week a run on the Northern Rock bank in England and some speculation in our own media about the position of regional banks regarding their liquidity and assets held. Interestingly, the governor has suggested that the big Australian banks disclose-he actually called on them to do so-the degree of their exposure to the risk from the subprime fallout. I think it is terribly important that the governor is making that statement. It suggests that both the market and the public have a right to know if there is a risk and what that level of exposure is. Those disclosures would be welcomed. In reflecting on the latest RBA interest rate rise, the governor detailed the constraints on our domestic economic growth, noting that labour shortages continue to be the single most important factor constraining further economic growth in our current economic situation. The Reserve Bank governor acknowledged the bipartisan approach to labour market priorities, in answer to a question that I put to him, when he said: My view is that the Australian labour market is very different from the animal we saw in the episode that Dr Emerson referred to in the late seventies and early eighties. I think it is obvious that two successive governments of differing political persuasions have moved things in the direction of less centralisation, more flexibility, more focus on productivity and so on. I do not think an objective observer would conclude differently. The governor highlighted the constrained economy, and the inflationary effects of that, when he pointed to the current situation with labour shortages. It is a tradition of advice that our governors have adhered to, during this term of parliament at least, pointing out the constraints on growth brought about by a lack of attention to skills, infrastructure, housing and land release policies, the productivity dilemma and now of course the shortage of labour. But these are elements of fiscal policy that require the government to respond and intervene. Unfortunately, when you consider the constraints on growth that we are presently experiencing, the government’s response has been clearly inadequate. I take these last moments to conclude and thank the Reserve Bank governor and his team for the excellent interchange. I congratulate the secretariat, which deserves a special recognition for its excellence in supporting our committee. And, lastly, I give my best wishes to the MAIN COMMITTEE chair, Mr Bruce Baird, on his retirement and thank him for the professional approach he has always taken to the economics committee of parliament. Debate (on motion by Dr Southcott) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 12.59 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Defence: Electricity and Water (Question No. 5218) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 7 December 2006: (1) For each financial year since 1 July 2004, what sum has the Minister’s department spent on (a) electricity and (b) water. (2) Since1 July 2000, what measures has the department instigated to reduce electricity and water usage. (1) The expenditure recorded by the Department of Defence financial system under the account codes for ‘light and power’ and ‘water’ for each of the periods specified is: 2004-2005 2005-2006 2006-May 2007 Electricity: $74.3m $76.0m $75.2m Water: $10.4m $11.1m $11.3m The expenditure shown in the table above does not include the following: (i) treatment on Defence establishments of water extracted from rivers and bores to potable standard; (ii) treatment on Defence establishments of wastewater prior to its release back to the environment; (iii) expenditure on diesel fuel used to generate electricity in remote Defence establishments or for standby energy security; and (iv) expenditure recorded in the ‘light and power’ account code by any group that does not have responsibility for the purchase of electricity (usually electrical maintenance work). (2) Defence is pro-actively addressing water and energy management through the Defence Environmental Management System, site Environmental Management Plans, the Defence Sustainable Water Management Strategy and the Defence Energy Strategy. These Strategies have been in place since 2004 and were updated in late 2006. (a) The key objective of the Defence Energy Strategy is to consume the least amount of energy necessary while maintaining the capability to defend Australia and its national interests. Defence is committed to: (i) minimising energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and demand; (ii) achieving enduring cultural change in energy management across the entire organisation; (iii) meeting obligations under the Commonwealth policy Energy Efficiency in Government Operations; and (iv) demonstrating to all stakeholders continual improvement in energy performance against appropriate targets and benchmarks. To achieve these objectives Defence has: (i) identified 45 high energy use sites across the Defence estate; (ii) continued to identify opportunities at these sites for reducing energy consumption by avoiding waste and improving efficiency; (iii) set a 10 per cent energy saving target for buildings across the entire estate to be achieved by mid 2008;",213,Committees
299,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(iv) specified that all new buildings constructed and major refurbishments undertaken by, or for, Defence must meet strict energy performance standards; and (v) developed regional and site energy management plans for the Defence estate. Examples of energy efficiency projects that have been implemented across the Defence Estate include: (i) retrofitting energy efficient lighting controllers in Russell, Canberra; (ii) construction of energy efficient and environmentally friendly office buildings in Paddington and Richmond, Sydney; (iii) amplifying the requirement for energy monitoring and management in maintenance contracts; (iv) engaging with regional staff to promote actions to identify and rectify inefficient practices; and (v) implementing a national energy reporting system to enable improved management and reporting by category of usage. (b) The key objectives of the Defence Sustainable Water Management Strategy comprise: (i) maximising the efficiency of water use; (ii) eliminating losses through leakage and waste; and (iii) reducing potable water use by substituting lower grade sources of water where they remain fit for purpose (for example collection and use of rain water and storm water, recycling of grey water and waste water). To achieve these objectives Defence has: (i) identified 45 high water use sites across the Defence estate; (ii) commenced the identification of opportunities at these sites for reducing potable water consumption and increasing the use of rainwater and stormwater, and the recycling of grey water and waste water; (iii) set a 30 per cent water saving target in potable water in new buildings and major refurbishments; (iv) specified water efficient fittings, fixtures and appliances which have a minimum AAA rating or equivalent water efficiency labeling and standards scheme star rating; and (v) developed regional and site water management plans for the Defence estate. Examples of water efficiency projects that have been implemented across the Defence estate include: (i) the implementation of waste water recycling for irrigation of the sports ground at the Royal Military College Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy; (ii) the installation of recycled water washpoint facilities at Gallipoli Barracks and Lavarack Barracks; (iii) rainwater harvesting for HMAS Cairns redevelopment and Oakey Army Aviation Centre; (iv) the installation of waterless urinals at RAAF Richmond and Enoggera Army Barracks; and (v) the installation of dual flush toilets in various facilities. Defence: RAAF Base Darwin (Question No. 5711) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 8 May 2007: (1) Is he aware of previous restrictions upon the operation of air-conditioners by service personnel resident at RAAF Base Darwin; if so, has action been taken to address this issue. (2) Has he taken action to ensure that the families of service personnel are not disadvantaged by the potential negative impact of the introduction of the Remote Locality Allowance upon Family Tax Benefit entitlements; if not, why not. (3) Does the Remote Locality Allowance provide for varying entitlements according to severity of climate, as did the air-conditioning allowance; if not, why not. (4) Are there any service locations where the Remote Locality Allowance has not resulted in a net increase in entitlement following the discontinuation of specific allowances such as the air conditioning allowance. (5) Has the discontinuation of individual allowances in favour of a Remote Locality Allowance made administration easier for his department, at the expense of service personnel’s net salary and entitlements. (1) In 2005 the electrical system on RAAF Darwin required an upgrade to enable it to meet the increasing demands of modern households. During this period, the base experienced a number of planned and unplanned power outages. In an attempt to avoid unplanned outages, residents were requested to manage their household electrical loads during peak usage periods. (2) The allowance that compensates Service personnel living in remote locations is known as Australian Defence Force (ADF) district allowance and is considered by the Australian Taxation Office to be income. Accordingly, receipt of the allowance may reduce a member’s entitlement to Family Tax Benefit in the same way that an increase in taxable income will affect the entitlement to Family Tax Benefit of any other Australian taxpayer. (3) Yes. ADF district allowance is paid in accordance with a scale based on the isolation of the location and the severity of its climate. Locations are graded into five levels. (4) With the exception of a small number of ADF members working in Shoalwater Bay Training Area near Rockhampton, ADF members in all remote locations received an increase in ADF district allowance. A component of the increase in some locations was an amount to compensate for the discontinuation of air conditioning allowance and was calculated based on the average amounts of air conditioning allowance previously claimed. This figure was then ‘grossed up’ at the top marginal tax rate to negate the effects of the ADF district allowance being subject to income tax, while air conditioning allowance was not. Individuals who were extremely high users of air conditioners may not have had a net increase in entitlement. (5) No. The discontinuation of the air conditioning allowance in favour of an increased ADF district allowance has made administration marginally easier for Defence and for ADF members. Air conditioning allowance was discontinued, and ADF district allowance increased, to better compensate Service personnel for the rigours of living in a remote location. Conditions in the north were reviewed to make service there more attractive. The total package, including the increase in ADF district allowance, cost Defence an additional $35 million per annum.",220,Questions In Writing
300,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Human Services: Information Technology (Question No. 5838) Ms Burke asked the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 29 May 2007: For each financial year since 1 July 2000, what was the total cost of outsourcing information technology services for each department and agency in the Minister’s portfolio. honourable member’s question: The Department (excluding the Child Support Agency and CRS Australia) The Department of Human Services was created in October 2004.

Defence: RAAF Base Tindal (Question No. 6194) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 8 August 2007: Does his department intend to make operational changes to RAAF Tindal, Katherine, Northern Territory; if so, (a) what reduction in staff numbers, if any, will this entail, (b) what is the reason for the changes and (c) when will the changes take effect. (a) to (c) The Government is committed to the future of RAAF Tindal and there will be no downgrade of facilities at the base. In fact, on 21 June 2007, a $64.2 million project to build facilities at RAAF Tindal for the Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. The project will provide a range of new facilities at RAAF Tindal such as taxiways, aprons and shelters to enable the Wedgetail aircraft to operate from the base. This project clearly demonstrates that RAAF Base Tindal remains a very important part of Air Force’s network of bases. In late 2006 there was a small reduction of 30 maintenance personnel at the base as a result of a more efficient F/A-18 Hornet maintenance structure. The current number of uniformed Air Force personnel on the base is 607, with a further 119 Defence civilian and contractor staff.
