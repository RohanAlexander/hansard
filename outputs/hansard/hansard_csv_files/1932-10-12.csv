Norfolk Island is a territory of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth is responsible for safeguarding the interests of its inhabitants.

The produce of Norfolk Island is notsubject to Commonwealth customs duties, and its disposal elsewhere than in Australia is therefore advantageous to the Australian producers.

Notwithstanding that there is already a surplus of over £2,600,000, the Government is proceeding with its harsh measures, and these are striking fear into the hearts of the aged and infirm throughout Australia. My intention is to direct attention this past experience, with all the dangers afternoon to what is the most important attached to it. problem that confronts the people and the Parliaments of Australia-ho w to reduce unemployment.

It is recorded in Hansard that I predicted that the time would unBut, after making all doubtedly come when the value of our exportable products would fall, and Australia would experience depression, with a consequent increase in the number of the unemployed, and an increase of taxation at a time when the people would be unable to bear it. That prophecy has, unfortunately, come true. NowI issue another warning, and it is that unless the Government takes stock of the present position, we shall have a repetition of the On the foundation of a balanced Some and balanced budgets and the employment The catastrophic fall in the prices of our exburden that is now weighing it down. That reckless policy left tlie nation ill For this this year than last year, because we shall A be limited by the amount to our credit I have spoken on the past. We were not limited by the amount To illustrate what occurred, let us take the five-year period from 1925-26 to 1929-30. The excess of imports over exports in these years was £76,000,000, and we had to provide £160,000,000 for overseas interest and services, a total of £236,000,000. Our borrowings totalled £140,000,000. That left a shortage in ' London of £96,000,000. It was met partially by the shipment of gold reserves to the value of £35,000,000. Thus £61,000,000 still had to be accounted for. No one can say with any degree of accuracy how that amount wa3 provided. Mo3t of it was obtained by the investment in Australia in short-term loans of the trade moneys that had piled up here as the result of the sale of imported goods. There was thus created in Australia a false sense of security, and a mistaken idea that prosperity existed. The belief was held that the investment of these moneys represented an inflow of capital, whereas it was not genuinely such. That was disclosed when a critical period in the history of Australia bad to be faced, and it was found that this money was a great menace to our credit, and impeded our efforts to restore the financial affairs of the Commonwealth and the States. SoI warn the Government that it overlooks the facts of history when it contends that it. is not possible to import more goods than ca.n be provided for by means of London funds. What was done in the past may be done again. Probably there never has been a time when it could be done more successfully than at present, because there is such an abundance of cheap money available in England. It would be an easy matter for manufacturers and traders overseas to take advantage of lower duties to build up their trade, by sending their goods to Australia and awaiting a more favorable opportunity for the return of their money, meanwhile investing it in our 4 per cent, stock and raising their requirements in London at a very much cheaper rate. Honourable members must'have noticed that the British Government is embarking upon a conversion loan of £150,000,000 at 2 per cent, at par for a period correspondopinion that, at the very best, the credit ing to that at which our conversion loan in London was floated recently for an interest return of 4 per cent. The Prime Minister has very rightly said that the rate of interest at which our loan was floated was considerably lower than was anticipated a little while ago; but the indications are that a large amount of very cheap money is available in London to-day. Unfortunately, however, that is not necessarily a sign of prosperity. I a reality, this cheap money is available, because there is no outlet for it in other forms of investment, on account of a lack of enterprise in industry. It is a good thing that money should be cheap, and I hope that it will remain so; but I should feel more satisfied if its present cheapness were the result of general all round prosperity instead of being due to an absence of prosperity in practically all the industries of every country in the world. On the question of the balance of trade, I draw attention to the fact that in the first three months of the last financial year the credit balance represented by the excess of exports over imports amounted to £2,500,000. We have accurate figures for only the first two months of this year, and they disclose an adverse balance of £3,000,000. : customs revenue in each period? accepted as an accurate guide for any one month, but it is a very good guide over a period of three or six months. The increase iri revenue is relative to the increases that have occurred in tlie imports. The revenue figures for September maintained the same high rate that characterized the imports for July and August. But. we arc now in the exporting season. The wool that is being and is to be shipped will have a marked effect upon our exports for the balance of this calendar year, and for a period in the new year. Consequently, I anticipate a very large increase in the value of our exports for, the month of September. A l though the figures are not available, a very fair estimate may be made of the imports for that month. I venture the balance for September will not be more than £500,000. Consequently, the adverse balance for the first three months will be £2,500,000, compared with a favorable",13,Lyons

That is a serious position for Australia to occupy, and it cannot be viewed with equanimity by any person. gold responsible to a large extent for the favorable ""balance to which the honourable gentleman has referred? cludes in his figures only the new gold that has been won in the year. In that respect, it is as much merchandise as wheat. The gold reserve shipped in the period to which I have referred amounted to £35,000,000. I have not included it in my calculations. All my references to credit balances have eliminated any gold reserve exported. I clo not suggest that the adverse trade balance will continue every month. That, however, is not sufficient. If we are to be a solvent nation, we must have an excess of exports over imports of very nearly £3,000,000 a month. Wc shall not, in the future, have gold reserves with whicli to meet extraordinary circumstances, and if we again experience anything like the position that confronted us two years ago, we shall become insolvent, and unable to carry on. There is not the slightest doubt that, notwithstanding the amount of cheap money that is available in England today, we should not have obtained anything like the terms on which the last, loan was floated had we not had a favorable trade balance last year. The hardheaded investor in Great Britain knows that interest on overseas loans can be paid only with goods. Last year we exported sufficient to pay for all our imports, to meet all our interest and other charges, and to have a balauce of over £S,000,000. That, and that only, was the factor that convinced the investors overseas. No matter how cheap money may be in England, if we cannot prove to the investors there that we are going to maintain our trade balance on the lines pursued last year, and have an excess of exports over imports our credit will slump as it did before and we shall be unable to convert our indebtedness overseas on the favorable terms that we all hope for. The action taken by my Government Conwas the only effective one possible. Unfortunately, it has been largely reversed by this Government, which has removed the prohibitions that were placed on specially selected items, luxury goods that could be done without, or that could be satisfactorily produced here, such as potted meats, biscuits, cheese, ham, butter and fruits. The alarming adverse trade balauce to which I have referred sot in almost immediately when this Government altered the policy instituted by my Administration, arid if it continues it will be extremely dangerous. Will the Government pay heed to past experience or disregard those warnings, just as did the Government led by Mr Bruce, as a result of which Australia drifted to the brink of bankruptcy? Its financial solvency was endangered, its industries retarded, and unemployment increased by tens of thousands? It has been suggested that a higher rate of exchange would check the flood of imports when the balance of trade is adverse. If the rate of exchange is made so high as to effectively check all imports, necessary and unnecessary, it will have detrimental results to the country. Such a rate would add to the cost of the raw materials that we import, and, consequently, to the cost of production. When considering the prohibition of goods as a means of restoring our trade balance, my Government specially selected those items that we could do without or could produce here, so that the whole of our limited funds in London could be used to pay for the importation of goods definitely required by Australia. That is a most important thing to consider. I notice that some sections .of the press suggest that we should ask the banks to co-operate in rationing the amount of exchange or overseas credit, claiming that that method has proved most successful. I say that it has not been at all successful. There was the outside market upon which traders who wanted to import goods could and did operate, so nullifying the influence of the banks. So alarming was the position at one time that my Government seriously considered taking complete control of the importation, of.goods to Australia, under the powers conferred",15,Lyons

53,Mr Scullin,"Tb e Statistician inupon it by the Customs Aet, whicli demonstrates that the attempts of the banks to ration exchange were feeble and ineffective. The only effective method is the prohibition of selected items. It is well known that the Labour Government rectified our adverse trade balance, straightened out the financial position and carried through a successful conversion loan which brought the rate of interest down to 4 per cent, at a time when the return on such securities was as high as from 8 to 10 per cent, in Australia, and from 5-J per cent, to 6 per cent, in London. At the time that my goverument met defeat it was preparing to convert Australia's overseas indebtedness, and previously it had advanced proposals to create employment in Australia, which, unfortunately, were defeated in another place.

The lack of money is the only thing that stands in the way of again setting the wheels of industry in motion. Money is only a relative term.

I am not putting forward any wildcat financial scheme. I do not believe that we can reach our hands into the clouds and .draw down millions of banknotes, to be scattered broadly. But there is great need to-day for a liberal banking policy by which the banks would make advances to governments for public works. If such a policy were adopted, large bodies of men could be employed immediately, and a wage fund would at once ber created out of which the commodities which private enterprise manufactures could be purchased. I know of no other way by which the wheels of industry can be started. Unless the wheels of industry are soon set iu motion, we shall sink further and further into the slough of despond. This will cause one of two situations t.o arise in this country: either we shall bring into being a discontented body of men, on the verge of starvation, who will be prepared to revolt, or, worse still, we shall build up a body of men who will be quite content with the dole, and will lose their morale and their manhood for evermore. Those are the alternatives to the solution of our unemployment problem. T. was convinced by my experiences while occupying the responsible position of Prime Minister of Australia, and since then, that less than half the depression from which we are suffering is due to outside conditions. It is true that Australia was struck a staggering blow when the fall in the prices of her exportable products reduced the national income so disastrously. falling. prices is arrested we shall have to cope not only with the unemployment of factory and workshop employees, but also with that of the settlers on the lands of Australia. seriously accentuated by those in control of finance in Australia. On the shoulders of the bankers the greatest responsibility rests. I do not say this with any desire to be abusive. banking companies are probably neither better nor worse than other private companies whose aim is the making of profits, but the banking companies have it in their power to withhold or release the life-blood of industry, which is credit, and as thoy use this power, Australia must prosper or fail. My indictment of the private banking institutions is that when times were prosperous, and the men in control of our factories and workshops and on our farms were doing well and obtaining good prices, the banks were prepared to be lavish in their advances-in some cases they oven suggested where certain enterprises should be expanded-bu t as soon as the slightest danger arose of their not obtaining the repayment of their advances, they rushed to cover, and called in the overdrafts granted to some of the soundest men in the community. Honourable members opposite are interjecting, but these defenders of the banks clo not want to hear the facts. Yet if they would make an investigation for themselves, and interview farmers, pastoralists and business men, they would find that at the first suggestion of trouble in Australia, and when the first signs of depression appeared on the horizon, the banks immediately called upon their clients to reduce their overdrafts. It did not matter how sound a man was, or what margin of security he had, he was obliged to reduce his overdraft. Some of the honourable gentlemen opposite who are interjecting have intelligence enough to know that one of the worse features which has crept into banking practice in Australia is the lending of money on overdraft which should be lent on long-term advances. As a matter of fact, many people who obtained overdrafts from the are still banks thought that they were being granted long-term advances, and that the conditions of their advances would not be altered so long as their assets remained sound. Acting under this impression these people improved their farms, added to the equipment of their businesses, and. in the case of some working men, erected The depression has been homes for themselves; but they discovered, to their undoing, that their credit could be withdrawn in a night. The sending out of one letter was sufficient. The private Mr ""WHITE -An overdraft is usually a long-term advance.",17,Lyons

I am 1 not quarrelling with those who' advocate an' increase in the exchange rate, but I contend that tliey are proposing to start at th6 wrong end. Instead of adopting such"" a policy, we should prevent 1 deflation. ""We have had a longexperience of deflation, aiid I am surprised' to fin'cT that there are more fh'a'ii two' Or three' memhers of this committee who are prepared to champion such a policy. We know that tliere are some in this community who are so hard-headed and hard-hearted that they regard this sufoject solely from, the economic view-point, eliminate entirely, humane considerations. Studying this subject from the economic' view-point alone,. in a hard hearted and business like, but absolutely inhuman, way, we might say that price's and wages should continue to come down until the lowest possible level was reached, and we could successfully compete with the lowest wage countries in the world. But even if that occurred, there is one section of the community whose income would not come down, but would go higher and higher. I refer to the rentiers, those who live by clipping off interest coupons, without working, enjoying-ah. income contributed by another struggling, section of tlie eonimunity. We have only to consider the conflict that is going on in Grdat Britain; \vhich is a typical capitalist country-not between employer and employee, but between the rentier and the entrepreneur-the borrower of money. London is the financial centre of the world and its views are voiced by the press of that bity; but those conducting factories and other industrial undertakings in the provinces are asking that the burden of interest should be reduced, because prices are down so low that they are compelled to dismiss men by the thousand. A similar struggle is proceeding elsewhere throughout the world. There is only one way in which an adjiistment can be made, and not much can be done by legislation. We are doing something in a small way by reducing interest and proclaiming moratoriums; but we have still to strive to get price levels up to a figure approaching those whicli Obtained when the bulk 'of these debts were incurred. The price Mr Scullin. levels' of 1929 have been selected as those which we should seek to restore, because,, although prices came down after the war,i and subsequently increased a little, they remained, nearly stable from 1924 to 1929. For a period of five ye'as,the whofesale price levels in Australia, which are a better guide than the retail price' level's!,' though fhe same remark applies to them, remained fairly stable. During, thatfive years, many contracts were entered into by returned soldiers who were' purchasinghomes from the War Service Homes Department, by working men who were' purchasing and a.re prepared to homes through building societies and State savings banks, arid by farmers in connection with the purchase of land. Ntft cmly were there' these new contracts, but many old contracts in the form of mortgage's were renewed. The interest burden incurred during that period when the price levels were higher than now, falls more he'avily on the borrower today. I do not advocate a policy that would bring us bcick to the price levels of the war period.. What has followed ? We have had a period of deflation, which has reduced the prices of commodities within the Commonwealth, and also nominal and real wages. Many working rden and others who were buying their homes have had to abandon th^m, and others will be forced to do the same. A l though the official figures show that there has been a reduction in rent, there has been no, real reduction in rent in the lender and the case of those who have entered into, say, a 30-year contract. We should arrest deflation,, and endeavour to secure stabilization. Some economists call it reflation. The policy of cheapness of which I have spoken will not get lis out of our difficulties, even if we were prepared to accept the riiin that would follow in the wake of deflation, when the farmer would have to sell his holding, the working man give up his hoine, and the business man go through the insolvency court. I believe that if we got right down to the bottom-ther e must be a bottom somewhere^-whe n a rise in prices took place throughout the world, there would be wonderful scope for the profiteer, such as there was during the war. To get down , to the bottom would be to put millions of pounds into the pockets of the profiteers, who would derive all the benefits at the expense of other sections. able the Leader of the Opposition say by what artificial means prices can be fixed at a certain level? be made to finance public works. We should regulate'the advances to check a rise in prices; but that power must be placed in the right hands. Sir Arthur Salter in his work entitled Recovery, which has been published within the last three or four months, states, on page 72, thatWhat the world needs now is an increase in of that party made, in this House, the general level of gold prices-unti l it reaches the level of 1029. That is generally agreed upon, but some honourable members will say that that means world prices. We should encourage every movement and do everything possible by international conferences and other methods to increase world prices. If that is not done, there are many economists and financiers who consider that a number of the debtor nations cannot meet their obligations and must default. Unless prices are increased, the creditor nations, who are already finding that they cannot get their interest charges repaid, will also suffer. The creditor nations are not prepared to receive goods from the debtor nations, because their own people are already out of work. Therefore, they are unable to trade. What is .true as between debtor and creditor in the case of individuals is also true as between debtor and creditor nations. I do not suggest that we in Australia can take auy action that will affect the world position, except as a contribution to it as from one nation among 50. But Australia cannot remain idle, awaiting the outcome of international conferences. We can remove one-half of the depression from Australia by attending to our own conditions in the direction of increasing internal price levels. the prices of commodities in Australia a great disadvantage to our progress? but I am pointing out that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The"" disadvantage of that disparity is the very disadvantage that the members of the Country party wish to bring about by having an arbitrary rise in the exchange rate without any accompanying advantages. arbitrary rise in the exchange rate. that the Country party has adopted. to the honourable member individually, but to the members of the Country party generally. On the subject of the exchange rate, the leader a speech that was somewhat different from one which he had made in the country a few weeks previously. I am not quarrelling with him, but merely pointing out that he is starting at the wrong end. There is no doubt that if wages and prices reached the 1929 level, or something approaching it, the lot of many of our wage earners, farmers and others, would be a much happier one. It has been said by some critics, in articles which have appeared in the press in particular, that this experiment was tried by the Eederal Reserve Bank of the United States of America a few years ago; when it pumped credit into the open market in order to increase the level of commodity prices, but failed in its object. That is true, but it has been admitted, particularly by those in control in the United States of America to-day, that the bank started in the wrong way. It pumped credit into the stock market, and created a demand for stocks and shares, which really accentuated the problem of unemployment. Money was attracted from other countries into the stock market. When that money, together with many short-term loans, was eventually withdrawn it became a menace instead of an advantage. That was a proposition entirely different from the making of credit available to governments al the outset to provide for public works, because every f l of money expended in that Way would bo pumped into the purchasing power of the working man. It would be spent, not in buying stocks and shares on the exchange, but in buying commodities, and in creating a buying confidence which is non-existent to-day.",19,Lyons

If our imports continue to exceed our exports as they have done during the last three months, there will be a rise in the rate of exchange. of the fall in the value of exports? of exports is exactty the same as a f a l l in the volume of exports. [Leave lo continue given.] not wish to appear to be elementary, but two factors operate to control the rate of exchange. One is the excess of imports over exports, and vice versa, and the other is the relative difference .between internal and external price levels. There is no general agreement as to which is the more important factor, but the opinion has been expressed in this country that as Australia is f a r removed from the markets of the world, with us, the trade balance is more important than a difference between price levels. That may be true, but a difference between price levels w i ll automatically express itself in the exchange rate, unless we peg tbe rate of remembered that the private banks refused to co-operate with the Commonwealth Banki n controlling exchange at £25 -per £100, fearing that they might get caught with London balances acquired at the existing rate, although one bank in particular is urging an increase of the rate, because, possibly, it has money loaned on properties that are being devalued, and may not be able to recover its losses. But as all private banks definitely refused to take their share of risk, if the exchange rate should collapse, the Commonwealth Bank is today shouldering the whole of the responsibility. To sum up the advantages and disadvantages of a high rate of exchange, I would say in the first place, that it benefits our exporters. The whole of our exportable wheat, wool, mutton, or beef is subsidized to the extent of the exchange. thousands of farmers would bo driven off the land. the honourable member for Echuca( Mr. H ill ) . When I was Prime Minister, 1 discussed this subject with the Commonwealth Bank Board, because it was essential then that we should keep our export trade moving along steadily in order to avert national disaster. A high rate also I s it not rather a question checks imports; it enables internal price levels to rise, and the extent to which it improves government revenues is reflected A f a l l in the value in increased returns from income and sales tax. The disadvantages are that it adds considerably to the cost of all raw I do materials and other necessary goods imported, and adds to the cost of remitting money overseas for interest, and services. It is therefore an important item in all Government budgets. To assume that a high rate puts money into tbe pockets of money lenders overseas, is incorrect. the pockets of the workers. the pockets of those who bave goods to export, The London investor lending money at 5 per cent, is paid in sterling £5 per annum for a £100 loan whatever may be the rate of exchange. If honourable members contrast the relaexchange. It should .also be tive price levels for primary and manufactured goods, tliey must admit that the primary producer is entitled to something to make good the disparity. SoI am not quarrelling with the present rate of exchange. All I say is that we should examine its advantages and disadvantages and, in view of our present difficulties, I think we should endeavour to hold it where it, is to-day, but if the tendency is upward, to allow the rise to take place. Certain members of the Country party state that the only effect on Government revenue of an increase of 10 per cent, in the rate of exchange would be approximately £3,000,000. They arrive at this figure by estimating that our overseas interest obligations amount to £30,000,000 a year, and assume that an increase of 10 per cent, in exchange would add £3,000,000 to the Government's budget. To prevent an increase in the cost of imported goods and raw materials, they also urge that the tariff should be reI f the rate were not high, duced by 10 per cent.

But I should add that, if an increase in exchange followed the employment of an additional 100,000 men, the advantages would far outweigh any disadvantages that would follow from having a difference between internal and external price levels. We have to consider whether we can afford to allow 400,000 of our people to remain in idleness and on the dole. I say unhesitatingly that, it, is the duty of governments to attack this problem. Private employers will not make a start to produce goods merely for stock, without a profitable market. It is the Government that must lead the way. A bank advance is the creation of credit. than the Commonwealth Bank, took Such advances in normal times would mean inflation; and in abnormal times would arrest the fall of price levels, which is now called reflation. The increased productivity of the workers would be an offset against advances, and would minimize the danger of a rapid rise in prices. But the position would need to be watched, and there would need to be a predetermined price level. If a higher exchange rate automatically follows some months behind the re-employment of tens ef thousands of our workers, then, whatever disadvantages there might be-and there would be disadvantages-the y would be far outweighed by the advantages. the exchange rate to be so high as it is to-day. has Australia suffered so severe a depression. The whole of the balance between debtor and creditor nations have been upset. ' If we contrast present conditions with those prevailing prior to the war, we must realize that war debts and reparations have done more than anything else to bring about disequilibrium between the nations. We now have to consider measures to correct the position. Our immediate task is to soften the blow and make conditions as easy as possible for our people during the next few years. As I have stated, some of the private banks are urging a higher rate of exchange, but decline to take any of the risk. Consequently, the Commonwealth Bank is buying and selling all the exchange offering, and there is no need for outside operators. The private banks in the present crisis are. adhering to the policy which they adopted when the Commonwealth and State Governments were in a financial jamb a year or two ago. When I was Prime Minister, I had to approach the Commonwealth and private banks for assistance to help finance deficits and loan works. ' Treasury-bills were issued at 6 per cent -a n extremely high rate of interest-bu t under the Premiers plan the rate was reduced to 4 per cent. Right through those troublous times, although the private banks, which had much greater resources a share of those treasury-bills to relieve the strain on the Commonwealth Bank, they insisted on the right to discount them with the Commonwealtli Bank at any time. Thus they were able to draw the interest, and were quite willing to. carry on until danger threatened, when they could pass the risk On to the Commonwealth Bank. But I do not wish to criticize them unfairly. They played a part, though, as I have shown, a comparatively small part, in helping governments out of their difficulties. The crisis has demonstrated that we cannot rely upon private banks. They expand or contract credit to suit their purpose, and often their action merely tends tb accentuate the difficulties. The Commonwealth Bank, although limited in its scope, in co-operation with the Commomvealth and State Governments, did more to save the situation than all the other banks combined. I siiggest, therefore, that if Ave are to deal adequately with the present problem, Ave must expand the Commonwealth Bank until it is the banker for all Australia. Banking, more than, anything else, is a national service, and that should be its basis-^-not profits and dividends.",23,Lyons

In his Speech this afternoon he interested the committee, as ho usually does, when he speaks upon abstract financial matters. With many of his conclusions"", every one in the chamber will agree, but with others, many of lis must disagree. His speech would have been more effective if we .had not all read passages' from it in the newspapers within the last week or so. The right honourable .members remarks regarding the bilnks have a familiar ring, because Ave have read most of them already in the metropolitan newspapers. The criticized tlic Government chiefly oh the score of Australia's overseas trade balance. emphasized this matter of the trade balance almost to the point of making it a' fetish: tinually hears references to the trade balance as if those speaking knew all about it, whereas, in fact, they know comparatively little. It is a fact that the trade balance to-day is against Australia, but there are reasons for that. The Leader of the Opposition stated that, for the first three months of the last financial yearj the trade balance vvas favorable to Australia, but he neglected to point out that the embargoes imposed by his government against the importation of goods had then been in operation for sixteen months, and their ful l effect Avas being felt. It is true that there has recently been a considerable increase in the volume of imports into Australia, and this can easily be accounted for. In the first place, large quantities of goods are being, imported to' replenish warehouse stocks, which became exhausted during the operation of the embargoes. Moreover, this is a period of the year in which Australia derives little or no benefit, so far as her trade balance is concerned, from her overseas exports. Over and above these two reasons, however, there is the fact that the adverse trade balance is largely accounted for by the importation of petrol and oil, piece goods, &c, things not manufactured in Australia, Avhich are coming here to meet the demand arising out of Australia's increased prosperity, upon Avhich she is just entering.

115,Mr Aechdalepaekhill,"O nviews. to-day he advocated inflation and its control, thereby contradicting what he said in the speech from, which I have quoted. The right honourable gentleman was not over generous to the members on this side in his references to the conversion of loans debt to her, the Commonwealth budget amounting to £560,000,000. Those loans were converted, not because of the influence of the Scullin Government. The confidence created by the fact that the conversion loan had the backing of honourable members on this side of the House was responsible, in a success,and the right honourable gentleman might well have mentioned that in his speech. Everybody knows that prices are down to-day. The man who bought a pastoral property when wool was bringing 2s. per lb. is a loser to-day by the fall in values. So, too, is the person who paid high prices for shares a year or two ago, and has received no dividends. Similarly, a person who bought a house a few years ago, and still owns it, has on his hands property which is now at a discount. This position must be faced, but it caiinot be corrected by tbe employment of money which has not been actually earned. No money can be honestly obtained unless it is actually earned. There are men to-day who advocate Weird methods of obtaining money from goodness knows where; but the only way in which unemployment can be ended is by less talk and a good deal more work. Wo must face the position manfully, and with the courage that is an inherent quality Of our race. Then Australia will emerge from this depression a wiser people, but with a prosperity that will be more substantial and enduring than that, enjoyed in the past. -We are glad to learn from the budget speech and the Estimates that the Government hopes to balance its accounts on the 30th June next; but it depends for that balance first upon, action which, it is hoped, will be taken by the United States of America. It is understood that a world monetary conference is to be lield before the end of this year at which it is hoped that some satisfactory arrangerespect to the cancellation of our interment may be reached with respect to war debts. If the war debt moratorium should be extended, or if there should be au absolute cancellation of internal war debt payments, that part of the budget will not be affected. If , however, only a reduction in the rate of interest due to America results, and Great Britain cannot, therefore, wholly Suspend our must, to some extent, be thrown out of balance. We benefit this year as we did last year by the British Government's suspension for two years of the payment on our war debt to it, a saving of a little over £2,000,000. In regard to £4,000,000, we have to depend on hoped for action considerable measure, for its on the part, of the United States of America. I was very glad to-day to hear the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) say that tbe British Government had indicated that it was prepared to suspend meanwhile the first payment for this year of our interest obligation to it. Evidently, Great Britain has some hope of action being taken by the United"" States of America in the direction to which I have referred. A striking fact which has emerged in world affairs within the last year or two in connection with the huge international payments arising out of the war, is that, whether interest or reparations payments, the difficulties connected with them are not all on the side of the debtor. Acceptance of payment in goods on an unprecedented scale such as is required in connection with some of these war payments has been very much feared both, on the one hand, by America, which receives the war interest, and, on the other hand, by Erance, which gets the lion's share^of the reparations payments. Both countries wish to obtain these payments, but both appear to have done everything possible to make payment, impossible by repeatedly raising their tariff barriers until it has been no longer possible for the payment to be made by the only sound means available to the debtors, namely in goods. Consequently payments were made in gold, and it is the drain of gold to those two countries that has had so much to do with the fall in the purchasing power of the world, and the los3 of confidence, due to so many countries going off the gold standard. If our hopes with",27,Pabkhill Such Proposal Means Permanent Inflation

117,Mr Archdale Parkhill,Yet,28,Pabkhill Such Proposal Means Permanent Inflation
118,Mr Paterson (Gippsland) [5.18].,"national war debt obligations materialize, the big drop in the expenditure from £29,500,000 in 1930-31 to £19,500,000 for this year, a reduction of £10,000,000, will have been achieved in two years. The saving arising out of the action of Great Britain will be nearly £6,000,00,0; some £2,500,000 has been saved by the reduction of the internal interest burden on war debt by our conversion loans, and roughly about £1,500,000 by the reduction of soldiers' pensions and repatriation and medical services, a total of about £10,000,000. The next biggest item in the budget is the payments to the States. These have shown a steady growth. Their refusal to diminish, however, can be viewed with a certain degree of equanimity, inasmuch as the money goes from the pocket of one government to that of another. To whatever extent we may assist the States, their governments are likely to reduce taxation. The Commonwealth contributions to the sinking funds for the extinguishing of the debts of the States have been steadily growing. During the past five years they have been as follows:Year. £ 1028-20 192930 .. 994,000 193031 .. 193132 .. 193233 .. _ .. 1,220,000 The amount of those contributions has increased from £931,000 to £1,220,000, or by approximately £300,000 in four years. Under the Financial Agreement made between the Commonwealth and the States, the Commonwealth contribution to the interest burden of the States being constant-abou t £7,500,000, representing about .1 per cent, on the total existing State debt of some £780,000,000-w e do uot share with the States in any relief gained by tbe conversion of State loans at a lower rate of interest. The States alone benefit hy such savings. For instance, under the recent conversion in London, money formerly costing 5-^r per cent, now C03ts about 4 per cent., the saving of l f per cent, benefiting the State of New South Wales alone. Henceforth, instead of the Commonwealth paying equivalent to 1 per cent, and tlie State 4$ per cent, on the amount converted, the State will pay about 3 per cent., and the Commonwealth will still pay 1 per cent. I congratulate the Government upon the success which has attended the conversion operation. . During a debate in this chamber recently upon the advisability of the right honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) going to London as Resident Minister, to assist in this project, I remarked that if with the assistance of the right honourable gentleman we were able to obtain a reduction in interest of only 2s. 6d. per cent, many thousands of pounds per annum would be saved; but the loan has been converted at a rate which is even more favorable than most of us anticipated. A member of the Beasley group interjected that exchange would have to be paid on the 4 per cent, which is the new rate of interest; but surely honourable members must realize that if we debit exchange we must apply it to principal as well as to interest. If we say we are paying iu interest 4 per cent, plus exchange, we have to admit that instead of converting some £12,750,000 sterling we converted what isequivalent to £16,000,000 Australian money. Moreover, if we must add exchange to the 4 per Amount. cent., we must also add it to the previous 5-J per cent. The States' interest burden .. .. 931,000 has been lightened by the conversion by .. 1,054,000 more than £3,000,000. .. .. 1,153,000 In a speech that I delivered in this chamber ten days ago, I referred to the bank overdraft of £82,000,000 that had been incurred within the last three years by the various Australian Governments. I wish now merely to emphasize the fact, that, although there has been no external borrowing during the last year or two, the governments of Australia, with the object of financing deficits, are still borrowing from the Australian banks at practically the same rate as formerly obtained in connection with public works. The Commonwealth hopes that this year it will "" break even "" ; but we were told by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) in his budget speech, that the States will add £9,000,000 to the bank overdraft of * £82,000,000. In those circumstances, it it necessary for us to realize that every possible economy must be made. To-day, in order to get within £9,000,000 of a budgetary balance in the accounts of the Commonwealth and the States, we are staggering under a tremendous load of taxation. Let me show the effect of that taxation (D) TAXABLE INCOME upon income obtained from money loaned Normal Federal income tax (£231 5s.) which reduces the either on mortgages on land or for business purposes generally, compared with the lighter burden that is borne by in(E) TAXABLE INCOME OF £2.000 FROM MORTGAGE AT 5 run comes derived from government bonds.

Even at 6 per cent., the margin above the return from bonds, after deducting taxation and .0 per cent. allowing for risk and the relative . 44 per eent. inconvertibility into cash, is compara.152 per cent. tively small. With prices for primary products as low as they are to-day, I 1.57 percent. believe that 5 per cent, is the maximum 4.43 percent. rate that the man on the land can afford 3.75 percent. to pay on mortgage; in fact, he cannot .08 per cent. pay that rate ou too big a mortgage. Some of those who are engaged in certain forms of primary production cannot afford to' pay any interest at all to-day. Money may be provided at 5 per cent, for mortgages on laud or for any other purpose only by the reduction of taxation. If the super tax of 2s. in the £1 on all mortgages of 5 per cent, or less were abolished, the disparity between the taxation imposed on the return from bonds and from other forms of investment would bo reduced by £ pev cent, or more; and the net interest return from a 5 per ceut. mortgage would be 4.19 per cent, on a taxable income of £1,000 and 3.78 per cent, on a taxable income of £2,000. The net return would be then .44 per centbetter than, that obtained from 4 per cent. Commonwealth bonds at par on a taxable income of £1,000, and approximately i per cent, better in the case of a taxable income of £2,000. That might be just sufficient inducement to investors to make money available for mortgages on land at 5 per cent. Nothing short of that reduction would be of any use. I remind the committee that when that special tax was imposed it was designed to obtain revenue from persons who, at the time were drawing a high rate of interest from gilt-edged securities. That 2s. in the £1 was taken off when the bonds were converted at a lower rate of interest, but it still remains on all other believe that the only means by which forms of investment. Until it is withdrawn generally, there must remain a wide gap between the price at which money can bo obtained for these purposes and the ruling rate of interest for giltforms of investment. edged securities. orable member advocate the reduction of interest on bonds? been entered into with the 97 per cent, of bondholders who agreed voluntarily' to convert, and also with the 3 per cent, who were compelled to convert, and I hope that neither this nor any other government will break that contract. I make it clear that I am not endeavouring to submit a case for, nor am I greatly concerned about the position of, the man with ah income of £2,000. I am urging the desirability of removing taxation from these incomes, not so much with the object look in connection with some of our of assisting the individual enjoying them as to bring down the price of money, and I suggest that action might be taken to remove the super tax of 2s. in the £1 from mortgages of, say, 5 per ceut. and under. That would be an inducement to persons to leud money at a lowerrate of interest, and would bring the rate of interest more into line with present earnings from bonds I quite realize that this Government is torn between a desire to reduce taxation on the one hand, and its determination to balance its budget on the other. "" But the desperate financial position of a very large portion of those engaged in primary production, and especially in wheat-growing, wool-producing, and raising lambs, calls for relief. I know that you, Mr Chairman, would be only too ready to add that the price of potatoes has fallen, and that potato-growers are in just a3 great difficulties as the otlier primary producers mentioned by me. It is useless for State Governments to pass legislation with the object of reducing the rate of interest on mortgages if the Federal Government imposes taxation which makes it practically impossible to obtain money at those reduced rates of interest. I am most anxious to see interest rates come down, aud I they can be reduced is by lowering the tremendous taxation which makes such a disparity between the rate imposed on bonds and that on incomes from other The position of the primary producers is so difficult that, at the first possible opportunity, the Commonwealth Government should join Avith the States in considering the desirability of taking some kind of concerted action to reduce taxation upon money lent for pastoral and agricultural purposes, in addition to removing the Commonwealth super tax of 2s. in the £1. In many fields it is desirable to obtain cheaper money, but everybody realizes the especially difficult position of those engaged iu producing primary products, the Avorld price of which has fallen to an unprecedently low level.

120,Mr Paterson,"A contract haspromising. A prominent Melbourne business man engaged in tbe wheat industry told me recently that, in his opinion, only could be overcome of altering the duty two things could prevent a large proportion of the wheat-growers from going out of business, the continuance of a bounty, or a rise in exchange. wheat-grower? merchant and, therefore, presumably, quite as well informed in a matteT of this kind as the man who grows the wheat. Supposing exchange were to rise. The advantage of a premium on exports of wheat, wool and other commodities would be partially offset by the additional cost of imports and the additional cost of certain locally manufactured goods, the price of which rises in sympathy with the price at which competitive goods can be imported. The protective incidence of exchange should be recognized, for, without doubt, exchange has a very substantial protective incidence to-day. Take, for example, a duty of 40 per cent. against which is really 44 per cent, owing to the method of its imposition. The primage tax, for the same reason, is 11 per cent, and not 10 per cent., which increases, the duty to 55 per cent. Exchange on top of that makes the total duty 80 per cent., on which is superimposed the natural protection afforded by freight, marine insurance and landing charges. I need not mention the sales tax, because that tax is common to what is produced in this country as well as goods imported. The time has come when some adjustment of duty should be made in harmony with the protective incidence of exchange. It was said by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Gullett) when I mentioned this matter before, that an almost insuperable difficulty would arise in connection with foreign exchanges, which vary considerably. The honourable gentleman pointed out, that while in the British column the rate of 25 per cent; would remain constant, and afford no diffigentleman apply that two-thirds reducculty, there would be trouble in connection with duties in the foreign column. Eor instance, the United States of America has a 60 per cent, exchange, while Japan has an exchange rate with us of approximately 15 per cent. The honourable gentleman asked how the difficulty so as to make it fair to both countries. Another objection taken was that manufacturers fear that if a duty were temporarily lowered because of the height that man a of tlie exchange, it might never come back to the previous level. My own experience is that it is easier to increase rates than to bring them down. But neither of those difficulties would arise if , instead of dealing with the customs schedule, we amended the Customs Act so that when duties were imposed on a particular consignment on a certain day, the incidence of the exchange ruling between the country from which the goodswere imported and Australia were recognized, and a certain proportion of the duty taken off to offset the exchange. I do not suggest that the whole of the exchange should be lost in that way. I recognize that there are some manufacturers who import some of their requirements, and have to pay exchange on those' importations. It would be for this Parliament Great Britain, or some technical body to decide what would be a fair reduction. I shall give an example of what would happen if a reduction of duty were made equivalent to, say, two-thirds of the existing exchange rates. The position in connection with' the United States of America would be that instead of a duty of, say, 60 per cent, plus an exchange protection of 60 per cent., an amount equal tb two-thirds of the exchange rate of 60 per cent, would be taken off the duty, lowering it to 20 per cent., which, plus the 60 per cent, exchange, would make a total of 80 per cent, instead of 120 per cent. In the case of Japan, two-thirds of the exchange, equalling 10 per cent., would be deducted from the duty of' 60 per cent., leaving 50 per cent., to which must be added 15 per cent, exchange.

A good deal has been said this afterments of the members of the Country noon about getting back to 1929 levels. Actually, we have not got very far away from those levels in respect of many of our manufacturered goods. Recently, there has been a welcome drop, but not anything like so great as that in connection with primary products. If the tremendous price gap to which I have referred were partially closed, much would be done towards putting us on the road to prosperity. Exchange would then be a factor in improving world prices of. primary products without increasing to the same relative degree, the price of the manufactured goods. It may be stated that we should get less revenue. I question that. duty and a 60 per cent, exchange, there are probably no importations from the United States of America at those rates, and therefore, no revenue from that source, whereas, the lower rate would induce importation, and produce, .at least, sonic revenue.

The alleged direct representatives of the primary producers have candidly admitted that the policy that is being pursued by this Government is not conducive to the rehabilitation of Australia. It may fairly be claimed, indeed, difficulties that existed Avhen the Government assumed office. I have no reason to doubt the stateparty concerning the position of the primary producers. I have friends and relatives engaged in primary production, particularly in the State of Victoria. In conversation during the last week-end, one of these people declared to me that the position of many primary producers in. his district Avas black, indeed, and that this gloomy outlook Avas caused to a large extent by the banks forcing these people to meet their overdrafts at short notice. Many people have, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has said, been put into a distinctly unfair position through the general tightening of credit. This has happened probably more in Victoria than in any other State. To-day, with a 60 per cent, A good deal has been said this afternoon about the primary producers.

It has been said that many peoplo iu the country are bankrupt; but there are thousands of people in the cities who have never been anything but bankrupt. severely in these difficult times through unemployment and wage reduction that neither I nor any other honourable member could find words to describe adequately the deplorable position in which they find themselves. Government is seeking to make still further inroads upon the little that many of the working people have left. At first it was only the workers who were attacked; but now the result of the present policy is also being felt by the primary producers. The .honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) has said a good deal about the necessity for recognizing the sanctity of contracts. Unfortunately, many honourable members seem to think that contracts should only be kept in regard to gilt edged securities and the like. suggest that a contract made with the workers in regard to wages and conditions is as much a contract as any of those referred to by the previous speaker. In fact, I think that contracts in relation to wages and conditions are even more important than contracts in relation to bonds and other securities, for if the contracts made with the workers are broken, those who suffer thereby arc immediately in dire distress. this Government has repeatedly disregarded the sanctity of tbe contracts made with the workers of this country. In February, 1931, an application was made to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for a general reduction of 10 per ceut. in the value of real wages, on the ground that there had been a serious fall in the national income. No regard was paid at that time to the fact that many Mv. Rcasley. workers had entered into obligations to purchase homes, and had made commitments of various other kinds. It We hear a good deal was simply argued by the Government that in order to bring about national recovery, and to cope with an acute and desperate situation, wages must be reduced. We know that employers, en bloc, requested the Arbitration Court to The result reduce wages, and that their application was endorsed by the various governments throughout the Commonwealth. At, that time we endeavoured to show that a contract had been made with the workers which was quite as binding as contracts These people are suffering so associated with bonds or other financial ° transactions. -member suggest that it. was a breach of contract to apply to the Arbitration Court for a reduction of wages? doubt about that, for Avage contracts made between the employers and employees are for a definite term, and should uot be interfered with until that term has expired. In this case the term had not expired. Successive applications have been made to the court, however, for wage reductions. Within the last fortnight I was compelled to bring under the notice of honourable members the violation of a contract made with the raihvay and tramway workers of New South Wales in regard to the federal I basic wage. These industrial contracts are, as I have said, of such importance that they should be regarded as equally sacred with any other contract. If their sanctity is disregarded, the flow of what is the economic life-blood of the people is stopped. Obviously, people who are living from hand to mouth must have at least a certain amount of money to keep body and.soul together, and anything that stems the flow Yet of their meagre income is intensely serious to them. The references this afternoon to the inroads that have been made upon the income of those who have invested their surplus money in gilt-edged securities, remind me that these people take very little, if any, risk at all.

In my opinion it would be a good thing for Australia if the investment of money in gilt-edged securities was made much less attractive than it is. It should be possible to devise unpopular and unpalatable proposals a financial system which would force people with surplus wealth to make it available for industry. If this were done, we should not have nearly so many of our people unemployed, for money would be circulating in tlie proper quarter, and that would make work. the money invested in bonds were placed in a current account, or if provision were made for the Commonwealth Bank to compel these people to use available surpluses of this kind, whicli really are the accumulation of unnceded money, a grant deal could be done to stimulate industry. stimulated if the burden of taxation were lifted from it. ber for New England talks about lifting the burden of taxation from primary production. generally-bot h primary and secondary production. den were lifted from primary and secondary industry I admit a great deal would be done to help both. We must remember that our burden ' of taxation is heavy, principally because of the exorbitant interest rates that we have to pay. prise honourable members to realize that in the last two years the wages bill of the New South Wales railway system was about £10,000,000, while the interest bill has been £7,000,000. At first our opponents endeavoured to improve the position by concentrating attention upon the wages bill. We know that wages were reduced so seriously that the purchasing power of the people fell enormously. At the time of which I am speaking, economists, statesmen and experts of one kind and another, said that wages must be reduced. When we said that something should bo done to reduce the interest bill, we were looked upon with scorn and horror. Those who opposed our view said that the mechanism of finance was so delicate that if anything were clone to interfere with the interest commitments,the results would be disastrous. But those who then opposed the alleged distinctly which we made, have since received them with open arms. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) had something to say about war debts. He remarked that the present budget position had been made possible only because of If the relief that had been obtained from war commitments through the Hoover moratorium ancl exemption from certain payments to Great Britain. The honourable gentleman also had a little to say about the cancellation of war debts. Yet two years ago, any one who suggested, that war debts should bo cancelled, was called a repudiatiouist. It was said that our war debts were solemn obligations, which must be observed just as commercial or industrial undertakings were observed. We were told that the same sacred principles applied to those contracts as to others. But we held different views on the subject and were not afraid to declare them. ber ancl his followers talked about repudiation, not cancellation. are forced into a corner by the sheer adversity of circumstances they find some other term to describe what they want to clo, although it is the very thing that we wish to do. Fortunately for them, they have the press of Australia to It may surhelp them to cover up their tracks. They simply change a term and 'think that they have thereby overcome a principle. E believe and hope that most of us will live long enough to see the men who, notwithstanding ridicule and contumely, have advocated certain means of restoring our country to prosperity, accepted as our greatest patriots. We have advocated these methods of assisting both primary and secondary production, and wo have been condemned for so doing.

137,Mr Beasley,"When our opponentsthe restoration of prosperity will be set down as more far-seeing citizens than their opponents. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. to the budget is in an endeavour to settle what I consider an important aspect of the policy at present being applied. The budget speech made many references to the Premiers plan, and I think the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) said that the proposals contained in the speech were to be regarded as a further step towards the development of that plan. Following upon the general elections in Queensland and New South Wales on the l l t h June last, there was a further meetof money. ing of Premiers which, from the public view point, could be regarded as having been convened for the purpose of taking a general survey of the economic condition of Australia and determining upon the next measures to be adopted in order to meet the situation. It is not necessary for me to go into details with respect to the proceedings or decisions of the Premiers; but before going further, I should like to clear up the point whether the financial policy embodied in this budget is, or is not, a part of the Premiers plan; and in order to do so, I propose to quote from speeches delivered in the Queensland Parliament subsequent to the return of the Premier from the conference. Mr Forgan Smith claimed to have been instrumental in modifying the Premiers plan, and declared that the policy previously followed had proved to be au absolute failure; that it had caused more misery and suffering than previously existed, and as a consequence a new principle had been adopted. In effect, he said, the Premiers plan had been thrown point cleared, up, because it is important. whether the right honourable the Prime Minister, in his budget speech, or the Premier of Queensland in the Queensland Parliament, has stated the actual position. Mr P. K. Copley speaking on the Address-in-Reply in the Queensland Parliament saidThe pessimistic Premiers plan, which was in operation during the regime of the late Government, was a plan responsible for despair and panic amongst the Australian people. Then Mr Gair, in making his contribution to the Address-in-Reply debate, congratulated the Premier upon his efforts at the Premiers conference and said "" It was like sunlight let into a dark cell."" If the budget speech delivered by the Prime Minister is ""sunlight let into a dark cell"", all I can say is that it is a remarkable document from the angle from which I view it. Mr Gair further statedAs the Premier said at thu recent Premiers conference, if the wage reduction policy was continued as a further attack upon the workers' wages, the purchasing power of the people would be so diminished that the business man would not make his turnover and his diminished profits would curtail the power The alleged arguments of the Premier of Queensland made the other Premiers realize that the lines upon which they had been proceeding for the previous three years were entirely wrong. The same gentleman also said that-Fortunately the people of Queensland wisely decided to follow the present Leader of the Government, and, as the representative of this State at the Premiers conference, he succeeded in winning the representatives of other States over to his views. The natural deduction to be drawn from Mr Gair's statement in support of the attitude of the Premier of Queensland, based, I take it, upon the report the Premier had submitted upon returning from the conference, is that drastic changes had been made in the plan. those changes were? the Premiers plan .by the speaker were to the effect that the.policy .of reducing the purchasing power of the people in overboard. I want this the form of either wages or social services was such that it had brought suffering I want to know and despair upon the people and consequently was entirely and .unutterably wrong. Broadly speaking,, that was the deduction to. be drawn from the report of the Premier of Queensland. That gentleman himself, speaking on the Address-in-Reply, rightly declared that the Labour party opposed the Premiers plan, which provided for arbitrary reductions in wages and social services. adopted by the Federal Labour party.",35,Bonds And Other Investments

It was adopted one day and rejected the next I do not know exactly where some of the then leaders of the Labour party stood, but I am now quoting what was said by the leader of the Labour party in Queensland-that the plan was not the -Labour party's plan. We in this corner endorse that. The plan was never the policy of the Labour party. party stood by the plan and supported it. West Sydney( Mr Beasley) represents only a part of the Labour party. accustomed to making threats, I think I can safely say that the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) will not be even a part of a party within a few months. The point I am making is either that some drastic changes have been made in the plan, that it has been entirely thrown overboard, or that the statements of the Premier of Queensland were wrong. Perhaps it may be as well to indicate how the Premier of Queensland viewed-the position. In dealing with the attitude of the Labour party, he saidLabour criticismgenerally has been amply justified. Not only has it failed to achieve budget equilibrium, but further unemployment has resulted with general business-stagnation. . . . The Premiers plan was conceived during a period of bitter and intense political less than a fortnight since the Financialcontroversy: The depression complex was widespread amongst the people and deflation and retrenchment were the order of the day. Either, the Premier of Queensland is wrong, -or tlie Prime Minister errs in emphasizing-the fact that certain pro^ posals in the budget speech are logical steps towards the development of the Premiers plan. It may be interesting to make a few comments concerning the Prime Min^ ister's review of the last twelve months'. The right honourable gentleman said "" It should hearten us to continue along the same track that we have followed."" Those words may appeal to very few, I am sure; but I feel certain that persons who have made sacrifices and experienced undue suffering as the result of the policy that has been adopted in this country, have no more desire to look back upon tbe past two years than they have to look forward to a continuation of it. I think that I can safely say that those electors who supported honourable members opposite at the last, general election are far from satisfied with the position as they now find it. They were led to believe that the present Government would, at least, hold the"" position then reached and not allow it to become worse. They expected that ui> employment would be relieved, and that even if old-age pensions were not restored, no further reductions would be attempted. They have, however, been sadly disillusioned. According to the quarterly figures of the Commonwealth Statistician, unemployment has reached a higher point than at any other time in our history. During the first six months this Government was . in office, unemployment increased from 28 per cent, to 30 per cent. Such is the answer to those honourable members opposite who declared on public platforms that this Government, if returned to power, would not only hold the position in the matter of unemployment and old-age pensions, but would also see that unemployment was reduced, and that pensions were restored. At least some' of them said so. The effect of the reduction in pensions has not yet been fully felfy and I am certain that honourable members oj>posite have already been asked to assist in removing many of the injustices which have resulted from the passage of recent legislation. It is Emergency Bill providing for a reduction in old-age pensions was passed,' but the people a*e already realizing how they were misled by the supporters'of the Government prior to the last general election. The Prime Minister also declared that the policy of the Government of New South Wales was largely responsible for the unsatisfactory financial position of the .Commonwealth, and that it was necessary to take certain action in order to' force that State into line with the other' States, whose developmental programme, as agreed upon at the conference, was being hampered.

The other States, it is said, were, by the action of the New South ""Wales Government, hampered in the work of rehabilitation; yet only the week before last financial measures were passed by this Parliament with the object of granting assistance to three States which were supposed to be supporters of the Premiers plan. grants of £1,000,000 to South Australia, £500,000 to Western Australia and £300,000 to Tasmania were partly the result of strict adherence to the Premiers plan, and it is remarkable that those States have to ask the eastern States to support them while they carry that plan into effect. However, by the action of the Commonwealth Government, assisted by the Governor of New South Wales, the government; of that State was changed, and the full significance of the Prime Minister's reference to enabling New South Wales to co-operate with the other States in carrying out the plan is now being realized by the people. I am certain that the workers who suffered a sudden cut. of the basic wage by 12s. 6d. a week now understand what that plan means. The restrictions on food relief imposed by. the present Government of New South-Wales also will be appreciated by the people, who are forced to rely upon government assistance. One incident that occurred in a street next to that in which, I live illustrates the callous attitude pf the ! State Government. Some spy declared that one recipient of the dole had secured employment for a couple of days at the meat works. / alleged income, which the worker denied and the department could not prove, not only was he refused food -relief but even his invalid child was unable to get the special food which a doctor had ordered. To justify the Government's harsh policy, all manner of corruption is alleged against the unfortunate people who are obliged by their circumstances to ask for State relief. Another hardship is in connection with the identification of the applicant for food relief. If he is not known to the police or some other specified authority, he is refused relief on the principles of the Premiers plan, and a Mr Hamlcy. Honourable score that he is unidentified. Not even his registration on the electoral roll is accepted. It is. distressing to me to have necessitous men and women wait upon me with complaints that they are unable to obtain food supplies, and when I asked an official of the department what I could do to help these unfortunates, he replied "" Send them to me and I will see what I can do ""-thi s after having withheld relief for a week or ten days. No doubt The this restriction is part of the co-operation which the Commonwealth Government demanded of the New South Wales Government. The moaning of this co-operation will be appreciated also by those who arc to suffer a 15 per cent, reduction of the childhood endowment, by the widows whoso pensions are to be reduced, and by the 3,000 railway and tramway employees whose jobs are to be abolished. The setting aside of the federal basic wage on the application of the Minister for Transport will also help the people of New South Wales to understand the effect of the change of government in that State, and the co-operation of the Stevens Ministry with the governments of the other States. I am satisfied, however, that the people who are being driven by this policy to desperation will, at a date not far distant, free themselves of the illusion that was created prior to the last general election in New South Wales, and reverse the decision they then gave. The Prime Minister declared that all Australian Governments are now adhering to the Premiers plan. The Premier of Queensland and his supporters declare that the plan is not being Because of this followed in that State. Here is a contradiction which I would like the Prime Minister to explain. I hope that the Queensland Government is not following the Premiers plan but is remaining true to the principles of the Labour movement. Time alone will toll whether that is so, but I trust that the real Labour policy will be adopted by Mr Forgan Smith, a policy which will prove to be of benefit to the people.

The Loader of the Opposition ( Mr tion, as its underwriting at £97 10s. means Scullin) has moved an amendment drawing attention to the problem of unemployment. I shall support the amendment, but I regret that the right honourable gentleman did not take the opportunity which this debate presents to widen the scope of his protest by calling attention to other injustices which the present Government is imposing on the Australian people. Particularly do I protest against the glaring inequity of demanding from the invalid and old-age pensioners, by reducing their pensions, a sacrifice of £1,100,000 towards the estimated saving of £1,479,000, and at the same time lifting taxation from other sections better able to bear the burden. This is especially unjust in view of the fact that the treasury returns of revenue and expenditure for the first three months of the financial year indicate that a greater surplus than that for which the Treasurer budgeted will be realized. I protest also against a further reduction of public servants salaries, and the refusal of the Comresolutions upon the Commonwealth monwealth Government to observe arbitration awards and acknowledge the principle of'the basic wage. I protest against the failure to demand and obtain a decrease [37.1 of the rate of interest on the New South Wales loan recently converted, to a rate commensurate with the terms upon which the British war debt of £2,000,000,000 was converted. It is useless for honourable in regard to this transaction. The terms obtained from the British money lenders were less favorable than were expected, and from the point of view of the Australian people were unreasonable. Much has been said throughout, the country about the great sacrifices that were being that the made by all sections, but thousands of people are arriving at my conclusion, that the talk of equality of sacrifice was only a catch-cry for the purpose of deluding reasonable and impartial people into supporting the Nationalist party candidates. Those who believe in the declaration that sacrifices were to be The Prime required of all sections, now realize that the policy of the Commonwealth Government does not include sacrifices by the bondholders. The designation of the New South Wales conversion loan as a 3-1 per cent, issue is a deliberate misrepresentaa discount of £2 10s. per cent, for a period of five years, bringing the yield up to £4 Is. 2d. per cent, without exchange according to the official statement of the Prime Minister. While exchange maintains its present level, the cost of the loan will be almost 5-J per cent. That is the comment of the weekly newspaper published by Windeyer, Fawl and Company on Sunday last. I protest against, the failure of the Government to make adequate provision in the budget for the absorption of the unemployed in accordance with the definite promise of Nationalist candidates at the last general election, and its failure to grapple with the growth of unemployment, which according to the Commonwealth Statistician's quarterly report increased from 28 per cent, to 30 per cent. during the first six months of the Government's term of office.

150,Mr Beasley,"I have mentionedover to the Tariff Board for a fixed term of years the sole right to determine the fiscal policy of this country, and at the same time giving the British manufacturers an unrestricted charter to exploit the Australian market to the detriment of our own secondary industries. We feel that the Leader of the Opposition ought to have taken advantage of this opportunity to voice a protest against these features of government policy to which I have referred. The amendment should have been much more comprehensive. There is no doubt that the general position of Australia has not improved; many sections of our people are suffering severely, and as the Premiers plan has developed one section after another has been, called upon to make sacrifices. The first to suffer were the workers, whose wages have been reduced to a miserable dole, whilst hundreds of thousands are subsisting by means of food relief coupons. The next victims were business people and others who iu more prosperous days had amassed small amounts of capital, but who now, through the decreased purchasing power of the community and the fall in the general level of prosperity, see their reserves being.' gradually depleted. If the present'process of impoverishment continues, they too, in time, will be reduced to the extremity of relying upon government relief. Now the indigent aged and sick are being attacked. So the policy goes on; it is like a cancerous growth that is gradually eating into the vitals of the community, and eventually national collapse will be inevitable. Because of their environment and their more fortunate circumstances, honourable members opposite may not appreciate what is happening, but we who are acutely aware of these things take this opportunity to voice our protest against the present ruinous policy. We support the amendment, but base our protest on the broader grounds I have mentioned. should prefer to discuss industrial matters free of political bias, because political influence in industry has been, one of the greatest handicaps suffered by Australia for several years. Nevertheless I feel that it is incumbent upon me to remove the doubts of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), regarding the attitude of the Premier of Queensland to the Premiers plan. I was in Canberra while the Premiers Conference was in session, and, sitting in this chamber I listened to the speech of Mr Forgan Smith. He spoke after the Premier of New South Wales, and his remarks might be said to have been an echo of those which preceded them. Indeed, I understand that privately Mr Forgan Smith stated that Mr Stevens had "" stolen his thunder "". The Premier of Queensland had come to the conference fresh from a general election, during which one of the principal features of his policy was the raising of an internal revival loan of £2,500,000, because, lie said, the process of deflation had gone far enough and it was necessary to restore the purchasing power of the workers. At the conference the financial situation generally was discussed, and the Premiers unanimously agreed to re-affirm the plan of 1931. The report of the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held at Canberra on the 28th, 29th, and 30th June last, contains the following:Discussion of the motion by Mr Lyons, and the amendment thereon proposed by Mr Forgan Smith, was continued. ResolvedThat this conference affirms its adherence to the principles of the Premiers plan of 1931, and undertakes to meet interest obligations, to continue progressively to reduce budget deficits, and to conduct public policy with a view to reviving industry, so as to restore normal employment to those of our citizens who now have neither work nor wages. It will thus be seen that the reaffirmation of the Premiers plan was unanimous. Later, in the Queensland Parliament, when the proposed revival loan was under discussion, Mr Forgan Smith said that there was now no need to take action, because fuuds had become available from another source, indicating, of course, that the Commonwealth Government, in collaboration with the various States, had made financial. provision for the relief of unemployment.

153,Mr Hutchin,"I wish to-night torelationships, and kindred matters affecting .social and industrial life in Australia. By way of opening, I should like to refer briefly to the history of this movement, because that is necessary before one can make a comprehensive survey of the situation. It is only within the last 40 years or so that public conscience has been seriously aroused concerning the evil conditions which existed in industry. The first mention made of it in the literature which I have beeu able to consult was in a report submitted to the House of Lords, in 1888, by a committee which made a sweeping condemnation of sweating in what were described as home industries. I believe that many of those evils, which every person with a decent social conscience must deprecate, are to be found in certain cities in Australia. The present depression has been responsible for a substantial reversion to sweating conditions in home industries, in Sydney and Melbourne particularly. The next reference to which I direct attention comes from no less exalted a person than His Holiness, Pope Leo XIII . , who, in an encyclical in 1891, said:Eucli one litis ti right to procure what is required in order to live; and the poor can procure it in no other way than by work and wages. Let it he granted then, that as a rule workmen and employer should make freo arrangements, and, in particular, should freely agree as to wages. Yet there is a dictate of nature more imperious and more ancient than any bargain between man and man, that theremuneration must be enough to support the wage earner in reasonable and frugal comfort. The first evidence of an awakening social conscience with regard to unfair industrial conditions in Australia was the appointment, in Victoria in 1884, of a royal commission to inquire into subcontracting and sweating iu home industries. In 1890, a bill was introduced in the Queensland Parliament to give effect to the principle of a living wage. In 1892, the Government of South Australia ordered an inquiry into reports of sweating in certain industries. Victoria, in 1894, passed the Shops and Factories Act, and some years later enacted legislation fixing the minimum wage in industry at 2s. 6d. per weeka figure which might appear to be somewhat ridiculous to-day. Another important advance in Victorian legislation was the establishment of wages boards to determine wages payable in certain trades, and to make them legally enforcible. That was the first touch of compulsion in Australian industrial legislation. South Australia followed suit, fixing a minimum wage in industry of 4s. a week, and providing for the appointment of boards on lines similar to those established in Victoria. In Queensland the minimum hours in industry in 1900 were fixed at 56 hours and the minimum wage at 2s. 6d. a week. Eight years later Queensland set up wages boards similar to those operating in the southern States, but it was not until 1912 that the principle of compulsion was introduced iu Queensland legislation. In succeeding years, not only in Australia but also in America and Europe, there was a steady growth of public opinion favoring the fixing of a living wage in industry sufficient to enable a man to live in frugal comfort, and keep in bodily health and to fit him to do his work. In Australia finally we had superimposed upon' the industrial laws of the various States the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act. In this respect we followed the lead set by New Zealand in 1894, when conciliation boards were appointed and provision made for a court of appeal. As every one knows, the passing of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act led to a great deal of confusion. Numberless strikes and much litigation ensued, because the borderline between Federal and State jurisdictions was not clearly defined. High Court decisions varied according to the view taken by the personnel of that tribunal of the law governing the matter. The High Court decisions particularly concerned matters of jurisdiction: whether the dispute was one of which the CommonAvealth or a State tribunal should take cognizance; whether Federal or State awards should be paramount. At one .time, as honourable members will recall, industrial organizations Avere at liberty to accept either a State or a Federal award, whichever was the higher. It Avas not till recent years that the High Court enunciated the principle that federal arbitration jurisdiction sbould be supreme. Then there was the furthei point whether the Federal Arbitration Court had power to make a common rule. In this matter the High Court held against, the federal tribunal, but laid it down that federal awards were paramount, and that the court could make awards binding employers or prospective employers, or employees or prospective employees. Recent decisions have done much to remove overlapping between Federal and State jurisdictions. From what I have said it will be seen in the matter. I very much doubt that our Arbitration Courts have that it is politically possible, let alone laboured under difficulties which arc not desirable, to transfer all industrial experienced by the ordinary courts of law, jurisdiction to the Commonwealth. The which have centuries of precedents and tradition to guide them. The common honourable member for ""Herbert( Mr law of England is the growth of Martens) who, I know, is interested in centuries. to think, is pure, aud our judges are reason why such a change should not be guided by well defined underlying prinmade. In Queensland, recently, when ciples. Our Arbitration Courts have there was an application before the State pioneered an original field of jurisdiction court to reduce the basic wage by Ss. a and have been obliged to build up their week, the court deferred its decision until own practice. As might be expected, in February next, quite unmindful of the their earlier years the machinery of the fact that the people in the other States courts has not run quite as smoothly as have already made considerable sacrifices, might have been desired, because the while Queensland, which has made such judges have been dealing, not so a terrible fuss about sugar, is not yet much with fixed principles as with prepared to do so. social and industrial changes.

Of course, the time will come when social and industrial progress. arbitration jurisdiction has to try to keep other States. In the New South Wales pace with this march. For this reason our railways case which was before the Arbitration Court judges are entitled to Arbitration Court recently, the court itthe utmost synrpathy, which is not always self suggested that matters of industrial extended to them.

In Australia there are five principal groups of wage earners-thos e government services and the service of public bodies; those engaged in manufacturing and services incidental thereto; those engaged in agriculture and allied pursuits; those engaged in the mining industry; and those engaged in industries of a purely interstate character. question is whether an obligation should be placed on federal arbitration in regard to each of those five groups. I am trying to luok at this issue from a practical point of view, apart altogether from politics. I consider that it is practicable and advisable that a centra] authority should lay down general standards in respect of the living wage and working hours, and that it should adjudicate in respect of purely interstate industries. But arbitration should be decentralized in respect of industries which are not of an interstate character. function which should be handed back to the States or, better still, to industries themselves, so that the employer and employee may confer and settle their own disputes on the job. It is because people like houorable members opposite, whose political origin is due to union activity, are not willin g to confer in this way that there is this gap between .employer and employee, which, while it exists, does not permit the country to progress. I shall now refer to the report which the British Economic Mission submitted to the Federal Government on the occasion of its visit to Australia in 1929. The members of that mission were knowledgeable men; they made a thorough investigation and passed opinions regarding our industrial problems. To many of the members of this House, those opinions are well known. The following is the gist of their remarks upon The only result our industrial arbitration system:The indictment of tlie system of the Arbitration Courts which we have heard is a heavy one; and we feel that it is well founded on many grounds, and particularly on the ground that the system has tended to consolidate employers and employed into by Judge Draketwo opposing camps, aud has lessened the inducement to either side to resort to round table conferences for that frank and conI t is a fine example fidential discussion of difficulties in the light of mutual understanding and sympathy whicli is the best means of arriving at fair and workable industrial agreements. If honourable members do not agree with in that statement they are blind to the real facts. We have, in Australia, because of the arbitration system which we have built up, the unfortunate spectacle of organized employees massed on the one side of industry and organized employers massed on the other side. Every The endeavour to get them together has failed, and as a result the development of decent industrial relations in many of the main unions of the Commonwealth has been retarded Lord Amulree, who was the president of the BritishI n dustrial Courtf o r a number of years,'in his review of industrial arbitration made this significant remarkOne conclusion, however, stands out prominently from tlie mere narrative^ namely, that tlie settlement of industrial differences, otherwise than by means of a trial of. strength, between employers and work-people is That is a primarily not a matter of administrative machinery or legislative provision, but of goodwill and common sense. .The main point that I wish.to stress is that our industrial troubles' w ill be solved, not so much by the Arbitration Courts, as by the application of goodwill and common sense. Mr Jethro Brown, President of the Industrial Court of South Australia, as f a r back as 1920, saidThe Court merely prescribed minima.

163,Mr Hutchin,"than can justly he ensured or imposed by .courts which have to deal, not with an indithat industry were discussed at roundvidual business concern, but with industry as u whole. We have evidence of the progress that has been made in industrial conditions from the days of sweating in home industries, to the day of the living wage. We cnn never expect to have complete agreement in industrial matters while the protagonists of socialism claim that capitalism has failed and that the workers must take over industry if they are to obtain from it that to which they are justly entitled. I have livel among the workers all my life and I know perfectly well that they do not want to control industry; that all they are asking for is a fair deal. If they want a fair deal, it is up to them to confer with the employers, and tell them what they consider is fair. They should do their part, not only to sustain the stability of their own particular industry, but also to promote industrial welfare throughout Australia. On the other hand, the employers must set an example to the workers in encouraging round table conferences. All their cards must be placed on the table, and they should use their efforts in the direction of benefiting Australian industry as a whole. Tf those things are not done, Australia, so soon as it emerges from the depression, will again experience the industrial strife which was rife during the ten years prior to 1929. There are signs of it already, in the recent wages dispute in the textile industry in the southern States. That industry, which was in the doldrums for some years, has gradually become more prosperous. The warehouses, owing to the depletion of their stocks, have placed steadily increasing orders with the f actories. result of the tariff. has been the result of the tariff which the Scullin Government passed; but the absorption of existing supplies has been the principal factor. member believe in the kind of round-table conference offered to the public servants? about that matter, but I do know something of the dispute in the textile industry. Por many years industrial conditions in table conferences, and later the decisions arrived at were made consent awards of the court. But there came a time when the minority asserted itself and said to. the workers in that industry "" Come with us, and we will get you more wages"". They held a gun at the heads of the employers who, unfortunately, gave way. Ultimately, the matter was referred to the court. dispute occur because of a 20 per cent, reduction ? of living award the wages of workers in the textile industry were due to be reduced by 15 per cent, from the 1st July last. The union had agreed to that arrangement ; but because the drop was a severe one the minority objected to it. Arguing that because the industry was prosperous there was no need for the cut, they went back on their own agreement. If there is to be peace in industry; if goodwill and efficiency are to be maintained; if the fruits of industry are to become greater, both employers and employees must show a willingness to face the facts. If iu times of difficulty an industry cannot earn profits, and calls on its workers to make sacrifices, it should, when prosperous times return, treat its employees with corresponding consideration. If peace is to he preserved in industry, the parties concerned in a dispute should not rush to the Arbitration Court at the first opportunity, but should rather sit down together and confer about their differences. An essential element of success is a feeling of goodwill between employer and employee. What is both fair and possible should be the criteria in deciding what the workers in industry should be given. It is essential that industries make good profits in order to provide funds for the extension of business and the financing of new activities. ' I u the interests of the workers as well as of the shareholders the profits in industry should be substantial. In the accounts of every concern provision must be made for depreciation, insurance ancl contingencies. Finally there comes the time when a net I do not know much profit is declared.

On examining the decisions reached at the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa, we notice that Australia undertakes to remove the prohibition against the importation of certain British goods, to remove customs surcharges, and to reduce or remove the primage duty, so soon as Commonwealth finances will permit.

The comment of the world's purchasing economists, as published iu the.

Probably after another loan conversion, which we may expect the press to applaud as a wonderful success, we shall find him returning to Australia in a blaze of glory, and honourable members opposite will no doubt find a soft corner for the present Prime Minister, so that the right honourable member for Flinders may once more be Prime Minister. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that it was necessary to restore the commodity prices prevailing in 1929. No doubt the right honourable gentleman firmly believes that such an action would provide a solution of the problem. He said that what was wanted to-day was not inflation but deflation; but I point out that in order to restore the 1929 price levels, some inflation would be necessary. Many honourable members believe that by stimulating primary production our difficulties would be removed. As a matter of fact, the members of the Country party realize that prices of primary products are still falling, ancl will continue to fall. on to other markets ancl would thus cause We find that because of the intense competition to-day for world markets, British imperialists who have invested money in secondary industries in Great Britain are desirous of crushing Australian secondary industries, and making Australia a country for the production of cheap raw materials. A further conflict of interests is due to the fact that American capital is also invested in Australian secondary industries, and it is natural that the capitalists of America will not sit idly by without protest. Conflict in the economic field eventually leads to armed conflict, and that is a danger which the workers must guard against. One has only to mention the word "" Russia"" many honourable members immediately lose their mental balance. They deprecate the importation of Russian timber, aud talk of the necessity for imposing a clumping duty upon it. But I ask honourable members why they have not considered the wisdom of encouraging trade with Russia. realized the possibilities in that direction, and are taking advantage of them and evidently on a profitable basis. Germany ancl the United States of America do a large amount of trade with' Russia, and so does Great Britain, but not so much trade as she coiild if the privatebanks would be prepared to meet present day conditions in that country, ancl follow the example of Germany and the United States of America by granting credits up to eighteen months. British bankerswere not prepared to agree to a period longer than twelve months. The opportunities that they discarded were grasped by German industrialists aud American producers; and it is a remarkable fact that the credits extended to Russia by Germany were made possible by loans to Germany by British banks. Tlierefore, British capital actually was used against the interests of the British people in those markets. Any one who has studied the figures knows that the quantity of Russian oil entering Great Britain is becoming greater year' by year, ancl that Russian wheat is preferred to the Australian product in the British market, the argument being that if Great Britain did not purchase it, it would be forced world prices to be reduced. I have heard many honourable members argue that Australia relies wholly upon her exports of wheat and wool, and that in order that those industries may survive they must be subsidized by means of a bounty or through the agency of the exchange. WhatI sliould like to know is, if we are all leaning upon those industries, and they in turn are leaning upon us, by whom is the whole supported? The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) said that the exchange rate was a direct advantage to primary producers. The advantage that it confers is not so great as might appear on the surface. A raisin this chamber, and ing of the exchange rate would increase the return which the primary producer received for his product, but concurrently it would also add to the overseas indebtedness of the governments of this country, and make it necessary to levy additional taxation so that budgets might be balanced. The men who are producing Other countries have arc in a position to pay taxes, but the unemployed cannot do so; consequently a big portion of the taxation that is necessary for the discharge of our overseas indebtedness is paid by the primary producers themselves. Thus it cannot be said that the raising of the exchange rate can be considered as an unmixed blessing. Yet some honourable members ancl others say that it ought to go higher and higher if a greater measure of prosperity is to be achieved! I confess my utter inability to follow their line of reasoning. The Leader of the Opposition said that the bench regretting that it is necessary in days gone by he was, ancl that he still for them to ask the workers to make is, opposed to inflation. In ray opinion, further sacrifices, but they compel the however, the arguments that he used making of those sacrifices Avhilc refusing could not be construed in anj' other way to take similar action themselves. than as in favour of inflation.

He would be wise to attend to his, if he hopes to retain much cleverer than I give them credit his seat after the next appeal to the people. We do not all possess luxurious limousines in which we may travel the country enjoying ourselves at the expense of the people, while shutting our eyes to the misery that exists in our electorates. -I have no misconceptions regarding the sufferings of the unemployed. I have been one of them, and I mix with them continually. I know the demands that are made upon them. Those who talk of having made sacrifices should try the. experience of existing on the dole, and by mixing with these people learn whether there are many cases of fraud among them. If they mixed with old-age and invalid pensioners they would find that many of them are existing on two meals a day because they cannot afford a third. Yet whenever honourable members go through an all-night sitting, they have a fourth meal provided for them. I do not blame those who think differently from me; probably the environment in which they have been brought up has not been the same, and they do not understand these things as do men of the Labour party who have been among the people and have suffered and worked with them. The problem will not be solved by the making of flowery speeches, or by optimistic references to the prospects of an early return to prosperity. I say quite candidly that I am convinced that what we are experiencing is not an ordinary depression but the decay of the social order. The governments of the world will not stabilize the position by a policy of low wages aud intensive competition among themselves. The party to which I belong is hopeful not of stabilizing it, but of changing society in such a way that the first care of every government will be the needs of the people and the first demaud upon every industry the satisfaction of those needs. I ask honourable members, as intelligent men, whether they believe that food should be cast into the sea when there are people who need it, whether factories should remain idle when workers are crying out for boots, clothing, and shelter, and wish to be given the opportunity to keep the wheels revolving. If they can show me how it is possible to stabilize the world position iu any other way than that which I have suggested, they are for being. wish, first, to congratulate the honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutehin) upon the speech that he delivered to-night. The latter portion of it interested me very greatly. The adoption of his proposal would go far towards bringing together master and man in Australia. I have been a large employer of men, and have never concerned myself as to whether those whom I engaged were unionists or not. The conditions of their employment were' fixed by mutual arrangement between them and me. I always gave them to understand that, should, trouble arise, they should mention the matter to me and not "" tell it to the world."" I never had any difficulty in adjusting a grievance. If this principle were adopted, not only by individual employers but also by firms and companies, many difficulties would be avoided. There are factors which to-day make 'it almost impossible for master and man to work amicably together, and party politics have been largely responsible. Frequently the elected representative of the x^eople is merely a rubber stamp, the real politician being the trade union organizer. I would refuse to enter Parliament on such a basis. I hope that the suggestion of the honourable member for Denison will be adopted throughout Australia, and that much good will be obtained from it.

I. also listened with interest to the cri tical speech of the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin). He referred to the present Commonwealth surplus. That is easily exnlained. For the past two or three years the warehouses in Australia have had to draw heavily on their stocks, which naturally became almost depleted. uecessary replenishment of those stocks has been largely instrumental in bringing about the surplus mentioned by the right honourable gentleman. He claimed that the Government had made a mistake in lowering the tariff. I remind him that the Government promised the people that it would revise the tariff within reason. It has fulfilled that obligation. I also remind him that high tariffs are detrimental to our trade, and cause retaliation on the part of those on the other side of the world. In that respect, it is always well to bear in mind the words of the ScripturesAs ye would that men should do to you, of its most capable members, whose serdo ye also to them likewise.

I offer, in all sincerity, the suggestion that tenders should be called for the lease of our hotels, and trust that tbe Ministerf o r the Interior( MrP a r k h ill) -will take it seriously. I entered this Parliament as a business man, and I wish to see the affairs of the Government conducted on business lines. I am glad that £10,000 is being provided on the Estimates for the transfer of another department from Melbourne to Canberra. opinion. When Canberra became the Seat of Government, it was intended that the central staffs of all the departments sliould be transferred to it. I believe that provision has been made here for a. population of between 25,000 aud 30,000 people. It. is not f a ir to the business people who have established themselves in Canberra, or to the officers of the departments already here, that other departments which sliould be transferred, are allowed to remain in Melbourne. If all the departments ultimately intended to be located here were transferred without loss of time, Canberra would become more revenue producing. On several occasions, I have referred in this chamber to the subject of afforestation. ago, I have had the opportunity, by the the. forest plantations in the Eederal Capital Territory, not only on M t . Stromlo, but also much farther afield. But neither these visits nor my conversamy opinions. I still believe that the authorities are trying to grow five or six trees where only one can grow really well. It is a satisfaction to mc to know that, in consequence of my representaout the trees on a portion of the M t . Stromlo plantation so that each tree will have a minimum spread of 16 feet. This w i ll reduce the number of trees per aero from 500 to about 170. The effect of this policy can be closely observed in the next two years. I feel confident that it w i ll be so satisfactory, and that the growth of the remaining trees w ill be so stimulated, that other portions of the area w ill he treated in a like manner. A f t e r visiting the area being planted beyond the Cotter river, I am convinced that the rainfal l in that locality is greater than it is at Mount Stromlo, and that the soil and conditions generally are better. In that locality the trees have been planted twelve feet apart instead of eight feet as at Mount' Stromlo. It will, however, be necessary to remove the lower branches of these trees for a number of years, to prevent tbe timber becoming knotty. I do not think that it will ever be practicable to produce in this Territory pinus insign is of the type grown in the south-east, of South Australia, where the timber is equal to that grown in any part of the world; but it should be possible to produce in the Federal Capital Territory timber of a superior quality to that now being grown. In studying afforestation from the commercial aspect, consideration must, be given to the cost of transport, and in this connection we have to remember that, the timber produced in the Federal Capital Territory must be transported to cither Sydney or Melbourne before it can be of any commercial value. I think I would be safe in saying that by the time haulage is paid from the forest to the railway, and rail freight to either Sydney or Melbourne, the cost of transport will be Since then, only a fortnight greater than the price obtained for the timber or that at which similar timber could be obtained from overseas. If the Government intends to continue with its afforestation policy in the Federal Capital Territory, I trust that it w ill pay some regard to the experience of the South Australian Government in a similar venture. The pinus insign is produced in South Australia is equal to that grown in almost any part of the world, but in that State a great, mistake has been made. The forests at Wyatt Park and Wirrabara are the oldest in Australia, having been planted sixty years ago. Four years ago, I was asked by the Controller of Forests to conduct an investigation into the afforestation work in that part of the State. The quantity of timber available was estimated at, 80,000,000 super, feet-m y estimate is approximately 40,000,000 feet-for which the Government was offered 2s. 6d. per 100 super.",53,Bonds And Other Investments

The mistake made in that way should not be repeated in the Federal Capital Territory. Wirrabara forest, ""Wyatt Park, and the Wirrabara township, constitute the three points of a triangle, all of which are 7 miles apart. The Government established a timber mill at the Wirrabara forest which is 7 miles from the township of Wirrabara, and also worked the Wyatt Park forest in conjunction with the Wirrabara forest mill. This involved cutting the timber in tlnjmade certain suggestions to the officer forest at Wyatt Park and carting it 7 miles to -the Wirrabara forest. It was not long before the road between those two points became worn out, and the timber was then carted an additional 7 miles through the township to the Wirrabara forest, from which point it had to be carted another 7 miles to the Wirrabara township, to be loaded ou trucks for transport to the city. The mill should have been set up in the Wirrabara township adjacent to the railway station, and one carting would then have been sufficient. The Government's estimate of the production of the two forests was, as I have said, 80,000,000 super, feet, which could have been sold at 2s.' 6d. per 100 super, feet on the spot. Had that, offer been accepted, the Government £100,000 for it. Instead of doing so, it erected State mills and entered into competition with private enterprise. WhanI visited the mill four years ago it was engaged in cutting standard fruit cases on which a loss of Id. per case was being made. It takes 4 superficial feet of timber in the log to cut a standard fruit case on each of which the Government was making a loss of Id., which means that the £100,000 offered for the timber in the forest will be lost together with an the Government should be extending and additional £85,000. After a lapse of 60 years in which this timber has been growing and expense in wages and in other directions has been incurred, a loss of over £80,000 has resulted.. Some honourable members may think that matter forward, but I mention the experience of South Australia so that connection with afforestation work in the Federal Capital Territory. I trust that whatever government is in power when the timber is ready for marketing, an ^effort will be made to dispose of it in the most' profitable manner. There are many thousands of acres under timber in the Mount Gambier district iu South Australia, where the mills are cutting 30 feet of timber from trees fifteen years of age. There are trees sixteen years of age in the Mount Stromlo area from which 3 in. x 3 in. limber could not be cut. I have in charge of afforestation work in the Federal Capital Territory, which I hope will be acted upon. I regret that the policy adopted at Wirrabara has also been followed at, Mount Gambier. It has also been suggested that it is proposed to plant the pin-us insign is between Mount Stromlo and Black Mountain, but I trust that that will not be done, because the nature of the country is such that the trees could not possibly thrive even to the extent, they have at Mount Stromlo. I have brought this matter forward in the interests of the Commonwealth, and I hope that the Government will give it further careful consideration. [10.20] I support the amendment, because of its general criticism of, and protest, against, the budget, and bewould have obtained cause of the appeal it makes to the Government to reconsider the proposed reduction of pensions. Seeking a motive for the Government's drastic invasion of the rights of our poorest people by a reduction of pensions and the basic wage, one would naturally expect to find that the finances of the country were much worse this year than they were last year. But an examination of the facts shows that the contrary is the case, and suggests that improving its social services rather than curtailing them. It is safe to say that the budgetary and political position is 50 per cent, better than it was this time",54,Bonds And Other Investments
195,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"last year, and in view of that fact I protest against the Government's ruthless interference with social services. Having regard to the political circumstances that existed last year, the present Government is in a very fortunate position; there is no "" bad boy "" in the public life of Australia to-day, and we are assured that all governments are co-operating in the effort to restore budgetary equilibrium. That was not so last year. By the internal conversion loan the Commonwealth is saving upwards of £6,000,000 annually. A further saving is being effected by the New South Wales conversion loan recently floated in London, and we may expect greater reductions of the interest bill as the result of subsequent conversions of our war debt of over £100,000,000. dicates that the current financial year will end with a substantial surplus. Indeed the Government invites such an assumption by granting relief in respect of taxation to certain sections. Revenue is being deliberately surrendered by the removal of primage duties and the sales tax from many of the requirements of the primary producers. I would not object to a remission of taxation that gave relief in all parts of the world are agreed that to all sections of the community; but I protest against the class nature of the tax relief which is evidenced in the budget proposals of the Government. The fact that, in addition to remitting certain taxation, the Government has promised that no additional imposts will be made supports my contention that the financial outlook to-day is better than, it was last year when curin the world until some country takes tailments of expenditure appeared to be necessary. Apart from humane considerations, the Government is unwise in followobjective of the Government of the ing a policy which, the evidence shows, has made the economic position of the country worse that it was twelve months ago. A further curtailment of the spending power of the community, by cuts directed against the poorest sections, must adopts a monetary policy directed towards make tbe position even worse. Premiers plan has not produced the results that were anticipated from it. I emphatically protest against the present budget because it is entirely devoid of any proposal to cope with the paramount problem of unemployment. So far from providing relief, the Mr Ilollowaij. Government's policy is likely to aggravate the evil. It must be obvious that when the spending power of the pensioners was reduced last year by £2,000,000, that sum of money was immediately lost to the business people. Increased depression and business stagnation must result from any further curtailment of spending power. I pointed out, twelve months ago, that the Government's policy of economizing at the expense of the people, who must necessarily spend every penny they receive, was economically unsound as well as inhuman. If a pensioner saves a portion of the small amount he receives, that fact alone reduces his pension, and in time disqualifies him from this form of relief. Every reduction of the spending power All the evidence inof the people must be reflected in increased business depression. That is proved by the experience of other countries. The signatories to the Macmillan report and the leading economists of the world are unanimous in advising a policy the very opposite to that which was initiated by the Scullin Ministry, and is being continued in exaggerated form by the present Government. Experts to restore normal conditions, price levels must be raised. That can be brought about only in the way suggested by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin). Ministerial members have retorted that no one country can influence international price levels. It may be true that one country cannot determine international price levels, but no change can take place the initiative. The Macmillan report emphasizes that, and suggests that the United Kingdom should be to increase internal price levels, which in turn will affect international price levels. If all countries wait on each other no commencement will be made; but if Australia The raising and stabilizing internal price levels it will encourage and help other portions of the British Empire to follow that lead. There is a consensus of opinion amongst experts that unemployment, with the resultant decrease in the demand for goods and services, has become the cause, not the result or an effect of the continuance of economic instability and world-wide depression. Senator Givanni Angelli, the President of the Italian Senate, in a press interview in April last, declared that the only thing to do to relieve the present world depression was to increase the purchasing power of the people by putting tbe army of unemployed to work, by reducing the hours of labour in industry and by increasing wages. he contended it would he possible more quickly to equalize consumption and production. He added that the views which he expressed had the endorsement of the Italian Government, which had already approached the League of Nations Labour Office with a view to securing international agreement among manufacturing countries along these lines so as to bring relief, to a suffering world. This loss of demand for goods and services in all countries is paralysing the potential consuming power of many millions of people. Angelli, in the interview to which I have referred, stated that the Young plan for dealing with war debts and reparations imposed an annual burden on Germany of 145,000,000 dollars, and he estimated that the loss in consuming power for goods and services among the allied countries alone, due to widespread unemployment, was six times greater than the loss they would sustain by waiving the reparation payments demanded from Germany. which were not more than three months old, issued by the International Labour Office at Geneva, he showed that in the western countries there were no fewer than 25,000,000 people unemployed, and in ex-allied, countries alone no less than 12,000,000. pendants, we find that, due to unemployment in the countries mentioned, the actual number of persons deprived of their usual power of consumption is four times the actual number of unemployed. This great loss of consuming power in the demand for goods and services of all kinds is the real crux of the world's economic trouble. In a discussion on the British budget take had been made in accepting the in the House of Commons recently, all advice of experts^the same group of the speeches made and the views of all financial emissaries that visited Australia economic experts quoted, indicated that ancl urged deflation-in the attempted the only way to solve the problem was to re-create the demand for goods and services, and that the only way in which this could be done was to increase price levels. The speeches delivered by some honourable members supporting the Government would suggest that thenviews on this subject are somewhat elementary, if not childish. Apparently, some of them are under the impression that to raise the price levels.it is only In this way necessary to urge all retail shopkeepers to re-ticket the prices of their goods, or in some other artificial way raise prices. This, of course, is nonsense, and instead of making matters better would make them worse. The only practical way to increase price levels is to get our unemployed people to work again, and provide them with purchasing power in the form of wages, which, being put into circulation, will create a demand for goods and services and stimulate private enterprise to put in motion again the wheels of industry. Because of this stimulus, the Senator tendency would be for prices to rise and soon we should reach that much-to-be desired condition when confidence is once again restored. Confidence is purely an economic term. Between business men it means the existence of a belief that it will be possible to do business with some degree of stability. In an investor it means a belief that an investment will give a reasonable return on his outlay. Everybody who has given thought to the subject knows that no oue will buy, and Quoting the latest figures, no one will speculate or invest in times when prices are falling because of the fear that a competitor may, 24 hours later, be able to buy or invest on more advantageous terms. Thus, with falling prices, we have slumps in business leading to general depression and, in many cases, If we add their deinsolvency, all because of the lack of confidence on the part of business people or investors. Deflation brings in its train unemployment, due to lack of confidence. Until the Macmillan commission submitted its report, public opinion as to the causes of falling prices had not been crystallized. Those members of the House of Commons who took part in the debate following the presentation of the report, admitted that a misrehabilitation of tlie finances of Austria and other European countries. Mr of a managed currency. On that subject Winston Churchill admitted quite frankly that he had accepted their advice, but asked to bo pardoned for the mistake which he then made. Mr Churchill is a man of great will power. Once he makes a statement he is not likely to recant, but in this matter he does admit his error. I have reprints from the British House of Commons debates, of speeches made on this subject by Sir Robert Home, Mr Amery, and Mr Winston Churchill. Churchill referring particularly to the gold standard? part in the debate in the House of Commons, following the introduction of the budget by Mr Neville Chamberlain. There are two or three points to which I should like to refer in this reprint, because they are points which we discuss with each other and about which we have differences of opinion. They are embraced in the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition which I am supporting. That amendment suggests that the only way to relieve unemployment in Australia is to make some definite attack upon the problem, and to raise prices. The Leader of the Opposition has said that the only way to raise prices is to give private enterprise and business generally an impetus from some government fund. The Commonwealth Bank is the only financial institution that is able to extend the interests of the economic position of credit to the Federal Government to enable it to establish a wage fund. It is suggested that to obviate the fear which some people still have of the danger of inflation, the currency should be scientifically managed so that price levels may be stabilized, the amount of business circulating in the community to be the guide as to when prices have risen sufficiently. member say that the money from the wage fund should be expended only on reproductive works? I may differ from the honourable member as to what works may be termed "" reproductive"". Sir Robert Home, when addressing himself to the budget in the British House of Commons in April last, referred to the fear that existed in respect he saidThese questions of currency always seem very remote from the ordinary life of the people, who have not had to consider them for more than 100 years, and yet the question of currency sits down at every table that is spread with a nieal in every cottage or castle throughout the country. It very intimately concerns us in the House of Commons. Aristotle said long ago that money exists not by nature but by law. It is the law that gives it efficacy. 'It is the law which says what is legal tender. It is in this House that we make the law. We were the people who decided about our return to the gold standard. Wc were the people who gave authority for the amount of fiduciary issue that should be put out by the Bank of England. We arc the people who, only a few weeks ago, gave authority for £15,000,000 to be added to the fiduciary note issue. In fact we, God help us, are the people who have to manage this currency, under the advice and through the means of the Chancellor of the Exchequer using as his instrument the Bank of England. That is exactly the same argument that we are using in this House. We say that this Parliament on the advice of its Treasurer and through the agency of the Commonwealth Bank should manage the currency. That does not mean that we sliould interfere with the details of the administration of the bank's business. What we suggest is that this Parliament, on the advice of the Treasurer, the same as the House of Commons acts on the advice of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, should from time to time determine the monetary policy in the country. We should only be following the advice of the most expert commission that has ever dealt with this question of monetary policy. It has been said that never before has such a capable body of men been brought together to deal with this problem. The action that is now being taken by the House of Commons and other parliaments throughout the world is based on the report of the Macmillan Commission; but we in Australia are still flying in the face of that report. In reply to a question on the monetary policy which I put to the Treasurer of the previous Government, he said that there was then sitting in England the Macmillan Commission, which had almost completed its work, and that we should await its report before taking any action",55,Bonds And Other Investments

199,Mr Holloway,"Yes, but of coursein regard to our monetary policy. That report has been in existence for about eighteen months, yet we are still flying in the face of it . There is nothing have even gone to the extent of saying in the amendment or the policy proposed by its mover which counters any recommendation contained iu the Macmillan report, or tbe policy that is now advocated by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. Sir Otto Niemeyer endeavoured to-put the financial house of Austriai n order. Every country that has adopted the policy he has laid down has become bankrupt. As a matter of fact the whole world is strewn to-day with nations that have been financially wrecked as a result of putting iuto operation the deflation policy which was advocated by the financial group which sat at Brusselsi n 1921, and sent its emissaries all over the world to induce governments, against their w i ll in most instances, to f a l l into line with the resolutions carried at that conference. They urged every government and every business activity to curtail its business operations and not to invest or recapitalize any of its previous year's turnover, but to cut expenditure to the bone. I am not criticizing those gentlemen for what they did, because they may have been honest in their efforts to restore financial stability. I am basing my argument on the results of the operation of that policy. They called upon every business group to return to pre-war prices, wages and standards. idea was to stop inflation and place the economic world once again upon its feet. Cassel was present, not as a delegate, but as an adviser. He listened to the debates and he heard the resolutions framed there. Copies of those resolutions were sent abroad, but very few came to Australia. I was fortunate enough to obtain one and took it with me to a meeting of the Employers Federation, in Melbourne, which dealt with the problem of Mr Ashworth, the president of that body. As a result of giving effect to the policy of Sir Otto Niemeyer, four or five of the Central European States and others are absolutely insolvent. Instead of applying to those insolvent States names such as we have frequently applied to some of our own States, and such as, it has been suggested, England applies to Australia, which England never has-som e English financiers that Australia cannot be expected to pay its overseas debts unless interest rates are reduced-the League of Nations, England, and other prosperous nations are now collecting money through the central office at Genevaf o r the purpose of placing the insolvent nations on their feet. That may be because from a humanepoint of view it is right to do so, but it is also largely a matter of business. These countries are customers whose business is of value. The nations of Europe are helping one another, and talking of wiping the slate clean of reparations and debts, because they know that trade is necessary to national stability, each nation depending upon the custom of the other. They have come to the conclusion that the policy of deflation is wrong, and that the nations have lost their sense of proportion. It may be that inflation took place too rapidly, but it cannot be denied that the people were better off in those days. There was then .greater wealth, very little unemployment, and no doles or systems of sustenance. ""What was started then has brought ruin to the nations of the world. Professor Gustav Cassel at Brussels spoke somewhat as follows:If you onco stiu-t-tlie policy of deflation, it will roll like a snowball, gaining strength ancl power, and you will find it difficult to stop. Their Maybe it will bring to you more trouble, more ruin and desolation than any possibility of good that will accrue. A t that conference Professor His advice was not taken. Instead, circulars were sent to public and semi-public bodies, as well as to big companies, urging them to curtail their business operations. Professor Cassel saw the danger. H is advice was on these linesIf you determine to start this policy of deflation, I advise you to do it cautiously. There are millions of returned soldiers who are not yet absorbed in industry. If you ask unemployment. I left it with them to accept lower standards too rapidly, you may bring about a revolution. If you intend to do it, you must first create the necessary atmosphere. All over the world it has been accepted that the necessary atmosphere is the existence of large armies of unemployed, so that for every job, whether in a factory or an office, there shall be five or six applicants; that there shall be such keen competition for work that the workers will be prepared to accept a lower standard. rend the plan over a number of years, if they brought it into operation at all. Since then whenever Professor Cassel has written or lectured he has been consistent in the advice he has given. Dealing w it h the advice of experts, Mr Winston Churchill saidIt is accepted almost without dispute in England that the prime cause of all our troubles is the attempt to pay these huge sterile war debts and reparations across high tariff boundaries that will not receive goods,, and thus payment has to be made in gold. The small and limited supplies of gold, which have hitherto served as the foot-rule or measure in our affairs, have been purloined and misappropriated for a purpose for which they are wholly unequal, for liquidating these gigantic debts. This it is whicli has led in three short years, very suddenly and very swiftly, upon America stopping relending to the unhealthy engorgement of gold by particular countries, which have a special benefit from reparations and war debts. It is this whicli has led to the consequent cornering of gold and the consequent sterilization of large portions of gold and the consequent enhancement in the price of gold, and to the automatic and simultaneous diminution in the value of everything else which is made to-day or can be made by our efforts to-morrow. There is the root evil. Out of all the tangles and clouds of argument we can see quite plainly this knotty point projecting: the artificial enhancement in the price of gold and the consequent fall in the price of everything that is measured by it. Gold is a measure. It is a measure between the efforts of one country and another, between man and man, between class and class, between the past and present; but I regret and grieve that it is a measure whicli has played the traitor. Poor devil; it may not be its fault; but that is the fact. When I was moved by many arguments and forces in 1925 to return to the gold standard, 1 was assured by the highest expertsand our experts arc men of great ability and of indisputable integrity and sincerity-that we were anchoring ourselves to reality and stability; and I accepted their advice. I take for myself and my colleagues of other days whatever degree of blame and burden there may be for having accepted their advice. But what has happened? We have had no reality, no stability. The price of gold has risen since then by more than 70 per cent. That is as if a 12-iuch foot-rule had suddenly been stretched to 19 or 20 inches; us if the pound, avoirdupois, had suddenly become 23 or 24 ounces instead of-how much is it?-10. what this has meant to everybody who has been compelled to execute their contracts upon this irrationally enhanced scale. Look at the gross unfairness of such a distortion to all producers of new wealth, and to all that labour Mr Holloway. and science and enterprise can give us. Look at the enormously increased volume of commodities which have to be created in order to He advised them to expay off the same mortgage debt or loan. Minor fluctuations ""might well be ignored, but I say quite seriously that this monetary convulsion has now reached a pitch where I am persuaded that the producers of new wealth will not tolerate indefinitely so hideous an oppression. It is plain that by cornering the gold, and increasing its value 1.9 times, the value of everything else is automatically brought down. ' It is only by raising the price of everything else that we can get the ship of State back again on an even keel. In that case, Australia would benefit almost immediately, for instead of our primary producers having to send away, say, three bags of wheat for every £.1 of debt, only one or perhaps two bags would be required. That would be more on the basis of the value of wheat at the time the money was borrowed. I support the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. -Scullin). I protest against the budget because of its brutal slashing of social services. The reduction of the wages of public servants w ill make matters worse instead of better. The Government, in adopting this policy, is flying in the face of the teachings of the last few years. It is obvious that the budgetary position is infinitely more favorable this year than it was last year. I do not say that Australia has "" turned the coi ner "", economically speaking; but the Government is in a vastly improved position to meet its commitments and to avoid deficits. The saving due to the Hoover moratorium is sure to be repeated next year, and, in my opinion, the war debt payments w ill never be insisted upon. The Government, in addition to promising that there shall be no further taxation, has already relieved one section of the community of several hundred thousands of pounds?'in taxes, while it has also reduced customs duties and thereby derived itself of revenue. Such action is entirely contradictory to the reduction of invalid and old-age pensions, the wages and salaries Look at of public servants, and the maternity allowance. This is distinctly class biased legislation. The worse feature of the Government's proposals w it h regard to the invalid find old-age pensions is that they pauperize the pensioners, although the originators of the scheme were parGeneral) [11.17] -The honourable memticularly careful to avoid placing any ber must recognize that a difficulty might such stigma upon them.

As numbers of farmers may not be aware of the alteration, and may be taken advantage of, we would like you to ventilate this matter by means of a question in the House. Will the Government take such action as may be necessary to prevent unscrupulous firms from exploiting the man on the land by charging him with the whole or auy part of the primage on machinery that has not been subject to the tax?

The position of the Governor of the Bank of England is not analogous to that of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank.

The main objectives were to ensure ample supplies of crude oil , and to establish a refinery to deal with them and such indigenous supplies as may be found in Australia or in the territories; also to provide motor spirit at reasonable prices especially for industrial needs and primary producers. 2. The company has been successfully established, and is marketing its products in four States, In Juno. 1024, when the eompany commenced distributing, the wholesale price of second-grade petrol was 2s. per gallon, on which there was a duty of Id. per gallon.

The managing director of the company has furnished the following reply:It is the policy of this company to put down its own bulk depots at places where there issufficient trade to justif y this expenditure and to deliver its products in the surrounding neighbourhoods by bulk lorries. A t thoso points where a bulk depot cannot be justified, our policy is to appoint an agent, who holds supplies of our products, mostly in barrels, and distributes thorn to local customers. So far as possible the company avoids the iu certain cases it has been obliged to appoint re-sellers through its inability to appoint any other suitable agent. Mount Gambier is a case in point where a re-seller acts as our agent. It is, however, quite incorrect to say that he has the sole rights of the sale of our products at that point, since otlier garages can buy from him at the same price as they could purchase direct from the company, which price will admit of their re-yelling to the public through their pumps ut a reasonable margin of profit.
