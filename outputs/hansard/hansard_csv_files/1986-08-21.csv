In that regard, this Bill reflects We have all heard of the background to the this Government's sorry record of one step forTreaty.

The first point is handles our alliance and the promotion of that that many Australians have experienced a nualliance publicly. clear explosion. Literally thousands of AustraI am sure I will be attacked publicly for what lians were prisoners of war in Japan in 1945. I have said in opposition to this Bill.

I I want to put to bed one commonly held belief commend the honourable member for Phillip that the nuclear explosions in Japan ended the (Ms McHugh), who has been a colleague of war. All historians of any standing refute the mine for some years. I believe nobody in our theory that it was the atomic bombs that ended nation is more genuine and sincere in opposition the war. Is there a greater authority than Winto nuclear weapons, nuclear arms and uranium ston Churchill whom I could quote for the Opsales, and I thought her contribution today was position. He said that it was really not the masterly. I have been disappointed with some of dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan that the contributions made by my colleagues in the ended the war.

The American able members of Parliament and all Australians bombing of the Japanese cities forced the end of must have a commitment to disarmament, to the war. It was about to happen. The atomic reduction in the arms race and to the prevention explosions may have precipitated it by only a of war and hostilities. I believe that if a nuclear day or two. The British historian Liddell Hart war starts it could result in the destruction of said: the human race on this planet. The atomic bombs in August merely confirmed what I believe in the theory of nuclear winter. I most of the Japanese people, except for military fanatics, had already come to realise. believe that, once one side starts using nuclear weapons, the human race as we know it can be So the notion that atomic bombs win wars or in danger of extinr.tion and nowhere in the globe stop wars is in my opinion wrong.
