79,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [8.45],"Ithe House. But although the procedure itself is formal there is, on this occasion, tion marked the first occasion on which a a number of reasons why a deeper significance than is customary attaches to this particular opening of a session of the Parliament. Pirst and foremost, it marks the first opening of a Parliament of the Commonwealth since the Coronation of their Majesties the King and Queen. We in this House are fully conscious of the important position occupied by the Crown as a constitutional link between the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. But the Royal Family represents far more than any such legal link. We have this day welcomed the opportunity to subscribe to the resolution of loyalty and congratulation to the King and Queen. There is a deep and abiding affection in the hearts of the people of the Empire for the Royal Family. We in this country have particularly happy recollections of the visit by the King and Queen to Australia ten years ago, and for this House that visit has a special significance inasmuch as it was on the 9th May, 1927, that the King and Queen as the Duke and Duchess of York, formally opened these buildings in which the Parliament of the Commonwealth meets. It necessarily follows, from the imporwhich has been opened during the life of tant position occupied in our Constitution by the Crown, that the King's chief personal representative in the Commonwealth should be one who can give general satisfaction by the manner in which he carries out the duties which devolve upon him. Here again there is a significance in this session, inasmuch as it is the first which has been opened by Lord Gowrie as Governor General. And yet, in the short time that His Excellency has occupied that position, he has travelled far and wide throughout the Commonwealtb and has visited many places which had never previously been visited by a personal representative of the King. He has been most active in his efforts to come in contact with people in all parts of the Commonwealth and in all walks of life. In July of last year I had the privilege of attending a dinner given in honour of His Excellency at the township of Tully in' the north of Queensland. Honourable members from Queensland will know that this town is about 1,000 miles north of Brisbane, and this funcGovernor-General had visited that town. That illustration is typical of the activity which the Governor General has displayed in making himself familiar with all parts of the Commonwealth and getting to know its people. Both the Crown and the Commonwealth are equally fortunate in that His Majesty is so ably represented in the person of Lord Gowrie. There is one other reason which makes this session noteworthy. It is rare for a formal opening of the Parliament to take place except in the case of the beginning of a new session following upon a general election. Because of the assistance which private members gain from the outline of the business of the session, which is contained in the Governor General's Speech, they have often pressed governments to adopt the practice of having a new session each year. The Government is to be congratulated upon having adopted that suggestion on the present occasion, and as a private member, I express the appreciation which we feel for its action. This is the third session of Parliament the Government of which the right honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons) has been the Prime Minister. It is, therefore, appropriate that we should note the highly auspicious circumstances which surround the opening that took place to-day. If we consider the condition of Australia when the Lyons Government first came into office, we have every reason to tender our warmest congratulations to the right honourable gentleman and his colleagues for the striking degree of recovery that has taken place during their term of office. Reference has been made by His Excellency to the fact that unemployment registrations, which stood at 30"" per cent, at the end of the second quarter of 1932, have been steadily and progressively reduced, the figures at the end of the first quarter of this year showing a decline to 9.9 per cent. This: figure compares more than favourably with that which prevailed before the depression. ployees, which stood at 450,000 in the pre-depression year 192S-29, reached 490,000 in 1935-36. building Commonwealth-alway s a reliable barometer of business conditions-showe d an increase from £4,335,000 in the depression year 1930-31 to £21,972,000 in 1935-36. If any further evidence were required of the extent to which recovery has taken place, it is to be found in the addresses recently made to the Arbitration Court by Messrs. Mundy and Clary, who, together with Mr Crofts, appeared as advocates for the Australian Council of Trade Unionsi n its application for an increased basic wage. Mr Mundy, in opening his address,^ pointed out that his object would be to show that industry could afford to pay a higher basic wage at the present time. He hoped, he said, to show from statistical returns that prices for primary products are highly satisfactory, that manufacturing has never been so prosperous, and that unemployment has fallen to what might be regarded as a normal position. He was supported by Mr Clary who, to quote his own words, saidIn tlie period 1933 and 1934 we noticed an emergence from tlie crisis with a stabilization of prices. During this period confidence returned and the tendency was towards an extension of capital facilities with values rising and unemployment decreasing. Tlie period from 1935 to 1937 shows practically the most spectacular recovery ever witnessed. Normality was regained. There was a genera) adjustment to stabilized conditions, with greatly increased capital expansion. There was a balancing of government budgets and repeal of financial emergency legislation with respect to wages and social services. There was a general rise in the prices of exportable commodities and a gradual regression of unemployment to predepression figures. It was noticeable also that wholesale and retail prices were rising. "" The case of the trade unions "", Mr Clary submitted "" was essentially that of a comparison of present with past conditions."" It is scarcely credible that so great a change should have taken place in so short a time. I have addressed myself to this matter at some length because we are apt to forget, too readily, I think, the desperate plight in which this country found itself such a short time ago, and because I Mr Holt. maintain that the courageous and firm The number of factory emaction which the Lyons Government has taken during its tenure of office is responsible in no small measure for much of the The value of improvement that has taken place. operations throughout the Increased security in our economic structure is revealed by an examination of our overseas trade position. The figures relating to our overseas trade for 1D36-37 w ill show our exports somewhat higher in Australian currency and imports £30,000,000 lower than in 1928-29. Investigation has substantially confirmed the view that the expansion of home production has replaced imports to about the value of our pre-depression overseas borrowing. It is to be regretted, that no such highly satisfactory state of affairs appear in regard to our external affairs generally. Recent international developments have clearly shown that those"" countries which comprise the British Empire can no longer place any reliance upon the League of Nations as a guarantee of security. A League of Nations which is merely a league of some nations, not all of which can be relied upon to shoulder the obligations of membership, provides merely a condition of collective insecurity, which may be more f r u it f u l of conflict than otherwise. We have noticed w i th interest recent statements by official spokesmen of the British Government, which indicate a definite l i m it to the commitments which that government is prepared to undertake. Remote as we are in Australia, we have trembled far too long at a pistol shot in the Balkans, or have started nervously when a fist has been banged in anger on a table in Danzig. However much we may regret the temporary abandonment of the League of Nations as our guarantee against aggression-and our abandonment relates only to that aspect of its work-w e welcome the greater security which recent developments suggest. These developments have brought home to us the necessity-if we are to remain secure-for the closest cooperation between our own League of Nations-the British Commonwealth of Nations. We await with interest the information which the Prime Minister w ill give to the House upon his return, regarding the discusin 1911, to 215,000, costing £10,052,497, in sions that have taken place at the 1937.

When we look at the subject matters hut also of the functioning of the British referred to in His Excellency's Speech system. I feel confident that that action we find that, although this session reflects the wholehearted appreciation of is to be a short one, there is a considerable the Government of the principle of volume of business to be dealt with. ISTo national insurance, and am convinced fewer than 23 subjects are referred to in that if a practicable scheme can be the course of that Speech. This is not evolved, it w ill be placed before the House the time for, nor, in any event, would at the earliest opportunity. the time available permit, more than the most cursory examination of all of them, or of any one of them in detail. Opportunity will be afforded later for more detailed examination of them and fuller debate. I do, however, wish to make some short observations in regard to the references to what may be termed the Government's industrial programme, that is to the subjects of national insurance, a 40-Hour working week, and youth employment. For very many years we have had in mechanical invention has reduced the Australia a system of social services, amount of manual labour required. 1 which has been operated in part by find myself in complete accord with the the Commonwealth and in part by the policy of the Government as declared States. It has been built up piecemeal, in these instructions, and would add in haphazard fashion, and has imposed only one further observation. an increasing burden upon government the basic wage ease to which I have budgets. Let us take, for example, the already referred, Chief Judge Dethridge system of invalid and old-age pensions. stated that the court proposed to award We find that in 1911, which was the first the highest wage that industry could bear. year in which pensions for invalidity and It follows that any action which has the old-age were paid, the cost to the Comeffect of iiicreasing production costs-and monwealth was £2,054,360. In that year no reasonable person can deny that a there were 7,451 invalid pensioners, whose reduction of hours would have that effect. pensions cost £185,960. number of invalid pensioners had grown the wage which industry can afford to to 84,000, and the cost to £3,927,503.

All members of the House and appreciation ' of the have never disguised my wholehearted reports of experts who have had experience not only of Australian conditions The attitude of the Government towards the institution of a 40-hour working week is clearly outlined in the instructions which it sent to its delegate at Geneva-instruction s that have since been made public. We are all agreed that a reduction of the hours of labour should logically follow the general development and use of labour-saving machinery. To a large extent, this reduction has taken place, particularly in those cases in which In By 1937, the -mus t affect, hy a consequent reduction, had for the improvement of working conthe living wage-and thereby of the living standard-is much to be preferred to a reduction of working hours. On the subject of youth employment, I have wearied honourable members more than enough during the last twelve months; but because of the importance which it possesses in my mind, I make no apology for introducing it again. The Government is to be congratulated upon having initiated a conference with the States to deal with the problem, and upon having promised them financial assistance for this purpose. The Youth Employment Committee of the Government of Victoria has already expressed the opinion that the amount made available by the Commonwealth Government is totally inadequate to implement a satisfactory programme for the relief of youth unemployment. If that be the case, I urge this Government to suggest to Victoria-if it has not already done so-that the Government of that State might assist in financing the programme recommended by its own committee, by a contribution from the proceeds of its own unemployment relief tax. In the depth of the depression when unemployment registrations for that State were 27.7 per cent., the collections from this tax amounted, for the year 1931-1932, to £1,650,492. mated amount to be collected for 1936-1937, when unemployment registrations for the State have dropped to 9.5 per cent., is £1,854,000. If that tax is to be devoted to the proper purposes for which it is collected, no worthier object could be found than the youth unemployment relief programme planned by the committee which that Government itself has appointed. References in the Governor General's Speech to increased activity in the Department of Health will be welcomed. I this year we are paying pensions to 84,000 persons; evidence could be readily supplied to show that the general standard of health in this country is unnecessarily low-. Increased grants for 'health research liave recently been made, but, having regard to the fact that die estimated cost of invalid pensions alone this year falls ilfr. Holt. little short of £4,000,000., it is clear that a much greater expenditure on preventive measures would still be a justifiable economy. The Advisory Council on Nutrition has shown that there are at the present time, dietary deficiencies, which must be remedied if the general standard is to improve, and has, in fact, recommended that there should be a daily supply of milk for school children and, where practicable, for children of pre-school age. It is to be hoped that the Government has in view some action along these lines. It is regretted that the speech contains no reference to the question of the establishment of an Australian domicil in matrimonial matters. This House, in the previous session, passed a resolution expressing approval of its introduction, and while the question has admitted difficulties, it had been hoped that the Government would now be in a position to submit to the House a proposal having this object in view. I wish to make only one further observation. We are meeting to-day as a democratically elected body, responsible to the people of this country, and gathered to give, by legislative action, expression to the common will. At a time when the democracies of the world have been subjected to the threat of dictatorThe estiship and many of them have been submerged by the action of the dictator, our meeting here under these conditions must give us cause for reflection. We have -long believed that man has certain fundamental and inalienable rights, of which the most important are life, liberty and opportunity for the pursuit of happiness. To secure these rights, governments have been instituted, deriving their authority from the will and consent of the governed. No dictatorship in the world to-day-whethe r it be a dictatorship of the Right or a dictatorship of the Lefthave already mentioned that has been able, or in most cases, even willinvalid ing, to guarantee these rights. As the other present custodians of democracy in this Commonwealth, we bear a responsibility, the responsibility that none of our actions here in this Parliament shall in any way discredit orundermine that democratic system, which we. in this House, 'however much our political views may differ, are determined to maintain. I desire to express my appreciation of the privilege and opportunity afforded me to second the motion so ably moved by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt). In doing so, I desire to associate myself with the remarks that he has made concerning the visit of His Excellency the Governor General to Queensland almost immediately after his appointment. The people of Queensland appreciated the opportunity to come into contact with the new Governor General, and I am sure that I express the desire and sentiment of every resident of Queensland when I say that they wish him a long, successful, happy and peaceful tenure -of the high and honourable office which he holds. I am also mindful of the honour conferred upon me in entering this honourable Parliament, particularly as successor to the late honourable Sir Littleton Groom. The late Sir Littleton Groom devoted more than 30 years of his life to the public service of his country. His life was a record of achievewere lost definitely as the result of ment that is impossible for any Australian to follow, particularly in the circumstances and conditions now appertaining. I am consoled, however, by the fact that he has set an objective for Australians-that they should accept their civic responsibilities and always aim at rendering service to their fellow countrymen. The electorate which I have the honour to represent is typical of those rural electorates of Australia that have contributed so much to the economic welfare and national well-being of Australia. Unfortunately, however, it is also one which is subject to adverse seasonal conditions, particularly those brought about by droughts. At present the biggest portion of that -electorate is in the throes of a drought that has too long continued, to the detriment of every person in the district. It has lasted for two or three years. That brings me to urge upon this Parliament the necessity expeditiously to grapple with the all important national matter of drought alleviation. In the course of my remarks I think I shall impress on honourable members that the drought history of Queensland presents an appalling stale of affairs, and emphasizes the necessity to urge the immediate establishment of an institution to combat drought. I am not in favour of adding to the governmental institutions that already exist; but I 'think that the scope of existing institutions could be extended to deal with this matter, to collate information, and to bring about some effort at least to alleviate, if not to remove, the disastrous effects of drought. Wrapped up with drought is the necessity for water conservation, fodder conservation, the prevention of erosion, and the elimination of that disastrous pest, the cattle tick. It will come as a surprise to honourable members to learn that in 1935, the finish of the general drought in Queensland, 3,227,000 sheep were lost through drought. From 1931, which was also a drought year, to 1935, 8,690,000 sheep were lost through drought, and from 1926 to 1929, the three years the occasion of a previous visitation, 8,170,000 sheep were lost. In nine years, 16,850,000 sheep-approximatel y 2,000,000 a yeardrought. That is a reduction of the national wealth-producing capacity of the Commonwealth of Australia, and, particularly, of the State of Queensland. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has done an enormous service to the primary industries. By its research and activities it has improved the quality of produce, increased capacity in many instances, and improved herds, flocks, and stock. But it could do more. There is no definite policy to combat the disastrous droughts. The activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research have been extended to the elimination of the blowfly, liver fluke, and dingoes; but it should be realized that, out of every 1,000 sheep lost in Queensland, 715 are lost through drought causes. Yet nothing has been done about it. The minute books of local governing authorities, pastoralists' associations and other bodies are full of resolutions affirming the need for the destruction of various pests, but nothing is said about the elimination of the disastrous effects of drought, the visitations .of which are far too -frequent. When governments are putting forward every effort to increase",20,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
80,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs) [9.9].,"the productive capacity of tbe country, attention should be directed to the necesthe grasshoppers. Therefore, governsity for stabilizing a definite market that mental attention should be directed to the could be maintained and increased if the destructive effects of drought could be overcome. The figures which I have cited supply an answer to the question as to why Queensland has fewer sheep today than in 1891, and why it has 1,000,000 fewer cattle than in 1895. We talk of land development schemes and of opening up the country, but the best way to achieve progress in this direction cantheir part in connection with any restocknot be in doubt. When we consider defence policies we should remember the importance of foodstuffs and raw materials. We must also bear in mind the fact that, whilst the Commonwealth Government has made favorable trade treaties with other countries, and arrangements for the disposal of our meat, we are not in a position to take full advantage of the available markets, because we have not solved the root problem of overcoming the effects of drought. The two staple industries of Queensland-thos e which provide wool and meat-ar e of the greatest value to the nation generally. This is not entirely a State problem, but is one that must be grappled with on a national basis. The geographical boundaries of a State, which fire necessary for the sake of convenience and for the maintenance of sovereign rights, should not make it incumbent upon that State to carry the bulk of the burden due to a nil tional calamity such as drought. State boundaries and such artificially created limitations should be forgotten when the welfare of Australia, as a whole, has to be considered. In my opinion, we have too long delayed in approaching this problem, which we should have endeavoured to solve on a national basis. When we are considering methods by which loan money could be judicially expended on reproductive works, we should turn our attention to the improvement and expansion of the great wool and meat industries, for every pound spent in that directhem the final outcome may depend-the tion would return its value tenfold. In dealing with the problem of droughts, we should remember their aftermath. In Queensland, the pastoralists in the west and north-west now, fortunately, have plenty of grass, but they Mr Fadden. are short of stock, and the feed is left for desirability of giving financial assistance for the re-stocking of holdings. I submit that the provisions of the Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) Act should be extended in order to grant relief expeditiously in that direction. The State authorities should co-operate in re-stocking operations, and the Commonwealth Government should see that the States play ing or rehabilitation schemes undertaken. The Commonwealth Government should insist upon the State governments reducing rents until such time as the impoverished landholders are in a position to rehabilitate themselves. Freights also should be reduced, and the 'incidence of income taxation should be altered to enable losses to be carried forward until they are recouped by profits. .The provision in the present legislation for the carrying forward of losses is inadequate. That matter, of course, is one for the State authorities. But, the Commonwealth Government, in putting forward proposals for co-operative action, has an opportunity to insist upon the observance of certain conditions. The Governor General's Speech gave great prominence to the subject of defence. The world is experiencing troublous times. The nations are at the cross-roads. One road leads to a much needed peace, whilst the traversing of the other must bring about mistrust, intolerance, misunderstanding, selfishness and war. Which road will be taken depends upon the mental outlook and wisdom of the public men of the world. In this matter every member of this Parliament has a grave responsibility. We should make a united effort to bring about friendly international consultation for the purpose of solving the grave problems that confront us to-day.

The vulnerability of these supaltering these conditions as expeditiously plies is an important, matter which should as possible. While the responsibility rests be considered. I commend to honourable upon the States much can be done by the members the following remarks by the National Government. A fact that has Australian Advisory Council of Science always impressed me is that, whilst State and Industry, in Bulletin No. 6, 1918:governments spend enormous sums of money on hospitals and curative services, comparatively little attention is paid to sources tlie need for preventing disease. State especiallyforof her governments should insist that loan able for use in internal combustion engines, money shall not be frittered away on is a matter to which attention has been unnecessary buildings at the expense of directed for a number of years. Since the outdisease-prevention and the general health break of the community. National defence involves the important problem of oil supplies. The Governor General's Speech to-day touched upon the production of oil from shale, and outlined what the Government is doing in this regard. In 1933,1 published a brochure as the result of some two years' investigation of power alcohol as a fuel, which I believe can be successfully produced in Australia. That brochure contains a summary of information received from every country in the world interested in the production of power alcohol. power alcohol. According to. information which I have collated, power alcohol can If this be so, it is a dustry, it is all-important from a defence The matter should be entirely dependent upon imported liquid Tlie dependence of Australia on outside supply of mineral oils, and those lighter oils which are suitof war, Australia has been able to secure a supply of mineral oils sufficient to meet her needs, but in view of the increasing shortage of shipping and the ISrge demands for petrol in connection with the war, Australia may at any time be thrown on her own resources for supplies of liquid fuel. As opposed to her deficiencies in supply of natural oil fuels, Australia has the advantage over many other countries in the necessary elements for the production of raw materials which can be used as a source for the manufacture of alcohol. The world is using the existing supply of mineral oils faster than the rate of production. Some medium for the convenient application of the sun's energy other than the mineral oil deposits, which take geological ages to form, will soon become necessary. Such a medium exists in those crops which contain sugar and starch, from which alcohol can bo produced by human agency in annual rotation from inexhaustible supplies. development of the cultivation of crops for the manufacture of power alcohol is likely to play an important or even essential part in a complete agricultural policy. It may lead to the cultivation of areas unsuited for other crops, and may assist in the diversification of the agricultural industry. Certain crops grown as raw material for the manufacture of alcohol could be used as stock feed. As regards the engine problem, investigations in America, Germany, and France, and experiments carried out in Melbourne by the committee, show conclusively that alcohol can be used with entire success in internal combustion engines. Again, in 1927, the council had this to sayI t is well known that Australia is practiaspect of the industry should not be overcally entirely dependent on outside sources for her supply of liquid fuels, and particularly The manufacture of power alcohol on for those fuels suitable for use in the internal a large scale in Australia on proper sciencombustion engine. This position is very unsatisfactory even in times of peace, but in times of emergency it becomes positively dangerous. Moreover, in view of the probable world-wide impending shortage of petroleum, a considerable amount of discussion has already taken place in the United States, from which country a very large proportion of Australian liquid fuel is derived, as to the desirability of prohibiting exports altogether. That is a very pertinent reason why this matter should be thoroughly investigated. I know that some investigation has been carried out from a purely economic viewpoint, and that, solely because of the comparison with the price of imported petrol, locally-produced power alcohol has been condemned as uneconomic. If we are going to view the production of power alcohol on that basis, we have to remember that nothing we produce or manufacture in Australia could survive a price comparison with equivalent imported goods. The consideration of the matter must go deeper and further than mere economics; the defence aspect is all-important, and we must remember our experiences during and after the war, when the Australian consumers of petrol were called upon to pay as much as 3s. 6d. a gallon for petrol which, even at that price, was rationed. no control over the prices charged by the petrol companies, and, therefore, it is not reasonable to condemn locally-produced power alcohol merely upon a price comparison with imported liquid fuel. Mr Fadden. Power alcohol has also many other uses. TheA leading American technologist has stated that in the United States of America 35,000,000 gallons is used annually for the cooling of automobile radiators, 15,000,000 gallons in the cosmetic industry, 1,500,000 gallons in the manufacture of felt hats, and 2,000,000 gallons in the tobacco industry, to say nothing of many other industries which require it. In fact power alcohol may be regarded as the basic raw material of the great chemical industry. It is also largely used for war purposes. A barrel of power alcohol, we are told, is required for every 12-inch gun. This important looked in considering its economic merits. tific lines would mean the development of large areas of vacant lands, and the employment of a considerable number of people. We have the sunshine, the land, and idle population, and last, but not least, Ave have a valuable home market for the disposal of the product. In connection with defence, I urge the Government to consider carefully the position of Queensland, which, because of its vastness and sparse population, is extremely vulnerable. The importance of efficient control of our northern waters has been emphasized during the last year or two because of the presence of foreign sampans engaged in illicit fishing off the Australian coast. The people of Queensland are mindful of the proximity of a practically certain race, and of their distance from the thickly populated centres of the Commonwealth. I therefore urge the Government in the development of its defence proposals to give careful consideration to the position of my State. Another matter of vital concern to every honourable member of this House and the people generally is the unemployed youth of this country. I venture the opinion that if this problem be not scientifically and fearlessly tackled We have and solved the next decade will reveal grave evils, because wastage of humanity will have repercussions just as serious as wastage in industry. The situation must be faced, and adequate provision made for this lost legion of young men between the ages of 18 and 25 years who have never ""worked, and for whom, under existing conditions, the outlook is particuforced in Australia to establish our prilarly disheartening. The inevitable consequence of continued inaction will be the destruction of their morale. Since they are the legacy of the depression, responsibility rests upon every member of this House to see that no effort is spared to provide them with useful employment as soon as possible. I am pleased to know the Government has taken steps to ensure the co-operation of the various State Governments in this matter, and I cannot help thinking it significant that the only States which have not submitted reports to the Commonwealth as to the grave position of their unemployed youths are those which are governed by Labour. member is becoming personal. become personal in this discussion. My one desire is to impress upon all members the urgent need for supporting every action which the Government may take to provide employment for these young men and thus ensure their future security. I hope that the Government will deal expeditiously with this matter. As its contribution to the solution of this problem, the Commonwealth Government is setting aside £200,000 for expenditure by the States and although it may be difficult to attach conditions governing the manner in which the money shall be expended, it is nevertheless desirable that the Government should adopt reasonable safeguards against its expenditure for purposes other than those for which it is intended. It should not, for example, be used for the provision of buildings in capital cities or for other purposes for which a State government may get undue credit. [Leave to continue given.""} Linked up with the problem of our rendered yeoman service to the people at unemployed youth is the proposal for the large. The bulk of our national wealth introduction of a 40-hour working week. has its source in our primary producing 'This Government has instructed its industries, and these must, therefore, be delegates at Geneva to support a 40-hour safeguarded in every possible way. week under certain conditions, with, I hope, safeguards. desires a shorter working week, which, tice requires that economic regulation on the face of it, seems to offer a shall begin at the primary point of prosolution to many of our problems, we. duction. There seems to me to be someshall have to think long and deeply before thing contradictory and radically wrong we adopt it as our policy. ""We have been mary industries under unusual conditions, and in seeking to stabilize these industries the Government has had to make many adjustments. It has had to hold the balance as evenly as possible between the people engaged in primary industries who have had to face adverse world conditions, particularly through the period of depression, and those engaged in secondary industries who have had their conditions fixed without particular regard to world affairs. In order to make conditions as equitable as possible for all sections of the community the Government has had to provide subsidies, make financial grants of other kinds, and adopt administrative measures in keeping with conditions existing from time to time. The granting of a 40-hour week without safeguards would have serious repercus« sions on our primary industries. Foi this reason I would support a 40-hour week in respect of our export industries only if it were on an international basis. Unless complete safeguards are provided for those engaged in our primary industries they will find themselves in a worse condition than they are in to-day, and every one knows that the ""White Australia policy implies conditions that make a continuation of the existing circumstances very difficult. If production costs are increased in consequence of the adoption of a shorter working week, and our primary producers are obliged to compete with people, some of whom work 80 hours a week, disaster will overtake us. For these reasons, I contend that we can adopt a 40-hour week for our export industries only if our international competitors adopt it.

The problems associated with the issues I have just outlined must be faced frankly in the interests of Australia. If we desire to maintain our social services, raise the standard of living, and increase the extent and value of our home market to the advantage, not only of the primary producers, but also other sections of the community, we must revise our Constitution It must be apparent to everybody that the Constitution which was drafted 30 years ago has, in many respects, outJived its usefulness, and should be thoroughly overhauled and brought into conformity with the changes in our social system which have been forced upon us. The Constitution should also be considered in relation to the present-day practices of other nations. We need to review both the interstate and international aspects of the Constitution. I suggest that a convention should be held similar to those which preceded the drafting of the Constitution nearly 40 years ago. Such a convention would be wellqualified to recommend desirable constitutional changes which, I believe, would commend themselves to the people. We have been told in Queensland for many years, particularly by the leaders of Labour governments, among whom were Mr T. J. Ryan, Mr E. G. Theodore the test of government. so, every unbiassed and reasonable person will agree that the LyonsPage Government has been most successful. In consequence of its wise and careful administration it has achieved results which have been beneficial to the whole Commonwealth. When regard is paid to the legacy that the Lyons-Page Government inherited and also to the highly satisfactory condition of the country to-day, it must be admitted that a good job of work has been done. I shall not claim -that this Government has not made mistakes. It is constituted of human beings and is therefore fallible. But I submit to that if the achievements Ur. Fadden. scale against its alleged mistakes the beam will tip heavily in its favour. Australia was on the verge of bankruptcy when the Government assumed office, but in consequence of its carefully directed policy our industries have revived and the Commonwealth has recovered to a greater extent than has any other country. The Government has, in fact, done better work than any previous government in this country, or, for that matter, elsewhere. Its records shine out like a lighthouse in the night. The Government has reduced taxation in every direction and in particular it has lifted much of that particularly onerous burden which the sales tax, introduced by the previous administration, laid upon the shoulders of the working class. . It has also balanced its budget and eliminated the deficits which faced it when it assumed office. It has restored confidence and, as a natural corollary, revived industry. Unemployment has been decreased from more than 30 per cent, to 9.9 per cent. The public debt has been reduced by £7,000,000, although, during the period the Government has been in office, the aggregate State debts have increased by £75,000,000. Employment in factories has been extended until to-day record figures are reported. Benefits under our social service legislation have heen increased all round, and the scales liave been evenly held as between all sections of the community. I am sure that all reasonable and unbiassed persons will thank their lucky stars that they have lived under this Administration, and If this be were not obliged to suffer the Scullin Labour Administration for any lengthy period. The vision I have makes rae strive to attain to a ju'osperous nation embracing all branches of human activity in due proportion, and providing a varied and balanced economy rising from the firm foundation of prosperous primary ""and secondary industries. adjourned.

Honourable members will recall that during the last sittings of Parliament the suggestion was made that the Library should be opened on the evenings of nonsitting days and at week-ends in order to meet the convenience of those members who remain in Canberra. I am pleased to be able to announce that the Library Committee, with the assistance of the Government, has been able to meet this request. The arrangements are that on each non-sitting day the Library will be kept open until 9.30 p.m., except between C p.m. and 7.30 p.m., when the officer on duty will be away for his evening meal. It will be also open on Saturdays until 9.30 p.m., except for the periods 12 noon to 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. I should explain that these hours are purely provisional, and that the committee is anxious to meet members' convenience as far as possible. would welcome, therefore, any representations on the part of honourable members in order that the best roster of liours to meet their requirements may finally be decided upon. I should like also to emphasize that the present arrangements have been approved entirely as an experiment, and that their continuance will, depend upon the extent to which it is found that honourable members make use of these additional facilities. I bring under the notice of the House the necessity for the Government to handle the dispute in the Sydney General Post Office in a more conciliatory manner than is being adopted at present. I have felt for some time that the members of this chamber suffer a good deal of inconvenience owing to the fact that the Postmaster-General is a member of the Senate; we are thus deprived of the opportunity to obtain direct from him information on matters of importance. Jiecause of that, in presenting this case on behalf of a large number of employees Office in Sydney, I . cannot obtain a ""LlBKABY DlSPUTE IN definite and direct reply from the Postmaster-General. This is unsatisfactory to honourable members generally, who haye since the present Lyons Government took oflice. Honourable members are probably aware that a new system of supervision or spying has been adopted in connection with the sorters of mail matter in the Sydney General Post Office. The system now in operation is quite foreign to the employees in this department, many of whom have given many years of service in the work on which they are engaged-in some instances over a period of 27 years. No one can deny that these men have given efficient and loyal service to the department. Within the last few months a change has taken place, and the supervisor who had charge of the mail sorting department has been transferred to a higher position in the Commonwealth Public Service; I understand he has been appointed a Commissioner in the Public Service. This officer was able to carry on the service without any interruption or friction, and with the absolute co-operation and loyalty I of every man in the department. It now appears that his successor has introduced a system of spying in an endeavour "" to make his marble good "" at the expense of men who have performed their duties loyally and to the complete satisfaction of his predecessors. I cannot speak too harshly of the person responsible for the conditions which now exist, and I am sorry that the Deputy Director of Post and Telegraphs in New South Wales appears to have adopted a very unfair .attitude in handling the situation, and has declined to act in a conciliatory manner. The officers of the union consider that the matter should be approached in a conciliatory spirit, and that their representatives should be entitled to more consideration than they have received up to the present. This change of supervision, it is claimed by the department, has been introduced by the department on the plea that it is necessary to check the mail matter in order to eliminate unnecessary handling, to reduce the number of articles sorted at final divisions, to obviate delays, and to ascertain in the General Post whether instructions are sufficient and",30,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

87,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [9.57].,"satisfactory for the. guidance of the staff. This argument has been advanced by the Deputy Director, who is simply taking advice from the officer who has just been transferred to this department. The Deputy Director in Sydney is undoubtedly a capable man, but he has only recently taken over his position and therefore in regard to postal matters he must be guided by his officers. entirely on the information supplied to him. The union's reply to the director's contention is that the mail sorterswho incidentally, claim to have greater knowledge than the men doing the checking-have daily work is a constant and that, in their opinion, there is some undisclosed purpose behind the supervision. As some of the men have been 27 years on the job, it seems ridiculous that men without the same previous experience in this particular class of work should introduce a system of spying which leads to discontent and friction. Eurthermore, the employees say that regular tests are conducted almost every day in the year. They claim that a general sorting takes place first in what is called the primary stage, then the letters are drafted into sections according to postal divisions. They then go through another process of sorting and are tied into bundles, to which is attached a slip indicating the number of the sorter. If there is any inaccuracy it is competent for the supervisor to check where the fault lies. The sorting was satisfactorily conducted before the present system of spying and checking was introduced by the new supervisor. I cannot bring this, matter directly under the notice of the Postmaster-General, because he does not occupy a seat in this chamber. According to press reports the Deputy Director in Sydney visited Canberra to-day for the purpose of conferring with the Postmaster-General, but he bas left again before we have had an opportunity to be informed of the contents of his report. In order to prove that there is some justification for the arguments advanced by the employees, I shall read a portion of a letter sent to the secretary of the Postal Workers Union by the Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs in which he Mr Beasley: admits that a new system has been introduced. He statedYou represented to me a few weeks ago that a practice had been introduced without my knowledge of submitting a number of officers to a test of sorting each day. Following upon your representations inquiries were made, and I reached the conclusion that the practice in question was open to reasonable objection, and instructed that it should not proceed. I make that point in order to show that His decisions are based the present supervisor of the Mails Branch has introduced new methods. The Deputy Director admits as much in his letter, and admits further that the new practices may reasonably be objected to. In the particular instance regular tests, that their referred to the complaint was so wellcheck, founded that he took steps to have the matter adjusted. that? the l l t h of June of this year. If any officer of the Postal Department attempts to have placed before this Parliament or the Minister a statement to the effect that no changes have been made and that the present system of supervision has always been in operation, the letter of the Deputy Director of Postal Services from which I have just read will constitute the most effective reply. The men very naturally object to these pinpricking methods. They are prepared to give good service, but if they are driven to it they have it in their power, by adhering strictly to the regulations, to delay the delivery of mails by two hours in the city, by five hours in the nearer country districts, and by as much as 24 hours in the more distant country districts. very popular move. merely be observing the regulations which have been laid down for their guidance. If they followed those regulations and scrutinized each letter carefully in order to read the address, and to see whether it was properly stamped, and if they weighed each article in order to see whether the full postage had been prepaid, the delivery of mails would, in some instances, be possibly delayed by 24 hours.

The Deputy Director's own letter, however, proves that that is not so. All the men ask is that proper steps b»j taken to hear their complaint.
