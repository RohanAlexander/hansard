Firstly, this is clearly a case of the state government shifting responsibility for normal school building programs to the federal government, an action specifically prohibited under BER guidelines. The requirement to have fire safety tanks at schools is a state regulation in areas that are deemed to be a high fire risk. It is a regulation of the state government, which they would be required to meet anyhow in the due course of events. Noone can make any kind of case that the water tanks will improve educational outcomes, and this is a blatant case of the state government rorting the program. One would think that the minister would be sensitive to criticism of this type, but even though I have raised this issue before with her and in this House concerning the nearby Snowtown Area School, which has a similar problem, I have not received any response. If we leave aside the issue of the requirement of the school to have fire tanks-and I must say, as a long term volunteer firefighter with some experience, that I am somewhat surprised that neither Snowtown nor Port Broughton schools are considered high risk, considering the fairly flat and open country in which they sit-the second grievance I have with the fire safety tanks is the price. In line with so many of the totally out of control building sites under the school halls program, the cost to the taxpayer has virtually no connection to the normal price of the goods. The Port Broughton Area School has been told that it will have to pay $90,000 for two 37,000-litre tanks. I have approached a supplier and found that I could source the tanks for $8,900-less than 10 per cent of the price. Even allowing for limited plumbing-that is, a pipe to a fire hydrant-and installation costs, this 1,000 per cent mark-up is preposterous. How the Deputy Prime Minister can come into parliament, day after day, claiming that the school halls project is a resounding success when incidents like this are brought to her attention is completely beyond comprehension. She should be absolutely ashamed, and I have said on a number of occasions that the faults in this program will continue to be exposed for years to come. As appalling as all of this is, we should also consider the sheer idiocy of a policy which means that these tanks will not be even used to collect rainwater. You would think that if the government were serious about trying to reduce our reliance on the Murray then we would be planning to catch the run-off from the new buildings. But unfortunately it is just another example of the confusion surrounding this government and we watch it beginning to implode.

171,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (4.08 Pm),"It gives me no pleasure to have to report more BER disCapricornia Electorate: Drug and Alcohol Abuse Related Crime Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (4.12 pm)-TodayI want to bring to the attention of the House the shocking state of drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence and child abuse that is increasingly becoming part of our daily lives in Central Queensland. I use the word ‘shocking’, but readers of our local newspaper, the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin, would not be shocked, because reports of these incidents are routine and merely reflect what people see in the community or even in their families. Today’s Morning Bulletin reports a woman being threatened with a knife while she waited at a bus stop on a major suburban street. The offender in this case is apparently a child aged between 12 and 14 years of age. Also in today’s paper are reports that police are looking for two children who stole glue from our local Supercheap Auto shop. The knife attack that I referred to occurred not far from where an 82-year-old woman was bashed, raped and murdered by a teenager while in her back garden at 8 am on Australia Day earlier this year. To add to some of these reports, we also have examples of a drug-affected 16-year-old stealing cars and injuring others while the car was in his control, and a gang of children smashing into a hotel and stealing alcohol. These are just some examples, and they are summed up in statistics that show that in Queensland the average rate of offending for juveniles is 4.8 per cent. In contrast to that, in Rockhampton the rate for juvenile offending is 10.7 per cent, more than double the state average. This has been the case for about three years now. Woorabinda, which is near Rockhampton, is even higher than that at 13.3 per cent. Coupled with this, there has been a sharp rise in the number of reports to our child safety authorities indicating concern for the welfare of children. Those child safety concern reports have leapt from 3,700 in 2005-06 to 9,000 in 200809. I could go on all day quoting statistics and incidences from local news reports, but enough is enough. One Indigenous woman of my acquaintance has five sons aged between 24 and 38. All are addicted to drugs, alcohol and gambling. She and her husband now care for most of their grandchildren. In an echo of the experience in the Northern Territory, this woman begs us: ‘You must stop giving our sons money.’ I agree with her. I have therefore today written to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and to the Prime Minister asking that the minister act under the welfare reforms that were passed yesterday to introduce income management to Central Queensland and help save our children who are calling out for us to protect them. Petition: Homelessness the Standing Committee on Petitions, in which the petitioners draw to the attention of the House that Australia has more than 100,000 homeless people, with more than 15,000 sleeping on the streets every night. They ask the House that the government immediately provide emergency assistance to the more than 15,000 Aussie street-sleeping homeless by providing them with specially made for the homeless emergency backpack swags with built-in mattresses, which would provide all-weather protection and show the homeless that Australians do care. MAIN COMMITTEE",116,Constituency Statements
172,Mr Andrews (Menzies) (4.15 Pm),"I present a petition, which has been approved byThe chairman and founder of the organisation Swags for Homeless came to see me recently in my electorate office and demonstrated this protection, which is a tent with a built-in mattress which can be rolled up and easily carried about. This is something which would be very useful because one of the difficulties for homeless people is not only not having accommodation in the first place but the temporary nature of the shelter which they are forced in many cases, tragically, to change from night to night. This at least, while not solving the homeless problem in itself, would be some assistance for those who, regrettably, are homeless. We know that the government has announced a $10 million boost for the Personal Helpers and Mentors Program, which was an initiative of the previous government from April 2006 by the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the then Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing, Mr Pyne. That program has had strong cross-party endorsement. The 2006 census recorded 105,000 people on the streets; however, there is no concise indicator for homelessness in Australia. The number of homeless may in fact be many more than that figure. Service providers like St Vincent de Paul, Youth off the Streets and others have noted a ‘significant increase’ in the number of homeless since the promise was made in 2008 by the current Prime Minister to halve homelessness by 2020. On the government’s own projections, this additional funding is only $33 per homeless person per year-not even enough to buy a homeless person a roof over their head for one night, much less for a year. We have millions upon millions of dollars being expended, indeed wasted, on government advertising. If that amount could be spent on the most unfortunatethose who are homeless through, in many cases, no fault of their own-then it would be a much better use of that money. It is for that reason that I am proud and delighted to be able to present this petition on behalf of Swags for Homeless and to ask the government and the relevant minister to take note of this and to do something of practical assistance to these people. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of undersigned draws to the attention of the House: Australia has 100,000+ homeless with 15,000+ sleeping on the street everynight. The Rudd Gov. currently has no policy to assist the 15,000+ sleeping outside tonight. We therefore ask the House to: I want the Government to immediately provide emergency assistance to 15,000+ Aussie Street Sleeping Homeless by providing them with specially made for the homeless Emergency Backpack Swags (with built-in mattress) providing all weather protection and showing Homeless that Aussies do care. from 700 citizens Petition received. Holt Electorate: Cranbourne Information and Support Service retary for Trade) (4.18 pm)-I rise today to pay tribute to the magnificent work of Leanne Petrides, staff and volunteers at the Cranbourne Information and Support Service. I have had a long standing admiration for Leanne and her volunteers and the selfless contribution she has made to the Cranbourne Information and Support Service and the local community, which spans the area from Hampton Park to Cranbourne. This service recently celebrated its 31st anniversary, and Leanne has been involved for 11½ of those 31 years. MAIN COMMITTEE",117,Constituency Statements
173,Mr Byrne (Holt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary SecMuch has been made of the Rudd government’s rapid and successful response to the global financial crisis, making us one of the developed countries to avoid a recession. As a government we have managed to keep hundreds of thousands of Australians in jobs who would otherwise be unemployed. However, notwithstanding that, I certainly recognise that many families in my electorate face financial and mortgage stress due to contraction of working hours, separation, divorce, accidents or retrenchments. Therefore, this great service needs increasing resources to deal with an increasing workload. I was very proud therefore to be able to announce an additional $11,000 in funding for the Cranbourne Information and Support Service, on top of its normal annual funding, which will be used to fund an additional day of service that targets low-income families. The service sees between 50 and 100 people per day, so it is an important investment in the local community. On a recent visit to the service, along with Leanne, I met social worker Doug Thompson, who provides front-line services to families in need, be it financial counselling or general support. The service provides an ear for many who feel others have stopped listening to them, and a shoulder to lean on for many who have had nowhere else to turn. Leanne and her staff provide a holistic rather than a bandaid model of service delivery. This holistic service helps with things like advice and negotiation with landlords, businesses, neighbours and others on debt service and procedural issues, runs share accommodation and volunteer registers, and helps many local people through its crisis support service and counselling service. Help is also provided on health and family issues and there is assistance with transport and a range of other issues. The service also has outreach services in the fields of legal advice and public tenancy support. The Casey North Community Information and Support Service, which provides similar services, will also benefit from additional government funding in the order of $56,000 to sole parent families. The government remains committed to working families and is acutely aware of the cost of living pressures affecting families across the nation. It was four years ago that I spoke on the Cranbourne Information and Support Service in this place and my determination to support their ongoing work has only strengthened since this time. I commend the work of the service and, on a personal level, I am grateful for the many mums, dads, sons and daughters whom Leanne and her team have helped over the years. As I said, you meet very few people in public life who immediately impress you, and Leanne is certainly one of them. I would just like to say in this House that she is one of those people who you would like to see nominated for an Order of Australia and, you never know, one day, given the commitment to her community, we might see her there. Petition: School Chaplaincy Program which the previous government introduced and which has proved to be one of its most successful and popular programs. The School Chaplaincy Program has been rolled out in hundreds of schools across Australia. The school chaplains in both denominational and nondenominational schools make an enormous difference in supporting young people, particularly those who are sometimes looking for someone who is not a family member or a close personal friend to talk to about issues that they find challenging in the 21st century. Whether the issue for young people is drugs, school work that they might be finding difficult or sexuality, the School Chaplaincy Program has been a very important safety valve in many, many schools. In fact, a survey was conducted of the schools with the School Chaplaincy Program and it found that 97 per cent of school principals with a school chaplain funded by the govMAIN COMMITTEE",118,Constituency Statements
174,Mr Pyne (Sturt) (4.21 Pm),"I rise today to comment on the School Chaplaincy Program,ernment believed that the program was both valuable and important to continue. The tragedy, of course, is that the current government is cancelling the School Chaplaincy Program from the end of 2011. The government has not committed to the program being a permanent fixture in high schools across Australia. That is a tragedy for young people and a tragedy for those school communities where a school chaplain has made an enormous difference. In my electorate, this has been particularly the case in the government high schools that previously did not have access to a school chaplain. In many of the denominational schools, of course, a school chaplain is part of the staff, but not in government schools. That is why it is so important that the School Chaplaincy Program continue. The coalition has committed to the school chaplaincy program well into the future. We have funded the School Chaplaincy Program to the tune of $165 million through to the end of the current forward estimates in 2014, and that will continue beyond 2014. The government, on the other hand, has cancelled the School Chaplaincy Program from the end of 2011. In fact, the Prime Minister was asked about this last night at an event held by the Australian Christian Lobby. He said: We’ll go through our own evaluation as to whether it’s worked everywhere well but I’m pretty confident this program is going to continue. On the other hand, the Leader of the Opposition said: The coalition has promised to continue funding for the School Chaplaincy Program through to the end of the current forward estimates period in 2014. So the difference between the two parties could not be more stark. In giving this short speech, I present the petitions signed by people from my own electorate and across South Australia in support of the School Chaplaincy Program, which has been through the correct processes. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the National School Chaplaincy Program, built on the excellent history of school chaplaincy in Australia, which was introduced by the former Coalition Government in 2007/08 with a commitment of $165 million for its first three years. It was endorsed by Prime Minister Rudd who said “they (Chaplains) actually are providing the glue which keeps school communities rolling”. The program offers pastoral care and spiritual guidance to all. Chaplains necessarily have religious beliefs which underpin their work. These beliefs are representative of the school communities the chaplains work in and they do not hinder chaplains from working with those of other beliefs or none. It operates in 1915 schools and enjoys strong support among principals, schools and in the community generally. The Rudd Government has extended funding for the program, at a reduced level, until the end of 2011, after which time there may be no more funding despite the program’s social benefits, sound administration and strong community support. Malcolm Turnbull has announced that if elected, the Coalition would continue funding the program in its current form, at its current level of $165 million over 3 years. We therefore ask that the Rudd Government continue funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program in its current form. from 52 citizens Petition received. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Forde Electorate: Mr Brian Harris Forde Electorate: Canterbury College Cantabile Choir ing of a well-known Eagleby character, Mr Brian Harris. Brian Harris was born on 29 September 1954 in the UK. He grew up in Elizabeth, South Australia, and among other things he went to school with Jimmy Barnes, whose success perplexed him as, ‘All Jimmy does is scream.’ Brian’s political activism dated back to running from local law enforcement agencies during the 1960s Adelaide anti-Vietnam-war protests. Brian was a carer for his brother John, who moved with him to Queensland around 12 years ago for a new life. He lived happily in Eagleby, immersed in the local people, events and goings-on. He was passionate about life, the labour movement, politics and the Eagleby Tavern. Unfortunately, at only 55 years of age, his heart gave way on the morning of 18 May at his home. A compassionate and empathetic man, he had spent a large part of the last six months of his life doing all he could to help a troubled teenager. For many of us who occasionally visit the Eagleby Tavern, it is hard to picture the place without Brian. Within one minute there, you would run into Brian and his brother John, both with a beer in hand, and within five minutes you knew every political issue and you had to talk about it. Within an hour, of course, you had solved most of those issues with Brian. I want to particularly thank Peter Milsop and Bob Clancy, who organised a wake for Brian. His ashes were sent back to South Australia. The wake was held one evening at the Eagleby Tavern, supported by the kindness of the local hotel manager and attended by many of Brian’s saddened friends. My sincere sympathy goes to Brian’s friends and family, particularly to his brother John. On a lighter note, as I have mentioned in this chamber on a number of occasions, I also attended another event, which included the Canterbury College Cantabile Choir, a choir established by Canterbury College. You may remember that on previous occasions in this HouseI talked about their success. They were the world champions, the gold medallists, in Austria a number of years ago. They are currently at the International Eisteddfod in Llangollen, Wales, and they are touring England, Scotland and Wales. Just prior to their leaving, I was privileged to be at an appearance where they performed for the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister’s words in response to the cantabile were: I was thinking as I listened to the choir this evening, what is it that causes people to pursue excellence. Because in that choice, Cantabile Choir, tonight we were privileged to see excellence on display. Very extraordinary choir. Absolutely extraordinary. In the position I hold I travel around this country quite a bit; I actually travel around the world quite a bit. But one of the great, great experiences you have is when you come back to local communities like this to see excellence on display. And that’s what we saw here this evening. A sincere thank you to the students and to Susan Gouchee for her work in making the cantabile choir an impressive display of excellence. MAIN COMMITTEE",119,Constituency Statements
175,Mr Raguse (Forde) (4.24 Pm),"I rise this afternoon to note with some sadness the passSchools Greek Community Ms O’DWYER (Higgins) (4.27 pm)-I rise to speak on the current threat to the diversity of foreign languages in our government schools. The Rudd government is currently considering reducing the number of foreign languages taught in public schools from 12 to eight under its proposed new national curriculum. The teaching of languages at school serves to further enrich students both linguistically and culturally. Learning a foreign language gives students an opportunity to learn about other countries and cultures on a deeper level. One of the languages that the government is considering abandoning is Modern Greek, a language of great significance to the Western and English-speaking world. Let me state for the record that this is something that I oppose. The teaching of Modern Greek in our schools currently gives students the opportunity to learn about one of the most important cultures in the world. By learning about the history and language of Greece, students are learning about the development of Western civilisation and the growth of important institutions that remain with us today. Today’s modern, enlightened democracies are the beneficiaries of Athenian political and philosophical thought, and our literary heritage has drawn upon the mythologies and great literary and historical works of Greek writers and philosophers. The English language has benefited from Greek influence, with approximately 12 per cent of English words having Greek origin. An understanding of the English language’s Greek roots can enhance our knowledge not only of Greek but of English as well. A history and language curriculum that is well founded in classical antiquity and foreign language is the best education revolution that our children can have. By learning the Greek language, students are accustomed to other cultures, innovations and traditions. Our national curriculum should also reflect important events in our nation’s history. Our friendship and cooperation with Greece and the Greek people were most fully displayed during World War II, when both Australia and Greece were brought into the war against the imperial ambitions of the Nazi regime in Germany. Next year will mark the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Crete, a landmark event during World War II that saw the end of the German military ascendancy. Australia and Greece have a strong history of friendship and cooperation, and the Greek diaspora is very much a part of my own electorate of Higgins. It gives me great pleasure and it is a great privilege to represent their concerns today. Solomon Electorate: Projects have been and are being delivered in my seat of Solomon. My first priority when elected was to end the blame game between the Northern Territory government and Canberra which for so many years had been at the expense of the good people of Solomon. I believe I have achieved this. The Allen Walker Cancer Care Centre, which I had the pleasure of opening with the Prime Minister, is now operating. For the first time Northern Territorian patients can receive their cancer treatment in Darwin. This was a $28.7 million Rudd government commitment. The Northern Territory is going to have its first ever medical school, an investment of $30 million into the Territory economy and an investment in our health and the Territory’s young people, who will now have an option of studying in the Territory thanks to the Rudd government.

176,Mr Hale (Solomon) (4.30 Pm),"I rise today to comment on the fantastic projects thatThe Tiger Brennan Drive extension is also progressing well. With the first stage already open, the northern bridge will be open shortly and the southern bridge at the end of next month. The project will be completed by November. It will see much-improved access from the rural area to the city as well as less congestion for people travelling to and from work from Palmerston to the CBD of Darwin. In addition there will be quicker and safer access for prime movers going to the East Arm Port facilities. This is a co-funded project, with the Rudd government committing $74 million and the Henderson Territory government $36 million. The new GP superclinic is nearing completion in Palmerston, which is great news for the residents in Palmerston and rural areas. The after-hours service started in the existing building in November 2008 and it has been very well supported. The new building will give even greater services to the community. Due to the global financial crisis which struck in October 2008, the Rudd government was forced to act quickly in order to stave off the effects of the global recession. History will tell us that it was the decisive action of the government to stimulate the economy which has played a major role in keeping the nation out of recession and maintaining low unemployment, historically low interest rates and record levels of growth that are the envy of the rest of the developed world. In Solomon everyone will benefit in some way, shape or form. It may have been through cash payments in December 2008 which were vital in keeping small businesses going and employment strong. It is estimated that well over 200,000 jobs have been created because of stimulus programs. Beyond the cash stimulus, the government embarked on the Building the Education Revolution. It was a $16 billion commitment to building infrastructure in schools across Australia. In Solomon we have received $74 million from the program, which includes 20 libraries, seven classrooms, 16 multipurpose halls, three early learning centres, four language centres and one science centre. I have treated this opportunity to represent my constituency as a privilege and I have worked hard to break the cycle of the blame game, to deliver on our promises and, importantly, to protect jobs and provide increased opportunities. (Time expired) Murray Electorate: Victorian Auditor-General’s Report Dr STONE (Murray) (4.33 pm)-In Victoria there is a report just released by the Auditor General that looks at the extraordinary malpractice that has gone on in relation to the NorthSouth Pipeline and the so-called Northern Victoria Irrigation Renewal Project work, which they say has been very poorly executed. Certain channels have not had appropriate quality management, tendering has not been done and, in many ways, there has not been value for money. I will give an example today of what it means to be on the ground as a farmer experiencing first hand this inefficiency and shambolic administration. I want to talk about Steve Dalitz, who is a dairy farmer near Numurkah. With regard to the Northern Victorian Irrigation Renewal Project, he agreed with his neighbour to close part of a spur and approximately three kilometres of backbone channel. The closure meant that Steve would have to relocate his wheel to another section of the main channel and approximately 50 acres of his property would have to be re-lasered and replanted. Of course seasons do not wait for anybody, so Steve made it a condition that this work had to be done within a certain time frame so he could regrow enough of his rye grass and so on to feed his cattle. He needed to get to work. Unfortunately, despite the agreement on when the MAIN COMMITTEE contract would be made available, it was not on time. It was a month late and he had to delay his work, re-lasering his property and regrowing until that time. That means that he will not now have in place the feed that he needed. His costs for feed are now approximately $300 a day and he will lose up to $40,000 by the end of this season. It gets worse. Having had that problem, costing him a lot of money for extra feed, he then found that Goulburn-Murray Water had not communicated with NVIRP, so along they came to this section of channel which was to be closed down, to carry out maintenance works on each of the wheels in his section. This is a section that is to be closed down. In addition, they also carried out maintenance earthworks along sections of the channel that are to be closed, and this work is still going on. He told the truck drivers delivering the material to the site that it was going to be a closed channel and that their maintenance work was going to be a waste of time. They said: ‘Too bad, mate. It is what we have been told to do.’ He is really annoyed because he has a badly leaking channel elsewhere on his properties east of Numurkah. No work has been carried out on this section of channel-a section which is not to be closed. But, where the channel is to be closed, maintenance is being carried out. This is because there is simply no communication between Goulburn-Murray Water-a state owned authority-and the Northern Victorian Irrigation Renewal Project, another state owned authority. This is shambolic. It is chaos. It is not value for money and it is literally destroying people’s lives. Learn. Earn. Legend! Ms HALL (Shortland) (4.36 pm)-The Learn. Earn. Legend! campaign has arranged for 100 eager Indigenous students from all over the nation to spend one week in Canberra, exploring and undertaking work experience in Parliament House and in government related jobs. In my office there are two current students of the Presbyterian Ladies College, Sydney: Maddison Deguara from year 10 and Gemma Lloyd from year 12. Maddison is from the Wiradjuri tribe and says: The Learn Earn Legend! program is a fantastic program and enables me, along with 99 other students, to experience life as a parliamentarian. I think this experience, along with the support of other organisations, will enable Indigenous students to encourage themselves, other individuals and their whole communities to get an education, stay at school and get the jobs they have always wished for. Gemma Lloyd, from the Dainggatti tribe, said: This opportunity has opened my eyes to the vast opportunities and experiences available for Indigenous students in Australia. The students this week are working alongside parliamentarians such as Mark Arbib and Minister Macklin. The ambassador for the Learn Earn Legend! program is Scott Prince, a firstgrade NRL player for the Titans. In addition to being a famous footballer, the fact that he is an Indigenous person himself enables the students to relate to him and helps them to aspire to live life and follow their dreams. On day 2, many of the students found themselves splattered across the second page of the Canberra Times. The media attention will hopefully bring awareness to programs available and motivate students to work in parliament or community services. Maddison and Gemma have undertaken tasks such as editing speeches, opening and filing mail and writing media MAIN COMMITTEE releases on paid parental leave. Roger Price and I hope to give these girls a most rewarding experience. Hopefully, they will one day be working alongside us or other parliamentarians. Partnerships with the Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations have enabled the Learn Earn Legend! program to blossom, and I hope this work experience will continue in future years. Minister Macklin said: It is great to have the next generation of Indigenous leaders here in Parliament House and across a range of Government departments. I can only agree with this statement, as it is their pathways that will determine our country’s future. I anticipate that Maddison and Gemma have gained a sustainable understanding of life in parliament, and it was more than my pleasure to house them for these two days. It is not every day that we have students working with us, but it was exciting to teach them a little bit about my job. The Learn Earn Legend! program also aims at closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students in the workplace. I believe that, with support and funding from various organisations, we can maintain a continuously growing Indigenous workforce. This speech was written by Maddison and Gemma. They are both outstanding young women with big futures. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded.

Jacob Daniel Moerland and Sapper Darren James Smith-not forgetting the explosives detection dog that was assigned to Sapper Smith, ‘Sapper’ Herbie. They were from the Brisbane based 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, 2CER, serving with the 1st Mentoring Task Force, working as part of the Australian dismounted patrol conducting operations in the Miribad Valley region of the Oruzgan Province. Sapper Darren Smith and Sapper Jacob Moerland were killed in action after their patrol was hit by an improvised explosive device on Monday, 7 June 2010 while conducting search operations for weapons caches and IEDs. These deaths brought to a total of 13 the operational deaths in Afghanistan, yet sadly, last night, we learnt of another three Aussie diggers killed in a helicopter accident, bringing the total to 16. The deaths of Sapper Smith and Sapper Moerland represent the first multiple combat fatalities for Australia since Vietnam. Sapper Smith and Sapper Moerland were repatriated to RAAF Base Amberley on Sunday, 13 June 2010.

In a quote from the Bible, John 15:13 says: ‘Greater love has no-one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.’ This they did, and for this their nation is eternally grateful and their mates also. I, along with Stuart Robert, the member for Fadden; Senator Steve Hutchins; and Nick Champion, the member for Wakefield, met Sapper Darren Smith and Herbie in Tarin Kowt on a couple of occasions during our visit to Tarin Kowt in April this year as part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. It was Sapper Smith who demonstrated the equipment that was being used and how they used the dogs in detecting the IEDs-the challenges, the excitement but also the anticipation about going out on patrol. In fact, he was about to embark to the forward operating base. He knew what he was doing. He was a very professional soldier. He was very proud of his work, and he knew that he and his mates were making a difference. We spoke at the time of family. We spoke of the challenges. I detected that not only was he a fiercely proud Australian but he was proud to be making a contribution to make the world a better and safer place, not just for his wife, Angela, or his 2½-year-old son, Mason, but indeed for all people-and the Afghani people, for whom he had a deep and abiding respect. By military standards it is said that to be a sapper you must be determined, resilient, patient, intelligent, physically and mentally tough, quick to learn and adapt, a team player, selfmotivated and professional. You should enjoy explosive ordnance disposal, demolitions, mine warfare, air and water operations, making and breaking, training indigenous soldiers and negotiating a multitude of challenges. You must be willing and able to lead a sapper team in areas of difficult terrain and visibility with limited knowledge of the enemy, even when you are so hungry and tired that most men would choose to give up. The most defining thing is that to be a sapper is to be a person of attitude. This job description described the Sapper Smith that I and my colleagues met. It was on 17 June, last Thursday, that I and colleagues attended the funeral of Sapper Moerland. Sapper Moerland was born in Cairns. This young man, with white-blond hair and big blue eyes, was 21 years of age. Sapper Moerland enlisted on 9 July 2007, completing his initial recruit training at 1st Recruit Training Battalion in October 2007. After completing his driver courses and a suite of combat engineer courses in May 2008, Sapper Moerland was posted to the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, Brisbane. 2CER was his first posting as a combat engineer. Whilst at 2CER, he went on to complete a number of courses, including the Protected Mobility Vehicle Driver course in April 2009 and the Combat First Aider in August 2009. His deployment as part of the 1st Mentoring Task Force was his first operation. He was deployed in January this year. As part of this tour, he has been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with International Campaign against Terrorism clasp and the Afghan Campaign Medal. It is an understatement to say that our sympathies go out to his mother, Sandra Moerland, and his father, Robert; his sisters, Laura and Bethany; and, in particular, to his fiancee, who he was to marry in November, Kezia Mulcahy. From his unit, recollections were put together, and these are the words of the unit, recollections of 8530756, Sapper Jacob ‘Snowy’ Moerland: Jacob ‘Snowy’ Moerland was the sort of person you’d picture in your mind when someone used the term ‘Sapper’. When I first met him, he was a relatively junior soldier in what was a young Squadron at MAIN COMMITTEE 2 CER; however, he soon became known as one of the Squadron characters. This was no mean feat amidst a strong field of similar personalities. Snowy was a reliable and proactive soldier, who would put considerable effort and focus into solving whatever challenges were thrown his way. Once given a task, he showed determination and imagination in getting a solution. He soon gained a reputation for being a ‘go-to’ sort of Sapper and was a valuable member of his Section, Troop and Squadron teams. Snowy was an enthusiastic Sapper, who loved soldiering. He was especially happy when performing his trade in the field, and looked forward to field deployments whenever they arose. No matter how wet, cold, muddy or hot it was, Snowy was in the thick of the task, cajoling or cursing as the situation befitted, but always giving his all. His Troop Commander once remarked that “If only we had a troop full of Snowy’s we would be unstoppable.” While not the most perfect and disciplined soldier by any standard, a commander could not ask for more commitment and better attitude towards doing the job that he loved than what we got from Snowy. He is a testament to the traditional ‘can-do’ fighting spirit of the Sapper and Aussie digger. For all this, Snowy knew how to have fun. He had an extroverted sense of humour and at times disturbing sense of fashion. One of the first recollections of people who knew him is this sense of fun. While he occasionally had to be reminded that there was work on, Snowy’s approach to his duty was infectiously enthusiastic, and he was often doing his best to raise or maintain his friend’s morale, especially during difficult tasks. This could include acts like camming up, to the point of camming his hair, and sniffing people to see how they’d react. One of Snowy’s trademarks was the aviator sunglasses he constantly wore with the huge grin on his face. When you picture Snowy, this image leaps to the forefront. Be it in DPCU or going out clothes, the sunnies and the grin were a constant. I believe Snowy matured quickly within the Squadron, and with time would have become a very capable junior commander. He struck a good balance between his sense of duty and sense of fun. He will be greatly missed by his Family, the Regiment and Army. At the funeral, there was a very moving eulogy delivered. One of the parts of the eulogy was delivered by his pastor, Lee Dallman. It was a story that Jacob had written in the eighth year of his education at Gayndah State High School. I want to read that into the Hansard because I think it actually describes this young man who gave so much for our nation. It goes like this. In year 8 as part of the Gayndah State High School English program all students have an assignment entitled ‘My life’. These are excerpts from his assignment about his life up until then. I was born at three minutes past two o’clock in the afternoon on the 14th of January 1989. I weighed 7 pounds 2 ounces. I was born in the Cairns hospital. When I came home from hospital I was given my first stuffed toy. It was a Koala. I named it Sunny Koala. When I was six months old I got another stuffed animal, which was a panda, so I named him Panda. I have still got them both. My kindergarten years were spent in Mackay. The first day I cried because Mum was going to leave me all by myself. ThenI fell asleep in an old tyre. I was going to sneak back to the car but they locked the gate and Mum saw me. After that I had fun there because we painted most of the time. Preschool was fun. All the kids were nice to me. I liked to play dress-ups. My favourite costume was the Superman costume. I also liked the Batman costume. My favourite activity was ‘show and tell’. The earliest birthday I can remember was when I was seven. I got the best rubber band gun from my Mum and Dad. I used to line my army men up and shoot them. For my birthday cake I got an ice cream MAIN COMMITTEE cake made by the ‘Great Australian Ice Creamery’. The cake was made like a battle field with little plastic soldiers. It had chocolate ice cream for a hill with the British flag on it. The earliest Christmas I can remember is when I was seven. I got lots of lollies and chocolates. We spent Christmas at my grandparents in Toowoomba. I got an Action Man Para Glider from my parents. I have lived in many places because my Dad works for a Bank. At present I have spent 18 months here in Gayndah and I am enjoying it very much. In primary school I liked many subjects. I had many friends in the first years at school. One of my friends was Brendan Burrows. I have played many sports in my life. They include Soccer, Tee-Ball and AFL. I played soccer for three seasons in Gladstone, with one of the best teams in the district. We were almost never beaten in a game. I have many interests, which include watching science fiction and fantasy films like Star Wars. I am also very interested in combat games such as Diabolo 2, Kingdoms, Age of Empires, and Heroes 3. I have built many models. All of them are airplanes, most of them from World War 2. My best friends in Gayndah are Luke Gatt, Mathew Grant, Dean Mathisen and Troy Sawdy. I like people who are honest, trustworthy and have a good personality for friends. Simon Walker is one of my best friends. I have known him since our mothers met each other at a baby clinic. I like holidays because I can see family and friends as well as get some time off school. The best holiday I have ever had was five months long. Dad decided that he wanted to take long service leave and we would explore the Northern Territory and if we had time we would visit parts of Western Australia. At the present I am 1 m 61 cm. I have short-cropped blond hair, fair skin, blue eyes and a medium build. I am in year eight and have a love of life that not even Elmo and Ernie off Sesame Street can match. I am pretty content with myself at the moment and I wouldn’t change a thing. The value of my life is priceless. I like my friends and even my family. Having to regret things in my opinion is just extra baggage you don’t need, so I live life now. The world is out there to be enjoyed and I for one, am going to have some fun. One of the letters that he wrote to his fiancée Kezia was part of the service. He wrote: TO MY ANGEL In the darkness you are my light, the shining brilliance that lights my path home. Into the loving arms that you have waiting for me, I will run and collapse into gently falling asleep. Your voice rings out calling my name A sound that would make angels cry because of the beauty that resonates from it. A voice I hope to wake up to every morning. To hear until the end of time. The love that I feel even now from you Warming my heart on these cold lonely nights Ever present, ever comforting, forever surrounding me The warmth one can only feel if loved completely and unconditionally. I hope one day to be able to fully express my love for you baby. You MAIN COMMITTEE are everything to me. My one and only, marrying you would be the greatest and most amazing thing for me. I would be yours forever in a fraction of a heartbeat. You’re the most beautiful, sexy, passionate, loving woman in the world and nothing would make me happier than to call you my wife. Love For Always My Angel. My heart and soul is yours forever and always. Your loving fiancée Jacob. That was written on the battlefield as he counted down the days until he came back. His pastor Lee Dallmain said: Jacob could get away with just about anything actually, because balanced with his cheekiness was his amazing capacity to love and to show compassion. I have never seen a teenage boy hug his mother so much. He was never ashamed to show his affection to his mum in public, and was fiercely protective of his sisters. He would stir them up of course, but they were his sisters. He was actually willing to give just about everyone a hug who he thought needed it. Many times I was on the end of one of his big bear hugs. We see the tenderness of his poem to Kezia. It was fitting that he served in Afghanistan the way he did. He wouldn’t have seen it as a chore. Instead he would have revelled in helping those less fortunate. He would have excelled in mentoring others. He had a remarkable ability to make one feel loved and appreciated, and as families and friends we grieve. We will miss him. He also said: Our Jacob certainly lived up to his promise. It is only fitting for Jacob to have the last word. And these are Jacob’s words: IfI could live anywhere in the world, it would be anywhere where there was friendship and loyalty to each other. Ultimately I would like to live where I could be at one with Mother Nature and God. His mother released a statement in which she said: Jacob wanted to join the army from an early age and he loved his mates and his job and I have never seen Jacob so happy as during his march out parade. Jacob died doing the job he loved and he went to Afghanistan not because he had too, but he thought it was a valuable job to help the people in Afghanistan. When I spoke to Mrs Moerland at the repatriation ceremony she said of Jacob’s death: ‘Please don’t let this death be in vain.’ Last Saturday I, along with colleagues, attended the funeral of Sapper Darren Smith. Sapper Darren Smith was a committed, passionate, unassuming soldier, father and husband. His priority in life was his family and, after that, the Army. Smithy was 26 years old. He was born on 16 November 1984 in Adelaide, South Australia. As a student he was a very successful sportsman, especially in soccer and cricket. Sapper Smith’s military career commenced as part of the Army Reserve when he enlisted on 29 November 2001. He completed recruit training at Kapooka in January 2002, serving as part of 3rd Field Squadron in South Australia. Sapper Smith went on to complete his combat engineer suite of courses in 2004 and he became part of the Australian Regular Army when he MAIN COMMITTEE was posted to 1 CER in October 2004. He completed a number of driver courses, up to heavy vehicle and armoured personnel carrier level. While at 1 CER he successfully completed his explosive detection dog handler course in December 2006. Sapper Smith was posted to 2 CER in January 2009. He demonstrated an aptitude for promotion and completed the junior leader course in November 2008. His deployment as a part of MTF1 was his first military operation. He deployed in March 2010 as a replacement dog handler to support relief out-of-country leave for other sappers in country. However, while in Afghanistan his deployment was extended due to the requirement for further dog handlers. As a part of his tour he has been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with the International Campaign against Terrorism clasp, the NATO Service Medal and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. Sapper Smith was married to Angela and he leaves behind a 2½-year-old son, Mason. Both Angela and Mason live in Brisbane, although Angela was originally from Adelaide. He met Angela while serving at 1 CER in Darwin. Many of his friends have commented that he was an excellent father and husband who was always there for his immediate family. Sapper Smith’s son, Mason, has a very close resemblance to his father. Sapper Smith was a quiet achiever, but an achiever nonetheless. He had a true love of and dedication to dog handling and during his career he looked after three explosive detection dogs, Mandy, Buster and Herbie. He loved each of them dearly and treated them with care. During 2007-8 the regiment and the corps very much admired his dedication and work with Herbie in order to assist his rehabilitation after the dog sustained an injury. Sapper Smith represented his country on Exercise Longlook in the United Kingdom and worked with British dog handlers. He also met with the Queen. He was instrumental in initiating buried hides training in the Army, including sketches and diagrams for consideration. Sapper Smith made his own leashes in order to be more efficient. He was always at work early in the day and late in the evening, caring for his explosive detection dog. He spent extra time with his dogs to ensure they were up to standard. When it looked like Herbie was going to be scrapped as a working dog, Sapper Smith spent even further time caring for him and working with the vets to ensure that that dog could meet certification requirements and eventually be allowed to deploy. Sapper Smith was an excellent soldier, a great father and a wonderful husband. He will be greatly missed by his family, his regiment and his Army. Our deepest and sincerest condolences go out to Angela Smith, 2½-year-old Mason and Darren’s father, Graeme, and indeed to all of their friends. During the eulogy Dallas Livermore read a poem that he wrote for Darren, entitled Heroes. It is a very moving poem. Angela Smith put out a statement which encapsulated Darren’s life: Tomorrow we’ll farewell Darren with a celebration of his life. Family, friends and Darren’s mates will gather at the Marist Brothers Chapel, and we’ll remember all the Darrens we knew-the devoted father of Mason, my loving husband, a son who made his family proud, a dedicated and very professional soldier, a great mate, and a larrikin with a wicked sense of humour and mischief, but a man who would do anything for anybody, no matter what the cost. Darren had an uncanny empathy with the dogs he cared for, taught and worked with. He had developed strong ideas on training, and also the welfare of the Explosive Detection Dogs. We often talked about MAIN COMMITTEE his ideas and what he would like to have seen done to improve training and conditions, and I’m going to work as best I can to make sure Darren’s dreams come true. The last 10 days have been a huge ordeal for all of us, and I’d like to offer some thanks on behalf of Mason, Darren’s dad Graeme, and the rest of our families. A big thank you to all our friends who have rallied around and supported us, to members of the community who felt Darren’s loss and our pain; to the Army family which Darren was so proud to be a member of, in particular his unit the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment. Thank you to the Defence Community Organisation, and also thank you to the Australian Defence Force media who worked hard to maintain our privacy and respect. Our future will now be very different, and it won’t be easy. During the funeral, Angela got up and read a poem that meant a lot to her. It was Stop All the Clocks, Cut Off the Telephone by WH Auden: Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone, Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone, Silence the pianos and with muffled drum Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come. Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead, Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves, Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves. He was my North, my South, my East and West, My working week and my Sunday rest, My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong. The stars are not wanted now: put out every one; Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood. For nothing now can ever come to any good. His father, Graeme, spoke at the eulogy about the early days with Darren when Darren made a decision to become a soldier. He said: He got in the back of the car and the first thing he said was, ‘That’s what I wanted to do.’ He said he was so proud to have served his country. Darren was a cheeky little kid, always happy. He was so much more than a son, he was my best friend. Most of all, though, he loved his wife and his son, he loved Angela with all his heart and Mason was this little ray of sunshine in his life. Darren, I loved you yesterday, today and tomorrow and I will love you forever. During part of the eulogy, Lieutenant Colonel John Carey, the commanding officer of 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, said that, while Sapper Moerland was killed instantly, it took 20 minutes for Darren to pass. In those 20 minutes with his mates who attended to him, he spoke of his love for his wife and his child. He wanted to make sure that they knew how much he loved them. I say to his son, Mason: in the years to come, just remember that your father put you first and he worshipped the ground you walked on. To him, you were his hero and you made life worthwhile. MAIN COMMITTEE As Thucydides, the Ancient Greek historian and author, said: The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding, go out to meet it. Both of these sappers have always put their mates first. They say of combat engineers they are always out front. It was John Stuart Mill, the English philosopher, who said: War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. Some people live an entire lifetime and wonder if they have ever made a difference in the world, but I can assure this House that people like Sapper Darren Smith and Sapper Jacob Moerland do not have that problem. for what can only be described as a beautiful and compassionate speech. Somehow, Madam Deputy Speaker Moylan, I feel certain that both Jacob and Darren would be proud of that one. I too attended the funeral service on Thursday, 17 June 2010 for Sapper Jacob Moerland at the Gayndah Town Hall in my electorate of Flynn in Central Queensland and afterwards at the RSL hall. It was a full, formal military funeral service. His family attending included his mother, Mrs Sandra Moerland; his father, Mr Robert Moerland; his sister, Ms Laura Moerland; his sister, Ms Bethany Moerland; and his fiancee, Ms Kezia Mulcahy. The attendees included, but were by no means limited to, the Hon. Kevin Rudd MP, Prime Minister of Australia; Senator the Hon. John Faulkner, the Minister for Defence; the Hon. Alan Griffin MP, Minister for Defence Personnel; the Hon. Tony Abbott MP, Leader of the Opposition; Senator the Hon. David Johnston, shadow minister for defence; the Hon. Bob Baldwin MP, shadow minister for defence science and personnel, representing the shadow minister for defence; the Hon. Anna Bligh MLA, Premier of Queensland; Dr Ian Watts, Secretary for Defence; Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston AC, AFC, Chief of the Defence Force; Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie AO, DSC, CSM, Chief of Army; Lieutenant General Frank Hickling AO, CSC, Colonel Commandant Royal Australian Engineers; Brigadier Paul McLachlan ADC, Commander 7 Brigade; Lieutenant Colonel John Carey, Commanding Officer 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment; the pallbearer party, members of 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment; representatives from current engineers units; members of the RSL; Mayor Joy Jensen and her councillors; the state member for Callide, Jeff Seeney; and members of the Gayndah community. Sapper Jacob Daniel Moerland was born on 14 January 1989 and died serving his country on 7 June 2010 in Afghanistan. Sapper Jacob Daniel Moerland enlisted on 9 July 2007 and completed his initial recruitment training at the 1st Recruit Training Battalion, 1RTB, in October 2007.

179,Mr Trevor (Flynn) (5.05 Pm),"May I begin by congratulating the member for PatersonSapper Moerland left behind his fiancee, Kezia, who lives in Brisbane. He was 21 years old and was born in Cairns, Queensland. I also quote the recollections on 10 June 2010 of Sapper Jacob ‘Snowy’ Moerland by Major MJ Prior, OC in 2008-09 of 7CE Squadron, 2CER: Jacob ‘Snowy’ Moerland was the sort of person you’d picture in your mind when someone used the term ‘Sapper’. When I first met him, he was a relatively junior soldier in what was a young Squadron at 2 CER; however, he soon became known as one of the Squadron characters.

I believe there is no greater honour than for a man or woman to serve his or her country and to wear the uniform of Australia. The commitment, the dedication and the ultimate sacrifice that Sapper Jacob Moerland paid with his life at just 21 will never be forgotten by his family, his community, his friends and Australia. TodayI pay tribute to Jacob, and my thoughts and prayers are and will remain with his family and friends. I also paid tribute to Darren today, and my thoughts and prayers are and will remain with his family and friends also. who were killed in action in Afghanistan on 7 June 2010. I rise this afternoon to extend my condolences to the families of Sapper Jacob Moerland and Sapper Darren Smith, who were tragically killed in Afghanistan earlier this month. Both men were based in Brisbane. I also rise to pay tribute to Sapper Herbie, Sapper Smith’s explosive-detection dog, who died beside his handler. As we are all aware, yesterday we received more tragic news of three more Australian soldiers killed and a further seven wounded when a Black Hawk helicopter was involved in a MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Condolences
180,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (5.14 Pm),"TodayI rise to pay tribute to three fine sappersnon-combat accident in Afghanistan. Media reports this morning tell us that the three soldiers lost yesterday were from the Holsworthy Army barracks in Sydney. They were elite soldiers, commandos of the Special Operations Task Group. I and my colleagues from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade had the privilege of visiting their unit only last year, and we had the opportunity to observe a training exercise and to meet and talk with some of the men. I have to say that they are some of Australia’s finest-professional, committed, passionate and well able to do their job. This past fortnight has been one of the most difficult for the Australian Defence Force. The deaths of five soldiers and the injury of seven others in the last fortnight only highlight the highly dangerous nature of the work being undertaken by our defence personnel in operations like those in Afghanistan. It must never be forgotten that these men serve our nation. Wearing the uniform of the Australian Army, the Royal Australian Navy or the Royal Australian Air Force is indeed a very high calling. These five men and Herbie have made the ultimate sacrifice. They died serving all of us. They wore the uniform of the Australian Army with pride, and we must be proud of their efforts and remember, reflect on and commemorate their service. RecentlyI visited the Australian War Memorial, where the ACT branch of the RSL held a wreath-laying ceremony before their annual congress. I was able to lay poppies in the Hall of Memory in remembrance of Sapper Moerland, Sapper Smith and Sapper Herbie. The memorial advised me that planning was already underway to have the names of Sappers Moerland and Smith listed on the roll of honour by 11 November, Remembrance Day. Their names will now be joined by the names of three more of Australia’s sons for Remembrance Day. As the shadow minister for veterans’ affairs, I felt, along with my community, the loss of these five men killed in the service of their nation. The loss of Australian soldiers is particularly felt by those Australian families who have lost loved ones during operations. This morning, the media carried the stories of the families of Private Gregory Sher and Private Benjamin Ranaudo, reminding the families of Sappers Smith and Moerland that there is support available to them at this time. A family that I particularly thought of when this news broke is that of Private Luke Worsley. Luke died in Afghanistan in November 2007 as a result of small arms fire in Oruzgan province. Luke’s parents live in my electorate. I recently touched base with Luke’s mum just a few days after the recent news of what had happened to the three sappers. Each time news like this is brought to public attention, it has an impact on them. So today I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to the families that today are feeling the pain as they remember. They are aware of and identify with the long journey ahead for the families that are just freshly beginning to feel sadness and grief. As yet, we do not know the identities of the man killed yesterday or the seven who were injured and are now receiving medical care. I say to their families that our thoughts and prayers will continue to be with you. Our nation stands ready to provide whatever assistance we can to you in this time of grief and sadness. It is also fitting to pay tribute and send our thoughts to the soldiers who served alongside Sappers Moerland and Smith in Afghanistan. Their stoic bravery in facing up to a new day without their mates by their side must be a difficult challenge, and their bravery and courage are to be remarked. Their families, I am sure, also feel a sense of loss during this sad time. MAIN COMMITTEE The defence community is indeed a close family. I am sure the defence family will now do its best for the families of Sappers Moerland and Smith. I would like to say a few more words about the three sappers who died in Afghanistan. Sapper Moerland was 21 years old and was born in Cairns. He enlisted on 9 July 2007. He completed training in the 1st Recruit Training Battalion, along with driver and combat engineer courses, before being posted to 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, Brisbane. Sapper Moerland was on his first deployment. Sapper Moerland was awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp, International Campaign Against Terrorism; the NATO Service Medal; and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. He has also received the Return From Active Service Badge. The Moerland family is very proud of Jacob’s service to his nation. His mum, Sandra, and sisters, Bethany and Laura, issued a media statement following the announcement of his death. I know it has already been mentioned by my colleagues but I would like to repeat what Sandra said: Jacob died doing the job he loved and he went to Afghanistan not because he had to, but he thought it was a valuable job to help the people in Afghanistan. This commitment and compassion to not just the people of our nation but also the people of other nations is something that I see time and again when I spend time with the ex-service and veterans community and with our current serving personnel. To the Moerland family and Jacob’s fiancée, Kezia, I extend my sincerest condolences. Sapper Darren Smith was 26 years old and was born in Adelaide. He was a husband to Angela and a father to 2½-year-old Mason. Sapper Smith died on active service in Afghanistan. Sapper Smith joined the Army Reserve in 2001. After completing a combat engineer course in 2004, Sapper Smith became part of the Australian Regular Army in October that year and was posted to 1st Combat Engineer Regiment. It was here that he completed his explosive detection dog handler course. Darren’s wife, Angela, paid tribute to her husband’s unique empathy with dogs. In a statement issued last Saturday, when his funeral was held, Angela said: Darren had an uncanny empathy with the dogs he cared for, taught and worked with. He had developed strong ideas on training, and also the welfare of the Explosive Detection Dogs. We often talked about his ideas and what he would like to have seen done to improve training and conditions, and I’m going to work as best I can to make sure Darren’s dreams come true. Sapper Smith was on his first deployment. He has been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp, International Campaign Against Terrorism; the NATO Service Medal; and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. He has also received the Return From Active Service Badge and the Australian Defence Medal. I recently spoke with some engineers at an RSL congress. They made it very clear, with tears in their eyes as they spoke, and one man said: ‘Three sappers died. That dog Herbie was one of us.’ Sapper Smith’s dog, Sapper Herbie, a 3½-year-old collie-cross died alongside his handler. Last year a memorial within the grounds of the Australian War Memorial was unveiled as a tribute to all animals lost in war. Sapper Herbie joins a long line of animals which have also paid the ultimate sacrifice in a war zone. The death of these fine young soldiers has touched all Australians. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten by this grateful nation. Their sacrifice should harden our resolve to defeat the insidious forces of international terrorism. Sappers Moerland and Smith’s names belong to MAIN COMMITTEE the ages, as will the names of three more fine Australians who died yesterday. We will indeed remember them. Lest we forget. lence motion moved by the Prime Minister concerning Sapper Darren Smith and Sapper Jacob Moerland. They were both members of the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, based in Brisbane. I and my colleagues on all sides of the parliament and, indeed, the nation are mourning the loss of these two brave soldiers. I start by extending my deepest sympathies and condolences to both men’s families, their friends, their colleagues and their brothers in arms. Our prayers and thoughts are with them all at this dreadful time. Sadly, the opportunity to speak on this particular condolence motion comes only a day after another three Australian soldiers tragically lost their lives in Afghanistan and seven other servicemen were wounded, two of them very seriously. They were members of the Australian Special Forces contingent, which is based just outside my electorate at Holsworthy. This tragedy brings it very close to home for people in Western Sydney. Once again, I offer my thoughts and prayers to the families and friends of those who are only just now coming to terms with the loss of their loved ones so far away. I extend my best wishes to those who are injured and pray for their speedy recovery. The attack on 2 June killed Sapper Smith and Sapper Moerland. Sapper Darren Smith was a dog handler and his dog, Herbie, was also killed. Dogs do an amazing job. Those of us who have had the opportunity to see them work in the military can attest to that. We all know the bond between us humans and our animals. However, I cannot imagine how close the bond would have been between a dog as specifically trained as Herbie and his handler, Darren Smith. It would have been very close. Again, this just adds to the tragedy. These are very much tragic times for Australia and for the Australian Defence Force. These deaths take to 16 the number of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan since 2002. All these men paid the ultimate sacrifice. These deaths are a sobering reminder of just how difficult and perilous each day in Afghanistan is. Whilst their deaths come at a time when there is public questioning of our involvement in Afghanistan, it is important to remind ourselves just what our role is in that country. Our mission is necessary and vitally important. We know that we are up against a determined and dangerous enemy. You have only to watch the TV to see that first hand. Each day our soldiers are working diligently alongside the United States and other allied NATO countries to ensure that Afghanistan does not return to being a breeding ground for terrorists, who we know are capable of striking anywhere in the world and at any time. Sadly, this includes Australians both at home and abroad. We are not free from this horror. More than 100 Australians have already lost their lives to terrorists in the last decade. In question time today the Prime Minister reaffirmed our military position in Afghanistan. He said that that it was in our nation’s interest to stay on course despite the consequences we are currently facing. As difficult as it may seem during these horrific times, we must be firm and we must complete the mission we have set ourselves in partnership with our allies. I take this opportunity to reiterate the Prime Minister’s comments and those of the Minister for Defence about the outstanding work that our many fine men and women in the ADF are doing on our behalf. To them. I say: I, along with the community that I represent in south-west Sydney, recognise and appreciate the tremendous work you do on our behalf. Your job comes with a degree of risk that, thankfully, most of us will never, ever have to face. I know it takes a speMAIN COMMITTEE",133,Condolences
181,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (5.25 Pm),"It is with sorrow that I rise today to support the condocial kind of person and a special kind of courage to wear the uniform of the ADF. All Australians are truly indebted to the service and dedication of these young men and women. We mourn the loss of these soldiers. On behalf of my colleagues, my family and my community, I would like to once more offer my sincere gratitude to them for their service and for the commitment they showed on behalf of our nation. My thoughts are with the families, friends and colleagues of those who have given their lives for our security. May they rest in peace. Darren Smith and Sapper Jacob Moerland, and to pass on my sympathies and support to Angela Smith and their beautiful little boy, Mason; and to Jacob’s fiancee, Kezia. Sappers Jacob Moerland and Darren Smith from the Brisbane based 2CER, the 2nd Combat Engineering Regiment, died as a result of wounds sustained when an IED, an improvised explosive device, was remotely detonated on the morning of 7 June 2010, Afghanistan time. They were part of an Australian dismounted patrol conducting operations in the Mirabad Valley region of Oruzgan province. They were serving with the 1st Mentoring Task Force in Afghanistan, based around the 6th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment. Sapper Smith’s explosives-detection dog, Herbie, was also killed. They were two young soldiers, sappers and engineers. Sapper Smith’s military career commenced as part of the Army Reserve, enlisting in November 2001, completing recruit training in January 2002 and then becoming part of 3rd Field Squadron in South Australia. He went on to become a combat engineer in 2004 and part of the Australian Regular Army, and he was posted to 1CER in Darwin in late 2004. Whilst at 1CER, he also successfully completed his explosives-detection dog handler course. He was subsequently posted to the 2nd Combat Engineering Regiment in January 2009. He had also completed his junior leader course in late 2008. His deployment with MTF1 to Afghanistan was his first operational deployment. I still remember the first time. I was deployed overseas on military operations; it was a mixture of much excitement as well as concern about some of the daunting things we would face. I have no doubt that Sapper Smith felt exactly the same thing, as well as incredible pride in the uniform he wore. When he looked at the left and right sleeves of his shirt, where velcroed on each arm was the Australian flag and the rising sun of the Australian Regular Army, it would have reminded him of why he served and who he served-his nation-and what he was part of. Sapper Smith was deployed to Afghanistan in March 2010. As part of his deployment he received the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp International Campaign against Terrorism or ICAT, the NATO Service Medal and the Afghan Campaign Medal. He was also a recipient of the Australian Defence Medal. Sapper Smith leaves behind his beautiful wife, Angela, and a 2½-year-old son, Mason. They lived in Brisbane. He was 26 years old, born in Adelaide, South Australia. As I said, Sapper Smith’s dog, Herbie, a 3½-year-old collie cross to whom he was very close, was also killed in action. Sapper Jacob Daniel Moerland enlisted on 9 July 2007. He completed his initial recruit training at 1st Recruit Training Battalion in late 2007. After a suite of combat engineering courses in 2008, he was posted to 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment in Brisbane. It was his first MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Condolences
182,Mr Robert (Fadden) (5.31 Pm),"I rise to speak on the condolence motion for Sapperposting as a combat engineer. Whilst there he went on to do a range of courses including protective mobility vehicle driving and combat first aid. Again, his deployment in January this year as part of Mentoring Task Force1 was his first deployment. As part of his tour he has been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp, International Campaign against Terrorism (ICAT), NATO Medal and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. He leaves behind his fiancée, Kezia, who lives in Brisbane. The young Sapper was 21 years old. I met these two lads on a bright summer’s day in Oruzgan province. Dust was everywhere. The second Combat Engineering Regiment had a detachment there that they brought out to demonstrate for a few members of parliament-who were visiting and embedded in the combat zone for just short of a week-their equipment, the gear they were using, how they operated and how they moved around obstacles. I remember seeing the two lads, one of them with Herbie, his dog, demonstrating how they clear mines, how they moved about and how effective the dog was in working for the troops. They demonstrated their mine clearing equipment and how they detect mines. They had a couple of their mates and I grabbed all their gear because they were saying the gear was ‘so heavy’. We talked about operational experience, what we have done and how much gear I used to carry in the paras. I grabbed their gear and chucked it on. I put on their rifle, ammunition and water and I grabbed their portable ECM. I tell you what; I was weighed down by 50 kilograms. These guys were right; they were carrying an enormous load. Combat engineers were in enormous demand and desperately sought after by every formation on the ground because whenever the troops would go out with the MTF or whenever our boys were deployed they would desperately seek combat engineers. As they came to obstacles, corners in the road or areas where they could not see they would stop and prop, and the engineers would go out searching for mines-improvised explosive devices. These are devices that are difficult to see and that have little or no metal content. Here they were with their metal detectors looking for the thinnest of wires by which to discover the mines and to protect their fellow soldiers. These two men were proud of their jobs. They were proud of the fact that they kept coalition soldiers alive. They did their job well. Even as we spent a brief 30 minutes, you could see the pride they had in their work and in what they did, the pride in which they kept their equipment and their vehicle always ready for deployment and they were certainly always working hard. The hardest working guys in Afghanistan, I am sure, are the engineering guys, the combat engineers, the EOD technicians and the like. It is attributed to George Orwell that: We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm. These two sappers were killed by a remotely detonated improvised explosive device, which meant that the Taliban insurgent who detonated it could see the target, waited until the men approached and then detonated the device. That should give the nation pause to think and should illuminate clearly the type of enemy we fight. This is not an enemy with any compassion or any compunction in destroying coalition forces, as they desperately seek their own extremist views of Islam and seek to impose that way of life upon the nation of Afghanistan. MAIN COMMITTEE We sleep safe in our beds here because of rough men like these two sappers, like the men of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, like men of the Special Operations Task Force and like men and women of all the ancillary forces that make up the combat force in the Middle East. We sleep safe in our beds because rough men and women stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm. Whilst it may sound a small statement, the sacrifice of these men is not in vain. They are a beacon of inspiration to others because they sought to provide a better future for the people of Afghanistan. They sought to provide freedom. They sought to provide a platform where little Afghani girls could go to school; where Afghan women were not brutally repressed and stuck in their homes; where violence was not the order of every day and where progress, freedom and aspiration could rein and grow. They sought to build a world in which the 93 per cent of the world’s heroin that currently comes out of Afghanistan would not. They sought to build a world where infrastructure was the norm, where banking systems operate, where schools, retail establishments and opportunities in manufacturing could grow in Afghanistan. That is the world they went over there to try and build. That is the world they went over there to secure, to allow that world to be built. These men stand tall as men who believed that all people, wherever they may live, should have the opportunity to live in a better world. They stand tall because they believed in a world free from violence, free from intimidation and free from oppression. It can only ever be a small comfort, but these men died doing what they loved; they served their country. They died with the Australian flag on their shoulder. As two highly professional, skilled and dedicated soldiers, they knew the great dangers-be under no doubt about that. They knew the great sacrifices required. They served in the great tradition of their country, knowing that the only way that evil prospers is if good men do nothing. They will never share a place with those cold, miserable souls who stand by in ambivalence. Their place is one of honour. They are universally saluted. And if freedom is indeed a sure possession of those alone who have the courage to defend it then may I say that Sapper Darren Smith and Sapper Jacob Moerland stand tall in this nation’s history as men with the courage to defend freedom. The ancient warrior, statesman and king Pericles, who founded the Athenian nation 2½ thousand years ago and led that nation during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War, said: What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others. Lads, your families will not forget you. This nation will not forget you. Mason, you are only 2½ but one day you will read this, and you need to know that your dad was a deadset hero. AndI will always remember that mild April day in Afghanistan when I spent half an hour with a couple of combat engineers who proudly showed me their gear and their drills and spoke with pride of their responsibilities keeping coalition troops alive. They truly epitomised the Aussie digger. They were young men-keen, on their first appointment-and I think they added to and made the ANZAC name incredibly proud. may have to vacate the chair before this condolence motion is concluded, and I just want to say that it has been a very special privilege to be in this chair and to listen to the very heartfelt speeches of my colleagues on both sides of this chamber on the condolence motion for Sapper MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Condolences
183,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Je Moylan) (5.42 Pm),"BeforeI call the next speaker, IJacob Daniel Moerland and Sapper Darren James Smith. I endorse the sentiments that have been expressed and join my colleagues in extending condolences to the families, friends and work colleagues of Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith. I thank the House. tervention, and I know your thoughts will be very much appreciated by the families, friends and comrades of those who we pay tribute to this evening. It is possible that I might have met Sapper Smith and Sapper Moerland. As defence minister, I of course had the privilege to meet literally hundreds of fine young Australians, so committed to their country as to be prepared to give their lives for their nation. Of course, I do not remember every face and name; that would be impossible. But it is certainly possible, having visited Enoggera Barracks on a number of occasions, that I did meet them. Of course, I do not have to remember their faces or their names to come to the conclusion that they certainly were very fine and brave Australians-their deeds speak for themselves. I join with other speakers in extending my sympathies and thoughts to the family, friends and ADF colleagues of both Sapper Smith and Sapper Moerland. It is a very, very tragic time for the families and all who were close to these two brave Australians. I hope the fact that they died in service to their country somehow, at least over time, helps to alleviate the very great pain they are feeling today. Yesterday we lost three more very brave Australians, this time not combat engineers but members of 2 Commando Company based at Holsworthy. Seven others were wounded in the same incident, some of them very badly. While small when compared with the losses and injuries suffered by countries such as the US, the UK and Canada, the cost of the war in Afghanistan has been very significant for Australia. What always struck me as minister when I spoke with grieving family, friends and other serving personnel, but in particular parents, was that they found some comfort in the fact that their sons, brothers or husbands really believed in what they were doing, understood very clearly the risks involved and really believed they were making a difference. I too believe they were making a difference. Indeed, I believe every serving member of the ADF in Afghanistan is making a real difference, in partnership with the members of the AFP and the civilian workers who are assisting. There should be no doubt in our minds that the longer we are in Afghanistan, and the more people we lose, the more difficult it will become to maintain the support for this campaign amongst the Australian electorate. So tonight I would like to remind the broader electorate of a couple of key points. The 16 brave Australians who have given their lives in Afghanistan were not conscripts; they were volunteers. They were professional soldiers; indeed, they were very, very professional soldiers. I can confidently claim that every one of them wanted to deploy. They wanted an opportunity to serve their country. They wanted an opportunity to give effect to their training and the skills they had developed when doing that training. We should be in no doubt about that. They wanted to give effect to that training and to use those skills to make Australia and the globe a safer place in which to live and to work and to travel. They were conscious of the fact, and those who are still serving or might be about to serve are also conscious of the fact, that Australians died at the hands of fundamental terrorists. And they understand that there is a very direct link between what we are doing in Afghanistan and keeping Australians safe.

184,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (5.43 Pm),"I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for your inSoI say: grieve for them, yes. Be grateful for them, yes. But understand that the greatest gift of appreciation we can give them is to finish the job, to see the mission through. What is that mission? That is my second message to the Australian people. We are in Afghanistan to play our part in an international effort to stabilise the war-torn country, to prevent it from again being a breeding ground and a launching pad for terrorists prepared to perpetrate their acts of terror right around the globe, including on our own doorstep and, indeed, including in our own country. It is not a task that the US can or should shoulder alone, for many reasons. First, obviously that would not be fair. This is an international problem, the burden of which should be shared internationally. Second, even the US lacks the resources to undertake this task alone. Sure, the US has enormous resources which can be put to use in state-on-state conflicts, but not the resources necessary to deal with an insurgency and with asymmetric warfare such as we are facing in a place like Afghanistan, so large in its geography and so challenging in its landscape. Third, the ideological nature of this conflict insists that we have a united effort. It is so important that this be and continue to be an international effort-not the US versus the Taliban but the international community trying to make the world a safer place. Our relatively small role-it is not unimportant; it is very important, but relatively smallis to assist in the training of the Afghan National Army in Oruzgan province. This is the very specific task the government has now given the ADF, for many reasons-in part to determine our end point in this campaign. While members of the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force are building an effective Afghan army, the Special Operations Task Group is disrupting and denying the enemy. Meanwhile, our people in uniform and our civilians alike help to build an economy, a justice system and, of course, a system of governance. Sadly, the effectiveness of the work our people do will make only a relatively small difference in Afghanistan when compared to the critical decisions that are made and will be made in places like Washington, Brussels and, of course, Kabul. One right decision in those places and in those councils, of course, can be far more effective than any number of armies in their collective effort. I think that from time to time Australians and, indeed, members of the global community are entitled to be disappointed with some of those decisions, particularly some of the decisions that come out of Kabul itself. They are entitled to at times question the will and the determination of the Afghan government. I do not doubt or question the complexity of the issues faced by the government based in Kabul-there is no doubt that their task is a very, very difficult one-but Australians everywhere, I think, should focus their efforts more on doing what they can in a democratic process to put pressure on both us and other decision makers elsewhere to ensure that we have a strategy and a will to win. Of course, the definition of ‘win’ in this case is to be able to leave Afghanistan safe in the knowledge that there is a stable system of governance, that there is a justice system, that there are at least the beginnings of an economy-which is so critical to this outcome-and that the government there is sufficiently stable to resist any future attempts by organisations such as the Taliban to take back control of that country. I also ask Australians to ask themselves: what would be the outcome of the international community suddenly withdrawing from Afghanistan? I suggest to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, to the parliament and to anyone else listening that it would lead to the greatest humanitarian disaster in the history of the globe as retribution is sought against those who deMAIN COMMITTEE cided to, if you like, side with the international community in its efforts to stabilise the wartorn country. We saw the refugee flow into Pakistan during the conflict between the Russians and the Afghanis and, if you like, by proxy the United States of America. My belief is that that flow would look very small when compared with what you would see if the international community decided to suddenly withdraw from Afghanistan and the atrocities which would take place in that country would be potentially worse than anything we have seen in the past. SoI say to the Australian people, even if you believe we should never have been in Afghanistanand there is a good case, I am always happy to hear those arguments-we are in Afghanistan, the international community is in Afghanistan. If we do not finish what we began then there would be a terrible humanitarian disaster. In addition, there would be implications for places like Pakistan in particular which is, I remind people, a nuclear state, and it would embolden fundamentalists right around the globe. This idea of suddenly pulling out of Afghanistan would have very grave consequences. On a similar theme, I would like to touch on something that has become part of the public debate in recent weeks-that is, the idea that the Australian legislature should play a greater role in determining when we go to war and how long we remain at war. This is an idea I absolutely reject for a number of reasons but two stand out fairly obviously. The first is that I am not sure what the technical definition of ‘war’ would be for the purposes of such legislation. War can stretch from a very fast intervention by special forces in, say, an unstable situation in the South Pacific, through to a short-term intervention-and when I say ‘short-term’ I mean something that escalates and de-escalates in a number of hours such as a maritime incident somewhere in our waters or beyond-through to the insurgency we are battling in places like Afghanistan and previously Iraq and right through to state-on-state conflict, God forbid. So there is a very key definitional issue and the reality is that in the majority of those cases there is no time for the legislature to gather and to deliberate on these very, very critical questions. Secondly, and to me more importantly, is the folly of having such a debate in the legislature. When the National Security Committee of the Cabinet is considering putting people into harm’s way, there are a number of things it considers. First and foremost is the morality and necessity of the intervention. Another is the proportionate risk to our people-is the intervention worthwhile given the gravity or otherwise of the risks? Also very importantly is the prospect of success. There is not always a choice in existential threat situations when some of those choices are not with the National Security Committee of the Cabinet, but generally speaking they are. When assessing those things, a security committee does rely on some very sensitive information-information that is both critical to the decision-making process and that cannot be shared with the broader Australian community nor indeed the international community for obvious reasons. You cannot have a debate in the legislature without that information and you cannot have a debate in the legislature without therefore making that information known to the broader Australian community. It is unfortunate we cannot make that information available to the broader Australian community, but to do so would be to undermine and put at risk our efforts and indeed put at risk the lives of those who serve in the Australian Defence Force. Some will say that many governments in Europe already have debates in their legislatures which determine these issues. Of course, some countries even have constitutional constraints MAIN COMMITTEE upon them when making decisions about what they do or what they do not do in terms of military intervention. I acknowledge that, but I also ask people who put that argument to look at how effective that system has been in the conflict we are reflecting on this evening, Afghanistan, where European partners have been very constrained in the contributions they are able to make. I have spoken with ministers from some of those countries. One minister even appealed to me in international forums to assist him to persuade his constituency of the merit of his country maintaining the course, maintaining its involvement in Afghanistan. That is an unfortunate situation, and I think the Westminster system has it right. It is a big ask, but it is appropriate for the Australian people and even the Australian parliament to put its faith in those who carry the very heavy burden of making these decisions. Of course, our Westminster system has a certain way of dealing with the people who make those decisions if they get them wrong. I close by again extending my sympathies to the families of Sappers Smith and Moerland and reminding the families of all those who have gone before them, in Afghanistan and elsewhere, that we have not forgotten the deeds of their loved ones and, as a parliament and as a broader Australian community, we never will. lences to the families of Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith. The loss of a young person’s life is always something that we grieve for. When someone has lost their life in the service of their nation, there is a depth of emotion and feeling that we all in this country instinctively feel. When we in this parliament take decisions to send young Australians to places abroad and place them in harm’s way, we do not do it lightly but we do it knowing that we may well confront the tragic news that the nation confronted just recently, and again this week, with the loss of Australian lives in Afghanistan. On a personal level, it is hard to imagine the impact it has on immediate family and friends. The troops are well aware of the situation they are entering. They are well trained, they are committed and they go there as volunteers to do a task for their nation. Whilst their family and loved ones understand that may be so, it nonetheless is a different comprehension to that of those in the service. Last SaturdayI attended the funeral service for Sapper Darren Smith at Ashgrove Marist Brothers, along with representatives from the local community, from his regiment and from both sides of parliament, including the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. As I was looking at the program for the funeral service, I noticed Sapper Smith’s date of birth. He was about three weeks younger than my second son. As I sat through the service I had great difficulty getting that thought out of my mind. As I left the service and for a good deal of the day, I could not help but place my thoughts, as a parent, on the question of how you would feel in that situation and then on the decisions that I have taken and supported in this parliament. It caused me to reflect quite seriously on those decisions I take here in this parliament. BeforeI move to that I want to say something about the Smith family and about his comrades who were there at the funeral service. Sapper Smith’s wife provided perhaps the most touching moment of the entire service when she bent over to kiss the flag across Sapper Smith’s coffin. Just thinking about it makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up; I certainly lost my composure at that point during the service. She is clearly a wonderful lady who was deeply loved by Sapper Smith, and they have a wonderful son, who was very boisterous MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Mcbas Their Modular Combat Body Armour System And Their Webbing I Grabbed Their
185,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (6.02 Pm),"I rise, as with all other members, to express my condoand-perhaps happily-at this point in time does not fully comprehend what has happened. Sapper Smith’s dad was also at the funeral and spoke with great pride about his son’s commitment to the Australian Defence Force. It was equally moving to see the commitment of the members of the regiment who were there. One of the close friends of Sapper Smith-he had been best man at the wedding and provided one of the eulogies-in a very genuine way expressed the sentiment of many from his regiment as he pledged to look after the interests of Sapper Smith’s widow and child in the years ahead. I have no doubt that he and the others will do just that, as would Sapper Smith’s father, who spoke at the funeral service. These are difficult times for the family, and we cannot underestimate that. Frankly, we cannot pretend to comprehend it, even though we may have witnessed it at close quarters. Those of us who are in this parliament share some of the responsibility for the determinations of policy like this. I stand here as a person who was very strongly and very publicly opposed to our invasion of Iraq. I think that was an enormous miscalculation by all involved. I also stand here as someone who is equally committed to our participation in Afghanistan, where, indeed, I believe we should have been from the start. I mentioned earlier that the events at that funeral made me reflect throughout that day on the decisions and public stances I have taken. I can stand here and say that, having gone through that reflection, I do believe it is important for Australia to be in Afghanistan. I do believe it is important that we establish a form of law and order in that part of the world, not simply because there may be some benefit to those who live in that country-although there will be-but out of, if you like, our selfish national interest, our regional interest and our global responsibilities. Afghanistan has been home to some of the key fundraising and training activities of those who would export random violence. Indeed, Australians have been victims of it. The Australians who died in Bali were victims of those who had been supported, trained, aided and abetted by the activities allowed by the lawless situation that operated in Afghanistan. It is not coincidence that in the border territory between Pakistan and Afghanistan we see some of the most heightened fighting in the war against non-state terrorists. It is in the region’s interests to ensure stability there. It is definitely in the global interest to ensure stability on that border and to support the democratic government development within Pakistan. It is in the interests of countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Australia to put an end to a haven where terrorists can train with impunity, can raise money and can export their terror to anywhere on the globe they wish. Looking over the last decade, there is no doubt that Afghanistan has been a key part of that. It is important that we stabilise that area. As the member for Hunter commented, some of the NATO nations in Europe have failed to fully take on their responsibilities in these matters. That is a cause for great regret. At the end of last year I had the opportunity to lead an Australian parliamentary delegation to the NATO assembly, where many of these matters were discussed in public and in private. It is true that some of those countries are deeply divided. Some people actually came to the Australians and asked us to talk to other members of their own parliamentary delegation about these matters, which was quite peculiar. Without stability in Afghanistan and that part of the world, there is no doubt in my mind that we will confront another Bali, we will confront another attack on our embassies in our MAIN COMMITTEE region and we will see in other parts of the world similar acts of mindless terrorism perpetrated. The sacrifice of Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith has been in the cause of our security here in Australia, the security of Australians abroad, the rule of law in Afghanistan and respect for human rights throughout this globe. Australian troops have had a very proud tradition of upholding those principles from the early days of Australian nationhood. Sapper Moerland and Sapper Smith are without doubt now held in the highest regard in that great tradition. I want to make one other comment about the work they did. It takes a special sort of person to be in the military. It takes an even more special person to do the work they were doing. Dealing with unexploded ordnance, as they did, really does take a different set of nerves. You have to have a different mindset to do the work they did, and yet they did it with great joy, as was shown by some of the photos displayed at the funeral of Sapper Smith. There was one photo of Sapper Smith and Sapper Moerland together with their dog. They were obviously enjoying the work they were doing in providing safety to people around them, including their own troops and the villagers. It is a special person who does that sort of thing, and they deserve particular mention for that. On behalf of all my constituents in Brisbane, who are so familiar with the military-we have got a long tradition with the Enoggera Army barracks, the Gallipoli Barracks-I extend to the bereaved families our very deep and sincere condolences. Especially because these two sappers were based at Enoggera and were Brisbane’s own, we feel it deeply. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (6.13 pm)-I rise to speak on the condolence motion for Sapper Smith and Sapper Moerland. I offer very sincere condolences and sympathy to their families, their friends and their ADF colleagues. They were indeed fine, brave young men. We know that our Australian ADF members are held in great regard right around the world and have been throughout our history as a nation, and rightly so. We need to acknowledge these two young men with the absolute greatest respect. I have received a letter from the Returned and Services League of Australia sub-branch in the town of Bunbury in my electorate. They have written to me and said: The RSL Sub-Branch Bunbury, WA, would like to pass on our condolences to the families, friends and service comrades of Sappers Darren Smith and Jacob Moerland who were killed in action in Afghanistan. We feel for them, as in the Army, we are all one family and their deaths have a great effect on all their comrades past and present. These young men joined the Australian Defence Force to protect and serve their country and have paid the ultimate sacrifice and deserve and receive our highest praise and respect. Although Bunbury is a quiet little town we have received numerous calls from our members and the public in regards to this tragedy, offering condolences and at the same time supporting our serving troops. There will be no repeat of the shameful way our Vietnam Veterans were treated and their memories tarnished. We have local members who are ex Engineers, and they keenly feel the deaths of Sapper Smith and Moerland as comrades as it revives memories of the mates they lost during their service. Our local member and President for many years, Mr Ross Stewart, made the following comments: “As a Sapper going to Vietnam part of our training included the technique of mine detection and booby traps MAIN COMMITTEE and how to deal with them. Dealing with the reality of losing a mate (who, one has trained with) has life long memories of sorrow and not being able to rectify these occurrences and others, one never forgets”. I believe these will be the sentiments and feelings of the comrades of Sappers Smith and Moerland. Again can I offer our greatest condolences and thoughts. We ask that these families are able to find the strength to deal with what they have to deal with. Not just now but throughout their whole lives they will remember this. To Sapper Smith’s wife and son and to the parents and families, we say: our deepest condolences. From Trevor Kenny, the President of the RSL in Bunbury, I do the same. I know the Bunbury RSL members would like me to say that they will be remembering these two young men on ANZAC Day, and they would like me to say: They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will remember them. ing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (6.17 pm)-This is a very difficult time for the Australian Defence Force, with five casualties in the last two weeks and seven wounded, taking the toll for the ADF in Operation Slipper in Afghanistan now to 16 personnel having been killed in the course of their duty and no less than 134 ADF members wounded. It is an extremely important operation that the ADF is involved in, in partnership with our allies in the International Security Assistance Force led by NATO. Of course, we must not lose sight of the fact in these particularly tragic circumstances of the purpose of the mission. I know a lot of members have spoken in relation to it, but we must not lose sight of the fact that the ADF and Australia are involved with our allies in Operation Slipper as a contribution to fight international terrorism. The intention, the objective, is to bring security and stability to Afghanistan to prevent it from again becoming a haven for international terrorists. I wish, of course, to add my deep sorrow at the deaths of Sapper Jacob Moerland and Sapper Darren Smith on 7 June this year. BeforeI speak further about them, I would like to refer to the news yesterday, as announced by both the Chief of the Defence Force and the Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner, of three Australian commandos from the Special Operations Task Group having been killed and seven Australians wounded in an ISAF helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan. An ISAF civilian interpreter travelling with the Australian group was also wounded in that helicopter incident. One of the ISAF aircrew was also killed and three ISAF aircrew wounded. ISAF has now confirmed that the aircrew were US service personnel. The Australian government and I as a member of parliament extend our sincere sympathies and condolences to the families and friends of the aircrew member killed in this incident and our sincere regard for those members of the services of our partner nations in Afghanistan who were wounded in this incident. As Senator Faulkner has indicated on a number of occasions today, two of the Australian wounded are very seriously injured, one is in a very serious condition and four are currently in a satisfactory condition. Some, and possibly all, of the injured personnel are expected to be transferred to the health facility in Germany and, hopefully, will return to Australia in the very near future. That incident follows closely on the circumstances of the casualties experienced in relation to Sapper Jacob Moerland and Sapper Darren Smith on 7 June.

186,Mr Combet (Charlton,"Minister for Defence Materiel and Science and Minister AssistMateriel and ScienceI express my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those men during what is obviously a terribly grief-stricken period of time. In particular, I would like to offer my condolences to Sapper Smith’s wife, Angela, his very young son, Mason, and his father, Graeme. I would also like to extend my sympathies to his extended family and friends and mates in the ADF. I would like to express my condolences to Sapper Moerland’s mother, Sandra, father, Robert, and sisters, Bethany and Laura, and his fiancée, Kezia. I also offer comfort to his extended family, friends and comrades in the ADF. I have had the privilege of meeting many men and women of the ADF and I am always, as I think all members in this place are, impressed by their professionalism and courage. Of course, the circumstances in Afghanistan demand every bit of professionalism and courage. Sapper Smith, whose life and service we are honouring in this condolence motion, was aged 26. He was known as a very brave and dedicated soldier, committed to serving the nation. Over the period of time since 7 June, I have heard how Sapper Smith was a very loving husband and father and a quite remarkable person. He was very passionate about his job, putting others first, whether it was his friends in the Army or at home with his family and friends. He joined the Army Reserve, enlisting on 29 November 2001, and completed recruit training in January 2002, serving as part of the 3rd Field Squadron, South Australia. Sapper Smith went on to complete his combat engineer suite of courses in 2004 and became part of the Australian Regular Army. He was then first posted to the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment in Darwin in October 2004. He successfully completed his explosive detection dog handler course, I understand, in December 2006. Sapper Smith was posted to the Brisbane based 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment in January 2009. He was a popular and valued member of the regiment and the Army, from all reports of his mates. He completed the junior leader course in November 2008. His deployment as a part of the 1st Mentoring Task Force, Afghanistan was in fact his first operational deployment, deploying in March this year. I was at Enoggera on that particular occasion when the troops were farewelled. Sapper Smith was part of an Australian dismounted patrol conducting operations in the Mirabad Valley region of Oruzgan province at the time of his tragic death. As part of his deployment, he has been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with the International Campaign against Terrorism clasp, the NATO Service Medal and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. He has also received the Australian Defence Medal. On7 June, when this incident occurred, Sapper Smith was tragically killed as a result of wounds sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated whilst he was on operations in the Mirabad Valley. The same blast, as has been widely reported, also claimed the life of Sapper Smith’s explosives detection dog, Herbie, with whom he obviously had a very special relationship. Tragically, the IED also claimed the life of Sapper Jacob Moerland. Sapper Jacob Moerland was also a very loyal soldier, committed to serving this country and helping the people of Afghanistan. His passion and dedication to his service exemplifies again the courage and professionalism of those serving in the ADF. Sapper Moerland was only 21 years old. He was born in Cairns, joined the Army in 2007 and completed his initial recruit training at the 1st Recruit Training Battalion. After completing driver and combat engineer courses in May 2008, Sapper Moerland was posted to the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment at the Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, in Brisbane. He was deployed for his first tour of duty to Afghanistan in January this MAIN COMMITTEE year and was serving as a member of the 1st Mentoring Task Force at the time of his tragic death. Sapper Moerland has been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with the International Campaign against Terrorism Clasp, the NATO Medal and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. On7 June Sapper Moerland was tragically killed by the improvised explosive device during the dismounted patrol while conducting operations in the Mirabad Valley region of Oruzgan province, where the Australian Mentoring Task Force is active. I am sure that someone so young will be very sadly missed by his family and his fiancee, Kezia. This particular incident, as has been reported, was the nation’s first multiple combat fatality since the Vietnam War, almost four decades ago. How tragic it is that, only a very short period later, we have experienced the losses that the ADF experienced yesterday. But, as we remember Darren Smith and Jacob Moerland and fully contemplate the tragedy of the last 24 to 36 hours, I think the community is understanding the danger and the courage required to meet that danger that the ADF is facing in Afghanistan. All of us in this chamber know that we are in Afghanistan engaged with the international community in an extremely challenging campaign, and our troops in Afghanistan are doing a wonderful job in extremely difficult circumstances. Sappers Smith and Moerland died serving this country and they are owed a very special debt of gratitude that can never be repaid. Our thoughts, and my thoughts as a minister in the portfolio, are with the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, who are mourning the loss of these two comrades. Today, as we offer our sympathy and support to Darren Smith’s and Jacob Moerland’s families and friends, we say to them that we have not forgotten and we will not forget the very brave Australian soldiers that we have lost in this fight against the Taliban, but we retain the resolve to see the objectives of this mission achieved. Dr KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (6.29 pm)-I thank my colleague the Minister for Defence Material and Science for his comments and I thank those who contributed before me. We gather again in unity in what has been a very heavy week in the life and history of this nation, where we have farewelled yet more proud sons of the Australian Army and of this country. Sapper Darren Smith and Sapper Jacob Moerland are the 13th and 14th fatalities respectively whom we commemorate and farewell tonight, and we offer our condolences to their families. These were two proud Australian soldiers, two proud engineers, sappers, who were members of a proud unit, the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, which I was privileged to work with in my time with the 1st Division at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, and I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Bevis, know that unit very well and the life at that barracks very well. We also farewell Sapper Smith’s explosives detection dog, Herbie. It is important to recognise what a close bond the sappers form with those dogs. In my own region, we have the experience of Sapper Peter Lawlis, who lives in Bredbo, who lost his dog, Merlin, over in Afghanistan. Just recently we were able to bring back the remains of Merlin, which formed a very important part of giving peace of mind to Sapper Lawlis. It is important to note just how close a bond they form in performing the dangerous work that they do. We have heard the biographies of the two proud ADF members and about their families, so I do not propose to go back over those details. I am proud to note that Sapper Smith commenced his military service in the reserves, though, and went on to the regulars. We do have a wonderful record of people moving in and out of the regulars and reserves and rendering their service, and there have been members from the reserves lost in the conflict in Afghanistan. MAIN COMMITTEE Their records of service were exemplary and they were doing incredibly important work-and I will come back to that. I think members on both sides of the House do experience what the costs of these operations are when they attend the ramp ceremonies and the funerals and meet the families of ADF members. Neither side of this chamber runs away from the responsibility and the cost of these conflicts. What has struck me so much in these experiences has been the universal comments that we get from the families-that these members were passionate about their careers, passionate about the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force and passionate about the work they were doing in Afghanistan, and that they had a firm belief in what they were doing in Afghanistan. The support that the families gave to those members and continue to give in their memory shows that they understand that their passion was for their job, and they understood that commitment, and none of them have resiled from that in the conversations that I have had with them or that they have had with other members of the chamber at those services or in subsequent contact with them. I think that is an important thing to note. All of the members of the Defence Force that I talk to on a regular basis who are deploying to, coming back from or even redeploying to our theatres of operation in Afghanistan do remain 100 per cent committed. I have not heard a single person voice any concern about that commitment. They do feel that we need to see the job through there. It is an important point to note, I think, because whenever these casualties occur we do re-examine the nature of this conflict and our continuing commitment to it, and it is right that we do so. As we pay this cost, we need to re-examine whether it is worth that cost. As I mentioned, we have heard in great detail about the character of these two ADF members, and fine members they were. We know that they were from the proud 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, which has an incredible history itself. Its members having served as field companies through the First and Second World Wars and then gradually evolved into squadrons, they are now a combat engineer regiment. It is the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment that gave us the Joint Incident Response Unit as well, which helps us to respond to incidents of chemical, biological or radiological threat. The work of our engineers is quite diverse, and people need to know, I think, just how incredibly professional you have to be to follow a career as an engineer-a combat engineer in particular. These are people who do incredibly difficult, dangerous, strenuous and risky work, and the training leading up to this is also incredibly risky, strenuous and dangerous. Their main roles of course are to provide mobility and clear the way for the Australian Defence Force; to deny mobility to the enemy; to prepare field fortifications; to assault enemy field fortifications; and to deal with the modern risks emerging from chemical, biological and radiological threats. So they do perform incredible work. It requires nerves of steel to do some of the tasks that they do. In particular, this explosives detection work with dogs clears the way for their colleagues and clears the way for the civilians in Afghanistan and other people and agencies performing such great work there. I guess people recently have had access to some of the nature of the work that is involved in dealing with these insidious improvised explosive devices through the portrayal in the film The Hurt Locker. But it is as well to note that that film portrays those who deal with devices that have already been discovered, and that the work of these sappers is to actually go out there to find those devices. That is incredibly strenuous and dangerous work. MAIN COMMITTEE Our 2CER, and engineer personnel generally that have served in Afghanistan as part of the engineering task unit in the 1st Mentoring Task Force, perform a number of tasks. It is important that we note those tasks. As part of the overall mobility and survivability support, they do route clearance; predominantly, as we have seen, in the case of this explosive ordnance, they search for and detect but also dispose of these devices. They also do limited construction tasks including maintenance at patrol bases. They have also been involved in the establishment of the trade-training school in Oruzgan province and provide training as part of that school. Also they are involved in the mentoring of the Afghan National Army’s engineering capability. So they do perform a broad range of tasks that aid both our security mission and also the capacity building in Afghanistan that is so important as the focus of this government’s strategy in Afghanistan. It is important to note that we do have a strategy in Afghanistan. That strategy is to train the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army to a high standard, and then to hand over to that brigade. That will then be the trigger for the withdrawal of our own military component. Obviously, Afghanistan is a long work in progress. It is probably not ever going to look to us like a Jeffersonian or Westminster democracy, but we do need to continue to endure, to work towards an acceptable state of affairs there where we have a reasonable state of rule of law and good governance, and that will take many, many years of engagement on different levels. But our military engagement is pegged, clearly and distinctly, to this strategy of creating the Afghan capacity. One of the threats, of course, that we face is these improvised explosive devices. They have been an insidious threat which has been indiscriminate and has caused many, many civilian casualties-in fact, more civilian casualties than military. And it is important to note that we have our own Counter Improvised Explosive Devices Task Force, which has done such great work over the years. We will leave no stone unturned in research and development, cooperating with other countries that are dealing with these threats, our allies and close friends, to find ways to counter these devices. We have also learned to use these situations to learn more about the threat elements and the enemy through our weapons technical intelligence teams that analyse these situations in great detail. The situation in Afghanistan, though, is a complex and difficult one, and it is one that I know gives grave concern to the public. But it is important to stick with this task. We face a threat from these Islamist extremists. I know we have the member for Wentworth here with us today, and he understands this full well and has been very strong in his confrontation of, and support for causes countering, Islamist extremism. If we were not to fight this threat in Afghanistan then we would have to fight it closer to home. We were fighting it closer to home. We were suffering casualties as a result of what was emanating from that ungoverned space in Afghanistan. The Islamist extremists are like some very virulent, parasitic pestilence that seeks out ailing states or ungoverned spaces to exploit, from which to launch their operations against the West, against democracies, and against the voices of tolerance, reason and moderation, even within their own religion. And it is worth noting that the overwhelming number of casualties of Islamist extremists have, in fact, been Muslims-Muslims that they wage war on, on a daily basis, in places like Kashmir, and in Iraq and Afghanistan. MAIN COMMITTEE But we are committed to this task to deny them that safe space-to deny them that ungoverned space in Afghanistan-and we will stick to that task. I know that the Australian steel spirit of sticking to a long-range task which carries some pain and some sacrifice will see us through to that point. We will stick by the international community, which is of a like mind in adhering to this, but we will also leave no stone unturned to try and find methods to better protect our people. In the budget we have committed a further $1 billion to that effort, so further research and development will go on towards looking for protective technologies and protective equipment for our personnel. Tonight we say goodbye to these two, to Darren and to Jacob. Darren and Jacob understood extremely well the nature of their tasks and what they were contributing to Afghanistan and to our effort there. They have written in their own way very special pages in a proud, proud history of this Australian Army and this Australian Defence Force. Having written those pages, they will long endure in our memories and in the history of this country. I salute their service. I salute their families’ support of and goodwill towards the other members of the unit and the nation’s commitment. The commitment of those families is also something that we should continuously remember. We look forward now also to dealing with the further improvements that we seek to achieve in Afghanistan and to building on the sacrifices that have been made by these wonderful members of our Defence Force. able members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

All of us in the Australian parliament salute their service and send our condolences to their families. I will move to the bill. The Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia is one of the largest and most comprehensive aeromedical services in the world. The service delivers extensive primary health care and 24-hour emergency service throughout all of Australia. Notably, today the Royal Flying Doctor Service has a fleet of 53 aircraft operating from 21 bases across the country, flying the equivalent of 25 round trips to the moon in any given year. It provides medical assistance to over 270,000 Australians every year. That is one person every two minutes.

190,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (6.42 Pm),"I rise to speak on the Crimes Amendment (Royal FlyThe Royal Flying Doctor Service has come a long way since its first flight in 1928. That was the year in which the Royal Flying Doctor Service was born. The service began as a dream of the Reverend John Flynn, a minister with the Presbyterian Church. He witnessed the daily struggle of pioneers living in remote areas where just two doctors provided the only medical care for an area of almost two million square kilometres. Flynn’s vision was to provide a mantle of safety for these people. On 15 May 1928, his dream became a reality with the opening of the Australian Inland Mission Aerial Medical Service, which was later renamed the Royal Flying Doctor Service, in Cloncurry, in Queensland. Over the next few years, the Royal Flying Doctor Service began to expand across the country. By the 1950s, the Royal Flying Doctor Service was acknowledged by former Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies as ‘perhaps the single greatest contribution to the effective settlement of the far distant country that we have witnessed in our time’. The RFDS and the contribution of the Reverend John Flynn are commemorated on the Australian $20 note, something I am sure all members would be familiar with. The Royal Flying Doctor Service has become a very proud symbol of the Australian spirit. You do not need to look far to find examples of individuals and communities taking pride in their involvement with the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Only last month, the Far North Queensland town of Mareeba was announced as the new home of the Queen Air plane, a long-retired member of the RFDS fleet. The Mareeba community have welcomed the news and have expressed how proud they are to be part of the history of an organisation that so many times has meant the difference between life and death for the people of regional and remote Queensland. This bill deals specifically with the medical chest service. A good example of how this works in practice is detailed on the RFDS website, as follows: A worker on a cattle station or exploration camp has an eye infection. It isn’t serious enough for an evacuation flight but it needs treatment. The station is 200 km from the nearest doctor or nursing post so a long road trip would be required to have it seen to. If there is a medical chest at their location, the worker can call the RFDS on our medical advice line and ask for medical assistance. The call would then be transferred to an RFDS doctor, who will speak to the patient and diagnose the condition over the phone. The doctor will then prescribe a drug from the chest, for example, number “134” antibiotic eye drops, and give the patient instructions on what to do. At the end of the phone consultation, the doctor will also provide the patient with a consult number which is needed to re-order the drug once it has been used. This scenario is also applicable to emergency situations. In the event of something serious like an amputation, crush injury or severe burn, medical chest custodians have access to RFDS doctors who will assess the situation via phone, prescribe appropriate pain relief and/or other medication, and arrange for an aeromedical evacuation if necessary. According to the RFDS website, ‘medical chests contain a range of pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical items’, and a large number of the latter are prescription-only items. The use of prescription-only items is subject to direct consultation with a Royal Flying Doctor Service doctor, and it is the doctor’s responsibility to correctly diagnose and prescribe. Only authorised, registered custodians are permitted to manage medical chests, and they are encouraged to have completed a senior first aid certificate. The Royal Flying Doctor Service emphasises MAIN COMMITTEE that extreme care is taken to prevent illicit access to the medical chest, and in some circumstances the medical chest can be forfeited. The RFDS receives Commonwealth funding to replenish chest items free of charge to remote locations where there is a duty of care to the public, such as outback schools, nursing posts, Indigenous communities and roadhouses. The RFDS is responsible for 3,000 medical chests throughout Australia. The chests were, up until the beginning of this year, replenished by delivery through Australia Post because many of the locations were too remote to be serviced by couriers or other transport networks. As a result of the cessation of deliveries, some medical chests have been left without essential supplies. This bill therefore addresses what is an urgent amendment to ensure that emergency medicines are available to treat serious illness or injury in remote parts of Australia. It will amend section 85W of the Crimes Act 1914 to insert an exception to the offence of ‘causing narcotic substances to be carried by post’ for Australia Post and the Royal Flying Doctor Service and their officers, employees, agents and contractors. The exception ensures that those organisations may arrange for the carriage of medicines by Australia Post for the purpose of enabling the Royal Flying Doctor Service to administer medicines through its medical chest program. The bill also replaces the reference in section 85W to a ‘controlled drug’ or a ‘controlled plant’, within the meaning of part 9.1 of the Criminal Code Act, with the reference to a ‘prescribed narcotic substance’ within the meaning of the Customs Act 1901. This exception addresses the repeal of that definition in 1990 and ensures that the offence has similar coverage to the domestic drug offences in the Criminal Code and to the original section 85W offence. The purpose of the amendments in this bill is to insert a further exception to the offence in section 85W for bodies, persons or their employees, or others providing services for and on their behalf, prescribed in regulations who arrange for the supply of medicines to remote locations for the purposes of, and in accordance with, a program prescribed in regulations. The amendment will enable prescribed persons and bodies to arrange for the provision of vital medicines to remote Australian communities, utilising the delivery of services of Australia Post in certain circumstances. As an aside, I think it is worth mentioning that next month a group of Australians will take part in the Royal Flying Doctor Service Outback Trek to help promote the hard work of the men and women of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The 12-day trip will leave from Melbourne and travel to Broome, across the Kimberley and on to Darwin. Those involved will see first hand the good work that the Royal Flying Doctor Service does each day right across Australia. The opposition wish them very well on their tour and we hope that it is a success. In conclusion, the medical chest provides what the Royal Flying Doctor Service describes as a ‘mini pharmacy’ to many remote locations throughout Australia. The medical chests undeniably provide an invaluable service and also provide enormous comfort to those living in remote locations. The coalition wholeheartedly support the good work of the Royal Flying Doctor Service and, therefore, we support the passage of this bill in order for it to continue its efforts. MAIN COMMITTEE I understand there were to be some other speakers in this debate, but they do not appear to be in the chamber. I will conclude by quoting the words of the Reverend John Flynn, whose proud work founded the Royal Flying Doctor Service: Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers; pray for powers equal to your tasks. On that note, I commend the bill to the House. (Royal Flying Doctor Service) Bill 2010. The explanatory memorandum points out what this bill is about. It amends section 85W of the Crimes Act 1914 to insert an exception to the offence of causing narcotic substances to be carried by post for Australia Post and the Royal Flying Doctor Service Australia and their officers, employees, agents and contractors. The exception will allow those organisations to arrange for the carriage of medicines by Australia Post for the purposes of enabling the RFDSA to administer its medical chest program. Section 85W provides for an offence of intentionally causing to carry by post an article that consists of, encloses or contains a prescribed narcotic substance within the meaning of the Customs Act 1901. The definition of ‘prescribed narcotic substance’ in the Customs Act was repealed by the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1990. Due to an oversight, the effect of that repeal on the operation of section 85W was not taken into account and the reference in section 85W was not updated. The bill amends section 85W to give effect, as closely as possible, to the original policy intention behind the offence in section 85W, when it was introduced, by referring to ‘controlled drugs’ and ‘controlled plants’ within the meaning of part 9.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. Because ‘carried by post’ is defined in section 85E to mean ‘carried by or through Australia Post’, the offence in section 85W applies uniquely to persons, including employees of Australia Post, who arrange for the delivery of certain pharmaceuticals through Australia Post. The RFDSA administers the RFDSA medical chest program, which provides a range of pharmaceutical items, including pain relief drugs such as pethidine and morphine, which enable emergency treatment to be given to people in rural and remote areas. The RFDSA and its agents supply and maintain approximately 2,600 medical chests across Australia, including those located in national parks, remote homesteads, pastoral stations, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, outback schools, mines and mining exploration sites. The pharmaceuticals. Until recently, medical chests were distributed utilising Australia Post. However, section 85W makes it an offence for Australia Post or the RFDSA to arrange for the distribution of pharmaceuticals containing prescribed narcotic substances. Delivery services in relation to certain pharmaceuticals ceased following the discovery in early 2010 that this practice contravenes section 85W of the Crimes Act. The government understands that there are no viable alternatives to Australia Post for supplying medicines for the RFDS medicine chest program. Australia Post is the only delivery provider servicing many remote locations; consequently, a number of medical chests in remote areas are depleted or carrying out-of-date stock. That is why the amendment is required. It will address the risk of emergency medicines not being available to treat serious illness or injury in rural and remote areas of Australia. The explanatory memorandum sufficiently outlines the purpose of this amendment bill. MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Crimes Amendment Royal Flying Doctor Service Bill 2010

Committee, but the minister has the call. my office, Minister Conroy’s office and Minister O’Connor’s office that led to this piece of legislation. I thank Minister O’Connor for putting it into the parliament. The Medical Chest Program to which the bill referred initially enables Royal Flying Doctor Service medical practitioners to provide people in rural and remote communities with vital medication, including pain relief for those requiring emergency evacuation. The program has operated since the 1930s and provides great comfort to those living in the outback. The amendments in this bill will enable Australia Post to resume its services in delivering the vital medicines contained in these medical chests by ensuring that these services do not fall within the scope of the offence of ‘causing narcotic substances to be carried by post’. The bill also makes a necessary amendment to the offence itself. The amendment will provide that the offence applies to the ‘controlled drugs’ and ‘controlled plants’ listed in part 9.1 of the Criminal Code rather than to ‘prescribed narcotic substances, within the meaning of the Customs Act 1901’. This amendment will correct an oversight that meant that the offence provision continued to refer to a definition that was repealed in 1990. It is designed to give effect, as closely as possible, to the original policy intention behind the offence in section 85W. I will move amendments to the bill which I will outline more comprehensively during the consideration in detail stage. These amendments will insert a further exception to the offence in section 85W for conduct engaged in by a prescribed person or body for the purposes of the prescribed program for the supply of medicines to remote communities.

198,Mr Pyne (Sturt) (7.03 Pm),"I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendmentindexation formula for some programs as recommended by the Bradley review into higher education, which was handed to the government in late 2008. Specifically, this bill seeks to replace the Safety Net Adjustment wage price index with the Professional, Scientific and Technical Services wage price index published by the Australian Statistician for all amounts subject to indexation under parts 5 to 6 of the act from 2012. The Safety Net Adjustment wage price index and its replacement makes up 75 per cent of the total index, with the remaining 25 per cent continuing to be the Consumer Price Index. The bill itself has no financial impact but its practical effect will be a more generous indexation rate applying to all grants under the act from 2012, resulting in an additional expenditure of more than $2.6 billion over five years. From next year, universities will receive additional funding corresponding to the increase in indexation on teaching and learning if they sign onto the Rudd government’s new performance indicators. The coalition is also committed to the principle of the continuation of indexation of university funding and, by implication, the current arrangements regarding indexation as they stand prior to this bill. After undertaking consultation with the higher education sector, we do understand that an indexation formula for student payments and research and teaching grants has been an area of concern. However, I do want to take the opportunity to note that we are not committed to any particular method of calculating indexation. While Professor Denise Bradley and her panel made 46 recommendations to the government on higher education, recommendation 27 is directly relevant to the bill: That the Australian Government maintain the future value of increased base funding for higher education by an indexation formula that is based on 90 per cent of the Labour Price Index (Professional) plus the Consumer Price Index with weightings of 75 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. This was to replace the present Safety Net Adjustment, the SNA, introduced in 1997, which comprises 75 percent of the current index. However, as the Labour Price Index (Professional) that was suggested in the Bradley review has ceased, I note that the government have elected to use the Professional, Scientific And Technical Services Labour Price Index, reduced by 10 per cent, and that the remaining 25 per cent of the index will continue to be the Consumer Price Index. A number of programs under the act gain from the changes to indexation, such as the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, the Capital Development Pool Program and the Australian Postgraduate Awards program. I would also like to mention that in her second reading speech the Minister for Education pointed to these programs, which are subject to the passage of future legislation. They would have these arrangements apply-namely, the student amenities HELP loan limit, which is subject to the passage of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009. While on this subject. I want to take the opportunity to reiterate that the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 has not yet been subject to passage, due to the coalition’s concerns with this legislation. It seeks to introduce compulsory fees, which would be charged to students for amenities at universities. The coalition was very proud in 2006 to remove the burden of compulsory student union fees from Australian students. The bottom line is that this was a tax on students for services that many students never used. Labor’s attempts to bring it back represent the breaking of a clear and unequivocal promise by the Labor Party before the 2007 election that they would not introduce a comMAIN COMMITTEE pulsory fee, and they ruled out a HECS style system to fund it. Former Labor education spokesperson Stephen Smith said: I’m not considering a compulsory HECS style arrangement and the whole basis of the approach is one of a voluntary approach. SoI am not contemplating a compulsory amenities fee. This is just another broken promise to add to Labor’s list of 47 broken promises, which the coalition continues to point out on a daily basis. This is not the only area of concern with regard to the government’s so-called higher education reform. While the adopted method of indexation in this bill has been welcomed by the sector, I note that higher education providers are disappointed by the Rudd government’s decision to reject the other recommendation that was made alongside recommendation No. 27that is, to increase the base funding rate of student places by 10 per cent. Following the handing down of the budget last year, Professor Simon Marginson of the University of Melbourne, said: ‘The budget dumped Bradley’s moderate 10 per cent increase in the funding rate of local student places. Funding for these places remains below cost. Institutions will have to maintain very large international enrolments to cross-subsidise domestic teaching.’ While the coalition, of course, supports the vital source of revenue that the international student market brings for universities, the comment by Professor Marginson is concerning because we believe there is one source of revenue which has been denied to universities by Labor-that is, the abolition of full-fee-paying places for Australian students. It is well known that the coalition is committed to bringing back full-fee-paying domestic places. We do not believe that the opportunities available to overseas students should be denied to those Australians who are willing to pay for their own education. Full-fee-paying places for domestic students were a strong and solid source of revenue for our universities. Their abolition has undoubtedly hurt a great many of our institutions at the worse time possible, particularly since transitional funding was not deemed adequate by some providers. The foolishness of the Minister for Education in abolishing domestic places became even more apparent after spikes in demand, and we have heard that at least some universities have been unable to accommodate that demand with the Commonwealth supported places only. While the coalition welcomed the Bradley review and many of the recommendations in it-including the recommendation that has translated into the reform in this bill-I want to take the opportunity to reflect on where we go from here. Unlike the government, we believe that the Bradley review is not merely a checklist. The reforms stemming from the Bradley review are not the end of ongoing debate and reform in the higher education sector but the beginning. In particular, we welcome the move towards the student demand driven system proposed by Bradley and endorsed by the government. It is a good start, but I believe there is much more scope for even greater flexibility and freedom for both students and the universities themselves. Of course, reform does not happen instantaneously. Education providers always need time to adjust to changes and they need support with transitional arrangements. Nevertheless, the coalition is pleased that Labor has undertaken reform to the indexation formula to improve the current arrangements and for this reason we support the legislation as drafted. (Indexation) Bill 2010 will amend section 198-20 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to provide greater clarity on indexation arrangements under part 5-6 of the act. The amendMAIN COMMITTEE",156,Higher Education Support Amendment Indexation Bill 2010
199,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (7.10 Pm),"The Higher Education Support Amendmentment will detail the formula and components of the formula. As a result of a recommendation by the review of Australian higher education, the indexation arrangements will replace the Safety Net Adjustment wage price index with the Professional, Scientific and Technical Services labour price index published by the Australian Statistician. This index is considered to better reflect wage price increases in the higher education sector. I would like to take the opportunity provided by this bill to talk about the need to invest and the benefits of investing in higher education. I particularly want to take that opportunity, having heard the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education, reiterate the opposition’s position in support of full fees for domestic students. The argument for this advanced by the coalition both when it was in government and now when it is in opposition is truly remarkable. In the first place it says, ‘Let’s bring overseas students here and we will charge them full fees for bringing them here,’ and, having done that, it asserts that domestic students should have the same rights. This is like saying that everybody should have the right to eat prison food. It is not an advantage to be charged full fees. It means that tertiary education-postsecondary education-becomes the preserve of those who are wealthy or fortunate enough to come from wealthy families and it sets up a two-tier education system. I think that is completely unsatisfactory and I absolutely support the action taken by this government to abolish full fees for domestic students. It also fails to recognise that education is an investment. It is not simply a private benefit to the person who receives the education; it is a public benefit because it helps to secure a skilled workforce which is better able to contribute to national productivity. My own view is that there is hardly anything more important than determining both our collective prospects as a nation and our personal prospects as individuals, our children’s prospects as individuals, than getting a good education. So it is a question of investment; it is not a question of saying, ‘We want to treat education as a fee for service and have everyone paying full fees, full tote odds,’ and essentially restricting tertiary education and the benefits of that to those who are well off. Regrettably, a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD, titled Education at a glance , back in the year 2005 singled out Australia as the one country which had been cutting back its public investment in higher education and training. The report found that from 1995 to 2002 public investment in education increased in most countries regardless of changes in private spending. The report said: In fact, many OECD countries with the highest growth in private spending have also shown the highest increase in public funding of education. And back in October 2005, Sophie Morris, from the Australian Financial Review, reported: The main exception to this is Australia, where the shift towards private expenditure at tertiary level has been accompanied by a fall in the level of public expenditure in real terms. I remember speaking with the chief executive officer at the Moreland Community Health Service, who was lamenting the need for more GPs and dentists. Of course, it is not just doctors and dentists; everywhere you look, we have been experiencing skills shortages. We discussed the way in which, following the privatisation of utilities in Victoria, workforce training levels have been inadequate. A lot of training in Victoria was carried out by the old government authorities-Melbourne Water, the old Board of Works, V/Line, the railways and various public instrumentalities, gas and fuel, the SEC, the Forests Commission and the MAIN COMMITTEE like. They did a lot of work by way of workforce training and building skills. But, following privatisation of those utilities, neither governments nor private employers did enough to meet the need for a trained workforce, leading to competition for workers and skill shortages across a whole range of areas in the workforce. That kind of anecdotal concern that you hear from people in places like community health services who are familiar with these things was backed up by more detailed research carried out by Monash University’s Centre for Urban and Population Research. There is an article by Bob Birrell, Daniel Edwards, Ian Dobson and Fred Smith titled ‘The myth of too many university students’ published in People and Place. It outlines that after the coalition came to power in 1996 the number of domestic students in Australian universities at the undergraduate level hardly increased at all. All of the increase in professional training at the undergraduate level in Australian universities came via overseas students. In the years after the Howard government came to power in 1996, domestic undergraduate commencements increased from 132,000 to 135,000-that is a bare two per cent increase. Essentially, those domestic undergraduate enrolments flatlined. During that same period undergraduate commencements by overseas students in Australian universities increased by 20,000 from 16,000 full-time equivalent students in 1996 to 36,000 by 2003. That is a 125 per cent increase. To underscore the difference in the pattern of domestic commencements, the proportion of the total student population reflected by overseas students doubled during this period. Back in 1996 it was 10.8 per cent of the student population; by 2008 it was 20.7 per cent-essentially a doubling, a massive increase during that period of time. All the growth in higher education in this country was in overseas student places. There was nothing for domestic students. Yet there is a massive demand for university trained people in the Australian workforce. The modern economy has an insatiable appetite for professionally trained people. The unemployment rate in 2009 in Australia for people with higher education qualifications was significantly lower than for those without such qualifications. In particular, the difference in unemployment rates between those with and those without higher education qualifications was greatest amongst those recently graduated from university-that is to say the 25to 34-year-old age group. Only three per cent of people with qualifications are unemployed compared to seven per cent of those without qualifications. Furthermore, people whose highest level of educational attainment was a bachelor degree had mean weekly earnings-if you go back to 2005-of $1,049. This rose to $1,434 for people with a postgraduate degree. By contrast, people whose highest level of educational attainment was year 12 had mean weekly earnings of $631-that is around 40 per cent less than those with a degree. Clearly, having the tertiary qualification is a real advantage. It is an advantage both in finding work and in finding better paid work. Given this, it is perfectly understandable that parents wish their children to have access to university training with the likelihood of a well-paid job to follow. Naturally, the capping of the number of university places in the face of high demand for entry has led to increasing competition for these places. During the period I am talking about it coincided with a six per cent increase in the number of secondary-school-age children going to independent fee-paying schools. Between 1997 and 2004, enrolments in Australian independent secondary schools rose by nearly 50,000 students, or 27 per cent, and enrolments in Catholic schools rose by 28,000 students, or 10 per cent. In comparison, govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment secondary schools gained slightly more than 8,000 students, an increase of less than one per cent. As the concern about skill shortages mounted, employers expressed alarm at what this meant for their enterprises. Their concerns prompted the Howard government to increase the skilled migration program and in particular to encourage overseas students to stay on in Australia as migrants after the completion of their courses. Immigration may be a short-term way of dealing with this, but it comes at the expense of the opportunity for many young Australians to improve their economic situation through the acquisition of a university degree. There are plenty of young Australians who wish to achieve this; unfortunately the places are simply not available to them. The truth is that there has been too little domestic training at university level, not too much, and the number of government subsidised HELP places should have been rising in line with demand in the professional employment pattern. This is sensible both from the point of view of employers and from the point of view of increasing opportunity for Australia’s young people. Despite overwhelming evidence that a knowledge based economy requires an increase in professional level training, Australia is one of the few Western countries where participation rates in higher education for domestic students have fallen in recent years. Bob Birrell, John Sheridan and Virginia Rapson have done work on the particular failure to expand domestic training levels of professional engineers, despite severe shortages having been evident in Australia for some time. They note that domestic undergraduate commencements fell between 2001 and 2004, from over 177,000 to 165,000, and that domestic undergraduate commencements in 2004 were similar to the levels in 1995. Engineering domestic undergraduate commencements peaked in 1997 at 11½ thousand. By 2004 they had fallen to 10,700. So the only growth in engineering training at Australian universities has been due to growth in the number of overseas student enrolments. We should not be outsourcing our skills needs, we should not be selling out our young people; we should be investing in the training of our young people. I note that HELP is a very large financial burden on young people and acts as a deterrent to them obtaining tertiary qualifications and skills. When HECS, now known as HELP, was originally introduced by the federal Labor government in the 1980s, it was said that it would generate money for more tertiary places and that it was reasonable for people who had profited from their higher education to put something back. I think that had merit in theory. But whatever the merits of the theory, in practice it has not worked out quite that way. The Howard government substantially reduced the income threshold at which HECS cut in so that, instead of it being about affluent professionals giving something back, it has become a burden for quite modest income earners and a yoke around the necks of young students. The contribution made by government assisted students to their university education increased between 1996 and 2005 from 20 per cent to 37 per cent. Nor was this a question of the government switching resources from tertiary education to trades training. Between 1997 and 2006, the Commonwealth contribution to vocational education and training costs declined by 20.5 per cent and, between 1997 and 2008, government spending per hour on public vocational education and training declined by 22 per cent. The shadow minister referred to the Bradley review of Australian higher education. The Labor government’s Bradley review of Australian higher education was an important step MAIN COMMITTEE forward in identifying issues in this sector. It acknowledged that most job growth would be in occupations requiring university degrees and it set a target to increase the share of Australians with university degrees, and that is very welcome. In the 2009-10 federal budget the government announced major reforms to higher education. The government accepted the Bradley review’s recommendation to introduce an uncapped student demand driven systemsometimes called a voucher system-for the funding of university undergraduate places from 2012. This is a major policy change to the allocation and funding of student places, which to date have been funded through agreements with universities on a set of capped number of places. The Bradley review said we could achieve a ‘demand driven entitlement system for domestic higher education students’ where public funding will be provided for each undergraduate student eligible for a university place at a cost of $1,130 million over four years. The budget papers have allowed $491 million from 2009-10 to 2012-13 towards this objective, and I believe that this will be money well spent. From 2010 universities will be allowed to over-enrol student places by 10 per cent in anticipation of the introduction of the new student demand driven funding in 2012. I note that the Executive Director of the Australian Technology Network of Universities, Vicki Thomson-no relation, as far as I am aware-said in a recent article in the Australian: We have a recent study which irrefutably lays out the impact of this sector on the economy in terms of lower health costs, increased productivity and increased living standards … We are an intrinsic part of the economic and social fabric of the Australian landscape. The KPMG Econtech report Economic modelling of improved funding and reform arrangements for Australian universities of April 2010 estimates that increase in GDP from higher education reform, a combination of funding increase and structural change, would commence with an increase of $13 billion in 2014, rising to $36 billion by 2020 and $163 billion by 2040. That is a very substantial GDP increase. Other significant findings from the report include that the increase in public funding and structural reform will ensure that the government’s target of 40 per cent of 25to 34-year-olds having degrees by 2025 can be met, and there are 44,000 more graduates annually projected by 2025. If the funding of vocational education and training is also expanded by the same proportion as for universities, the education revolution at tertiary level, covering both higher education and vocational education, can deliver as much as an eight per cent increase in GDP, spread across Australia, at a public funding cost of just 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2040. The spread of Australia’s universities means that higher education funding directly assists inner and outer metropolitan areas and regional Australia. Graduates go on to work across Australia, bringing their knowledge and skills to all communities, as teachers, engineers, nurses, agricultural scientists and other professionals and managers. The innovative research of universities also adds substantially to the widespread national gain, delivering a 25 per cent plus rate of return on public funding. Universities demonstrably deliver on each of skills, productivity, exports, innovation, workforce participation and tax revenue growth across Australia. It would certainly be better if all young Australians who are presently missing out on a place at a university or TAFE were given a place. In 2009, 18½ thousand eligible applicants missed out on a university place. Professor Bob Birrell has said that the real number of stuMAIN COMMITTEE dents missing out may be much larger. He says that eligible applications amount to 227,000, compared with actual acceptances of 161,000-a difference of 66,000. The proportion of resident young people enrolled in higher education in Australia is relatively low by European standards. This reflects the period since 1996 when there has been very little increase in the number of domestic subsidised places. In conclusion, I welcome the government’s initiatives to address the lack of investment in the tertiary sector and to address what has been, I believe, a short-sighted reliance on overseas students and what is referred to as ‘skilled migration’. We should train our own young people. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (7.28 pm)-I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Indexation) Bill 2010. This bill seeks to replace the safety net adjustment wage price index with the professional, scientific and technical services wage index published by the Australian Statistician for all amounts subject to indexation under part 5-6 of the act, from 2012. The safety net adjustment wage price index and its replacement make up 75 per cent of the total index, with the remaining 25 per cent continuing to be the CPI. Revising the indexation arrangements under part 5-6 of the Higher Education Support Act forms part of the Labor government’s acceptance of the recommendations arising from the Bradley review of higher education. The Bradley review recommended that the government maintain the future value of increased base funding for higher education by an indexation formula that is based on 90 per cent of the labour price index, professional, plus the CPI with weightings of 75 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. The new index is considered to reflect the impact of inflation on the higher education sector. The practical effect of this legislation will be a more generous indexation rate applying to all grants under the act from 2012, which will result in an additional expenditure of more than $2.6 billion over five years, according to the minister’s media release dated 12 May 2010. The coalition, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz, is committed to the principle of the continuation of indexation of university funding and, by implication, the current arrangements regarding indexation as they stand prior to this bill. But I rise tonight to speak on this higher education bill, as I believe it is vital that people of all ages have access to lifetime learning opportunities, education and training programs-and particularly so in my electorate of Forrest. I am committed to supporting improved opportunities, equity of access to tertiary education and student retention in the south-west of WA. It is ironic that this bill is about higher education when, since the May 2009 budget, students, parents and families have been and still are in continuous contact with me regarding the Labor government’s changes to youth allowance, which have affected and are affecting great young people from my electorate and their educational opportunities. While the coalition was able to achieve some concessions for gap-year students, the Labor government’s ‘inner regional’ classification for the majority of south-west students means that many young people who have no choice but to move to access tertiary education outside the south-west have additional significant financial barriers-anything from $15,000 to $20,000 to $30,000 a year-to doing so, and some will not be able to afford to do so. These Labor government changes to youth allowance have hit south-west students particularly hard. Some families in my electorate have stated that they have no choice but to relocate their whole family closer to tertiary education facilities-a major loss to the whole south-west region. Others have said they are now forced to choose which one of their children will be MAIN COMMITTEE able to gain a tertiary education, because they cannot afford for more than one child in the family to be able to do so. That simply is not right. Students from the south-west who need to relocate for tertiary education deserve better. This is, unfortunately, just another example of the Labor government neglecting regional and rural communities. My most recent email is from a young student in Busselton, Sarah-Jane, who is desperately seeking some form of financial support for her higher education. Her email read: I am a year 12 student at Busselton Senior High School. Next year my goal is to attend Notre Dame University and study a Bachelor of Arts, double major in Journalism and Mass Communications. However the costs of the course and moving to Perth are well beyond what I can currently afford and this course is not offered at ECU in Bunbury or Curtin in Margaret River, I believe. I was wondering if you could give me some advice on who to contact … That was in relation to, perhaps, scholarships or sponsorships to help university students. As many in this House would know, many regional and rural representatives have repeatedly made representations to the minister directly and here in this House on behalf of students in our electorates. I acknowledge the other coalition members and the shadow minister in this House, who have worked so hard since the 2009 budget to represent these same regional and rural students. I acknowledge the efforts of the member for Kalgoorlie, the member for O’Connor, the member for Hume and the member for Murray. We have had a range of members working tirelessly, as have our constituents. These constituents have also worked tirelessly, writing emails and letters and signing petitions. Without them, we would not have seen any of the concessions at all on what was seriously flawed youth allowance legislation, and thousands of gap-year students would have missed out on youth allowance and possibly the chance to access a tertiary education. And this attack on the educational opportunities of south-west students comes at the same time that the government has spent $16 billion on school halls and buildings in a program that has typified waste, mismanagement, schools not actually getting the facilities they need and taxpayers not getting value for their money. We have seen $1.7 billion wasted in this program, with $7.3 million just for plaques and display signs. I would like to offer some of that to Sarah-Jane, who needs assistance to achieve her education. I have reports of serious overengineering in the program-the use of stainless steel roofing instead of Colorbond in inland areas, which I am told adds at least 40 per cent in additional cost to taxpayers, while at the same time students in my area, the south-west, and in other parts of regional Australia are struggling to meet the additional work requirements of the ‘inner regional’ definition for youth allowance. I had an email from another parent who contacted me, and she said: My daughter is currently undertaking a gap year. She is hoping to commence university studies in 2011 if she can get some form of financial support as in the form of Youth allowance. She contacted Centrelink last week and she was told that she had to work an average of 30 hours per week for 18 months before she could qualify as an independent student for youth allowance. She was told that the opportunity to qualify as an outer regional student … does not commence until July 1st this year, which would mean that she cannot begin university until 2012. It is impossible to work 30 hours per week for 18 months as an unskilled seasonal worker. This is the very issue that I have been taking up with the minister over and over again. As those of us who live and work in regional areas know, it is so difficult and sometimes absoMAIN COMMITTEE lutely impossible for young people from very small communities to find that 30 hours of work a week for 18 months. It is just not possible. The mother went on to say: Last year the students in regional areas were able to qualify under the existing arrangements, having to earn a minimum amount of money. This year it seems that the gap students literally fall in a gap. Why is the opportunity to qualify for youth allowance for rural students made harder? Without youth allowance we cannot support her and her 2 brothers who are already at university. The arrangements for rural students accessing higher education is a disgrace. This is what is going on in my electorate. This is not an isolated email or an isolated story. I forwarded these stories and the emails on to the minister, asking her to respond directly to these families and these students. They do not have the option of being able to access higher education or a tertiary qualification in their field in the south-west area. There is no choice: they have to move. It is going to cost them more, and they have been defined as ‘inner regional’. To qualify for the independent rate of youth allowance, they have to work 30 hours a week for 18 months. How do I explain to these parents that their children’s education is less important to the Labor government than the tragic and failed Home Insulation Program, which is costing them as Australian taxpayers $1 billion to repair because of the government’s incompetence with the program? This type of waste and mismanagement has also cost my local occasional childcare centres. We talk about education right through to the tertiary level. We have some occasional childcare centres, as well as the childcare centres in the wheat belt areas of Western Australia, as you would know. The Labor government has cut their funding, and it has come as a huge blow to the many rural and regional centres that simply do not have the numbers to sustain their centres on a full-time basis. This is again a lack of understanding of how rural and regional areas work. Here we have groups of young mums who do not simply sit back and expect a handout from the government; they are actually taking responsibility for their community based centres. They fundraise, they manage their centres and the finances and they take a direct handson role in their children’s day care. What a great way to go. But they cannot afford the increased fees caused by the loss of the federal funding, yet the government has withdrawn its 52 per cent funding share in WA. It is a total of $420,000 from the 28 centres in regional and rural areas. These centres have operated for almost 20 years in my electorate. One of these centres has provided sustainable, affordable and necessary day care for years. A number of these mums also have home-based businesses. They need this child care to be able to go about their home-based business. It is just another example, like the changes to youth allowance, that clearly shows that this government simply does not understand, or is not willing to understand, regional and rural communities and their issues, but is equally prepared to waste and mismanage taxpayers’ funds on insulation, on school buildings and, according to Senate estimates, on the approximately $82,000 it costs for every asylum seeker. Another promise that was made by Labor ahead of the election was to end the double dropoff for parents by building an additional 260 childcare centres across the country, to enable working mums and dads to make a single drop-off of their children at the school and childcare centre at the same time. But this has also been axed. Apparently the market has changed radically in two years, so the childcare centres are no longer needed. In a continuation of what was promoted as an education revolution, the computers in schools program has only delivered 26 per cent, or 1,472, of the 5,660 computers promised to the south-west of WA. They MAIN COMMITTEE should have already been delivered. It is well behind the national distribution average of 33 per cent and is yet another example of the government’s neglect of regional and rural Australia. As a result of Labor’s addiction to spending over the past three years, Australia will have a $57 billion deficit after July this year. The Labor government is borrowing $700 million a week-a hundred million dollars every day-for the next two years to fund this gross economic mismanagement, yet our students in rural and regional areas are still missing out. The Labor government has a history of poor economic management, and we also know that the coalition government paid off $96 billion of Labor debt over our last period in government. In conclusion, the coalition is committed to education and to equity of access to tertiary education for rural and regional students, students who have no choice but to relocate to study. We are committed to a fund to assist regional students to stay in school until the end of year 12, focusing on information technology and attracting and retaining quality teachers in regional schools. We also believe very strongly that school principals and school councils should be able to lead and be accountable in managing their funding responsibility. We are committed to capital investment in regional universities and to providing innovative solutions for country students. Ms HALL (Shortland) (7.42 pm)-I will commence my contribution to this debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Indexation) Bill 2010 by highlighting and concentrating on some of the issues raised by the previous speaker, as opposed to talking about the legislation. I feel it is only right that I should be given the opportunity to pick up on a few of those little points made by the member for Forrest. The member for Forrest spoke at great length about youth allowancelouder than my contribution to this debate, Member for Kalgoorlie. Your manners do not do you any credit. As I was saying, the changes to the youth allowance have had a very positive impact on people that I represent in this parliament. I also come from a regional area and I come from an area where most of the families are lowto middle-income families. The children of people on very low incomes were being prevented from accessing youth allowance under the previous scheme. Many more students are now able to access the youth allowance. In one case, I was contacted by a student whose parents earn around $105,000 per year. This particular student had moved to Sydney to undertake her university education. Under the previous scheme, she had been unable to access the youth allowance. With the changes that have been passed through this parliament, because she was one of a few children in that family attending university, she is now able to access youth allowance. That is a real benefit to this family. Even though they are a two-income family, their total income is not a considerable amount when you consider that both parents are on middle incomes. Their income is in that middle-income range. The previous speaker raised the issue of school buildings. I would have to say that principals and school communities within Shortland electorate have embraced the fact that the government has given them money for much-needed capital expenditure on their schools. There was one school in particular that I visited early in 2008. In that school, the president of the MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Higher Education Support Amendment Indexation Bill 2010
200,Mr Haase,You are such a bore.,166,Higher Education Support Amendment Indexation Bill 2010
201,Ms Hall,"I am sorry to keep you awake. I have only just started, but your yawning isP&C and the principal took me to the rooms and said, ‘Look at this paint peeling off the walls and this mildewed carpet-an absolute disgrace,’ and they told me that children were supposed to learn in those buildings. In fact, the principal undertook some painting and spruced those buildings up a little on his own. The week before last I visited that school. New school classrooms are being built. There is such excitement and vibrancy within the school. The school community and the P&C were there. They were excited, they were delighted and they were thrilled that the government had actually invested money in their school by providing the buildings that they had needed for a very, very long time. I must add that on that school building site there was also an apprentice who was employed under the Rudd government’s Apprentice Kickstart program. So not only do you have buildings being built in that school, creating employment and giving new classrooms to the students of that area, but you also have apprentices training. To some extent, the legislation we have before us today is about training and the development of skills for the future. The previous speaker also mentioned asylum seekers. I just refer her to the cost of the Pacific solution. I think that when she looks at that she might be very quiet about the cost. On computers in schools: as I have already mentioned, students in Shortland electorate tend to come from lowto middle-income families. Without those computers in schools and access to computers, they were disadvantaged-but the member for Forrest does not like to acknowledge that. She talks about poor economic management. Just for the record, Australia’s performance in the global financial crisis was second to none. Australia came through that better than any other country. Talking about equity and access to education, nothing could be more important than tradetraining centres. The opposition say that if they are elected they are going to get rid of tradetraining centres. In Shortland electorate, those trade-training centres have been placed in a variety of schools so that students, no matter where they live, can access that training. The actions that have been taken by the Rudd government in relation to education, youth allowance and all matters that relate to students have really been driven by the needs of those students, the needs of the school communities and the needs of the community as a whole when it comes to Building the Education Revolution. And it is delivering for the students within the schools, within the vocational education sector and also within the higher education sector. I refer to the legislation that we have before us-and I note that the parliamentary secretary has arrived-because, unlike the previous speaker, I actually want to touch on some of the issues in it. It is important to note that the Higher Education Support Amendment (Indexation) Bill 2010 comes from the recommendations of a review of the Australian higher education system, the Bradley review, and the indexation arrangements that will replace the Safety Net Adjustment wage price index with the Professional, Scientific and Technical Services wage price index published by the Australian Statistician. This index better reflects wage price increases in the higher education sector. For many years, the higher education sector were saying that they were being severely disadvantaged by the funding mechanism used by the previous government. There was a review of the pricing mechanism under the Howard government-I think that was in 2005-and the Howard government chose to do nothing and the index remained unchanged. MAIN COMMITTEE It is really important that we ask ourselves: why is it important that we properly fund our universities? First and foremost, it means that students can attend a university and get the education and develop the skills that they need to obtain jobs in the 21st century. It also means that students qualifying at Australian universities are competitive with students qualifying at universities throughout the world, and it puts Australia at the cutting edge of education. It is vitally important that we be a nation that is highly skilled, has a high level of knowledge and is at the cutting edge of the latest technology and research. This brings me to the second reason why we need to fund our universities properly-that is, so that we can undertake the research that is needed within universities. Universities are places of research. They are at the cutting edge of technologies and procedures that are needed going into the 21st century, and if our universities are not funded properly then Australia will fall behind other countries in relation to research. This legislation is the government’s response, and it does support the majority of the Bradley review’s recommendations. I might add that it has been widely welcomed by universities and the sector is pleased to see a commitment by government to improve the rate. The university sector had for so long been used to a government that ignored their needs, one that did not listen to them, that constantly pegged the level of financial assistance they got and did not use the proper indexation mechanism but an outdated one that they had introduced in 1997. It is no surprise that the sector would welcome the mechanism being put in place in the legislation that we have before us tonight. I commend the bill to the House and welcome the changes that it will put in place. members who have participated in this debate. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Indexation) Bill 2010 gives effect to the government’s commitment to improve indexation arrangements for the higher education sector. These amendments will enable institutions to keep pace with increases in costs and, by including these amendments in legislation, institutions will have a degree of certainty around future funding increases, with the resulting improved planning benefits. The existing indexation arrangements have remained unchanged for more than a decade and do not properly reflect the increased costs that are particular to the sector. The current minimum wage based arrangements for the salary component of the overall indexation formula will be replaced with a professional scientific and technical services index that better reflects the professional salary movements. The minister’s department has estimated that the new index will deliver $2.6 billion in additional funding to the sector in the period 2011 through to 2015. Clearly this is a significant step in the government’s commitment to driving reform back via sustainable funding for the long term. I urge members to support the legislation and I commend it to the House. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Higher Education Support Amendment Indexation Bill 2010
202,Mr Clare (Blaxland,"Parliamentary Secretary for Employment) (7.54 pm)-I thank theSecond Reading Debate resumed from 25 May, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time. tracts Amendment Bill 2010 for a range of reasons. One is obviously because I think insurance contracts are a very important part of our legal and financial framework in this country and also because I chair the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services and it is something that comes under our purview from time to time. The provision of financial services are always of interest to the committee-and no less this bill. At the outset I would like to congratulate the minister responsible for these amendments, the Hon Chris Bowen, who is the Minister for Human Services and also the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, for his ongoing good work in this area. This bill will give effect to a number of recommendations of the review panel that was appointed to review the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. While those changes are largely technical in nature-as are many of these types of amendment bills-they are also very important because they bring about necessary change and updating of important legislation to make sure that government responds to market condition change. They also make sure that the legislation and regulations that we have keep pace with consumer markets and developments in judicial areas since the enactment of the original bills, which often and regularly become out of date depending on change conditions. This bill will streamline a number of requirements and address some anomalies in the regulatory framework, which will be of benefit to not only consumers but to insurers as well. I know that Deputy Speaker Scott would agree with me in how important it is to get the balance right between the consumer protection regime that we have in this country and the services provided by insurers in this area. These measures have been subject to a range of consultations. In some areas the review panel’s recommendations have also been modified to take account of those issues raised in those consultations, which is part and parcel of the work that this government has always been committed to. In the approach we have taken to financial services reform right across the board, we consult and make sure that the amendments and changes that we make to regulation are in line with what is required by the sector, in line with what consumers need and in line with what is best practice. The government really does make amendments in view of the most appropriate regulations that you can bring forward, rather than just more regulation. Regulation, compliance and the red-tape burdens that exist are issues for small business and for business more generally. When the Rudd Labor government came to office in 2007, it made a commitment to reduce that compliance cost burden on small business, on insurers and on a whole raft of people in business, because we understand just how important that is. It is important to those businesses because it means they can provide their services under better, more cost-effective arrangements. What it means for consumers is that they can get better value. SoI am very pleased to support these changes. The Insurance Contracts Act 1984 is the primary source of regulation for the relationship that exists between insurers and those that are insured. It regulates matters such as the duty of MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Higher Education Support Amendment Indexation Bill 2010
203,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (7.56 Pm),"It is a pleasure for me to speak on the Insurance Condisclosure of those who are insured, the duty of utmost good faith and remedies for nondisclosure and for misrepresentation. The overall intention of the act is to strike a fair balance between the interests of insurers, those insured and other members of the public. That is the right approach and the right outcome, and I congratulate the review panel for getting to that position and making sure that the balance is right, which is appreciated by everyone in that sector. This bill gives effect to a number of recommendations that flowed out of the review of the Insurance Contracts Act, which commenced under the previous government. When good work and reviews have been done, regardless of when they began, the important role that this government has to play is to ensure that process continues and we take action and do something about those outcomes. I am also very pleased to say that the review panel did not find any major shortcomings in the way that the act operates, but it did recommend a number of changes to take account of market developments, of changes in the way things are done and of judicial interpretation since the original enactment of the act. It is good that is the case and we can follow through on those, but it is also heartening to know that no major problems were found with the way that the act operates. The changes that we are putting forward in this amendment bill are largely technical in nature. They do not make any wholesale changes to the act itself. Nevertheless, they do offer improvements that will enable the act to work more efficiently and productively and to provide better outcomes for insurers and the insured. It will correct a number of anomalies that exist, and correcting those anomalies will benefit insurers and the general public as well. It is a great outcome for both sides. Insurers were particularly keen on reform and some changes in this area. They were particularly keen to see that the bill progressed, because it will remove a number of legal impediments that would otherwise exist in dealing with customers in online systems. We need to appreciate in this place that technology does not stand still. We are often a little bit slow to act at a parliamentary level in terms of technological change, but we need to act swiftly when that change has either a judicial bearing or a bearing on efficiency in a particular sector. This amendment bill makes sure that regulation keeps up with technological change. Many people are now doing business directly online, and we need to make sure that legislation keeps up with that. It is important to say-and I have mentioned it a couple of times already, but I want to say it again-that extensive consultation did occur. It is important that happens. You need to get these things right and make sure that the right people are at the table. It is part and parcel of the methodologies that we have applied when working in this particular area. It occurred over a number of years with a whole range of people from industry. It also occurred with a range of consumer groups. In some of those cases, that consultation process did actually have a bearing on the final outcome and resulted in some change, so the efforts of those consultations were not in vain and had a positive input. Not all the consultation results in everybody getting their own way, but it certainly does provide that essential guidance for government to make sure that policy is right and that any change is actually for the better. There are a number of key amendments in the bill that clarify the types of contracts that are exempt from the act’s operation. The bill also frees up the use of electronic communication to make sure that the legislation is in line with technology and with the way that people commuMAIN COMMITTEE nicate and sign up to contracts. The bill also makes duty of disclosure easier for consumers to understand. That has been an important part of a whole range of work that my committee has done in terms of transparency and disclosure. Transparency and disclosure are not the same thing and people often confuse them. Disclosure does not always give you the full picture. You can disclose everything that needs to be disclosed in a document that is 100 pages long but still make it completely non-transparent. No-one can understand it, no-one reads it and noone actually gets any benefit from the disclosure. Transparency is completely different. It is about ensuring that people know, understand and see what they need to know in contracts. A lot of work is being done by this government and also by the Financial Services Working Group to ensure that transparency takes place in contracts, in financial services contracts, in advice and in insurance so that people understand what is being presented to them and so that it is fairly represented. There is a lot of work being done, and hopefully very soon we will have some outcomes in terms of short-form disclosure and transparency. Instead of people getting an 80-page statement of advice or an 80-page disclosure statement and a policy document and a range of other documents, which may total in the hundreds of pages, they might just get four simple pages which outline what they need to know about the contract they are signing or the advice they are being given. It might be attached to or on top of all the other documents, but at least they will have that regulated, compliant, short-form, plain English type advice, which is a real step forward. Short-form advice means that people will actually have a better understanding of what is in front of them. It also means that the people who produce and provide those documents to consumers have understood them and have read the most important parts. I commend the groups involved and the review committee for doing that, because easy disclosure for consumers, especially at the renewal of household and domestic insurance contracts, is very important. I am sure anyone who reads their insurance contracts would understand just how complex some of them are-even to find out a very simple thing, such as whether something is insured or not insured, is difficult. It is important that people understand the basic things. We are also making sure, through the amendments in the bill, that remedies in respect of life insurance contracts are more flexible and suited to modern life-insurance products, because they do change over time and we need to reflect those changes. We are also clarifying the rights and obligations of persons named in contracts as to who has benefit of cover, particularly for parties who are not mentioned in those contracts but can be a party to those contracts. It is important to clarify that information. The point of dispute is often about who is covered if they are not named in the contract. It may be households, families and a range of other people. An area that is of particular interest to me and many other members in this place is that of unfair contract terms. It is quite easy for unscrupulous operators to throw in a contract termfor example, ‘Term heading 128, subsection (b) of part F’-which has some outrageous arrangement that nobody would ever find, understand or otherwise know even existed and which, of course, removes the obligation of the insurer to provide any insurance at some particular point in time. We are dealing with this. It is not an easy matter, because insurance contracts and other contracts are complex instruments and need to be dealt with properly in legal terms. It is not one of the issues that are covered in this bill. It is the subject of a current carve-out under the Insurance Contracts Act for insurance contracts and under the unfair conMAIN COMMITTEE tracts terms provisions of other laws, including those that are included in the forthcoming reforms regarding unfair contract terms in consumer contracts generally. This makes a number of people unhappy, and I can understand that. Let me give them some joy tonight by saying that the intention of the carve-out is to ensure that the Insurance Contracts Act framework is the primary source of regulation of insurance contract issues and matters. It is not complicated by being tied up with other legislation, because that can cause some very difficult legal problems. We have ensured that there is absolute clarity about where that legislation exists. In the context of this debate and on the generic unfair contracts terms bill last year consumer groups did express some disappointment. I can understand that. They were disappointed that insurance contracts remain under that carve-out, but we are not leaving it at that. We have recommended that there be further consideration of this specifically in terms of insurance contracts. Whether the carve-out for insurance contracts should be removed or retained is a matter of some controversy. It involves some quite complex legal issues, which we are dealing with, regarding the interaction between different rules and laws. The government is dealing with this issue separately through a separate consultation paper, which will provide various options. That is the proper way we should move on these very complex issues. That will be released soon. That offers a more appropriate mechanism to deal with the issue of extending unfair contract terms provisions to insurance contracts rather than just having them wound up in associated matters with other legal bills. Insurance is very important. While I do not have hard data on this, I know it is the view of many people that, generally speaking, the Australian public are underinsured. Right across the board-be it life, risk, household, car or income protection insurance-there is a general view that we are underinsured. This is a serious matter because, when tragedy does befall, somebody needs to pick up the bill and somebody needs to step in and assist. It most often is the government through a range of departments or mechanisms that are available. At other times nobody really steps in, perhaps apart from charities. We saw a perfect example not so long ago with the tragedy of the Victorian bushfires. Very tragically not only was there a massive loss of life, property and goods-people’s homes were lost-but so many people were not insured at all. They lost absolutely everything. Insurance companies try to deal with and manage that fallout. It is really complex. Some people were underinsured. Of course, the tragedy of losing a loved one is further compounded if that loved one happens to be the major breadwinner for the family. Insurance is a strange product in a lot of ways because you do not really need it until you really do, and that is when its importance really comes home for people. I have always believed in insurance. I have always believed that it is better to have a bit of protection and take some risk rather than take all of the risk and hope and pray that nothing ever happens to you. Not everybody though can afford insurance. Insurance can be expensive. There are a range of state taxes, levies and stamp duties that apply that make insurance quite expensive. From the Commonwealth perspective we need to look at all the different issues around insurance and at what we can do to make it as affordable and accessible to people as possible to encourage people to take on board insurance, certainly at the minimum levels. MAIN COMMITTEE A perfect example is the compulsory third-party insurance that everyone must have with their vehicle registration. It is compulsory, firstly, because it is absolutely necessary and, secondly, because if it were not compulsory there would be a massive number of people who would not be insured at all. The burden of that on the rest of the community and on the taxpayer would be enormous. I think these matters are exceptionally important. There is a range of work being done in these areas. I know that the parliamentary secretary for disabilities is doing extensive work and research into the potential of a national disability insurance scheme. There is work being done in other areas to look at how we can best regulate the insurance sector and also make sure it is more affordable and accessible to all Australians. It really is an important part of Australian society. The Rudd government takes this area very seriously and certainly the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services also takes this area very seriously. It is worth noting at this point that when we did the inquiry, which is affectionately known as the Storm inquiry, and looked at a range of other things about fees and commissions, financial services and products, we specifically excluded superannuation, which is being done by Jeremy Cooper in a more extensive manner, and we also excluded insurance in terms of fees and commissions. That is not to say we are not dealing with those things. We excluded them for that particular inquiry and recommendations. The minister has made a number of comments about turning back to those issues at some later time. I am certainly of that same view because I do take them very seriously. They are very important issues and need a very specific focus in terms of any further regulatory change in the future. This bill is a very important bill. It covers off on a range of mostly technical amendments and was the subject of some very sound consultation over a number of years. It finishes off some work that was started by the previous government. I commend the bill to the House. Ms HALL (Shortland) (8.16 pm)-I would firstly like to congratulate the member for Oxley on his fine contribution to this debate on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2010 and the fine work that he has done on his Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The report that he brought down in that area on fees and commissions was an outstanding report and members on both side of this parliament would have had very positive feedback about that report. Without a doubt it is one of the key reports that have been brought down by any committee within this parliament. I commend the member for Oxley on the fine work he has done in that area. His knowledge was very apparent in his contribution to this debate tonight. He made some very good points about people being underinsured, and the impact that that has. He referred to the bushfires in Victoria, which were a prime example of the effect that being underinsured has on people. Within my own area in the Hunter, the earthquake in 1988 was another example of people being underinsured; it really impacted on the people of that region. The issues that he raised about making sure insurance is affordable and accessible are very relevant. I do not think there would be a member of this parliament who does not believe we should do everything in our power to encourage our constituents to take out insurance, and in taking out insurance make sure the insurance they get covers them. The bill before us gives effect to a number of recommendations of a review panel appointed to review the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. The changes are largely technical in nature and respond to market developments and judicial decisions since its enactment. The bill MAIN COMMITTEE will streamline requirements and address anomalies in the regulatory framework for the benefit of insurers and consumers. The measures have been subject to stakeholder consultation and in some areas the review panel recommendations have been modified to take account of issues that have been raised in these consultations. At this point I should state that the initial consultation on and development of the legislation were undertaken by the previous government. This is one of the areas where I think they looked at an issue in good spirit and good faith. As a result, we have the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill before us tonight, which arose out of recommendations from the review I have mentioned of the Insurance Contracts Act. That was an act of 1984-26 years ago-so the review was long overdue. It shows that we must keep our legislation updated. We need to revisit legislation and amend it to make it relevant to today. This act needs to be made consistent with the laws and applications of the 21st century. That is exactly what this legislation before us tonight does. The review was conducted by a panel that comprised Alan Cameron AM, a very respected man, and Ms Nancy Milne. The final report was publicly released in 2005, so in the years from 2005 to 2010 we have had consultation taking place. The review panel’s main conclusion was that the act was generally working satisfactorily to the benefit of the insurers and the insured. However, the panel found that some changes would be beneficial given the passage of time. I have highlighted that that passage of time is 26 years since the act was enacted. The insurance market since then has changed somewhat, and judicial interpretations of the act have shown there was a need to review it. One of the most important aspects of the legislation is that amendments can be made online. That will definitely benefit people who have insurance. I note there has been wide consultation on this legislation and that there has been generally widespread acceptance of it. I think all the schedules and the recommendations for the legislation will tend to benefit most people covered by it. I note there has been a bit of concern expressed by some groups about the interests of the insured. They raised the issue of proper public consultation in the process. I would have to say that when you have had five years of consultation there probably has been proper consultation. I know this is one piece of legislation that has been widely circulated and debated. I think it is fairly noncontroversial in nature. I will conclude on that point and endorse the legislation before the House. honourable members who have participated in this debate. The insurance market is a critical part of the financial services sector. Life insurance products offer financial security. General insurance enables people to engage in personal, business and community activities that they would otherwise be unable to without facing unacceptable risk. The government strives to improve availability and affordability of insurance cover for Australians. The global financial crisis has tested Australia’s insurers and the framework for prudential supervision. Our insurers have weathered a downturn in global equity markets; nevertheless, in line with international moves Australia is conducting further reviews of minimum capital requirements, corporate governance standards, prudential reporting frameworks, executive remuneration and the supervision of diversified groups, and will continue to strive to maintain world’s best practice in regulation of insurers. The Insurance Contracts Act, however, focuses not on the financial health of insurers but, rather, on the network of rights and obligations among insurers, policy holders and third parties. The bill is intended to update and improve the operation of the act MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2010
204,Mr Clare (Blaxland,"Parliamentary Secretary for Employment) (8.24 pm)-I thank thewhile maintaining a fair balance between the parties. It is the result of a consultative process that was commenced some time ago. Many submissions during the policy development and legislative drafting process helped in refining the proposals to the point of converting them into this bill. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the stakeholders for their contributions at various stages. As noted in the second reading speech, an options paper was recently released dealing with the issue of unfair terms in insurance contracts. Several comprehensive submissions have now been received and arguments for and against various options have been made. The government is considering the matters raised and I expect that the way forward on that project will be announced in the coming weeks. In conclusion, the changes in this bill form part of the government’s ongoing work to further improve the operation of Australia’s insurance market for the benefit of insurers, policy holders and, ultimately, the community as a whole. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.
