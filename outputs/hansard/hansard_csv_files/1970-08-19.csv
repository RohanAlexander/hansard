The new rate announced in this year's Budget represents only 21.7% of the average male weekly earnings in March of this year. Will the honourable gentleman confirm these figures? If not, will he state how much the drop has been in the last 12 months? detailed figures looked at and confirm the figures given by the Leader of the Opposition, or not confirm them, as the case may be. I do point out to the honourable gentieman that the figures that he quotes would seem to indicate that average male earnings have risen faster than prices. This is to say that real wages throughout Australia have been rising. I would hope that the honourable gentleman, like myself, would consider this a matter for some satisfaction. Defence a question. Is it a fact, as alleged in some reports, that the claims of Royal Australian Air Force flying personnel for increased flying pay have been ignored or rejected? quite widely reported in the last few days that the claims of Royal Australian A.T Force flying personnel regarding flying pay had been ignored or rejected. I do not think that those reports are accurate, and because this is important to an understanding of Royal Australian Air Force personnel in different bases, I wanted to say what had happened. It has been alleged that the reasons for also have other responsibilities not generally the decision which led to an increase of found in the duties of Royal Australian Air 100% in flying pay were not divulged. The Foroe personnel. These responsibilities reasons were known to the head of the include forming, maintaining and policing Department of Air who, of course, is a the rules and standards of civil flying. party to the decision and on the committee These are duties additional to those related making the recommendation. It has been to RAAF pilots. However, the increase that alleged also that the advice of uniformed the RAAF pilots gained was a 100% personnel had not been sought before the increase. decision was made. In fact, before the recommendation was a recommendationwhen it was still just a proposal-the advice of the Chief of the Air Staff was sought. He concurred in the figures. It is the figures which are important. He should well know the position in his own service. I am quite certain that he does. It has been alleged also that the rates that were agreed finally were below those which were considered reasonable by the Department of Air. I find this allegation difficult to understand when tbe Permanent Head of the Department of Air was party to the recommendation, which was a unanimous one, to the Treasurer and myself and when the Chief of the Air Staff had known previously of thefigures,had been consulted about them and had concurred in them. I can well understand the morale problem and the difficulty that people in the RAAF would have with the reports that have been circulated widely-and not only in the Press, because 1 understand that the Press reports were based on messages which had been widely circulated throughout Royal Australian Air Force bases in Australia. It has been suggested that the rates should have been the same as those for the Department of Civil Aviation personnel. I do not wish to comment in detail on the reasons for this, but I wish to make one point. statement. matter in which I think quite a number of people have an interest.

If so, why was it necessary to impose a 12±% freight rise on the Line's operations? Is the Minister aware of the severe impact this increase will have on the cost structure of Tasmania? Is it considered just that the Line should maintain its profit rate at the cost of dislocating Tasmanian industry and trade? Will the Minister vary the provisions of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act to emphasise effective services and not the maintenance of the ANL profit rate? profits of the Australian National Line are not at a satisfactory level and it is as a result of the decline in profitability that it has been necessary to adjust the freight structure throughout Australia. It is interestthe extent to which the ANL has maining to note that since 1959, when there was an initial reduction of some 45% in the tariff charged by the Australian National Line which was followed in 1961 by a further 15% reduction, the freight forwarders, who are the largest customers of the Australian National Line in servicing the Tasmanian trade, have seen fit to increase their freight by some 441%. Over the period during which the ANL through the introduction of new types of cargo vessels and unit cargo handling has been able to stabilise the freight structure between Tasmania and the mainland, freight forwarders have found it necessary to increase their rates by some 441%. There must be some limit beyond which the ANL can no longer absorb these cost increases. In only the past few years increases in the wharfage dues, levied by the port authorities on both sides of Bass Strait which mean an average additional 13c per 40 cubic feet of cargo have been absorbed by the ANL. There is also the problem that the wharfage dues levied by the Tasmanian ports are substantially higher than those levied by the mainland ports. None the less, the Government does was a committee of draftsmen or-o n a recognise the peculiar significance of the Commonwealth level-parliamentar y countrans-Bass Strait service to the shippers, sel, and the other was a policy committee. producers and people of Tasmania. It is for They are committees representative of the that reason that the increase in freight Commonwealth and of the States. They passed on to other trades in the ANL service was not immediately applied to the Tasmanian service but instead was deferred so that discussions could be held with the Tasmanian Government and interested Tasmanian peisons to determine the impact. Only on Monday of this week the General Manager of the ANL, the permanent head of my Department and I went to discuss with the Premier of Tasmania, the Tasmanian Minister for Transport and with interested persons in industries there the general question of the impact of the freight increases. There were quite a number of anomalies which, having been discussed, have now been removed. There were in some instances areas where the impact was apparently higher than the 12i% increase but this has now been reduced so that overall substantially only a 12i% increase applies to the Tasmanian trade. It is recognised that shipping costs and, indeed, costs of all sorts must have an impact on producers and consumers alike. However, to tained the freight rate at a stable level in Tasmania over a long period of time it has itself been suffering and it cannot continue operating as it does under a charter which requires it to operate on a commercial basis and sustain losses incurred in any sector indefinitely.

59,Mr Mcmahon,"When I read in onepolice informed my officers that he had been placed under supervision because of his strenuous actions at a basketball match between Greeks and Poles. He was in fact strenuously supporting the Poles against his native country. My officers also interviewed Mr Vrettos, who said that there seemed to be far more worry back home about his welfare and whereabouts than he had himself. He said that he was quite all right and satisfied. His passport had been returned to him. Early this morning I heard from other sources that Mr Vrettos had been again detained. My Department immediately telephoned our embassy in Athens and instructed the officers there to interview Mr sumers there are elements which have Vrettos at his hotel. Our embassy was also told to do all in its power, to ensure that his civil rights were protected. Mr Vrettos could not be contacted then, because it was 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. Nonetheless, at daybreak or as soon after as possible my officers would see him and ask him whether he wants any protection. The only other information I can give the House is that I have been informed by some members of the. Press that they have been in contact with Mr Vrettos. I again assure the House lhat my officers will contact him as soon as they can. ter for Shipping and Transport is supplementary to the questions which were asked of him by my colleagues the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Braddon. The Minister is no doubt aware of the intense feeling of the people of Tasmania with regard to the impost of a 121% freight increase on ships of the Australian National Line which trade between the mainland ports of Australia and Tasmania. I ask: Is the Minister aware of the fact that the whole economic fabric of Tasmania is now in jeopardy as a result of this increase because the State depends almost entirely on sea communications for its continued survival? Will he indicate, by reversing this decision, that the welfare of all the people of Tasmania is far more important than the profitable trading of the ANL? ber for Franklin has demonstrated an irresponsible attitude towards the way in which the Government should try to assist the people of each of the States of the Commonwealth. Over the period in which the Australian National Line has reduced its freight rates-initiall y by 45% and then by 15%-the freight forwarders have -increased their charges by 441%. Port authorities in Tasmania average nearly twice the port dues-in fact, in some instances it is nearly 3 times-of the port of Melbourne in relation to the same services. However, within other sectors affecting the movement of goods from Tasmanian producers to the mainland and goods purchased on the mainland by Tasmanian conmoved against the cost factor at a rate substantially higher than the 121% increase which is being applied to goods carried by the ANL. Some dispensations are available within ANL charges in areas of specialised stacking. I would refer in particular to a method of cargo handling referred to as top stocking which, if it is used by shippers-and I have been told that it is available to many shippers but it is not being used to any extent at the moment-w e will more than negate the present increase in freight charges. While it is true that Tasmania has substantial disadvantages compared with the mainland States in the movement of goods to and from its principal market, it is also true that other elements in the freight chain have moved substantially against the interests of Tasmanians. and. speaking comparatively, to a greater extent than has the Australian National Line. Indeed, it is only because of the stabilisation that the Australian National Line has produced through the introduction of new tvpes of cargo handling that the freight charges to Tasmania-and hence the interests of Tasmanian industry -hav e been protected for so long.

61,Mr Sinclair,The honourable mem,27,Darwin Waterfront
62,Mr Calder,"I s the Minister forvessel, 'Darwin Trader', will the Minister confer with his colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service, to see whether something can be done to provide a responsible work force on the Darwin waterfront? that in the movement of goods around the Australian coast the general unreliability of waterfront labour has created substantia! difficulties in the turnround time for conventional vessels. Because of this uncertainty in turnround time an accelerated move has been made into new forms of cargo handling. This has involved a lessening in the work force but at tbe same time has provided a more specialised nature of employment and, by giving the opportunities for more specialised training, it has provided opportunities for more remunerative employment for waterside labour. The 'Darwin Trader', the new vessel operated by the Australian National Line to Darwin, was introduced specifically to try to accelerate the turnround in the port of Darwin and so contain the escalation of costs which affect the provision of the Australian National Line's services there. The 4,500-odd tons of cargo for Darwin on the maiden voyage of the 'Darwin Trader' were discharged in about 38 hours at the port of Darwin, which was a very effective effort. But unfortunately, through industrial trouble at the port, the ship was delayed for about 9 days, making an additional cost of about $31,000 to the Australian National Line. Imposts in freight charges must necessarily reflect any undue burden of costs. The Darwin and Tasmanian trades unfortunately suffer by the movement of costs and the residents of Darwin in particular are being prejudiced in their enjoyment of an economic and reasonable level of freight structure by the general unreliability of the waterfront labour in the port of Darwin. Accordingly, I will be happy to discuss with my colleague, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory has suggested, what methods might be adopted to improve the general position there. It might be mentioned that the Government, through my colleagues, the Minister for thc Interior and the Minister for National Development, is committed to a very substantial expenditure in the upgrading of the facilities in the port of Darwin. Without doubt this also will be prejudiced if the waterfront labour is not prepared to adopt a responsible attitude to ensure a quick turnround of both coastal ships and those operating into and out of Darwin from overseas. by the Prime Minister at the last Premiers' Conference that in the event of the failure to pass the receipts duty scheme of legislation the Commonwealth would reimburse the States the amount of revenue lost by their inability constitutionally to impose such taxation, which would amount to a sum of about $70m? rather more than that which was mentioned by the honourable member, but we can look up the actual figures ourselves. I have no recollection of any undertaking being given. There is a transcript of the proceedings, but 1 bave no recollection of such an undertaking. On the other hand, it must be fairly clear that should the measure not be passed then those who voted against it would be placing the States in an entirely untenable position and would be attacking the capacity of the States to carry out their responsibilities for schools, hospitals, roads and the other things which the community wants, and that would obviously require responsible people to see whether such irresponsibility could be repaired. to the Attorney-General. For how long will the Government tolerate attacks on administration leaders, the destruction of property, the shouting of obscenities in the streets and the involvement of innocent citizens before it enforces the law against damaging demonstrators who apparently feel that they are immune from the law of the land?

The honourable gentleman is aware that there are over 200,000 migrants eligible for naturalisation who have not applied for same. Some of these people are willing to become naturalised but will not take an oath of allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen simply because they do not believe in monarchies. Would the honourable gentleman give permission to allow such migrants to take an oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth of Australia as a voluntary alternative? is no. DRUG PEDDLING Minister for Customs and Excise a question which concerns a recent statement by the Minister that Australia is being subjected to rapidly increasing international drug peddling operations and that this tragic and obnoxious trade is not being deterred sufficiently by the light sentences often handed out by rhe courts to those convicted. Will he confer with the Attorney-General to see if the laws for drug peddling and drug pushing can be altered so as to set a minimum gaol sentence for this offence as well as the present maximum sentence? While these laws are being reviewed, will he also consider amending the law so as to prevent people arrested with drugs in their possession from obtaining bail so that they will not be able ro warn rhe distribution ring of their arrest? honourable member after looking at all the cases over the last 2 years that in balance the sentences have been too light, too strong or satisfactory. WhatI can say and what I have said is that it is causing me deep concern that in a number of decisions recently where the evidence seemed to scream for some severe penalty very light penalties were imposed. In fact, in one case only a fine was administered. Whether or not the Government should consider imposing minimum penalties is a very serious matter. I know that the Attorney-General would share the view I have, and I suspect that the Opposition would also share the view, that responsible Government would impose minimum penalties for offences only where there are overwhelming reasons for so doing. I know that at least some of my State colleagues are becoming concerned at the statistics of the increase of drug smuggling. For example, in the 12 months ended this July we will have seized 20 times more hashish and marihuana than we seized in the preceding 12 months. Only a few weeks ago we seized 50,000 tablets of LSD imported from America, all of which were pre-sold. We have evidence that the importation and consumption of heroin is increasing in Australia. As far as bail is concerned, this too causes us concern. We regard bail as a right of an accused under the British form of justice. But it is a right that is given to a person after a judge has, I believe, sensibly viewed all of the situation. Not only have the rights of the accused to be protected but the rights of the community must surely take some place in the judge's mind. I am dismayedI use that term strongly and advisedlythat notwithstanding strenuous opposition by the narcotics squad before the courts, in certain cases where we suspect collusion and that the accused will alert his colleagues and so on, our investigations have been upset because not only has bail been given but also bail amountina to $100 or S200 has been granted for offences that can bring 10 years gaol or a fine of $10,000, or both. For this reason I have asked my Department to submit to me a comprehensive report of the charges, convictions and sentences over the last 2 years so that I can make a balanced judgnient on this and consult with my colleague the Attorney-General and the State Ministers. ter whether he has had the opportunity to consider the reported statement by Mr Justice Nimmo to ihe effect that the inquiry into health insurance over which he presided produced evidence of 'appalling social",29,Demonstrations

In view of this evidence arising from a Commonwealth inquiry which was not seeking it, will the Prime Minister give an undertaking to now consider the appointment of a committee of inquiry into poverty in Australia so that the fullest information and advice on this subject can be collated as a basis for further action? course, and indeed the Parliament, has considered the report of Mr Justice Nimmo on how to best provide the best health scheme for the people of this country and the Government and the Parliament have taken action to do so. The other matters which the honourable member has raised I suggest come within the ambit of future policy. to the Minister for Primary Industry. I ask: Has the New South Wales Government yet entered into a formal agreement with the Commonwealth under the terms of the $25m dairy farm reconstruction scheme legislation? If the answer is in the affirmasomething to the answer I gave to the questive, when will the scheme begin to operate in New South Wales and what amount of finance will be available in the current nnancial year for this important rural reconing of the Premiers-no t the last one but struction work? I further ask: What can be done to speed .up this important phase of rural reconstruction? any agreement reached with New South Wales on the dairy farm reconstruction proposals. So far 3 States have accepted the proposals and arrived at mutual conditions. They are Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. After negotiations with the Queensland Minister for Lands about 2 weeks ago we reached complete agreement on all aspects and 1 hope that this agreement will be put into effect as soon as possible. A lot of noise has been made in New South Wales either for or against the scheme. In fact, at times I wonder where that State stands on the proposal. There have been areas of difference between the Commonwealth and New South Wales. One of the areas of difference has been that the State has wanted to apply this money right across the whole dairy industry in New South Wales, including the whole milk area. The Commonwealth, which has the responsibility in the manufacturing area of the industry, has rejected this proposal. However, the Commonwealth has been prepared to accept that there is a marginal area where people may have small quotas and it has allowed this money to be available to farmers who have 50% or more of their dairy products sold at manufacturing prices. Therefore, this will overcome quite a bit of the grey area. However, we have said to New South Wales that we would have no objection if moneys which it uses in its present farm build up scheme are applied exclusively to the milk zone. In fact, we would be prepared to make a grant to that State to assist it to use these moneys to write off some of the redundant improvements on properties. However, as yet, I have not been able to get even to negotiating terms with New South Wales. I only hope that I get word shortly so that some satisfactory conclusion can be arrived at. tion asked by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I was not sure of the basis of the question. I do recollect a meetthe one before-in which the Premiers were assured by me that should their Budgets for the financial year which has just ended be severely damaged by failure to collect the money which they had budgeted for and expected to get from receipts duty then the Commonwealth would have to provide assistance to them in some way or find some means of assistance so that they would not have to sustain those losses. I will look at the transcript of the subsequent meetings but it occurred to me that that might have been what was in the honourable member's mind. For the rest, I can only repeat what I said, that I have not a recollection of a subsequent meeting.

As with university and advanced education scholarships, I hope to be able to make an announcement on allowances before the end of the year. Taken together, changes in the scholarship schemes are estimated to cost $ 1.69m in the financial year 19701971 and $3.13m in the full year 1971. The total expenditure on the Commonwealth scholarships schemes is expected to rise from $32.21m in 1969-1970 to an estimated $37.39m in 1970-1971 and $39.45m for the full year 1971. When the effects of the new measures are fully operative, the total cost of the schemes is expected to approach $50m per annum.

The Government is conscious of the need future provision of postgraduate education to provide for a wider range of educational in business management and administration facilities in the Northern Territory and with in Australia. The report of the Committee this in mind it has accepted the recommendations contained in the first report of the Planning Committee which was established last year to advise the Government on the development of a community college in Darwin. I believe that the college will provide great assistance to developing industries in the Northern Territory and will also enable the technical and professional knowledge of Territory workers to be regularly updated. Significant expenditure on the college will not be incurred in this financial year but, as honourable members realise, the development of the college has substantial implications for the future financing of education in the Northern Territory. Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education Tbe proposed Commonwealth expenditure during the financial year on universities and colleges of advanced education reflects its support for the continued expansion of tertiary education facilities. Grants to colleges of advanced education are expected to total almost $40m, which is more than 75% above the figure for 1969I would like to take this opportunity to mention briefly the recent inquiry into the which undertook this inquiry has recently been made public. Among the Committee's recommendations was the establishment of 1 national school of the highest quality. The Committee considered that it would be unwise at this juncture to attempt to establish more than 1 national school because of the scarcity of first class teaching staff and the heavy capital and recurrent costs involved. It recommended that this national school be placed in the University of New South Wales. It proposes that the school should aim at a 2 year full time course producing approximately 70 master of annually and should conduct annually 2 or 3 executive programmes of 8 to 10 weeks' duration. The school should also conduct a small Ph.D. programme and maintain a significant output of research. The Commonwealth accepts the Committee's recommendations in principle and is proceeding to discussions with industry and with the New South Wales Government and the University of New South Wales, concerning the establishment of a national graduate school of business administration.

Nation-wide Survey of Educational Needs It will be recalled that the Australian Education Council, which comprises the 6 State Ministers for Education, has during the past year been involved in a survey of educational needs over the next 5 years. Independent schools have also been involved. The Commonwealth has co-operated in the survey, in particular in respect of the business administration graduates future educational needs of the two territories. The results of the survey of needs of government schools were discussed at a special meeting of the Australian Education CouncilI attended in late May. The Ministers agreed to submit thefindingsof the survey to their respective governments. The States' needs in education formed a part of the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council discussions and reference was made to the survey. As a result of the new agreement for financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth, the States will receive almost $800m more during the next 5 years than would have been provided under the previous agreement.

99,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [4.12],"raises the question of the need for the Commonwealth to have its own teachers colleges, which it is doing to some extent with the College of Advanced Education, and to undertake seriously teacher training for its territories and for Papua and New Guinea. So long as the Commonwealth is beholden to the State of New South Wales for the staffing of schools in the Australian National Union of Australian University Capital Territory, and, even more importantly, so long as it is beholden to the State of South Australia for the staffing of schools in the Northern Territory, to that indication that he will consider them later extent the Commonwealth's capacity to vary its educational policy is limited. It is significant that in the same breath as the Minister is announcing South Australia's gradual withdrawal from the staffing of schools in the Northern Territory he is announcing a very welcome diversification of Commonwealth educational policy and activity in the Northern Territory in the founding of a new educational institution in Darwin. If the Commonwealth has its own trained teachers and really takes full responsibility for education in its own territories it can make all the decisions that wide survey of educational needs will mark are needed for the type of education that should be offered in those territories. I think that there are special needs in the Northern Territory in particular because the children living there, in contrast with those living in the Australian Capital Territory, do suffer serious educational disabilities because of the very nature of the Northern Territory. The Minister's statement on the special aid being given to the States in relation to migrant children is also very welcome. The agreed to: Commonwealth, of course, by its migration That in accordance with the provisions of the policy has created a crisis for the States.

The Minister's remarks on teachers 1 colleges follow very much along the lines of a statement he made earlier this year. His statement on scholarships is welcome. I hope that his remarks in relation to the Students, it having made certain submissions to him about scholarships, and his in the year, do. not raise the hopes of the students falsely. The Minister said: I have received representations that a further increase in benefits is desirable, and have studied a detailed report on this matter prepared by the National Union of Australian University Students. I expect to be able to make a statement on this matter before the end of the year. I am sure that as a result of those remarks the students will expect the proposed statement to be favourable. I hope that they will not be disappointed. Generally speaking, we welcome very warmly the Minister's statement. We add the hope that the nationthe end of sporadic Commonwealth intervention in the field of education and lead to much more systematic assistance to education.

Our export apple and position of tbe rural sector of Australia. pear industry is verging on crisis.

As could grow into a very serious problem in those papers will be discussed in detail at the immediate future. The Government has a later stage I shall 'refer only to the relea lot to say about strikes. There is one vant figures to prove the point that the sector of the work force which would have farming sector of Australia, as distinct every justification in striking.

We should act now. problems which exist and to promote and After all, we have known for a long time implement positive policies. The blame for that a decision on Britain's entry to the the mess in which primary industry finds itself today must be borne by the Federal Government. The Opposition cannot be blamed because this Government has been in office for over 20 years. One of the main reasons why primary industry is in such a mess is that the Government has refused consistently to face the facts relating to international trade and the policies of overmarketing, as well as the facts relating to domestic policies in Australia and those factors which are causing an insidious increase in costs and the cost price spiral. The Goverament has allowed rural Australia to drift for year after year until now a crisis with frightening ramifications has emerged. We have a crisis in wool, a crisis My investigations have shown that the gloomiest I had read for many a day. exports of sugar go to Great Britain. The",40,Public Works Committee Reports
102,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock),"EEC was pending. One of the first things that the Australian Government must have is a firm decision as to where Britain stands in regard to the Australian agricultural trade. The sooner this Government ascertains Britain's policy the better for all concerned. The Government's whole approach to primary industry is analogous to its approach to drought. In 21 years of power the Government has not formulated a constructive national drought policy. The policy of the Government is to wait until a drought occurs and then try to solve the problem by handouts to the States. 1 cannot stress too strongly the importance of the rural sector to the Australian economy. Over a long period of years primary industry has been rhe financial and economic backbone of this nation and it will continue to be the backbone in the future. To put it bluntly, the economic health of this nation is dependent on primary industry and the mineral industry. Should Australia's export income sector fail the result would be wholesale unemployment in almost every major secondary industry in Australia, most of which are located in the cities. of the Government. The wool fiasco is a glaring example of this Government's attitude towards primary industry. Five years ago the wool industry experts recommended a reserve price scheme. The honourable member for Curtin has interjected and very shortly in this session I will test the morale and courage of the Country Party on the subject of wool. When the reserve price scheme was put forward it resulted in organised opposition by the vested interests and ruthless campaigns against the wool growers. Nothing was done by the Government after it was rejected. The Government has, over a number of years, consistently blamed the wool industry for not grasping the nettle and today we are in exactly the same position. After5 years of study by the Government, and yet another expert report the Government still refuses to act on wool. We see the efforts of the Liberal Party to sabotage the wool marketing scheme just as it sabotaged the reserve price scheme. What will the Country Party do about this? Will it sit back and take it as it has done every other year when there has been a crisis in rural industry? The Country Party appears to be frightened by the numerically powerful Liberal Party which without doubt represents the vested interests, the middle man, the overseas cartels and the very big growers who are in a position to dictate their own terms. What does the Government propose to do about wool? Surely it will not again submit the question of a single marketing authority to a referendum. As I have said before, if the Country Party is not prepared to act the Opposition will have no hesitation in putting the Country Party on the spot at a later stage and testing it before the people of Australia. How far is ihe Country Party prepared to act in defiance of the Liberals, who are doing everything possible to sabotage the wool industry in the marketing field? Reconstruction of the wool industry is urgently required. Handouts simply delay the inevitable. WhatI mean by reconstruction is a complete re-organisation of the marketing and handling of wool and a forceful approach to the policies of overseas shipping companies with respect to freight rates. Let us not procrastinate any longer. The Government has had many years in which to act. It has had the advice of the best experts available. It has the backing of the rank and file of thc industry. Still we have no positive statement as to the Government's intentions. We are all aware that there is a crisis in the wool industry. There is an urgent need to face up to the future prospects of wool. Let us have the truth. If it is considered that we must scale down our level of production of certain courser classes of wool, the Government should say so. If we have to increase our production of finer wools let the Government say so and pursue policies which will achieve this objective. Whatever happens, we must have action; we must have policies. As I see the position, the greatest threat to wool and to every export primary industry are Ihe vicious and insidious domestic policies which promote the cost price spiral and encourage the forces of inflation in this country. The wages and materials cost price problem is eroding the economic heart of our export industries. If costs continue to increase at their present rate thc export minerals industry will be in trouble. The",41,Australian Rural Economy

104,Dr Patterson,"You are a supporterrumblings are already in evidence. Action to deal with the cost price squeeze in export industries must be regarded as one of our most important priorities. The Government has done nothing in the present Budget to control costs. Every manufacturer in Australia, heavily protected by tariffs, is free to raise his prices when workers obtain increased wages through arbitration. In no primary industry has the Government's failure to exhibit leadership been more apparent than in the butter industry. By his own admission the Minister for Trade and Industry has for 10 years warned the industry that it would have to do something to reduce butter production. But Australia is increasing its production of butter. carting buckets of clean water. This is an The Government says that it does not have control over production. It controls the purse strings. It controls the level of subsidy, and under equalisation it has widesweeping powers. The Government must take action to curtail butter production. The wheat industry has had the same problem of Order! The honourable member's time has over-production. For3 years prior to the expired. present crisis facing the wheat industry the rumblings were present. But the Government waited until the crisis occurred.

Yet that of the speech of the honourable member same Party adopts, the hypocritical attitude for Dawson (Dr Patterson) is what he did of selling wheat to Communist China at a not say. He did not offer one suggestion price .lower than is charged to owners of as to how these problems might be tackled. starving stock in Australia. I challenge the Government to disprove my statement. The Labor Party's policy is to marry surplus listen. grains production and our livestock. We all know that certain areas in Australia are past 2 or 3 months the honourable member susceptible to drought, yet we see hundreds has been roaming around Australia waving of millions of bushels of unsaleable wheat his arms about and saying vaguely that attacked by vermin. At the same time as we must have a national policy, but that this is happening we find hundreds of is as far as he has gone. There cannot be thousands of sheep and cattle dying for the one all-embracing agricultural policy want of feed grains. It would appear as because the problems are vast and differ though my time has almost expired. I from industry to industry. Therefore it is thought I had more time at my disposal. I necessary to have a wide range of policies conclude by saying that emergency grants for each sector of primary industry. There are essential for the construction of is no relationship between eggs, beef, cotton, desperately needed small scale water schemes for people, industry and established farmers whose economic livelihood is being threatened. I shall give 2 excellent examples. Day after day many people in Giru have had to fetch their water in buckets. Mt Morgan, where industry is involved, is another example. Large grandiose schemes are not needed at this point of time. All that is needed is a small scheme which will enable the people of these areas to survive economically. If any honourable member wants to ridicule my suggestion he should go to Giru and he will see what the farmers have to say. The wives of many farmers are going to the water points and example of the sort of thing that is going on. Not a lot of money would be involved in overcoming this problem.

But there are limitations on the assistance which can be given. There are financial limitations on the assistance which can be given by the Commonwealth and the States and there are constitutional limitations on what the Commonwealth can do. I think it is unfair to take the point of view that there has been no leadership shown or courageous action taken because there have been more radical moves in the field of agriculture during the past 2 years than this country has ever known. For example, a wheat quota scheme-bu t it did not get much support from the Opposition-ha s been introduced. In fact, the honourable member for Riverina( Mr The Government is concerned and it will Grassby) did everything possible to try to sabotage the wheat quota scheme. pleasure. cessful the industry would have been in utter chaos. though this is the policy of the Australian Labor Party, but we will lei the honourable member for Riverina speak for himself. The Government has brought about an international sugar agreement which will control the amount of sugar going on to the residual world market and it has limited Australia's production accordingly. The Government has brought about an international grains arrangement endeavour to achieve tbe orderly marketing of grain. It has also got the dairying industry together for the first time in an endeavour *o impose certain restrictions on production. A new system has been introduced whereby a quota is applied to each State in an attempt to limit the total production to 220,000 tons. The Government has also entered into a new field-far m reconstruction-whic h has received little support from some members of the Opposition. I exclude the honourable member for Dawson because he has been a strong advocate right through for farm reconstruction, but whispering campaigns have been conducted against it by some honourable members opposite. These 20734/70-R. 2 honourable members have gone round the countryside saying: 'The Minister for Primary Industry and the Government are only concerned about getting rid of the small farmers. They want to depopulate country areas. They do not care about the small farmers'. These honourable members have been saying this despite the fact that the whole objective of the Government's dairy farm reconstruction proposals has been to maintain in the industry those people who wish to stay and give those who wisn to leave it an alternative to diversify to other forms of production. Many measures have been taken to attack the problems which exist in every area of agriculture. So, any remarks to the effect that the Government is not concerned, worried or sympathetic are not genuine. continue to do everything possible to meet the problems which arise whenever they arise. The honourable member for Dawson said that all the Government can talk about is strikes. A very serious strike is pending amongst meat inspectors in tbe meat industry. I have acknowledged that this is a serious situation. In fact, the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mclvor) has contacted me many times ahout the problems of the large number of employees who work in the many meat works in his electorate. We have gone to no end of trouble to 117 to resolve the problem of insufficient meat inspectors by trying to improve the working conditions and wages of meat inspectors. Recently the Public Service Board, after negotiations with the in an meat inspectors, declared that all meat inspectors would become permanent Commonwealth employees and that many of them would be upgraded to second grade employees. However, the one problem which the Government has not been able to resolve is that of their opportunity to take their recreation leave. The rather shameful situation exists whereby some meat inspectors have not been on recreation leave for 3, 4 or 5 years because the Government has not been able to recruit sufficient numbers to make up for those who have left the industry. Following recent negotiations between the Government and the meat industry agreement was reached to slow up the killing rate so that meat inspectors would be",43,Australian Rural Economy

112,Mr Anthony,"It does not seem asable to take their recreation leave and thereby avoid the national strike which was pending amongst tbe meat inspectors. The agreement of the meat industry was obtained. Unfortunately, the works and the unions are now complaining because some people have to work shorter hours and cannot have the same throughput. In fact, some employees have had to be put off. But the Government has done its best as a responsible government and the Department of Primary Industry has done its best as a responsible department to resolve this problem and to try to spread its impact as much as possible across Australia so that individual meat works will not be penalised. But to talk of the Government encouraging strikes is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. If there is one sector cf the Australian community which is putting an impost on primary producers it is the leaders of the industrial unions, who seem to call on strikes at any time. A big problem facing primary industries is the cost price squeeze. There are some areas in which it is impossible for the Government to rectify the problems. I refer to the decline in world prices, the lack of access first impact of drought will be met by the to different markets in the world because of tariff barriers, quotas and embargoes and substitutes replacing some of our agricultural products. The green revolution has resulted in an increase in the production of certain types of grains for which there are no longer big enough markets. The Goverament cannot do anything about this sort of thing except try to buffer their impact. But a government and a nation should be conscious of the need to do something about the cost increases which are occurring. The Budget which was brought down in this House last night was a deflationary one. There is a very large domestic surplus in it in an attempt to reduce liquidity in the economy. We have been compelled, reluctantly, to increase interest rates, to make money tighter in order to dampen down the tremendous demand that is developing in the economy. Any party which supports a proposal for shorter working hours can only bring absolute disaster to the primary industries which are battling for survival today. They are being strangled by increasing costs. The President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Hawke, has publicly said that he is not going to take any notice of the wage impact on primary industries. What concern or sympathy for primary industries can there be amongst the Opposition when the leader of the unions which Opposition members come into this Parliament to represent takes this sort of attitude? It is sheer hypocrisy for members of the Opposition to get up and criticise the Government for the wage increases and the general cost increases which are having such an impact on the primary producers. The honourable member for Dawson mentioned his concern about the drought in northern Australia, mainly in northern New South Wales and Queensland although it has also been very severe in Western Australia during the past 12 months. Fortunately in some regions of that State the situation has eased somewhat. To say that the Government has no national policy on drought is again quite unfair. For dealing with drought it has established a set routine which did not exist until 3 or 4 years ago when we had a very severe drought in New South Wales and Queensland. The understanding between the State governments and the Commonwealth Government is that the States. The incidence of drought can be regionalised. When the drought spreads and takes in a large part of the State or is Statewide the State governments come to the Commonwealth and make a request and we match them dollar for dollar. When the position is reached that tbe States can no longer continue their contributions the Commonwealth comes in and provides all the necessary money. Last year in Queensland the Commonwealth provided $14m. This year already it is committed to providing $llm for Queensland. On both occasions the Queensland Government has had to provide only the first $2m to match $2m provided by the Commonwealth. The drought money is being provided to help relieve the freight impost on fodder and also the cost of moving stock into and out of affected areas. Loans are made available for carry-on finance. The amounts made available to Queensland farmers have been increased this year. In the case of a small farmer the amount has increased from $6,000 to $10,000. In the case of a larger farmer it has gone from $10,000 to $16,000. Re-stocking finance has been increased from $10,000 to $20,000. The Government has met every reasonable request from the Queensland Government. This year an additional request has been made for money for the reconstruction of properties in Queensland. So that it would be able to set up a reconstruction board or other authority the State requested the Com. . . if the Commonwealth had agreed, as had monwealth to amend the Bankruptcy Act. 1 would like to inform the House that the Attorney-General( Mr Hughes) has been examining this matter very closely in relation to amendments to the Bankruptcy Act. He has before the Government at the moment a submission that the necessary amendment be made. I hope that very soon -in the present session if possible-the amendment will be made, thus enabling the Queensland Government to proceed with the establishment of such a board to carry out the reconstruction. As mentioned last night in rhe speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Bury), I and my Department have been given the responsibility of examining in detail the general indebtedness of rural properties in Australia and of coming forward with recommendations as to how this problem might best be tackled, whether through Commonwealth agencies or on a State basis. I assure the House that this matter will be handled as urgently as possible as I believe that it is the most important, immediate aspect of the problem of rural industries and it must be thoroughly examined. port the motion moved by the Opposition to direct the attention of the Parliament to the problems of the countryside. The honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) put the facts and the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Anthony) said: 'We know them.' The Opposition then asked for further action and the Minister for Primary Industry said: 'We have done a great deal.' To illustrate the achievements of the Government and himself in the discharge of his duties he said: 'Look at what we have done with dairying. Look at our achievement there. Look at the progress we have made in reaching towards and achieving reconstruction.' That is an incredibly different story from the one that was put forward by the Minister for Lands in the Liberal-Country Party administration in New South Wales who, 1 might say, did not appreciate the reference by the Commonwealth Minister to the dairy industry being in absolute chaos, which the Minister for Primary Industry put down to gutless State politicians. In rebutting that, the Minister for Lands in New South Wales said: been suggested on several occasions, that the Ministers concerned-Commonwealt h and Stateshould meet to discuss this matter, I feel it could have been resolved many montbs ago. However, the Commonwealth apparently has not the courage or the good sense to agree to such a meeting. In fact, Mr Anthony, either because of ignorance or rudeness, has ignored the Ministers in each Slate responsible for reconstruction schemes and keeps contacting . . . the wrong Ministers. This is a rebuttal of the claim that there has been a great deal of progress on the part of the Government and the Minister for Primary Industry in that one section to which the Minister specifically referred. Confronted with a depression in the countryside, and with the situation worsening daily, the Government came to the Parliament last night and told us. through the Treasurer: The farm outlook is not encouraging bm we can reasonably expect a good rise in non-farm productivity . . . Our external outlook is promising. So much for the problems of the countryside. They are dismissed in a single sentence and the nation is told in the next sentence that we are not to worry too much because everything else is really all right. One half of the countryside is in a state of depression because of drought and the other half because of the Government's disastrous policies on primary products. It is through scandalous incompetence that sheep are dying in the drought areas of Queensland and New South Wales for lack of feed while wheat is being left in temporary storages and in many cases providing a monumental feast for mice and weevils. Surely the Federal Government can use some of its technologies and sophisticated know-how to get to grips with the problems instead of saying that it will through the ludicrous and lengthy procedure of giving money to the States, which will give money to an agency, which will lend money to the farmer-wh o cannot afford any more loans-to buy wheat which is uuder the Commonwealth's control. This chain of bureaucracy causes tragic delays, means that",44,Australian Rural Economy

Surely to goodthere at the present time. If we take the ness we have enough know-how to break this chain and cycle of democracy and get the job done. think it is democracy. I apologise for my slip of the tongue. I do not think it is beyond the democratic processes of the Government to break what I have just described as a meaningless chain of bureaucracy. After all, how can the Government claim to be helping drought areas when the need is for feed wheat and when feed wheat is available at prices higher than those we charge China? This is just not sound, it is not good and it is not just. The drought in some areas is the worse on record. It is worse than in 1965. But the financial position of the countryside is much worse. At the present moment, of course, we have a compounding of all the problems. We have drought and we have policies touching on wheat and wool. The Minister went on to defend his decision and the decision of his Government to introduce restrictions on wheat in the middle of a season. ourable member should know that by the industry. The wool grower has not asked record in the Legislative Assembly of New for handouts. He has not asked for anySouth Wales. The Minister brought in body's charity. What growers have asked restrictions, 1 might say, based on a for unanimouslyI say it has been asked national wheat ration which we did not for unanimously by the rank and file, and meet. Then he refused to take in what was I stand to be corrected on it-is a proper available. He refused to face the facts of marketing system, a just price and an end blackmarket trading and still does not face to the exploitation of his product to enrich them to this day. In doing this, of course, others at his expense. he opened a market at 60c, and this dragged down the price of every grain. Today that market is rising to 80c, which is an indication of need and demand. ber should just be careful. After all, I can in which he advocated that people who had say a few words about who will report been to see Federal members of Parliawhom for what. One of the things I think ment about problems of selling over quota we ought to do in relation to wheat is to wheat should be reported to the authorisay quite bluntly and definitely that it is ties. He should be thoroughly ashamed of no credit to the Government that unpaid himself. Let us have a look at the situafor wheat is being eaten by mice and weetion today in relation to wool. The Govvils in major and temporary storages. It is ernment promised urgent action back in there despite the fact that we did not reach our national quota last season. We will not meet it next season. But there is wheat Government's word that the surpluses are tremendous then surely to goodness the one thing the Minister ought to doI talk to the Minister particularly-is to bring the feed wheat to the stomachs of the stock that need it. That should not be beyond our ability at this time. When we turn to the future, if he is asking me whether we should have an orderly development of the wheat industry, my answer is yes, but it should not be based on panic decisions which are made at the last moment in the middle of a season, and it should not result in bringing in a system such as the one in New South Wales which the New South Wales Minister admitted to a meeting of 300 growers was rotten to the core because of the haste in which it was conceived and implemented. The situation in relation to wool is extraordinary. We have wool and everyone has said it is still in great demand. After months of waiting a handout is being proposed which will average out at between $200 and $300 per head, which is not enough to feed the chooks on a good size property. If this is the solution to the problems of the wool industry I would suggest it would be rejected by the clearly spelt out in relation to wool.

We have in fact, apparently, a deaf ear to what the woo! growers have put up through their organisations and through major meetings. Tbey have said that they want a change, a reformation, in the marketing system. In his reply on an urgent matter the Minister made no reference, no commitment, to it at all. Yet he comes here regularly and tells us: 'Whatever the industry wants we shall do.' We are waiting. Our policies are clear. They have been spelt out and I know the Minister has had the privilege of reading them in detail. i wanted to draw attention to the fact, in relation to wbeat particularly, that because of the circumstances of the introduction of quotas last season we have a moral duty now to take in and to pay $1.10 first advance on all wheat that has been either delivered or is awaiting delivery. That should be done. The Treasurer ( Mr farms will become bigger. One of the funBury), who is not known for his generosity, at least has made sufficient money available to do this. There should be a tearing up at the present time of the bits of paper which say that people should be restricted this year when in fact the Minister has admitted that we have a roaring drought in most of the country. So those who are able surely to goodness should be permitted to grow and deliver with confidence and be paid. The2 great needs of the countryside today are collateral and confidence.

Mr Lewis in New South Wales put that to the Minister and the Minister may reply to him directly. The Government could deal with wheat in a courageous way.

If the honourable members for Riverina( Mr Grassby) and Dawson (Dr Patterson) had been farmers and known what it is like to make decisions on whicb a living depends they would scorn to come into the House today and make the kind of political capital claptrap that we have heard. These are grievous times in which we are living. The problems that face us can be faced by a people and a Parliament that tackle their problems and think about them but do not abuse the opportunities to do that by coming in and performing in this way. We do face a problem of reconstruction. I think I ought to try to help solve it instead of carrying on as if I was in a circus. We are facing rea) and serious problems. Land aggregation is one and debt reconstruction is another. The object of the exercise, I presume, is to make viable economic units. Let us look at this problem of land aggregation. It will mean bigger economic units. In simple terms, it will mean that damental reasons for this is that tractors have become bigger. We had farms of a certain size when we had horse teams. Honourable members opposite would not know that, but this is the kind of thing that governs the size of farms. As tractors came in the economic size of farms became bigger. Anybody who does not recognise this is just blinking the facts of life. I do not think we will have any great big takeover by company farms. I know that the economic size family farms in Australia will out-perform, in animal production at least and often in grain production, any large advantages to be gained from living on your own property, which honourable members opposite probably do not know about. We go out to see our stock in the morning and we do not say: '1 will conic in and have a look at that ewe tomorrow.' We go out and attend to it. We try to tackle the problem of reconstruction, and the dairy scheme is a gallant attempt by the Minister to do this. We have clone it before in the marginal land scheme in the States.

Drought is also the problem of the farmer, but he needs the Government's active and sympathetic consideration and help to overcome it. Do not let us try to pass this problem off on to people other than the farmer. We have to see that the incentive remains for the farmer to make his own judgments. We should help him where we can. We ought to be careful not to use the slick and easy argument that irrigation schemes are the answers to drought relief. We all know that they are not. We know that irrigation helps and that it takes the drought problem away from the man who farms the irrigation land.

The provisions of the Bill have been incorporated in the Bill whicb r am about to present. Question resolved in the affirmative BILL 1970 Bill presented by Mr Lynch, and read a first time. Second Reading Immigration and Minister assisting the Treasurer) [5.17]I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) 20736/70-R-[6 1 Act 1935-1967. The amendments proposed by the Bill will apply to the First Schedule to the Act which sets out the categories of goods that are exempt from sales tax. Two new exemptions which are proposed will exempt Australian-made motor vehicles for use by members of the armed forces of Canada and New Zealand stationed in Australia. The circumstances in which exemption will be allowable are to be prescribed by regulation, the intention being that they will parallel those in which exemption is currently available to United States and British servicemen. In conformity with Australia's obligations under the Status of Forces Agreement with the United States, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act was amended in 1963 to enable United States servicemen stationed in Australia to purchase Australian-made vehicles free of sales tax. A similar exemption was subsequently provided in favour of British servicemen. The amendment now proposed will extend the exemptions to vehicles for Canadian and New Zealand servicemen. Comparable concessions are enjoyed by Australian servicemen stationed in those countries. The Bill proposes to remove the specific exemption of goods for use by British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Ltd (an airline no longer operating) and Qantas Airways Ltd. Other provisions of the sales tax law exempt such items of equipment as aircraft and aircraft parts, servicing equipment and tractors for towing aircraft. But in respect of goods not so exempted, it is considered that Qantas Airways Ltd should be in the same position as other airlines Qantas already is liable to Commonwealth taxes other than sales tax. This amendment is .o be effective from tomorrow. 20th August 1970, so that on and from that date the specific exemption in favour of Qantas will cease to apply. The Bill includes a provision to exempt goods for use, and not for sale, by the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board. This replaces a similar provision which was included in the er.rlier Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill 1970 which has just been withdrawn. The new exemption is supplementary to the AngloAustralian Telescope Agreement Bill 1970 under which it is proposed to set up the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board.

Trinidad and Tobago Conference present the report of the Australian Branch delegation to the 15th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference held at Port-ofSpain, Trinidad and Tobago, during October 1969 and move: That the House take note of the paper. In moving this motion I do so knowing that the task was originally to be performed from the opening speech of thc Right by the late member for Chisholm, Sir Wilfred Kent Hughes. I take this opportunity of joining with other honourable members who spoke yesterday in a tribute to Sir Wilfred for the great work he has done for the Commonwealth of Nations. Over his lifetime he took a great interest in the Commonwealth and I know that he was glad to be present at the Trinidad conference last year. We remember also the way in which he took an interest in so many Commonwealth students who often stayed at his home in Melbourne when they had nowhere else to go. For that reason 1 pay a tribute to him. I wish that he were undertaking the task that I have been asked now to perform in his stead. The report deals with the conference that debates were concerned with problems of took place in Trinidad and Tobaga, the meetings of the General Council and the general meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in October last year. I am glad that the House has given us an opportunity once again to mention the activities of the Association, because this has been a model for so many other Parliaments which are now following the example that was first set by Australia in As I have moved around other branches of the Association I have said how important it is that members who go overseas at ineffective by the expense of the taxpayer should return to their countries and by making reports to their parliaments on what they have learned and of the value it has been to their countries, justify the expenditure that they have incurred. SoI am glad that we are doing this on this occasion. I am pleased also that the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly), who has taken such an interest in the Association over the years, is prepared to join in this debate, because it is something in which both sides of the House are tremendously interested. We hope that we will, by this means, geta greater involvement in the work of the Association by the 7,000 members who now comprise our membership in 88 separate branches throughout the Commonwealth. At the Conference in Trinidad and Tobago a number of interesting debates took place. These are summarised in the report. I should like, however, to quote Honourable Eric Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, who said: Your Association is performing a vital taskthat of maintaining a continuing dialogue . . . between the elected representatives of countries comprising a significant proportion of the population of the globe . . . the opportunities presented by your Association for the sharing of ideas and experiences as between diverse peoples are no less valuable than the more publicised discussions which take place in more formal international bodies. It is for this reason that we in Trinidad and Tobago consider this to be one of the most important international gatherings that we have ever been privileged to host. His words were echoed by the Governor General a little later, during the opening ceremony. As always, the main the Commonwealth of Nations and world security. Here, of course, the Australian and Malaysian Government delegations spoke of the importance to the Commonwealth of the situation in Vietnam. There was also debate on whether Britain would maintain a force east of Suez. Other countries of the Commonwealth dealt with the importance of the Nigerian situation and particularly",50,Sales Tax Exemptions And Classifications
127,Mr Howson (Casey),"by leaveIof Biafra. I think it is useful to remember that in the course of achieving independence many countries throughout the Commonwealth have each been split into a number of smaller countries. The dangers of Balkanisation are such that the whole world would suffer if this process went too far. This was one of the issues that we saw in the situation between the Federal Government of Nigeria and the attempted secession by Biafra. A similar situation is important in Kashmir. The issue of Kashmir to a great extent is whether parts of a country are to be allowed to secede at their own wish. If Kashmir seceded from India that might be the start of a process in which the whole of the present Indian nation would be split into a number of small countries. In the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association we have seen that the task is not to promote a splitting of countries but to try to see whether we cannot bring together in larger units some of the small countries that now exist as a result of independence movements that have taken place throughout the Commonwealth over thc last 15 years. This was one of the main subjects that was debated in Trinidad. We heard also of the troubles between Guyana and its neighbour Venezuela, and between British Honduras and its neighbour Guatemala. On the subject of aid throughout the Commonwealth it was interesting to observe how much of the discussion related to the problems that developing countries are now facing with debt servicing. The amounts they have to pay in interest and in repayment of former debts almost cancel out the benefits of new aid provided in 1970 by developed nations. This is one of the matters that we must look at as an Association during the coming conference in Canberra. The new matters that had not been debated before in the Association dealt, first with the problem of race relations. During the debate that took place, of interest was not so much what was said as what was not said. For the first time Australia's immigration policies were not criticised at an international level. This has great interest greater opportunities to take initiatives for Australia because there is a gradual realisation that mass population pressures in some of the densely populated countries either in the Caribbean or in Asia, such as in India, are not going to be solved by subject of youth. We had a most interesting mass migration movements-whic h might have been the idea current in the early 1950s. Now, there is a realisation that population pressures must be controlled by family planning and birth control measures, and that if family planning is successful, the pressures on migration will become less and the Australian immigration programme, looking at it from our point of view, will be more widely understood. It is interesting to see what great achievements are being made already in places like Barbados, India and Fiji with family planning. Gradually, the elimination of population pressures, not in the immediate future, but over a 20 year period, will make a great deal of difference to some of the other major matters which affect those nations. We also had a debate on the whole issue of parliamentary democracy. So many nations, in Africa for instance, have faced the very real question whether parliamentary democracy would survive. Takeovers by dictatorships have occurred in places like Sierra Leone and Ghana. Those countries have suffered under dictatorships and have been able to re-achieve parliamentary democracy. Those nations realise how important it is to build up the parliamentary democratic system and they look to other nations like ourselves to help them. In the debates that take place at our meetings, we try to help them to look at the essentials of parliamentary democracy and to see what are the important tasks of a member of parliament. One of the reasons why a near-revolution occurred in Trinidad a few weeks ago has been said to be because there was a weak Opposition and because members of parliament were not making known to the executive the grievances of their constituents, so that the Prime Minister and his Ministers did not know the troubles that existed beneath the surface. When a country has a weak parliament and when weak members of that parliament are not doing their jobs properly, the democratic system cannot operate properly. This was one of the matters examined at the last conference. So many people said how important it was that private members should be allowed especially on issues arising between elections and on which no mandate has been given. Anothei vital debate took place on the introduction by the honourable John Turner, Leader of the Canadian delegation. He called 1968 the 'Year of the Student' when a new phenomenon, the politics of confrontation, had been born in the universities. The root causes were the despair and crisis in values aroused in youth by the injustices which they saw in the established order. The politics of confrontation made them radical and communications media made the confrontation international. Confrontation and radicalism developed into the politics of demolition and gave rise to violence. Mr Turner said that, approaching the was to prepare the agenda for the Canberra 1970s, a new class was coming to birth, conference. I wish to let honourable a counter-culture, which was youth in members know of some of the important revolt. The distinctive features of the patmatters that are to be debated here in a few terns of unrest could be characterised as, weeks' time. firstly, the influence of communications media in creating a generation consciousness; situation in southern Africa will be consecondly, a crisis of legitimacy and a breaksidered and, in particular, the situation that down in the authority of any institution has been developing as a result of Britain's with which the youth generation disagreed; decision to send maritime arms to South and thirdly, racial injustices and poverty.

This will create a wide measure of He said that it was essential, however, that debate amongst the nations of Africa as well the youth generation should feel that change as those outside the African continent. The was possible within the political process and delegates from Malta have asked us to put by lawful means. The demand of the young was in particular for a political system that the situation in the Middle East on the would create and preserve the individuality agenda. It is interesting that the representaof man and the sense of community among tives of India no longer wish us to refer to men. What was seen at that meeting was that area as the Middle East but as West the importance of involving youth in the Asia. 1 think we are beginning to realise affairs of society and the importance of that the expression 'Middle East' is an odd seeing that parliament was able to incorterm for us living in Australia.

These are matters which, I think, are important to all members of the Commonwealth Parliawealth countries of Britain's entry into the mentary Association and particularly to us European Economic Community is gaining in Australia. Reference is made in this report to the that subject. We shall be dealing also in meeting of the General Council of the greater depth with the matters to which I Commonwealth Parliamentary Association have just referred as having been discussed at which the President of the Australian in Trinidad; that is, the whole working of Senate.

As last year in Meetings of the Executive Committee, Trinidad we saw the importance of youth in which 1 attended as its chairman, took revolt and the effect that this will have on place. I will refer to those meetings in a the workings of parliament, so now we must moment. The Association resolved to hold see to what extent members of parliament the 1970 annual conference of the CPA are able to withstand pressure groups, here in Canberra. Finally, this report gives moratorium marches, television programmes, very sincere thanks to the host branch, opinion polls and the like to make certain Trinidad and Tobago, and particularly to that we maintain the role of the ballot box Mr Rex Latour, the Clerk of the House of Representatives there, who provided such extremely good organisation for all the delegates who attended the meeting. Having dealt with the report, may I refer now for a moment to the forthcoming Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference to take place in this chamber commencing on 2nd October. As the House knows, after the Trinidad conference I visited Jersey to take the chair at the annual meeting of the Executive Committee of the CPA. The main thing that we did First, on the international front, the The second item for consideration is aid. The question of the effect on Commonin importance.

But, at the same time as we look at the representatives on the executive committee way in which a member of parliament must found ways in which we can bring together be helped to withstand outside pressure and involve many more members of the groups, so also is it important to look at Association than has been possible in the the whole structure of parliament and to past. We have developed also a new system see that parliament is moving with the times. of seminars.

Now that it has been going for 3 years I should like to quote from the annual report which has just been published. It reads: Indeed iis size and balance of membership had developed within the Committee a strong corporate feeling which hud been a major factor in the efficiency with which it had worked and the that took place just after the Conference broad imaginative approach which it had adopted in reviewing the activities of the Association. As Chairman, 1 have begun to realise that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has within its structure the seeds that Can be nurtured and, with imagination-, developed so that its international role can be truly significant. 1 have already referred to some of the developments that have taken place over these 3 years but in this period we have only gone part of the way towards making this Association a really effective force in world peace and security. 1 shall finish my term in October. I hope my successor will take this imaginative approach much further than it has been possible for me to do. As1 conclude. 1 remember the words of Mr Desai, a man in India for whom I have tremendous respect, who said that an important phase of this Association has been during this period in which the Empire has been changed into the Commonwealth. As independence takes place a period of tension always develops between the new independent country and the former colonial power; but as one moves further away in time from that moment those tensions decrease and a new sense of understanding emerges. In the older nations of the Commonwealth the period of tension is obviously over. It is obviously over in India, Ceylon and Pakistan but still exists in some of the newer countries in Africa and the Caribbean. Our task as an Association is to try to hold the Commonwealth together during this period of change because we will emerge at the end of that period with an Association that will be of even greater importance in the international world than it has been in the past. Those of us who have been to these Association meetings realise what a great task is being performed. to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Casey( Mr Howson) and 1 do so in rather unusual and unfortunate circumstances. Two of the delegates to this Conference have now passed on, the Honourable G. C. McKellar and the Honourable Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes. I express my sympathy to the relatives of those distinguished gentlemen. The other 2 delegates, Mr Harrison and Mr Peters, retired from the Parliament at the election concluded. So today on behalf of the Parliamentary Labor PartyI associate myself with the comments in regard to the activities of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and particularly the Conference at Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. I was not at the Conference. AlthoughT have been in the Parliament a long time. I have attended only 1 Parliamentary Association conference, in the Bahamas in 1968. I endorse the sentiments that have been expressed by the honourable member for Casey on the valuable contribution that conferences make towards better understanding amongst the parliaments of the world and. ultimately, the people. We are fortunate that as on this occasion delegates from this Parliament represented it with dignity, impartiality and non-politically. That has been my experience of conferences that I have attended and I do not doubt that the gentlemen who attended this meeting also acted in that way. The festivities arranged for us and the hospitality extended to us by the host country were of the highest standard. The conference was a very notable one. At the Bahamas conference I enjoyed particularly the stimulating agenda for discussion. No holds were barred. As the honourable member for Casey has mentioned, all subjects were contentious and some were very provocative. To use a term in a friendly way, one could say that it was on for young and old in some of the debates that took place. That is all to the good because I believe that tame cat conferences, while they may look well and make everyone feel congenial, are not what we want. If occasionally someone throws in a dead cat it helps the conference and improves tbe spirit, and provided delegates part as friends not much harm has been done. Only by open honest discussion at these conferences can we understand the problems of member countries be they racial, be they economic or be they political.",51,Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
128,Mr Daly (Grayndler) [5.47],"I wishThat Is why I think that in recent times the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has adopted its present policy. I believe that it is a very sound policy. There is a wealth of things to discuss in the field of parliamentary democracy-ne w concepts in race relations, Commonwealth and world security and so on. It is fascinating to attend conferences of this kind with people from many and varied countries, some of them wealthy and some of them poor, and to hear their points of view. By that means we get a better appreciation of them. We should place on record with a certain amount of pride our appreciation of the services rendered by the honourable member for Casey in his executive capacity in the Association. He retires from his position at the end of this year. He has followed distinguished Australians. I think that a former Prime Minister held a similar post on one occasion. My experience of the honourable member for Casey at the conference I attended was that not only was he a very good chairman and most impartial-h e gave me the call on one or two occasions-bu t also that he was very well accepted by the delegates and that he upheld the high position he occupied, I think with great credit to himself and to this Parliament. I hope that the person who succeeds him will be able to live up to the high standard that he has set. I do not wish to speak at greater length 1969-70 season was an exceptionally diffiexcept to say that with other honourable cult time for the wool industry. A drastic members.

I understand that other matters are to be presented before the sitting is suspended so I shall not say more at this stage. It is to the credit of all governments in Australia that they have given great support to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the Inter-Parliamentary Union and international parliamentary conferences. I hope that the practice will continue, whatever government is in office, because it not only gives people the opportunity to meet and understand others but it also leads to a much better understanding of world issues and the great problems that we have to decide in the Parliament. I support the motion for the printing of this report and congratulate all associated with the conference-ou r delegates on their representation and the honourable member for Casey for the part that he played.

Sitting suspended from 5.55 to 8 p.m. Ministerial Statement for Primary Industry)-by leave-The emergency financial assistance.",55,Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
129,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Ministe rHonourable members will be aware that wool incomes have fallen markedly over the last year. Aggregate realisation on shorn wool sold has declined by some SlOOm to $687.2m in 1969-70. However, the severity of the fall for individual wool growers is not generally appreciated. Some 90% of this decline occurred in Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales. In Queensland the wool cheque was 36% down, representing an average fall of about $8,000 per property. In Western Australia wool proceeds were 23% lower or $3,000 per property. These are only average figures with many wool growers faring much worse. Although Government aid has been of material assistance in drought areas, many producers have also had to bear costs of drought feeding, losses from forced sales of stock at low prices and the death of a proportion of their flocks. The Government has been giving detailed consideration to the problems being experienced by wool growers and the ways which are open to place the industry on a sound basis. The Government has before it a number of proposals. However the total approach is essentially long term. Further improvements to wool marketing, research into industry problems and debt reconstruction and farm adjustment necessarily take time. Short term urgent measures are clearly needed to prevent a loss of confidence in the industry, which would reflect throughout the whole economy. The Treasurer ( Mr Bury) has announced the decision to provide emergency assistance for I year to those wool growers who are largely dependent on wool and whose incomes have fallen markedly in 1969-70. The assistance will be given by way of a grant within a total amount of $30m. Because individual entitlements will depend upon the number of applications lodged, it is not possible to announce the extent of entitlements. The payment to any individual will, as a maximum, be no more than $ 1,500. To assist in the speedy processing 4 of claims, it is not proposed to pay those involving an amount of less than $50. The Government is most concerned to ensure that the assistance be directed primarily to those most in need. It is the intention to assist all growers who have been unduly affected by the drought and by low prices. On the other hand, it is reasonable to expect the wool grower to carry some of the loss as a normal hazard associated with the production of wool. With this in mind, the assistance will be based on half the average fall in wool prices in 1969-70, that is, 8%. The amount of assistance will be related to the difference between gross wool income in the year ended 30th June 1970 and 92% of the wool income for the previous year. In order to ensure that only those wool growers who are largely dependent on wool for their living receive a grant, assistance will be confined to persons receiving a substantial proportion of their total income from wool. Eligibility for full assistance will be limited to growers whose gross income from wool makes up at least 50% of their total gross income from all sources in the year ended 30th June 1969; but there will be a phasing out arrangement, with assistance ceasing where gross income from wool is 33i%. From the foregoing it can be seen that applications should only be made by wool growers who obtained at least one-third of their income from wool in the year ended 30th June 1969 and who suffered a fall in gross income from wool of more than 8% between thc years ended 30th June 1969 and 1970. Under these conditions, a large part of the grant will be going to persons in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia who have been affected by drought. The Government has been mindful of the views of the Advisory Committee of the Australian Wool Board that immediate relief was necessary, and has taken account of the principles enunciated by the Committee, in formulating the principles on which the assistance is to be given, subject to administrative feasibility and simplicity. As this assistance is to meet an emergency situation it is essential that it be made available as soon as possible. If we are to avoid any undue delay it is inevitable that some anomalies may well be unavoidable. Where these can be shown to have a particularly adverse effect because of the circumstances of an individual wool grower these will be considered as sympathetically as possible. Further details of the grant will be made available to wool growers in the near future. It is not possible to calculate the total entitlement of wool growers until all applications have been lodged. Accordingly it Js proposed to make an early interim paypossible opportunity for consideration by ment on each claim. In order to ensure that payments are finalised as soon as possible, wool growers must submit their applications by 30th November 1970. Claims for assistance received after this date will be considered only if the total fund has not been exhausted. Application forms for assistance will be available at post offices within the next few weeks. I must ask eligible wool growers to submit these promptly. This scheme should materially assist hard-hit wool growers to survive the immediate crisis. However the emergency assistance outlined here tonight can only be a first step. As1 stated earlier, the Government will be seeking appropriate longer term measures to overcome the fundamental problems of the industry. As my colleague, the Treasurer, has said such an authority. A close analysis of the the need for reconstruction in the wool proposal is required and (his is being underindustry will be examined as a matter of taken by the Government as a matter of urgency.

The Government recognises that any total approach to the problems of the wool industry entails close attention to wool marketing. It has before it a proposal submitted by representatives of the wool industry for the establishment of a statutory wool marketing authority to administer the marketing of the Australian wool clip. The plan was prepared by the Advisory Committee of the Australian Wool Board at the request of the Australian Wool Industry Conference. The Advisory Committee was under a great deal of pressure to complete iis report. I had asked it to provide a quick picture of the total wool scene including reference to the marketing structure proposed by the industry. As the Treasurer mentioned in the Budget Speech, the Government has under examination all aspects of the setting up and operation of Close aitention has also been given to the The measures which 1 have outlined will operate concurrently with the assistance which has been announced earlier, namely, the halving of the levy paid by wool growers for promotion and research and a doubling of the Government's contribution in this field as well as the financial aid given by the Government for the operation of the current wool marketing price averaging plan. All these measures, together with those which the Government has under immediate consideration, represent a concerted approach designed to deal with the real and pressing problems of wool growers and to restore confidence and prosperity in Australia's major rural industry. I present the following paper: Assistance to Wool Industry-Ministeria l Stateand understanding. All of these problems, ment, 19 August 1970. Motion (by Mr Holten) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Debate (on motion by Dr Patterson) adjourned. Trinidad and Tobago Conference Debate resumed (vide page 167) -yout h and revolt-regiona l development pleasure to speak in support of the report of the Fifteenth Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference which was held at Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago last October. I do so with a great deal of pleasure because I realise the importance of Commonwealth parliamentary conferences. It was my privilege to attend one in 1964 and I appreciated its value not only to myself and the other members of the Australian delegation but also to the members of the Commonwealth of Nations who attended it. The conference we are now debating would have been of particular value to the people of Kingston and Jamaica because they would have had the privilege of witnessing a meeting of parliamentarians of the Commonwealth of Nations. Many complex problems are facing the Commonwealth of Nations in this day and age. I believe that Commonwealth parliamentary conferences as they are constituted at present can make a tremendous contribution to the stability of the world because members of the parliaments of the Commonwealth of Nations are able to gather together and discuss matters which are of vital importance not only to our parliamentary system but also to the world. On top of that, the members of parliament who attend these conferences are given an opportunity to see the conditions which prevail in the countries in which they are held. They are also given an opportunity to get together and talk before the sessions of the conferences actually begin. I believe that these conferences are of value not only to the Commonwealth of Nations as such but also to the rest of the world because of the impact they have on world affairs. Many problems are being experienced in the Commonwealth of Nations. These include such things as problems of trade as well as discussions in regard to our parliamentary systems, are brought out into the open and debated in an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding. I believe that this report substantiates what I have been saying in support of its adoption. One has only to look through it and read some of the matters of discussion to realise its value. Such matters include the pattern of unrest and economic development. The section on economic development would be of value on its own, even if there had been no previous discussion, because one gains a full appreciation of the economic problems confronting, in the main, many of the small countries. I do not say that there are no economic problems in the larger countries, but in particular the smaller countries, many of which have received their independence in recent years and many of which are trying to find their place in the scheme of world economics, are confronted with economic problems. From the discussions held at these conferences we can learn to understand the problems of these countries and they can understand the problems that we have in endeavouring to assist them. As I said, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I support the remarks of those honourable members who have spoken in regard to the report of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference. The honourable member for Casey( Mr Howson), who has had very close association with our Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, said that it also gives honourable members an opportunity to",56,Assistance To The Wool Industry
130,Mr Lucock (Lyne) [8.17],"It is mycome back and report on the floor of this national Parliament on what they did at the conference and the value of it. This highlights the value of these conferences for many people who would not otherwise have an appreciation of their value. Today we have had the privilege of having members of a Japanese delegation here with us during their visit to Canberra. The value in meeting members of other parliaments was mentioned in the speeches of welcome to the delegation. Members of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association attend various conferences throughout the world. The associations that they make at these conferences and the understanding they gain provide a valuable contribution to the success of discussions that are held and which relate to many problems. As I say, I am glad that this report has range of subjects. They are matters of been presented to Parliament and for the opportunity to discuss not only the report but also the wider sphere of activity of our before, it would be hard to assess the value Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I am glad of the opportunity to have these discussions and this debate. J am sure that all honourable members on both sides of the House and in both Houses who have attended these conferences have an appreciation of their value not only to us as individuals, not only to Australia, but to the Commonwealth as a whole. not my intention to delay the House too long with my remarks on tbe presentation of the report of the 15th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference. The title on the cover of the report should indicate to the House the manner in which air travel has removed all boundaries. When one thinks of tbe places where Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences have been held one cannot but wonder how these meetings could have been arranged without the modern travel facilities that we have today. Places like Nigeria, India and Bermuda come to my mind as places which in the old days would have been considered far out of the way places but which are now accessible because of the modern air travel that we are Yorubas, the Hausas and the Ibos could not so fortunate to have today. Such places as Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago were in my younger days legendary places that belonged to the days of piracy on the high seas. While honourable members know that the decisions reached at these conferences are not binding on the governments of any of tbe delegates attending, i agree with former speakers that these conferences have tremendous value from a public relations point of view and serve to strengthen the bonds of understanding between countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and the parliamentary institutions in which delegates serve. The agenda set out on page 8 of this report indicates the high standard of the subjects discussed at the conference. As my colleague, the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) said, the discussions get very heated at times. Nobody is tied down to any particular range of policy. As the honourable member for Grayndler said, it is an open go for one and all. Thc matters under discussion cover a very wide great magnitude to many of the developing nations and indeed to Australia. As1 said of these discussions. 1 have had the privilege of attending CPA conferences. Apart from the benefit of touring the countries in which the conferences have been held I have been impressed by the quality of the debates that took place at these meetings. 1 gained a great deal of knowledge from them. 1 think that those who attended the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in New Delhi came away convinced that there at that conference was laid down the pattern of apartheid, lt was evident that between the white delegates from South Africa and the black delegates from South Africa tbere was such a difference of opinion that at times they would not travel together on the same bus. Because of the mutterings we heard at the conference we came away firmly convinced that the near future would see such a policy as thc apartheid policy brought down in South Africa. I think 1 would be truthful in saying that most of the delegates who went to Nigeria came away firmly convinced that the enmity that existed between tribes such as the be contained and that it would break into open conflict before very long. The day that we left Lagos there were riots in the streets of that city and much of it emanated from the jealousies and the differences that",59,Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
131,Mr Mcivor (Gellibrand) [8.23],"J t isexisted between the tribes in those days. So it came to pass that there was a terrible in the Opposition caucus and that the caucus conflict in Nigeria that practically wrecked did agree to a free vote on all matters in the country and practically wiped out the tribe of Ibos in Eastern Nigeria, as we called it in those days. I think that the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr and also agreed that there should be a free Jess) who travelled to London with me in 1967 as a guest of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association of the mother country was impressed by the nature of discussions that went on and by the manner in which the delegates, particularly from the developing countries, were so keen to learn everything about our parliamentary institutions and to put forth their views on the problems associated with their own countries. SoI conclude by saying that this report contains a wealth of inforof (a) sitting days, (b) a reduction in time limits mation on the attitudes of many countries to the problems besetting the world today and Australia in particular. Therefore, like and other honourable members who have spoken, I have much pleasure in supporting the tabling of this report in the House today. Debate (on motion by Mr Snedden) adjourned. Report Labour and National Service) [8.31]Last night Mr Speaker presented to the Parliament a report from the Standing Orders Committee. After the presentation of that report I moved that the report be printed and I then moved the subsequent motion that the consideration of the report be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting; hence it appeared on the notice paper today. Honourable members will have seen that there are a number of items listed before it and will be aware that I have just moved for the deferment of those items so that this matter could come on. It is a matter which concerns every individual member of the Parliament. It affects him more specifically as an individual member than as a member of a party. For that reason, in the course of the Committee deals with 5 matters. Three of discussions in the Standing Orders Committee, it was suggested that there should be a free vote on all matters contained in the report. I have been informed by the Barnard) that the matter was considered the report. I have no doubt that it is also known to all honourable members that the joint Government parties met this morning vote of every individual member of the House. So we approach this debate, which will be launched by the motion I am about to move, in the situation where each individual member will express his own views according to the way he sees the best operation of this Parliament for the passage of its business and its national duty. I move(1) That the Report of the Standing Orders Committee in its relation to the general matters for debates and speeches and (c) a reduction in the quorum of the House, be endorsed in principle (2) That Standing Orders 72 and 250 be amended as recommended by the Committee, such amendments to come into operation on Tuesday, 25 th August 1970. After this debate is concluded, I will put down a motion on sittings of the House which will be so framed as to allow discussion of times but not reopen the principle of the 4-day week on a 2-week sitting, 1week off basis. I shall also present a motion to amend standing order 91, which relates to time limits for debates and speeches, not to reopen the principle of reduced time but to enable any particular speaking time to be discussed. I will say more about the issue of the quorum proposals in the report at a later stage. There is another matter in the report which relates to the sittings of the Parliament over the meal hours. I believe it will be necessary for much more investigation to be carried out before the House is in a position to consider the question of sittings continuing over meal times referred to in paragraph 5 of the report. When that investigation has been done I will circulate the information and then take the appropriate action for the Parliament to consider it. I would like to explain the reasons why I have put the motion in those terms. The report of the Standing Oraers them-the sitting days, the limitation of speech times, and the quorum-ar e matters on which I believe we ought to take a decision in principle.",60,Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
132,Mr Snedden (Bruce;,Minister for,61,Standing Orders Committee
133,Deputy Leader Of The Opposition ( Mr Mr Calwell,"What does that mean?copy of what you are putting before the House? Could you give it to us in a lump? member will listen 1 will explain very clearly what it is all about. Mr Charles Jones-Will we get a copy of what you are saying? member want a copy of the motion 1 moved? Mr Charles Jones-We think you should circulate details of the procedure you propose to follow. motion. I am now explaining the procedure. 1 am informed by the Clerk that the motion is on the way and as soon as it comes it wiil be circulated. If honourable gentlemen will contain themselves and allow me to explain it while we are waiting for the motion to be circulated, 1 will do so. There are 3 matters which I think should be dealt with on an issue of principle. These are the sitting days, the reduction in time limits for speeches and the question of the quorum of the House. The reason why I propose it in this way is that the Standing Orders Committee has recommended a 4-day week, 2 weeks following, and then a week of recess. In the course of making that recommendation it also recommended the actual sitting hours. I am sure that honourable members will have the report in front of them. If they look at it they will rind the times set out in the report. It important in their own way but are not of proposes that the commencement of a day's sitting shall be at 10 a.m. on certain days and at 2 p.m. on other days. It may be that some of the honourable gentlemen in the House would feel that 10 a.m. was not the appropriate hour or that 2 p.m. was not the appropriate hour. There may be some very real discussion as to whether or not that is an appropriate commencing time. But I think the first thing we need to do is to look at the principle of a 4-day week for 2 weeks with a week's recess. That is the reason why the motion is moved in the terms in which it is, to endorse the principle of what I might term a 3-week cycle instead of a 4-week cycle. At the present time we have a 4-week cycle of 3 sitting weeks and a week's recess. Each of the sitting weeks is normally of 3 days. What is proposed by the Standing Orders Committee is a substitution of a 3-week cycle for the 4-week cycle, that is, a 2-week sitting of 4 days instead of 3 and then the week's recess. It is important in my view to look at the matter as an issue of principle so that honourable members can express themselves on this principle. Having expressed themselves on the principle, if there is a majority of the House in favour of it, then it will be necessary to put a specific motion as to the sitting hours so that honourable members can express their attitudes to the particular hours. That is the reason why I am adopting this procedure in relation to sitting times. As to the limitation of times for speeches, generally the Committee has recommended a reduction of time. of the response: One honourable member says: 'Shame', and another honourable inember says: 'That is good'. The purpose of the debate is to express an attitude to the House on the principle of reduced speaking time. Then we can look at a specific motion which deals with the matter as the Standing Orders Commitlee has dealt wilh it for the various categories of debates, and there will then be opportunity for individual members who may agree with the principle but have some objection to a particular debate being shortened to express that view. The second part of the motion deals with 2 matters which are quite the same category of interest to honourable members. Therefore my motion proposes that thc recommendations for the amendment of those 2 standing orders be adopted now to have effect from next Tuesday, 25th August. As I run through the report to give it a brief description I will come to those in detail. The report of the Standing Orders Committee records the decisions and recommendations of that Committee arising from its meetings on llth May and Ist June 1970. I should point out to honourable members that although the Standing Orders Committee met on those 2 days Mr StewartT rise on a point of order.

140,Mr Snedden,"We have an illustrationprocedure that he intends to adopt. Firstly he dealt with the days of sitting, the times of speeches and quorums. He is going to move that the recommendations on these matters be adopted in principle. This is his intention particularly in regard to the days of sitting. Having established the prinYou could have in front of you, I suggest, ciple he then intends to move a substantive motion setting out the times of sitting on the days of a 3-weeks cycle. This has been set out in the report of the Standing Orders Committee. As there will be a free vote by members from both sides of the HouseI think we will be faced with a fait accompli. The principle would be established. The Leader of the House said there would be no argument about the principle of sitting times when he moved the substantive motion. We could argue only about times at that stage. Since there is to be a free vote. I believe that the discussion should take place on the report rather than that we should allow the Minister to lay down what he thinks without having given any notice to the House. If this is not done I believe we will be caught napping. Some of the decisions that are made may not meet with the general accord of the House after the free vote is taken because a number of members will not know what has been said. When these members come in to vote they will find they are voting on something they know absolutely nothing about. The principle will then have been established. It will then be just a matter of setting down times that might be suitable. Again, perhaps we will get major discussion on whether the sittings should commence at 10 a.m. and continue to 12.30 p.m. reply to the point of order raised by the honourable member in regard to the report that has been circulated to members of the House, at any stage a member can move an amendment to a motion before the Chair. This means that a motion that may be moved by the Leader of the House or by another Minister can be amended by any member of the House. The moving of a motion by the Leader of the House does not restrict any member of the House from moving an amendment. Deputy Speaker, what I am afraid wif. happen is that we will get complete turmoil. The Leader of the House wants to get this motion through. He wants to establish some sort of arrangement of sitting days. He wants to set down a cycle of sitting days and times for sitting days. 5, 6 or 7 amendments and instead of accomplishing what the Leader of the House has set out to do I am afraid that this will not be accomplished. I do not know with whom the Minister has spoken about the procedure he has adopted. However, I think it might be in the interests of the Minister, of you, Mr Deputy Speaker and of honourable members generally that further consideration be given to the course of action proposed. The ideas that the Minister has in mind should be circulated. If that is not done I am afraid that a debate that should take only a little time might take a very, very long time. point? The very facts which the honourable gentleman has raised led me to this course of action. T took this course because there may be people in the House who feel that the commencement time should be. for instance. 10.30 a.m. instead of 10 a.m. or 2.30 p.m. instead of 2 p.m. Mr Charles Jones-Ho w do you get on if you are like me? T do not want a 4-day sitting. ber does not want a 4-day sitting he should vote against the agreement in principle. Mr Charles JonesI agree with some parts of it. ber says he agrees with some parts of it. If he is in disagreement with some parts of the recommendation, for instance the limitation of time of speeches and so on Mr Charles JonesI agree with that. is no reason why the honourable member could not move an amendment to the part with which he disagrees. That is the reason that the motion is cast in these terms. It is to allow honourable members if they wish to move amendments which tions.

His disagreement is either with sitting days or quorums Mr Charles Jones-There are 5 points and I agree wilh 3 of them. is free to move the strict sense at this given moment we are not proceeding according to the Standing Orders. I have allowed a certain amount of question and answer in an endeavour to allow tbe House to place itself in a position where we might be able to get some appreciation of what is involved. What concerns me at the moment is that we are getting further into a state of confusion with the questions and answers that the Chair has allowed. 1 feel that the motion moved by the Leader of the House when it is circulated may answer some of the queries that at the moment are being raised by honourable members during this discussion. In regard to thc point raised by the honourable member for Newcastle relating to sitting days, if the Chair can make an observation, I feel that honourable members perhaps have to decide on the sitting days before we go into the matter of hours. If this is not done the House may spend a great deal of time deciding on what hours the House will sit only to find then that the days of sitting might be rejected by the House, in which case the debate on the hours would have been wasted. Mr CalwellI rise to a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. In view of your enlightened remark that what we are doing is not in accordance with the Standing Orders, I want to know under what standing order or orders this House can determine something in principle. In the long period that I have been here-and perhaps I have been here too long-ther e has always been a specific proposition put to the House. Honourable members vote for it or they vote against it. They do not vote for some airy-fairy notion in principle to be followed by something else later. I ask you, Sir, to rule on the question whether the House can decide a question in principle and by that decision inhibit the House from discussing propositions that might come up consequent upon that decision? 4he point of order raised by the right honourable member for Melbourne I would say that a motion can be moved and the House can then debate that motion. In this case there is a motion before the House. As to inhibiting the debate that follows. I say that you would not inhibit debate because the House would already have made a decision by vote on that point. Therefore it would be exactly the same as the House not debating further something that it had already agreed to. question, Mr Deputy Speaker? Does a decision in principle mean a decision in vacuo? a comment on that, but perhaps it would be unwise. It is not for the Chair to interpret or comment upon a decision of the House. procedural matter. There are 3 separate items in the Minister's motion. I ask whether the Minister would consider reframing his motion so that each of the items could be voted on separately rather than in to to, because some honourable members will be placed in the position where they will be forced to vote against the whole motion because they disagree with one of the 3 items and this would defeat the object of the present motion. Mr Charles JonesI have been trying to get to my feet now for some 10 minutes to a quarter of an hour. remind the honourable member for Newcastle that he has already spoken. Mr Charles Jones-No, I bave not. able member for Newcastle has already made a comment. That is what I meant.",63,Standing Orders Committee

155,Mr Deputy Speaker,"The honourMr Charles Jones-Begging your pardon, Sir, this is my first gallop. honourable member for Newcastle speaking in the debate or raising a point of order? Mr Charles JonesA point of order. We are discussing a point of procedure and I want to make a submission to the Leader of the House along similar lines to the matter raised by the honourable member for Corio. The Leader of the House has submitted 5 points to the Parliament and asked it to vote for or against them or to move amendments. I hate to think of the confusion that will follow as a result of the number of amendments which will be submitted to the House. For instance, I disagree with item (a) in part (1) which relates to sitting days. I am opposed to a 4-day sitting week. But1 agree with item (b) which proposes a reduction in time limits for debates and speeches. I am opposed to item (c) which proposes a reduction in the number of members necessary to form a quorum. I agree with the whole of part (2). What sort of amendment would 1 move? It has been suggested that each of these 5 points be dealt with seriatim. This would overcome the whole problem and wrap up the debate quicker. Mr SneddenI take the point that has been made by the honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Newcastle. There is provision understanding order 166 whereby the House or the Committee may order a complicated question to be divided. I do not think there is any need for me to alter the terms of the motion. What can be done is lhat the House can decide-and I would be quite willing to have it do this-to take, in terms of my motion, part (1), that the report of the Standing Orders Committee in its relation to the general matters of (a), (b) and (c) be endorsed and vote on each part separately. I do not think there is any need to separate the other two matters mentioned in the motion. 1 would be surprised if anybody wanted to separate the other 2 matters. I move that items (a), (b) and (c) be voted on separately? would be better to do what we normally do when a suggestion is made by a Minister. Does the House agree to the suggestion made by the Leader of the House in relation to the 3 items that have been mentioned? without prejudicing my further right to speak on this matter? able member for Wills is tempting me terribly. standing that we will be able to exercise an independent and free vote on every item in the report of the Standing Orders Committee. I sympathise with the objectives of the Leader of the House but the procedure he has adopted puts us in an invidious position. It is really impossible to sort out the position and decide whether we can insert something new in, or leave something out of, the Standing Orders. It is my belief that the correct procedure, in accordance with the practices of the House, is that in the first instance the simple motion should be moved that tbe report be received. Then we can take each item separately and agree on the proposals we want and fight about the ones we do no! want. The motion should be that the report be received and not that it be adopted. order raised by the honourable member for Wills has been dealt with already. The matter before the House now is the suggestion of the Leader of the House that the House consider items (a), (b) and (c) separately. If the House agrees to that course the Chair will allow that procedure to be fallowed and the motion will be moved in that way. Mr DalyI came into the chamber a little late, Mr Deputy Speaker. Are we discussing items (a), (b) and (c) of the Minister's motion or paragraphs of the Standing Orders Committee's report? cussing the Minister's original motion.

Dr GunI want to take a point of order further to that taken by the honourable member for Wills. I think that in your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, you failed to distinguish between the report of the Standing Orders Committee and the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee. The point that the honourable member for Wills was making was that we should go through the report item by item. There are several items and several paragraphs in this report, but there are only 3 substantial recommendations on which the Leader of the House proposes we should make decisions. However, I have specifically in mind, and I think the honourable member for Wills also has in mind, paragraph 5 on the first page of the report of thc Standing Orders Committee relating to proposals which were circulated by the point of order raised by the honourable member for Kingston is not a valid point of order. The motion of the Leader of the House covers only a portion of the report and it is that portion mentioned in the motion that the House is considering at the moment; not all the other matters that are related to the report or the recomChair asked then whether it was the wish mendations. It is that motion that the House is considering and the suggestion that the Leader of the House has made in view of the points of order that have been raised. give an assurance that the House will have the opportunity to debate and, if necessary, to vote on matters on which the Standing Orders Committee presented a report but did not make specific recommendations? Mr Snedden1 can give no such undercedural difficulties at this stage-a t least, I taking. The report is before the House hope so. I hope that, during the course of and honourable members can speak to the the debate, we will not have points of order matters contained in the report. As to what taken on matters of procedure which will flows from their speeches I am unable to avoid the resolution of the issues which now anticipate, therefore I cannot answer the have become important for the House to question. seek your clarification as to how this matter should be dealt with, because I want to time to time in the past. What has been the usual procedure? If the Leader of the House comes along with a list of proposed amendments in precise terms and makes some explanation of those amendments in a general way with arguments as to why these should be adopted in principle and so forth, then the House has the opportunity to vote on each specific proposal to amend the Standing Orders. We have a general debate and we are able to vote on the particular matters. It seems to me that the same procedure ought to be followed as on other occasions when the Standing Orders are amended. -In reply to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Bradfield. I suggest to the honourable member again that the only matter before the House at the moment is a suggestion by the Leader of the House in these terms: (1) That the Report of the Standing Orders Committee in its relation to the general matters of (a) sitting days, (b) a reduction in time limits for debates and speeches and (c) a reduction in the quorum of the House, be endorsed in principle. . . . The Leader of the House has suggested that there should be a separate vote on the 3 parts of that section of his motion. The of the House to proceed as suggested by the Minister. At this moment, this is the question that has been asked of the House. The House has to decide whether it wishes to proceed with the debate and whether it wishes to proceed along the lines as suggested by the Minister, that is, taking the parts of the motion, which I have read, separately.

[Extension of time granted.] the Minister for Social Services( Mr to make consequential amendments to the Wentworth), for the extension of time granted to me. The report of the Standing Orders Committee was circulated to all honourable members in July. The matter has been considered in the Party rooms of Parties on both sides of the House. So that the debate may proceed in a composite form, 1 shall set out briefly what the Committee has recommended. The first recommendation of the Committee is that the sittings of the House be based on a cycle of 3 weeks-Tuesday through to Friday in the first week, Monday through to Thursday in the second week, with no sittings in the third week. Commencing times would be, as the report recommends, variously 10 a.m. or 2 p.m. with rising times at 10.30 p.m. or such later time as may on occasions be necessary, except that on the Friday of the first week the anticipated rising time would be about 4 p.m. Jt is that matter-the actual hours of sitting-whic h 1 feel ought not to be intruded into the debate at this stage because the variations could be minor, such as a 10.30 a.m. start instead of a 10 a.m. start, or something of that kind. I feel that, if these issues came up, the matter that we are deciding now would be clouded. The matter I refer to is the proposal for a sitting this would not prevent members from of 2 weeks, of 4 days a week, with a recess of 1 week, as distinct from our present system of a 3 weeks sitting of 3 days a week followed by a recess of 1 week. The motion is in these terms so that the issue will not be clouded. I should make it clear that new standing orders will be required to achieve this end and that it will be necessary for me actually to move the new standing orders. I will move them in the terms of the report of the Standing Orders Committee. Certain honourable members may oppose different recommendations. For instance, an obvious matter which may come up for discussion is the 10 a.m. commencing time on the Tuesday of the second week. This is a matter with regard to which honourable members will consider the needs of standing committees, joint committees, statutory committees and so on. We do not wish to cloud the issue tonight by debating that point. I should point out also that it will be necessary to put these new standing orders as a specific motion because we will need Standing Orders to deal, for instance, with Grievance Day and General Business Day. The Standing Orders now provide specific times for those days, but those times are related to a different sitting programme. Those specific times would need alteration. Therefore, a composite motion dealing with that matter will be proposed. Standing order 72, as at present written, prevents references in the House to any debate or proceedings of the current session in the Senate or to any measure pending in the Senate. This was no doubt a useful provision in the days when the debates of one House were not easily known to the other. But the Standing Orders Committee is of the opinion that the daily publication of debates and the expansion of the news media make the rule unnecessary. In fact, the recent practice in the House has been to allow reasonable reference to debates and proceedings of the Senate. The Committee therefore proposes that the Standing Orders be amended to allow reference to Senate debates or proceedings, provided it be relevant to the matter under discussion. As a corollary, it is proposed also that the Chair should allow reference to the Senate and senators by name although using the former oblique reference such as 'another place' and 'member of another place' if they so desire. The parliamentary history of this matter is dealt with more fully in the report. Under the terms of my motion, this proposal would be adopted by vote tonight in terms of the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee and would operate from next Tuesday. I would not think that any member of the House would find any objection to it at all. The next recommendation of the Committee relates to time limits for debates and speeches. As honourable members will see from the report, these proposed changes are fairly comprehensive. A number of amendments to standing order 91 are",66,Standing Orders Committee
173,Mr Deputy Speaker,Order! I,67,Standing Orders Committee
174,"Mr Sneddeni Thank My Colleague,","recommended. But, in the main, it is proposed that speech times be reduced by 5 minutes in debates such as second readings, censure motions, resolutions relating to tax or duty, and consideration in Committee of the Whole of the main annual Appropriation Bill or a Tariff Bill. The Committee feels that these proposed changes are reasonable in present circumstances and will not prejudice in any way the opportunity for or the ability of a member to deal with matters before the House. The Committee felt-and I agree with it-that the time that a speaker will be permitted in the debates that I have mentioned will enable each member to mobilise the facts and arguments that he wishes to present to the House and so contribute to a coherent debate. Standing order 250 sets out the procedure which may be followed where a Bill is returned a second time from the Senate and where the Senate insists on its original amendments to which the House has disagreed. When a Bill is returned a first time by the Senate, the Standing Orders permit the House to make a further amendment in the Bill, provided it is relevant to a Senate amendment rejected by the House. That is. the House respects the Senate amendment but. in place thereof, makes another and relevant amendment. The Committee thought that this ability fo make a further amendment in the Bill on an occasion when the Senate returns the Bill a second time should be written also into standing order 250. This is consistent with the modern practice in the House of Commons and will expand the area of deliberation between the Houses. A sap has been identified and the Standing Orders Committee rr»<: recommended 'hat it be filled. Under the terms of my motion-and I would not think that members of the House would obiect to this-the change would operate as from Tuesday next. The next change proposed by the Committee is that legislative action be taken to reduce the quorum of the House from one-third to one-fifth of its members. The present quorum of one-third is fixed by section 39 of the Commonwealth Constitution which provides: Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the presence of at least one-third of the whole number of the Members of the House of Representatives shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of Meetings of committees, of sub-committees. the House for the exercise of its powers. The case for the proposed alteration is well documented in the report. But, if the House will listen to me, I would like to deal with some of those factors. The Committee recognised the importance of ensuring that the House acts responsibly in carrying out its constitutional and parliamentary functions, particularly when the House is voting in division. It was clear, however, that this would not be at risk as, for many years, the number of honourable members voting in a division has been well in excess of the quorum required and the Committee had no reason to think that this would not continue. Por instance, over the last 5 years, when the quorum has been either 41 or 42 depending on the total number of honourable members, the number of honourable members voting in division has varied between a maximum of 115 and a minimum of 66 but the average number of honourable members voting in a division has been between 93 and 96, an extremely high figure. There have been only 4 occasions in the years since 1901. the last being in 1934, 36 years ago, when there was a lack of quorum on division but on each of these 4 occasions the question was the purely formal one for ths adjournment of the House. That the quorum requirement for the House of one-third is out of step with provisions which have been found realistic and acceptable in other parliaments is established by the table on page 8 of the Committee's report which shows that the bigger the membership of the legislature the lower the percentage required for a quorum. For instance, the Tasmanian Assembly with a membership of 35 has a quorum requirement of 40%; the Ceylon House of Representatives with a membership of 157 has a quorum requirement of 13%; the Canadian House of Commons with a membership of 263 has a quorum requirement of 7 i % ; the United Kingdom House of Commons with a membership of 630 has a quorum requirement of only 6 i % . The changed circumstances of the House since federation have made a reduction in the quorum necessary and reasonable. The considerable growth in the scope and volume of Commonwealth affairs has increased ths demands on honourable members to the point where they have to make the maximum effective use of their available time, particularly while they are in Canberra. of the parliamentary political Party to which they belong, together with correspondence and discussions with constituents visiting the national capital are among the many things which impose calls on the honourable member's time, apart from attendance in the House itself. I think it is fair to say that never bas this House been more dynamic than it is at the present timeI use the term 'dynamic' in the proper sense of the word-and this is as it should be. A quorum is not the test of the effectiveness of the Parliament except perhaps inversely. There is now a complexity in legislation, there is involvement, there is a very real sense of the need to service the Australian electorate by all honourable members. [Extension of time granted] In all the circumstances the Committee reached the conclusion that although there may have been good reason for a requirement as high as one-third in the early years of the House this is no longer the case and a reduction to one-fifth would serve the best interests of the House, honourable members and the electors whom they represent. The Committee recommends that legislative action in accordance with the Constitution be taken to effect this reduction. Depending on the outcome of the vote in this debate 1 will arrange for the introduction of a Bill to reduce the quorum. One final point I make is that the Committee also recommended that the quorum requirement in the Committee of the Whole should continue to be the same as the number required in the House. I have moved the motion and the House has agreed to the adoption of the procedure of voting separately on items (a), (b) and (c) of the first part of the motion. If honourable members want to vote separately on the amendments to standing orders 72 and 250 I have no objection, although I would not expect there would be any opposition and perhaps they could be carried together. suggested, that is, that there should be a will have access to Ministers and will have separate vote on sections (a), (b) and (c). the opportunity to raise matters of national I think the Minister might also give an importance in this Parliament during the assurance to the House that there will be 3-day week. If business is completed in 15 a separate vote on the other 2 proposiweeks Parliament will be in recess for a tions. I think that would meet the wishes much longer period. Then the only way of honourable members on this side of the honourable members will be able to raise House. Mr CalwellI rise to order. I accept nothing. Both parties have agreed this will be a free vote. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has no right to say that we accept something. I am not committed by any assurance that I accept anything that anybody else says. I want to have a say. order. Mr IrwinI rise to order. We are discussing the Standing Orders Committee's report and on the table throughout the debate has been your proposal, Mr Speaker, which has caused confusion within the House. that proposal I (a) be agreed to. Mr ScholesI rise to order. It was agreed that points (a), (b) and (c) be voted on separately. I would think that the entire motion would be before the House during thc debate as opposed to only point (a). to take each vote separately and I am putting the question now that proposal (1) (a) in relation to sitting days be agreed to. [9.17]I oppose the proposition that we adopt a 4-day sitting week. I consider that there are many reasons why honourable members should not commit themselves to a 4-day week. Firstly, we have no guarantee from the Government that the sittings will continue for any length of time or that honourable members will be given the opportunity of debating at length measures brought before the Parliament. Let me state a hypothetical example. Suppose that in the autumn or spring session of Parliament there is sufficient business for 60 sitting days. If a 4-day week is introduced the Parliament will sit for 15 weeks. If there is a 3-day week the Parliament will sit for 20 weeks and that will mean that the Parliament will be in recess for a much shorter matters of importance to their electorates, their parties or the people as a whole will",67,Standing Orders Committee

179,Mr Speaker,The House has agreed,69,Standing Orders Committee
180,Mr Charles Jones (Newcastle),"be by writing to the Prime Minister or the Minister in question. We will not be able to subject Ministers to continuous questioning, raise matters of urgency, speak on adjournment motions or do other things that honourable members are entitled to do under the Standing Orders to bring to the attention of the Parliament matters which concern them and their electorates or the nation as a whole. For that reason alone we should dispose of the proposition for a 4-day week which has been put before us on the supposition that honourable members will travel less, that it will involve less travelling between their electorates and this place. On one occasion a senator stated in my company that one would think that the sitting hours of this Parliament were framed to provide business for the airlines. I am not held a meeting on Monday of this weekconcerned with the airlines; I am concerned with doing a job in my electorate and doing a job in this place. With a 3-day week we will be in a much better position to bring matters continually before the Parliament. If the Government had proposed to us tonight: 'Whether it be a 3-day week or a 4day week we will sit from the first Tuesday in February to the last Thursday in May' -'that is a sitting extending over 4 months I would agree to a 4-day week. If the Government were to say also: 'In the Budget session we will sit from the first Tuesday in August to the last Thursday in November'-that would be the minimum sitting period-yes , there would be some sense and logic in a 4-day week. But the way I see itI emphasise this-is that this is an attempt to close this Parliament as quickly as is possible so that the Executive will be able to continue to rule and dominate the affairs of the Parliament. We would become increasingly a rubber stamp for the Executive, whether a Labor Government or a Liberal-Country Party Government was in office. There are many other points to be taken into consideration. I see a member's responsibility as something more than attending in this place. If you consider the number of members who speak in the Parliament you will agree with me that some honourable members rarely participate in debates. In fact a former member of this House had the proud reputation of having made only 1 speech during the whole of his time in the Parliament. It is not a matter overtime, but as far as other honourable of the number of times that a member speaks in this place. If some honourable members want to become a rubber stamp for the Executive, that is a matter for them. As I see it, a member has 2 responsibilities. Firstly, he is required to be here as often as he can while his health permits him to do so, and if his health deteriorates to the extent that he cannot be here then the sooner he resigns the better. Secondly, a member has a responsibility to his electorate and to his constituents. I know that most honourable members attend their offices daily when the House is in recess. Another matter concerns me greatly. I have established an understanding in my electorate that I am in my office every Monday except in exeptional circumstances -on e sucb occasion arose when my Party or should a committee of which I am a member meet on that day. I might add that when a Monday sitting is suggested I always try to use my influence with the committee not to sit on that day. The proposal before us is to sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the first week and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the second week. That will throw members out of their routine in their oflices. At present their constituents know the days on which their member can be interviewed. Whether it be a Monday, as in my case, or a Friday is immaterial but at least let us have some set days on which we can be in our oflices so that our constituents will know when they can interview their member. With the present 4-day sittings my secretary and I rarely leave my office before 8 p.m. on Mondays and there have been occasions when we have not left until 9.30 p.m. I do not think this is a fair go. Under the proposed arrangement we will not be in our electorate offices for a period of 10 days. Further, according to the programme which has been outlined a member will not be in his office on ordinary working days which I classify as from Monday to Friday. If honourable members decide to change the Standing Orders to provide for the proposed sitting days we will have to look at the question of the payment of overtime for the staff we engage. At present the payment of overtime is not permitted. Ministers are all right. They can bring their staff on duty whenever they wish to do so and pay them members are concerned the position is different. If the 4-day sitting week is introduced we should be given authority to bring in staff on a Saturday and a Sunday to clear the business which has accumulated in our offices while we have been in Canberra, and to pay the staff overtime. I suppose most people try to stick to a S-day week, but in industry if it is necessary to work overtime on a Saturday and a Sunday the staff concerned is paid overtime. I cannot see any reason why, under the circumstances which may be created here tonight, we should not have the opportunity and the right to bring in staff over the weekend to dispose of correspondence and other business which accumulate in our offices while we are away, and to pay the staff overtime. These matters must be taken into consideration. Another matter which has been raised is that if we sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the first week and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the second week honourable members who have to travel long distances will stop over in Canberra on Saturdays and Sundays. I have spoken to a few honourable members who live in Western Australia and other far distant places and they all have indicated to me that if the House rises on Friday afternoon of the first week they will pack up and go home. I know that I will go home. I have no intention of remaining in Canberra on Saturdays and Sundays. If that is what the Standing Orders Committee has in mind, I am one who will not cooperate with it. As far as I am concerned 1 will be going home as soon as I can get out of this place. Travel will not be saved by the introduction of a 4-day week. Possibly things will only be complicated for members. I oppose the proposition. We cannot move an amendment. There will be a straight out vote for or against it. But if the interest. proposition is adopted, when the Minister proposes his next motion at least let us look at the possibility of working on the same 4 days in the 2 weeks that we might sit. pretend that in weeks gone by I did not adopt the same policy as that enunciated by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones). In fact I do not suppose it is breaking a confidence to say that in my Party room some time ago I spoke in the same vein as he did. But I wonder whether the honourable member and perhaps some members of his Party have stopped to consider the ramifications of the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee. Although they represent some inconvenience to me, as they would to the honourable member for Newcastle, I am now convinced that this is a move in the right direction. I should like to try to explain my reasoning to the House. First of all, whether we accept it or not, Canberra is regarded by the community in general as something of a white elephant. There is no question in my mind that in time to come members of Parliament, whether they like it or not, will be here for the majority of the year putting in their time on committee work, as has been suggested by honourable members, particularly the younger ones, on both sides of the House. I regret that this will occur but I believe that it will. In looking at the proposed amendments to the Standing Orders we have to take into account the fact that it might well prove to be the position in the future that members of the Commonwealth Parliament will be anchored here for the majority of the time working full time on committees and on other jobs with staff supplied for that purpose. ting up of committees? will restrain his undoubted exuberance for a couple of minutes 1 will continue my remarks. As I have said, whether we like it or not the chances are that we will be working full time in Canberra. When that does come about we will have an even harder job explaining to our constituents that in Canberra we are looking after the national setting up of committees? member for Chifley will cease interjecting. would ask the House to consider these recommendations. It is inconvenient for me when I am unable to get a longer weekend. I agree with what the honourable member for Newcastle said in this respect. I have no intention of being in Canberra on Saturday or Sunday.",69,Standing Orders Committee

The point I wish to make is that as a stop gap, pro tempore measure I regard these recommendations by the Committee as being of importance to the Parliament. When we consider these recommendations let us stop for a minute and look not at our own personal convenience entirely but at the function of this House and determine in what way we can get better performance because it is largely on performance that this place will be judged by the people of Australia. I remember very clearly 2 recent debates, one on the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities and another on Meals on Wheels. During those debates honourable members for one reason or anotherI do not deny for a minute their interest-too k part and put their views to the Parliament, very largely I suppose on behalf of their constituents. But in the national order of priorities those Bills were very low in importance and of very low financial significance and yet this House wasted an extraordinary amount of time on such simple measures. Whilst all honourable members may be in agreement with the principles involved other major issues will crop up even more frequently in time to come which will be of major importance to the nation. Any move which will give additional debating time to honourable members which this recommendation will achieve in terms of approximately 30 days compared to 27 days in a normal sessional period, must be of advantage to the back benchers because it will permit more time for debate and there will be Jess wastage of time on individual debates. It will also remove some of the onus from the Leader of the House( Mr Snedden) and the 2 Whips on the Government side in regard to the use of the gag. Obviously any administration of Parliament must be elastic otherwise we would not be able to deal with the emergencies which arise from time to time. I would earnestly deprecate anyone who did not think seriously enough of this Parliament and its performance-whethe r he be on the Opposition side or the Government side-and who did not take into account the necessity for the Government and the Executive Whether the Labor Party is in government or whether it is the Liberal Party which is in government, the performance of Parliament will very largely be measured by the community on the ability of Parliament to put through timely legislation-no t 2 years too late or 6 months too late, but at a time when it should be passed. The incongruity of the situation is precisely this. Honourable members on the other side of the House have for many years been on the Opposition benches. I have not had that experience. However, I have a genuine regard for the rights of the Opposition to fight. In this context I would not have a bar of mechanisation to facilitate the counting of a division, because I regard it to be an inherent right of the Opposition to fight back on divisions, and, as it were, to waste time by fighting back. I do think that in the interests of the Parliament and the people of this country we need some reform. I do not personally regard these recommendations as a very great reform. As I said I regard this matter as a stop gap, pro tempore measure which is necessary at this point of time. I remind honourable members and those who sat on the Committee that there are many more important things that need to be considered in the future before we can streamline our methods and obtain performance on behalf of Australia and the people of this nation. I spent a few days in the House of Commons3 weeks ago and a few days in other parliaments during my journey to London and it may well be that in order to get a proper priority in debates we need a great deal more consideration from those on the Opposition benches. There are ways and means by which this can be encouraged and there are ways and means which I have in mind by which we could gain more influence as a Parliament to try to achieve these effects, although the whole principle of the House of Commons with 630 members and room for only slightly more than 200 is the opposite of our position in Australia. On the other hand we have honourable members who are virtually in a hostage position in Canberra. I believe that there are great lessons to be learnt from experiences of a Parliament such as the House of Commons, which has functioned effectively for many years and to produce performance. which has altered 98% of its standing",71,Standing Orders Committee

191,Mr Calwell,"My heart bleeds for theimpossible for each member of a parliament of 125 members to debate every piece of legislation which is introduced. We would be talking into eternity if every member of the House were to speak on every Bill. There has to be some reason used in regard to this sort of thing. We should adopt the practice of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom of a set time being fixed by the Government for discussion on each piece of legislation which is introduced, with a vote being taken at a certain time. That is the only way in which the House of Commons can work with its more than 600 members. We should adopt this practice. It seems to be to me somewhat idiotic to set aside a fortnight to debate the Budget. The case to be put on the Budget can be stated very well by, say, 10. 20 or 40 speakers. The public should be able to make up its mind on the merits of the Budget after such a debate. I believe this is the next matter which should be considered. Although it may be somewhat irrelevant to the proposal we are discussing at this stage, I would like to say that 1 do not like the idea of cutting down the time allowed for each speech. Those honourable members who are called upon to speak should be given more opportunities to say what has to be said instead of their time being cut so that everybody will have an opportunity to say something. Some people can say a lot in a very short space of time. Abraham Lincoln took only 3 minutes to say what he wanted to say at Gettysburg and what he had to say won a deserved immortality. A lot of people can cut down the length of their speeches. We do not want to be depicted in the public eye as a parliament of babbling brooks, and we do not want to be all talking on only 1 or 2 subjects. 1 have no objection to what the Leader of the House( Mr Snedden) has proposed, that we have a break of 1 week after the House has sat for 2 weeks of 4 days each. T am in favour of the proposal. I am sorry that I have had to disagree Hill and Bunbury whose activities we are with the honourable member for Newcastle, in duty bound to consider.

If honourable members were to check the arithmetic they would find that the proposal would simply mean-if we were to have a 4-day sitting week under this system-that in 12 weeks we would have 48 sitting days and at the end of a year we would have had 96 sitting days if we sat on the basis of 2 half years, which would be 50% more days yearly than we have met since I have been a member of this place. Honourable members would still have 14 weeks off in each half year and 12 weeks on. My suggestionI hope it will be written into the Standing Orders-is that the 2 sessional periods should commence every year during a particular week in, say, February and August. I believe that the House should sit during February, March, April and May and then again during August, November. In this way the House could easily sit on 96 to 100 days, or even more if necessary, and all honourable members would know where they stood. It seems to me that the great penalty which we inflict upon each other is that the eccentric nature of sittings means one cannot plan to do anything in particular. I believe that this is a dreadful place. I think it is really rather the important issue which is before us. The other point I wish to make is that my experience in this place is that the present idea of a 2i-day week results in a continual disintegration of one's life. At present we are not remaining in this chamber for a long enough period to complete some matters. We manage to get a debate launched in some way only to find that on Thursday evening we are banished until the following Tuesday. A 4-day sitting week would give us much greater continuity of work. Therefore I appeal to honourable members to support the proposition which is before the House. I believe it will assist in the working of the Parliament. I hope it will make life a little more comfortable for those honourable members who have to travel long distances, regardless of whether they do so by aeroplane or some other means. Perhaps the situation was a little different the day. I return to Canberra again on thc when the original Parliament House was Monday. This, in my book, is quite crazy sited at Canberra, but if it were being sited although honourable members often hav.; to today I would suggest that it would be do it. It is far too many miles even with more appropriately sited at Alice Springs, jet travel. because that place is more central insofar as the whole of Australia is concerned. No doubt the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Calder) would agree with me on this aspect. It is 2,000 miles from the west coast; it is 200 miles from the east coast. This results in some difficulties for some honourable members attending this Parliament-and I happen to be one of them-wh o have many miles to travel. I am in favour of the proposals before the House for sitting 4 days for 2 weeks straight-o n Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in the first week and on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in the following week. This would mean that honourable membersand I would be one of them-woul d come to Canberra for 4 days 2 weeks straight and then return to Western Australia for ths following third week. This would avoid a tremendous amount of travel for honourSeptember, October and able members from Western Australia. I am sure that after some experience of the programme they would stay in Canberra over the weekend. The honourable member [or Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) said that he would not stay in this place for 1 day more than he had to, that he would go home in any case. Canberra is not such a charming place. I can see no reason why honourable members should not-and I often do even now-sta y here over the weekend. I see nothing wrong with that at all. The electors of Canning elected me to represent them in this place. When the House is sitting I propose to be here as often as possible. It is much easier for me to be here for 2 weeks straight, as proposed, than it is in the present circumstances especially if we are sitting 4 days a week anyway which is the programme at the moment and which I understand will be the programme for the next 6 weeks of sitting. We shall be sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and the same days next week.

198,Mr Cohen (Robertson) [9.54],1 do not losing a few votes because we could not go,76,Standing Orders Committee
199,Mr Turner (Bradfield) [9.57],"I findof Parliament, as far as it goes, had some merit. But listening to the honourable member for Newcastle and considering what has happened in the past I realise that there is immense merit in what he had to say. I think that the proposal would make Parliament simply into a quicker rubber stamp. Let us have a look at a little bit of history. Let us first of all think about a few statistics. This Parliament sits fewer days and fewer weeks in the year than any other comparable parliament, far fewer than Westminster and far fewer than Ottawa. We sit very few weeks and very few days of the year, much fewer than either of those other parliaments. At the end of last year the House sat fora day, was it? I was not here. Then the autumn session started rather late this year, later than usual, and it ran through for a long time because the Government lost control of the House. It tried to steamroller measures through. It met with turbulence and opposition and then was too timid to gag when the gag should have been applied. So we dithered through that period. This session in which we are now engaged has started later than any Budget session than I can remember, on 18th August. My recollection is that the Budget session usually started on about the first Tuesday in August. This time it started on the 18th. Let it not therefore be said that there are not enough weeks in the year. Let us look at the proposal and see what it is. Let us get down to detail. We are debating this proposal: That the leport of the Standing Orders Committee in its relation to the general matters of (a) sitting days . . . be endorsed. Let us have a look at the question of sitting days. It is not just a matter of sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in 1 week and on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in the next. The recommendation about sitting days also involves sitting hours; let us be clear about that. In the past the major parliamentary committeesI refer in particular to the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Public Accounts Committee-hav e sat on Tuesday mornings. Under this system it will be impossible for them to do that. When will they sit? Nobody has told us. Not only that, but the hours of sitting involved in this little matter of '(a) the sitindecency about the way in which this proting days' involves snatching an hour here. an hour there, cutting back meal times and things of this sort. I am not so much concerned with meals but it so happens that this Parliament has the heathenish practice of having party committees at meal times. If the meal times are cut short, so are the opportunities for party committees. So under this system it will be made very difficult for the parliamentary committees to sit. The time in which party committees can sit will be cut down. NowI come to the point that there is no guarantee whatsoever that at the end of the fortnight's sitting under this new proposal-thi s new cycle, this bicycle that the Minister has referred to-w e shall know what is to be the business for the next fortnight. If we could use that week in between to prepare speeches for the fortnight that follows all would be well, but experience teaches me that we shall never know what is happening from day to day. much, I know. Under the present system at least sometimes one has the opportunity of knowing one week what is coming on the next week. If you are not quite as assiduous as, I think, the honourable member for Robertson, then you may even find a day in the weekend to make some preparation of a speech for the following week. With these things in mind-and these are the results of history and bitter experience of what happensI believe, with the honourable member for Newcastle, that all that would happen as a result of this change is that the Parliament would sit for fewer weeks in the year, there would be less opportunity to question the Executive and we would rush through legislation with even less notice of what was coming than we have had in the past. I believe this would be to the detriment of Parliament. While my heart bleeds for the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hallett) I believe that Parliament is more important than Canning. support some of those views which have been expressed, especially by the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner). It seems to me that there is an element of position is being put before the Parliament.",76,Standing Orders Committee

202,Mr Hayden (Oxley) [10.2],"I want toI would expect it would be offensive to the great Australian public. The conditions of employment we are proposing are to work for 2 weeks and then have a week off. This would surely be the envy of any group within Australia. I am happy that we have this opportunity to speak as individuals and not be bound by party discipline. I feel strongly on this. I expressed my opinion quite forcibly within the executive meeting of my party a few mornings agoI was not the sole one to do so-alon g the lines on which I am now proceeding. I believe we are elected to Parliament to represent the people of this country in our electorate and, as national representatives, the people of Australia on the great national issues which are discussed here. Our return to our electorates is not associated with the great national issues which are discussed here. Our return to our electorates-w e often forget this-and the work we do in our electorates is connected with political self survival. We want to move about our electorates to look after ourselves, to maintain our vote, to see that we come back at the next election. Frankly, that is a thoroughly commendable purpose. I for one want to return at every election. But on the other hand I increasingly feel as I serve more time here that I want to play a more influential and positive role on behalf of this country. I have grave doubts about just how influential is the role I play in this Parliament. Perhaps this is through personal deficiencies, but certainly not the least of the causes of this are the deficiencies in the way in which Parliament is operated. There is room for deep seated reform within this Parliament, and we are tinkering at the very distant periphery in that area of reform needed when we deal with hours of sitting and the period of sitting. T frankly believe that once we commence sitting we ought to be sitting continuously without a week's break every 3, 4 or 6 weeks until we complete the business of the Parliament. This is the important reason why we are here. This is our responsibility to the public, ft is because of these breaks that we run into the problem which is apparently the cause for the change in Standing Orders to be recommended to this House, that we are here over too many months in the year, ft would not matter if we were here for 12 months. If there is work to be done then we ought to be here. ThisI firmly believe. I want to mention our role in this Parliament. I believe it is a greatly diminished role, if in fact it was ever a greatly influential role. 1 do not know. I do not believe that backbenchers in this Parliament on the Opposition side or the Government side have been greatly influential, despite any theories expressed to the contrary by political scientists or political commentators. I am speaking of the time since I have been in this Parliament. It may have been that back benchers were influential at some stage in rhe history of federation, but I doubt it. The influential role of the back bencher in Parliament goes back that this motion deals with the role of the back bencher. Unless the honourable member is going to show some relevance to the question before the chair I will have to ask him to leave that aspect. MR HAYDENI will relate it to the motion in about 2 seconds. 1 was saying perhaps if we went back far enough in history of the development of the parliamentary system of government in Great Britain that significance may be discovered. 1 do not know. 1 am not an historian in this area. But in any event I am reluctant to make any concessions to the Government because we operate under a system of Executive autocracy. The Cabinet makes decisions. They are brought into this Parliament and the back benchers on the Government side pretty much have to rubber stamp them. The great decisions are not made in this Chamber under the parliamentary system today; they are being made in the councils of parties outside the Parliament. They are being made in the party committee meeting rooms. They are not being made in this chamber. This incidentally is one of the reasons why I welcome the opportunity to express one's individual feeling on this issue. Because of this autocracy we find that the influence of private members is a greatly diminished one in this Parliament. It has diminished in the short time that I have been here, so 1 will make no concessions to the Government until there is some sort of equivalent concession made to back benchers, until the role of Parliament and the role that back benchers play in this Parliament",77,Standing Orders Committee
203,Mr Speaker,"Order! 1 do not thinkbecomes an influential one. I am as concerned about this situation of which I am so critical under a Liberal Government as 1 would be in the event of a Labor Government coming into power. I would hope that we would operate better than the Liberal Government has done. We have no guarantee, and so I speak about the rights of back benchers. I want to see something written into the Standing Orders to preserve the rights as they should be. We need a system of standing committees which will allow back benchers to play a positive role on behalf of the people of Australia. I have been here 9 years and I find see out of these recommendations is further increasingly that I am suffering recurrent regression. This is one of the critical issues periods of gloom and depression because 1 of parliamentary government. am not playing as positive a role as I feel I am capable of playing in this place, because in spite of the work which I doregardless of the value which honourable to hear the honourable member for Oxley members might place on it, I do work hard ( Mr Hayden) commend the work of bipartiat the speeches I presentI find that after san committees.

WhatI am concerned about is to see an two functions. They are both important. I uplifting in the standard of our performance for one would think that the former-the in this Parliament and of government of policy function-is the more important. But Australia. What impresses me tremendously both of these functions are important and is that in bipartisan standing committees we need as much time as we can to perform or select committees most often we have them. One thing that is certain is that found that the rigid party differences have while we are travelling we are performing been broken down. Presented with the facts neither function. We are wasting time of the particular issues by experts as eviwhile we are travelling. If we can find dence and advised by an expert staff, the some way of spending more of our time committees have come down most freon these two functions, whichever one we quently with unanimous decisions. The may think the more important, we will be recommendations have been of outstanding increasing our efficiency as members of Parvalue. This is what I am talking about and liament. 1 take the point I think originally this is the area we ought to commence from-no t from the other end. I will make no concessions on Standing Orders until we back benchers are given some countervailing power to try somehow to bold the autocratic power which the Executive is currently able to wield in this Parliament. It is true, I repeat, that our role has diminished; the only power we have at the moment is to stand on our feet and talk. It is limited power. But at least it represents some sort of influence, albeit extremely moderate, for us. I do not want to give this away. The more we give away the less influence we will have.

206,Mr Wentworth,"It is a unanimousmade by the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) and echoed by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) that travelling in itself has some disorienting effect and may diminish our own efficiency in this Parliament when we are here. For those reasons 1 think we should support the proposition that has been brought forward by this bipartisan Committee. There is only one other thing I would like to say, and that is that I feel my friends, the honourable members for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) and Bradfield ( Mr Turner), have not sufficiently considered the figures and details of the proposal because if they had done so they would not have spoken as they did in regard to one important matter. They said that the recommendation before the House would diminish the times in which the Parliament was in session. This is not quite true. If they looked at the figures they would see that under existing arrangements of a 3-day week the Parliament sits approximately 24 or 25 hours in a week. Under the suggested new arrangements the Parliament would sit 60 hours in 2 weeks. But including the proposed week off in the calculation, the weekly average would be just on 20 hours-almos t exactly the same as under the existing arrangement-unde r the new proposal. So the length of the session would not be affected materially either way. I can assure the honourable members that if they look at the figures they will see they have made a slight arithmetical error in this regard because they have forgotten that the times we are speaking of are a 4-week cycle of 3 on and 1 off and a 3-week cycle of 2 on and 1 off. I would also say to them that they should look in more detail at the matter of hours, which we are not at the present moment considering but of which we will be speaking in a moment. There will then be ample opportunity to discuss not only the conduct of Committee business as it is at present but indeed ample opportunity to discuss how Committees can be conducted in a more efficient way. Indeed, anything which reduces travelling time and provides for members a greater total of time-whic h they can divide as they choose between their duties as policy makers in this Parliament and in preparing for their work in this Parliament and their duties in representing their electorates and keeping in contact with their electorates will increase also their efficiency as members, however, they may see their duty. am vehemently opposed to any alteration in the sitting times of this House. I say this not because I want to act as a brake on progress but rather the reverse because as I see the position it is quite a simple one. The more weeks and the more occasions on which we can visit Canberra the better for our constituents and the better for this nation. The net result of the proposals that have been submitted for our support is this: We will be here less frequently and we will have less opportunity to observe the bureaucracy. I have every respect for the men who dedicate themselves to the Public Service. But by the same token we have 3 generations of civil servants and they have developed an intellectual elitism which needs to be watched. Parliament is being progressively downgraded. If we were to probe into the fundamental philosophy today of civil servants, not only in Canberra but in most countries, it would be: 'Parliamentarians come and go, but we continue forever till the day of our retirement'. I happen to be rather old-fashioned in one respect. One thing I do believe in is decorum. On many occasions I would be ashamed to bring my constituents to this House and to see the bear garden that exists here. We are here to do business, to speak, to listen and to be listened to. A good deal of the time that is wasted here is to be offset further by implementing a 4-day week. With what intensity are we using our time when we come to Canberra? We are not using it efficiently. If we were to ask an efficiency expert to pass judgment on us he would not give us a 15% pass for the way in which we used our time. For example, take yesterday.

Today the major issue is between Parliament and the Executive, and Parliament is being progressively downgraded. A proposal of this nature will do more to downgrade it. Let us come here for as many weeks as we need. Let us come here for a 3 day week and, above all, let us have a fair go at the bureaucracy. words I support the proposal. I do not agreed with the arguments that have been advanced by the honourable members for Charles Jones) and Cunningham ( Mr like to reply to one or two of the points Connor), who, I think, at the moment is still objecting. I have found it difficult, howon this side of the House. The honourable ever, to listen to such argument as was put forward by the honourable member for Oxley who regards the week away from Canberra as a week off. There would not be another member in this building-in this House or in the other place, which we still have to refer to it as-wh o would regard the time away from Canberra as a week off. However it is not my intention to continue with this type of debate. I rise to discuss a simple matter relating to committees. I agree with the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) that the proposals as put before us make it very difficult for joint statutory committees to meet. The Public Accounts Committee, of which I have the honour to be Chairman, cannot meet while the House is sitting. One of the problems we have already faced with the 4-day sittings arrangements we have until October is that by conducting the public sessions of the Committee, which we are required by this Parliament to conduct, certain members, who have to come from all States, have to stay in Canberra for at least 2 weeks at a stretch. I believe that we have to give greater consideration to the work of the existing joint parliamentary committees. If the proposals contained in the other paper that was tabled by Mr must travel 300 miles to Kalgoorlie and Speaker come into effect then I suggest that the hours as mentioned in paragraph 7 of the paper being discussed will not fit in 20736/70-R-[7 ] with the correct and proper functioning of those committees. I agree with the honourable member for Cunningham that one of the great jobs of this Parliament is that we, as parliamentarians, should have our eye on the effects of administration by the bureaucracy. It is something that is creeping on us so quickly that we should be concerned about it. In any rearrangement of times, days, and timetables we must consider very emphatically the role of the committees that this Parliament itself appoints. IfI have understood the Leader of the House( Mr Snedden), I believe this is the time for me to give notice that the question of the sittings on the second Tuesday morning of the 2-week sittings will be the subject of an amendment from myself. I support the motion. that have been raised, mainly by members member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor) said that if the proposals were accepted we would be sitting for less time. In my view, and on the figures that have been supplied to us, we would be sitting for more time under the proposal that is before the Parliament than under the existing hours. The hours have been set out not in a report that was submitted to the Parliament but in a report that was submitted by our own committee, and they reveal that this is so. Under the proposal we would be sitting longer hours than we would be sitting under the normal hours of sitting in the present circumstances. The honourable member for Cunningham said there are corresponding duties to perform over the weekend-that members had corresponding duties to do. That is only natural. But, for God's sake, give those who have long distances to travel an opportunity to do those duties. How can a member carry out correspondence duties when he must travel for more than a day to and from Western Australia. Take as an example the case of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Collard). After he lands at Perth he then return over that same distance to Perth.

What about giving some thought to them? We do nol get just a bus ride home to our State. It is not a trip of half an hour or an hour. It is a trip of pretty well a day. When Parliament sits on Friday, a member returning to Western Australia arrives in Perth very late on Friday night and gets home in the early hours of Saturday morning. Then, in the case of those honourable members. I have mentioned, additional travel is involved in going to their' home districts. For God's sake, give some thought to those members. My remarks do not apply only to members representing Western Australia. The position of each of those members is bad, but other honourable members who live in country areas are affected as well. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) say that, if we adopted this proposal, we would be making a concession to the Government. Where is the concession to the Government? I look at this proposal as a concession to ourselves and to those whom we represent in our electorates. If we can sit for more time here and spend more time at home in our electorates, surely this should be our objective. Is this a concession to the Governissue that we are deciding is whether we ment? The proposal does not come from the Government. I see revealed before me tbe names of 11 persons who are members of the Standing Orders Committee. I see that 5 of those persons are members of my Patty, 5 of them are members of the Government Parties and the remaining member of the Committee is Mr Speaker. This decision was a unanimous one. So, where is the concession to the Government? Also, I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) say that the majority of members from Western Australia would still go home of a week-end if the new proposed sitting procedure were adopted. He said that they were opposed to this proposal. Well, I have not seen one Western Australian member rise and say that he is opposed to it. All those to whom I have spoken support it. I do not know of one member from Western Australia who has revealed himself to me as being opposed to this new proposal. So, when the honourable member for Newcastle says that there is a majority of them, or some of them opposed to it, he should say who they are, because I do not know of them. I think that we ought to look &t this proposal realistically. We should be reasonable about it. We should adopt this proposal, which is something new. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) raised anotber issue in regard to this matter. He referred to sitiing hours. We are not even discussing this matter at the moment. discussed. are set out. The Leader of the House( Mr Snedden) has said that we will have a separate vote on the matter of sitting hours. separate proposition. If the honourable member for Bradfield wishes to move any amendment on the subject of sitting hours, he will have the right to do so just as the honourable member for Cook( Mr Dobie), who sits alongside the honourable member for Bradfield, said he would do when the time comes. I will leave it at that. The will adopt the new proposal as far as days of sitting are concerned. The remainder of the matter will be decided after that. I ask the House to support the proposal.

I feel that at least one-third of the members of this House, probably more, support this proposal on the ground of hours of travel and the fatigue that is built into sitting in an aeroplane hour after hour, not being able really to concentrate on anything because you must transfer from one aircraft to another and so on.

226,Mr Calder1 Feel That 1 Would Be,"Saturday afternoon or late on Friday night after a parliamentary sitting and must leave again for Canberra some time on the following Monday. He barely gets time to do any work at home at all. This is one of the reasons why I support this proposal. I support it very strongly. Even when I leave here on a Friday, I do not arrive home until Saturday afternoon. I cannot go to Darwin which is at the other end of my electorate. As regards Katherine, to which ter) has referred, that is out of the question. So, I support this proposal very strongly indeed. 1 suggest that those honourable members who are against this proposal, while they may have other reasons, live in close proximity to an air terminal. It is just a quick hop, step and a jump and they are home. ment too general. the honourable member for Mallee travels for hours in a motor car to get home. I did not say that he lived near an airport at all. age and invalid pensioners come to see me. WhatI wish to emphasise is this: About one-third of the members of this House must come from electorates far away from Canberra. They are subjected to long hours of air travel. During those hours, members have no chance to read, to do research work or to carry out any of the things that can be done by members who arrive home on a Friday afternoon and who are able to go to their offices, as bright as larks, on Saurday. I work in my office on Sunday when I arrive home. I have to. I work Saturday. I work in my office on Sunday then able members-Saturdays , Sundays the lot. in the office. The week that was referred to as a week off by the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) is in my electorate a week going around the traps. I know this is so in the case of every honourable member. For the honourable member for Oxley to say that it is a week off is quite absurd. The thought that we will be able to stay here over the weekend and possibly spend some time in the Parliamentary Library and do reading and research which an organisation in my electorate called other honourable members are able to do, South Sydney Community Aid. It meets on is something that appeals to me. I feel that I will be a better member for it. That is why I am supporting this proposal. every honourable member is speaking to this proposal in regard to how it affects him individually. Speaking as the member for Sydney, I indicate that I intend to oppose any alteration in the sitting hours. I do so because of the fact that in my electorate of SydneyI interview my constituents on Mondays-as I did for 15 years in my former electorate of Watson-wit h an occasional break when I have to come to Canberra, say once in 3 months or 4 months, to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts. According to the latest redistribution figures, my electorate has the largest population of any New South Wales electorate. Let us not forget that politicians have a responsibility not only to the Party which they represent but also to their constituents. For the purpose of interviewing people in my electorate, I travel to several points. This is for the simple reason that quite a number of They cannot afford the money to travel into the city to my office there. are asking the impossible. I have advertised already the points at which I will be conducting interviews in my electorate. People do come to see me on Mondays at those points. Naturally, every honourable member is speaking from his own point of view as to the way in which this proposal will affect him. In addition to these interviews, I have 28 Labor branches in my electorate. This, I believe, is the largest number of branches in any electorate in Australia. They need quite a lot of attention. 1 hear a few interjections from members representing electorates in States other than New South Wales. It is strange to hear those interjections coming from members from States where those members are appointed by their Executives. I would remind those honourable members, now that they have brought this matter up, that it is only in New South Wales that a democratic method of electing members is followed.

I think it is something that may attend my Labor branches and the other organisations which I have mentioned. in favour of the change. 1 want to speak as Chairman of the Public Works Committee. I have consulted some members of the Committee and we can see no difficulty in the change. I would ask the House to have some regard to the position of honourable members who come from far away States, particularly the Queenslanders and the Western Australians. I think it is unreasonable to expect them to be shuttling uneasily across the face of Australia continually unless they have to. I do not think they have to and I have much pleasure in recommending the change to the House. Dr GUN (Kingston) [10.42]I just want to raise a couple of points. We are not discussing the total number of hours that are to be sat in any particular year. The number of hours that are to be sat in any year has nothing to do with the passing or opposing of this resolution. This is in reply to points raised by the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) who said that if we pass this resolution we will spend less time in Canberra. The parliamentary sitting time is quite irrelevant to that. The amount of time we spend sitting in Parliament is surely solely related to the amount of business that the Government has before us. We are not discussing the total amount of parliamentary sitting time. We are discussing how we will best use our day. We have had a number of reasons put up by the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor) and the honourable member for Oxley. I do not think they are relevant. The honourable member for Oxley said that if we passed this resolution we would not spend enough time in Canberra. The honourable member for Cunningham said that if we passed it we would not spend enough time in our electorates. I think they have both missed the point. It is dependent on the amount of business the Government has before us. There is no relationship between the amount of sitting time and this motion. They have nothing to do with each other at all. I wish to raise a couple of other points. The honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr can be dealt with when we consider the times of sitting as a separate matter. Even apart from that, is this not one of the points of being here over the weekend? I hope that we are going eventually to make the committee system more meaningful and that some of the time we spend in Canberra over the weekend, at least on Saturdays, will be devoted to committee work. Otherwise there might not be any point in being here. Surely that is one of the most important matters. Another point has not been mentioned by any honourable member. I hope that consideration will be given by the Library Committee and the Joint House Committee as to what facilities will be available to honourable members when they stay over the weekend. There are a lot of things we can do apart from normal parliamentary duties and committee work. I would appreciate the opportunity to be in Canberra a bit more. Sometimes I think it might be better if honourable members lived in Canberra. We would at least have a better idea of what is going on. Usually when I get here as an itinerant I have to ask one of the Press gallery what is going on in the corridors of power. When we are here a bit longer we might be able to find out for ourselves. Apart from that, I hope we can spend some time on research, committee work or library work and that the Library Committee and Joint House Committee will see to it that if we pass this resolution we will be able to spend time over the weekend in the library and making use of rhe facilities in the House. have not been influenced by anything I have heard here tonight.

When Mr Chifley was Prime Minister in the time Labor was in ofiice the House had to rise because on occasions there was not a quorum. We were supposed to sit till 4 o'clock on Fri2 airports located 30 and 68 miles away day but because there was not a quorum the House had to rise. Things are just about getting to that stage now. After all, everyThat is how the timetables work out. I body wants to get away early on a Friday. No-one is prepared to see it through. There are a handful of people here on Friday so what chance has the honourable member for Kingston got of getting honourable members here on a Saturday. It is just a dream that you cannot take into consideration. I have been here a long time and have seen what happens. Let me refer to one or two other the same opportunity as honourable things that have been said. The right members who live in Sydney and Melhonourable member for Melbourne bourne? As soon as the House gets up on ( Mr Calwell) said that this proFriday-the y will be asking for leave to posal suits Sydney and Melbourne get away early-the y will go home. There members; it suits them admirably. He is no doubt about that. Do honourable proved it suited Sydney and Melbourne members think that of those from Sydney because he supported it. Apparently most and Melbourne more than 2 or 3 will stay honourable members say they will not here? I think not. They will go home and remain in Canberra. I would like to see there is not the slightest doubt about that. a show of hands to know how many would stay in Canberra but that cannot be done. Other honourable members say we could here, when the Chifley Government was in have committee meetings at the weekend. office and whilst this Government has been As far as their electorates are concerned, in office, the main thing I think about is the honourable members do not lose votes by late nights. They are the things we should being here. They lose votes by not being overcome. After all, if we sit till 3 o'clock here. IfI went to some function in the in the morning for 3 or 4 days and until Mallee electorate when Parliament was 4 p.m. on Fridays what good are we in sitting I would have-withou t exaggerating our electorates? I find the young men are a dozen people come to me and ask why the first to go to sleep in this House so I was not in Canberra. Apparently members do not blame the old men. I am speaking say they are very pleased to be in their of the average. I would not have a chance electorates because they are not important of getting home. That would not matter enough to be in Canberra to attend to very much. I want to say very definitely their job. This is the way things work out. that I am against the proposition. I will As the honourable member for Cunningvote against it because if I looked at what ham ( Mr Connor) said, this is the place. it says I could say: 'This is fine-Tuesday It is also our place to be in the chamber 2 p.m. to 10 p.m.' But this can be changed as far as quorums are concerned. How afterwards. It would be fine if it were 2 often have I heard honourable members p.m. to 10.30 p.m., 10 a.m. to 10.30 p.m., come into the chamber when there is a 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. If that were right I would vote to be taken and say: 'What are we vote for it. But1 turned the page of the voting on?' No-one tells them. They just report and found that this is subject to follow whatever"" is happening. This happens what the Government may decide to do. all the time. I listened very carefully to the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden), who decided against the proposal for a reason that has nothing to do with the subject. My colleague, the honourable member for Northern Territory ( Mr Calder), said that I do not live near airports. I do. I live near but the planes always run in opposite directions from the way I want them to. heard honourable members say that the Western Australians have to sit in an aeroplane for 3i or 4 hours. That is a luxury. It is said that everyone puts his own case. Let me put mine. I have put it here often; let me put it again. The railway goes to the town where I live but it is impossible for me under the proposed system to go home at the weekend by public transport. Why should I not have When I think of sittings since I came It could decide to sit, not till 10.30 p.m. hut till 5 o'clock in the morning because at 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m. the question relating to the adjournment of the House would be put and if the Government wanted to carry on it could negative the question and the House would continue to sit just the same as ever. Therefore, that proposal will not overcome late night sittings and that is one thing that I want to overcome. I am an individualist in this job and T think if we sat for 4 days a week for 2 weeks I have some supporters. I want to do away with late nights. I am opposed to the proposition for a number of reasons which I will not detail tonight. When the proposition comes to the vote I will vote against it and that will prove my sincerity. oppose the proposition. I should like to deal with a few of the points that were raised earlier this evening. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Giles) stated that there was a very great need for the reform of the procedures of this House. I do not think that too many honourable members would disagree with that. He referred to committees and said that the day would come when the committee system would be instituted, but when I asked him by interjection whether he would support the committee system and would vote for it-h e will get the opportunity pretty soon nowbe did not answer. I do not think he is being fair dinkum in his remarks. Either he believes that this is a reform or he is trying to make it out to be a reform. Let us look at the proposition. The most important thing is for this House to sit for as many montbs of the year as is possible as a forum and as a watch dog to ensure that the Executive does not have unbridled rein and unbridled opportunity to govern for the greater part of the year. I think we must look at the history of recent events. As the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) said tonight, the Government tried to be too rigid in its method of handling the House during the last sessional period and it was faced with revolt. Accordingly it lost control and the House sat for 4 days a week instead of the traditional 3 days. The Government has suddenly realised that if it can continue the 4-day week sitting cycle the House, in normal circumstances, will meet for fewer months of the year than it has been meeting in the past, given the same amount of legislation to handle. The proposal is to concertina the sittings of the House so that the period in which we will be able to act as a watch dog on the Executive and determine the government of this country will be reduced. That is the motive behind it. lt is true lhat we would sit for the same number of days in a 12 weeks cycle on and I week off as we would if we sat for 4 days a week for 3 weeks on and t week off. But the important thing is that 4 sitting days a week would become a permanent arrangement to enable the Government to concertina the business of the House and to sit for fewer months of the year, thus depriving the public, the Press and this Parliament of the opportunity to act as a watch dog on the Executive. That is the base motive behind this proposal before the House. That is why the Ministry is so keen to see it implemented. Without doubt there are other aspects to be considered. If the House met on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the first week and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the second week difficulties would be created such as those mentioned by the honourable member for Sydney( Mr Cope) and other honourable members who have set days for interviewing constituents and for meeting the normal commitments that a member of Parliament has to meet. If the proposal were adopted it would be far better to sit for the same days on each week and for us to have the same day off, whether it be a Monday or a Friday, so that we would be able to make long term commitments. However, I repeat that the most important thing to look at is the way in which this proposal for a 4-day sitting week arose and the motive behind it. It will mean that overall the House will be in session for a shorter period and will be in recess for a longer period. The Government wants to concertina the sittings by meeting for 4 days a week instead of 3 days a week. The Executive has suddenly realised, as a result of the circumstances which arose during the last sessional period, that it has an opportunity to govern for longer periods by virtue of the fact that the Parliament will be in recess for longer periods. For those reasons I oppose the proposition.",85,Standing Orders Committee
239,Mr Armitage (Chifley) [10.51],"IDr SOLOMON (Denison) [10.56]A number of honourable members have indicated their support for the motion so 1 shall be reasonably brief. I believe that a certain amount of obscurantism is involved in what has been stated by the honourable member for Chifley( Mr Armitage) and I think we should get one or two simple facts of the matter straight. The proposal is that we sit on a certain number of days on what is essentially taken to be a 12-week cycle. It is true, as the honourable member for Kingstom (Dr Gun) has pointed out, that we are not held to that 12 weeks cycle and that, if necessary, we could increase the number of sitting weeks. Let me draw some simple facts to the attention of those who do not appear to have them straight. The system under which we operated in the past was for a 3-day sitting week repeated 3 times and then we had a week off. The result was that there were 27 sitting days in a 12 weeks cycle which involved 18 trips to and from this place. For reasons which have been put forward, some of them specious and some of them correct, that developed into a 4-day sitting week repeated in the same cycle which, if we had gone the full term on it, would have given us 36 sitting days which still involved 18 trips to and from this place in a 12 weeks cycle. What is now proposed is 4 sitting days in 2 successive weeks with 1 week off making a 4 times effort for 12 weeks instead of 3. That will result in 32 sitting days and a mere 8 trips to and from this place. I suggest that the most relevant aspect brought forward when the specific matter was under discussion was that brought forward by the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth). He took up the points which had been made variously and at variance by several honourable members that they saw their main function, on the one hand, to be here and, on the other hand, to be back in their electorates. I think as absolute nonsense to suggest that the it was Duncan Sandys who once said that he was elected by the constituents of Streatham, if that was the electorate, to represent them in Parliament, not to represent the Parliament in Streatham. I think that is true although I allow the fact that the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) or whoever else feels the same way, may hold the view that working for the electors in the electorate is his prime function. The fact of the matter is that some people hold that view and some people hold the other view. Both views relate to the proper work of people elected to this place, and therefore the point made by the Minister that the system now proposed will make the most efficient use of the dme, whether it is here or there, is the best point that has been made in this whole debate. We cannot make a direct analysis of the travelling time involved without taking up a lot of time. Let us assume that the average travelling time is half a day. We would be proposing 32 sitting days with 8 half day trips. That is 36 days out of the electorate in a 12 weeks cycle. Under the system operating at the end of the last session we would be using 45 days. This proposed arrangement is a compromise. There is no correct amount of sitting time. Presumably the logic of the honourable member for Chifley is that we should sit 2 days a week each week of the year and we would then be able to watch the Executive v<*ry closely indeed. I do not have quite the same fears. However, I understand his point of view even though I may not agree with him. I have used a little more arithmetic than most honourable members have tonight. In terms of a compromise We have offered to us now the best compromise. It seems to me that the honourable member for Chifley has not been very informed or else some of us are more stupid than we look. He could have been told lhat he has several more honourable members-and notably new members-o n h s side of the House who have ! been independently involved in trying to evolve a system such as this which will increase the efficiency of the operation of this place and thereby, some of us think, the workings of the Parliament and perhaps even the furthering of democracy in at least one of its manifestations. I regard it Executive has suddenly decided that it has not enough power and it wants to get more by putting up a system such as this. I think that is utter balderdash. I take a point with the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor). I cannot see that he can in any way substantiate his assertion that Parliament is being downgraded by the system which has been put before us. J cannot for the life of me see on anv statistical or other count how that statement can be substantiated. If it can days which begin in the afternoon. Tbere be I look forward to the point being made later during this debate. As to the matters of being here or in the electorate the question of compromise comes up again. I find myself totaily unmoved by the remarks of the honourable member for Sydney( Mr position is essentially the same. Even though Cope) and one or two other honourable members. I think he put his position most explicitly. He is used to meeting his electors secondary importance compared with siton a Monday morning. He may be used fo taking that is no reason for not having it twice a week or changing the time to Thursdays. That sort of inflexibility is something which the honourable member for Sydney should not be particularly proud of however long he may have practised meeting his constituents on a Monday. It would be a simple mat'.er to change the meeting day to a Friday or a Saturday or some other day which will he suitable because of the result of the propositions which are now before us. It is not often that I have found myself in disagreement in the short time that I have been here with my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) but I camot help commenting on his introduction of basically relevant-and I think specifically irrelevant for the moment-factors such as the number of days other people meet in Ottawa o in Westminster, f where, in the cast of the Mouse of Commons, there are three or four times as many members as we have here and everybody lives in and around London. 1 cannot see that that is relevant to a negation of or opposition to the current proposition. I cannot help but feel with due respect that he may have a slightly jaundiced view of this matter. Mr TurnerI just do not believe in fairy tales any more. sympathise with the point of view of the honourable member. I hope that I will nol have to hold it in 15 years time. I do not believe that there is anything more of real consequence which 1 can add except to take up a point which I think is relevant, even though we may debate this again on anothei section of this question, and that is the question of daily times. Obviously this matter affects people such as the members of standing committees. Honourable members will. see that it is proposed to have 2 are 2 days proposed to commence in tbe morning. Essentially that is the position which we now have. With a small fluctuation of half an hour or an hour or so at the end of the day as is now proposed the the Minister raised the matter of hours as distinct from sitting days, these are of ting days and the mechanics of their combath on a Saturday night but pression into 2 weeks. I put that point very strongly and I hope that there will be at least a majority, as there appears to be so far in this chamber, who hold essentially that point of view. I do not know if it is of consequence to this debate but I might say that I do not think I have ever seen more than half as many people voluntarily in the chamber at this time of the night in the time thai I have been here. Perhaps this means that there is some amount of interest in the procedures of the House as distinct from some other matters which appear to be more substantive. 111.5]-Although 1 have not had many opportunities to say this I have always said that the Parliament is at its best when it can debate any subject on a non-party basis, with each man being free to speak as he wishes and to vote as his conscience directs and dictates. This is one of those rare occasions when this has happened during ihe 20 years I have been a member of this Parliament. This proposal was first put to members of this Parliament, but not to Parliament, 12 years ago by the then honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). I supported the proposal then and I support it now. The Caucus of my Party by majority vote supported it then and I am glad to know that the Caucus of my Party has decided by majority vote that it will not bind all of its members to vote for it now when some members in the Caucus now, as was the case 12 years ago. disagree with the proposal. 1 think that this is a proposal that ought to be decided according to how each honourable memher feels. I think that the Parliament should always deal as a Parliament with any proposals affecting its own",87,Standing Orders Committee
240,Dr Solomon,That may be so. 1 can,89,Standing Orders Committee
241,Mr Clyde Cameron (Hindmarsh),"Standing Orders and not as a rubber stamp for a government or a rubber stamp for an Opposition or any other party. On this subject we are surely speaking as parliamentarians and as individual parliamentarians. We are speaking for or against the proposal according to the way in which we see the proposition as it will affect usI hope not as individuals but as parliamentarians-and as we think it will affect us as representatives of our respective electorates. The present proposal is now inescapable because the Government has decided that it will use its numbers to alter the number of sitting days from 3 to 4 until this matter is determined. Therefore the present proposal is not the proposal we have been accustomed to in previous sessions. The present proposal for rhe purpose of this debate ought to be at once recognised as a proposal which envisages thc sittings of 4 days each week, sitting from Tuesday to Friday with each Friday in Canberra for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by 10 days in the electorate each 4 weeks. The proposal is that we sit 4 days a week-the same as will be the case if this is defeated-for 2 consecutive weeks instead of 3, which will require honourable members to be in Canberra for only 1 Friday and 1 Monday, to he followed by 10 consecutive days in their electorates each 3 weeks instead of each 4 weeks. Now we have 10 consecutive days in our electorates every 4 weeks. Under the proposal before us we will get 10 consecutive days in our electorates every 3 weeks. I would most certainly favour the second of the two proposals because, as one who believes that the electorate is entitled to proper attention, I can see that it will give me an opportunity to give my attention to my electorate on 10 consecutive days in every 3 weeks instead of 10 consecutive days in every 4 weeks. The only questions which remain are: WillI be neglecting my parliamentaryduties by giving my electorate this additional time? Does the proposal mean that I will have fewer sitting hours in the Parliament? If it does. I would hesitate to support it; but it docs not. If one examines the proposal one will see that, although it will allow us to spend more days in our electorates than is now possible over, say, a 12-wcek period, it will also allow us more sitting time in the Parliament. aeroplanes. spend less time in aeroplanes, as my colleague points out. Even though this proposal may require some of us to remain in Canberra for 1 weekend in every 3 weeksI refer to those honourable members who live in distant States and isolated localities, a fact which would make a return to their homes on Friday night impossible -w e still have our own private secretaries lo hold the fort while we are away, although ihey could not do it as efficiently as we would do it ourselves. This could perhaps produce a situation which the electorate would be entitled lo complain bitterly about. However, if a matter of great urgency arose during our absence, regardless of whether it was on a Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday or Friday, we would be fortunate in that we would have the facilities available to us to handle it. Our secretaries would be able to contact us and tell ns of this matter of great urgencv and we would be able to attend to it either by dictating a letter hy telephone or, on the other hand, taking down the pirticulars of the matter to be dealt with and dea'ing with it promptly in Canberra. If the new programme results in some honourable members remaining in Canberra on 1 weekend in each 3-week period instead of travelling back to their electorates -as mo«t of us now have to do-it will force those honourable members to make a choice on that 1 weekend in every 3 weeks between wasting the Saturdnv or Sunday in idleness or resting-if the hours are to be as late as they have been in the past some honourable members might need the rest-o r of nsirg the 2 free davs in each 3-week period in catching UP with one'« reading or curving out research One of the main rrouhVs with our job is that we snend loo m'ich time travelling backwards and forwards between our electorates and the Parliament. Too much of our time is a'so wasted at weekends attending to things vvhich do not improve our capacity to represent our electorates in the Parliament or improve lis as pirliamentarians. Mr TurnerI believe that lale nights impair our efficiency much more.",89,Standing Orders Committee
242,Mr Webb,We will spend less time in,90,Standing Orders Committee
243,Mr Clyde Cameron,"Yes, we will the honourable gentleman. This is something to which I will refer in a moment. I could not agree more. I agree with many of the things which the honourable gentleman said a moment or two ago. The trouble is that we cannot find enough time to do the reading and research which we ought to be doing. At least under this proposal we will get 1 free weekend in which to do them if we find that we cannot return to our homes because of the difficulties involved. The trouble is that too many of us are forced to throw away material which is posted to us for our reading. I would suggest that very few, if any, of us could honestly say that we have read every piece of material which has been sent to us through the post. Perhaps we should not be expected to read all of it, but T venture ber for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Collard). All of the to say that in the process of throwing material in the waste paper basket because we do not have 'he time to read all of it we Looking further around the chamber I can have on many occasions thrown away material which it would have been to our own advantage and the advantage of the electorate to have read. We have In this place an excellent library and an excellent library research system. T would suggest that not one of us is so knowledgeable on any subject as to be unable to learn more from fhe material which is available to us in Canberra. When we are in our electorates on Saturdavs or Sundays we are rarely free from the constant interruptions of telephone call""!, interviews and social engagements which do not improve our capacity to represent our nation in the national Parliament. Unfortunately my good friend, ihe honourable member for Sydney( Mr Cope), is not present in the chamber. No doubt he is listening on the blower up top, which is one of the facilities we have in this place. at that point, because he does not recognise The honourable member said that each of us in our vote on this proposal will decide the question according to our own individual interests-the innuendo being that we will not care two hoots about our colleagues. Of course, this is not what the honourable member meant to say. Nobody is more unselfish than the honourable member for Sydney. I have never known a more dedicated member of this Parliament than the honourable member for Sydney. It was not his intention to suggest that each of us would be so selfish as to determine our vote by how the proposal would affect us as individuals, and not to care two hoots about the position of our colleagues who live in distant States or isolated localities. This is not what the honourable meant. I did not quite understand exactly what he did mean, but I know that he did not mean that. I know that the honourable member for Sydney is one honourable member who has always had a very sympathetic and kindly understanding of the difficult position in which his colleagues who live in distant States or isolated areas, such as the honourable member for Darling( Mr FitzPatrick) and the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Grassby), are placed. Looking around the chamber I also notice the honourable memhonourable gentlemen who come from Western Australia are in this category. see some honourable members from Queensland, such as the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) and the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Fulton), who come within this category. All of these honourable members are entitled to expect their colleagues to have some regard for their position. I have every regard far their position. I also know that nobody is more kindly and more considerate of another person's position than the honourable member for Sydney. I want to say that I agree with most of what the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) had to say. He was completely right when he said that we have to stop sitting late hours. It is crazy to go on like we have been doing, sitting in this chamber until after midnight each night. We cannot do our job next day if we are required to sit as late as that. But the honourable member for Bradfield and I part company in this proposition, as I do, an opportunity to escape sitting the crazy late hours that we have had forced upon us under the old system. 1 see in this proposition an opportunity to get rid of the necessity to sit such hours. I do not think that we should have such short sessions. The honourable member for Bradfield and I are again in perfect accord on this aspect. I do not like to see the Budget session begin as late as it did this year. I do not like to see the Parliament called together for only 1 day. which",90,Standing Orders Committee

During the whole of weekend for this sort of work. 1 strongly the past 20 years we have complained support this proposition. 1 do so not only about the hours of sitting. This has not because it suits me personally. From the forced the Government to have longer sespoint of view of transport 1 can get to sions, it has not stopped the Government Adelaide and back almost as quickly as one from sitting lateinto the night, and it has can travel to Sydney and back, and perhaps not stopped the Government from closing more quickly than one can travel to Newdown the Parliament, getting away from it castle. I am not supporting the proposal for all and treating Parliament as a rubber any particular personal reason associated stamp. Perhaps the new proposal will with travelling, but I do have1 mean achieve this. If it does not do so il will not this and 1 know 1 speak for all honourable have achieved any less than the old proposmembers on this side of the chamberals and there is a good chance that it will some consideration for our less fortunate achieve more.

Although the ment parties and Opposition Party have honourable member for Grey( Mr Wallis) specialist committees operating.

Another matter which people seem to have forgotten very quickly relates to the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) who very early tonight was making comments about the Parliament and the way it should work. I think it is very appropriate to remind the House that the honourable member, with all due credit to him, obtained his degree in economics during the hours that Parliament was sitting. In those earlier years when he had a somewhat shaky seat he applied himself diligently to his electorate. But now that the boundaries, through redistribution, have given him a favourable seat he can see everything wrong with honourable members wishing to work in their constituencies. I realise that the time is passing very quickly and in any case I can see no reason why this debate has been prolonged to this hour, but I must say that contact with the people in one's electorate means a lot. It enables honourable members to come to this place ably representing the views of the people. Tonight's debate has, to a degree, been free from political tones. On occasions there has been political undercurrent. I am able and free, as a member of the Liberal Party, to use much more discretion in the casting of my vote than honourable members opposite can. I am always pleased to come here with full knowledge of how the constituents of my electorate feel on a particular subject. The views put forward by the honourable member for Chifley( Mr Armitage) and the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor) are the views of men who have been here for a long time. They think that what went yesterday is good enough for today. Perhaps this type of policy characterises all their contributions to the Parliament. It is appropriate to remind honourable members that, comparing the session that has just passed with the session of last year, we have sat for over 100 hours more than we did in the corresponding period 12 months ago. There has been a need to discuss further legislation and more Bills have been introduced. I hope that the Leader of the House( Mr Snedden) at 11.27 p.m. will see fit to call it quits for tonight to avoid many of the plaining about, such as staying up late, and set a good example on the second night of the parliamentary sitting, because everyone has made up his mind anyway. MR DALY (Grayndler) [11.27]I want to add a few brief words to what has already been said. Firstly, I think that the real trouble with hold-ups in business started in this Parliament when the break of 1 week was introduced in the first place. I am one who favours sitting 4 days a week from the commencement of the session until itfinishes.That does not suit the Government because it cannot work out its business on more than an hourly or a daily basis. In other words, it does not know what is going to happen in the Parliament from day to day. I think that the Government should set certain days on which the Parliament will commence and finish each year. As the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) said, it should be able to announce the business for the session and, once having set it, Parliament should sit for 4 days a week, or 5, right through until the session is finished. What happens now is that we sit for a week, a fortnight or 3 weeks and then lose all track of the business. This is particularly so if Easter intervenes. A session may extend over months whereas if we had sat on a 4-day week or S-day week basis we could havefinishedit within a reasonable time. Members of this Parliament-be they new members or older members-ar e very fortunate to be here at this stage of their political careers. When I first came to this Parliament and when air travel was introduced a member had the privilege of travelling once each week to Parliament and back. There was no going to Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide or Perth every weekend as one wanted. I remember one Western Australian member whose son changed from short pants to long pants and who did not see it happen because he was here for so long. When I first came to Parliament we sat from February to November!",92,Standing Orders Committee

252,Mr Jess (La Trobe) [11.32],"J do notappear to have been in the hands of the members themselves for a very long time. One of the things that has been forgotten is that most of the wrongs can be rectified if members of Parliament themselves act as I contend they should act. There are occasions where honourable members complain that the House is being detained beyond a reasonable hour. If they can persuade the majority of the members of the House that this is so, the decision is in the hands of the House itself. It can dictate when the sittings should terminate on a particular night. I heard the honourable members from South Australia say that they have been forced to sit late hours in the night. AllI can say is that I and members on this side of the House have been forced to sit late hours in the night primarily because the Opposition wants to go on and on, mainly with the idea of forcing the Government to implement the gag so that the Press will be able to say in the morning newspapers that the Government gagged a certain issue. I support the motion before the House. Quite frankly I do not think it will achieve anything. I do not think it is necessary. I do not think it will do the things that some of the newspapers contend it was intended to do, and that is to make the House more effective. The House in my opinion will become more effective only when the members of the Parliament decide that they have a responsibility and are prepared to accept that responsibility whatever their Party. I think one of the things that has been proved tonight, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr about the time spent travelling. In Western Clyde Cameron) illustrated, is that, when members of Parliament are allowed to get up and speak on an issue without being bound by Caucus or by some decision from somewhere else, even perhaps by some other men, the Parliament is able to get down to a discussion and is perhaps able to reach a solution that may be to the betterment of the people of this country. I support the Issue but I do not think it will solve the problems. I think those problems will be solved only when members of Parliament, including myself, decide that they have a right and responsibility to act on certain issues, perhaps above and beyond the decisions of Caucus. put the record straight as far as the Western they would support the resolution because Australians are concerned. They are not unanimously in support of the proposal. There are those, such as myself, who oppose this motion. I represent, as does the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb), a Western Australian metropolitan electorate. I oppose this motion because I feel that what is before us is quite futile. It does not offer a solution to the problem. In fact, it represents a reduction in the hours of sitting which we experienced in the last session when we sat for 4 days a week. If it proposed that we sat for 3 weeks of 4 days or that we sat from the beginning of the session lo the end of the session, I would support it. I am not naive enough to believe that there will be committee meetings on week ends. For example, in the football season honourable members will return to their electorates, saying that they have to attend to electorate matters, but we willfindthey will go to the football. Even with the commitments set out here it will be possible for a Western Australian to return to his electorate for the week end. Of course, the honourable inember for Forrest( Mr Kirwan) or the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Collard), because of their country commitments, will not be able to do so. But it will be possible for honourable members with metropolitan electorates to return to Western Australia for the week end. No doubt if this motion is carried I will be returning because I feel that I should be there to attend to my electorate commitments. A lot has been said Australia the amount of time some school children would spend travelling each day would be equivalent to the amount which some honourable members are protesting about spending weekly. Even some of our school buses I believe take 2 hours to get to and fro each day. No doubt, with this modern transport by which some of our members are travelling to the various States, they would return to their homes in the same time and with the same liability as the school child would experience in Western Australia. It is no great burden to have to travel long distances because of the modern transportation that we have, and I appreciate the facility. I want to see the record straight because",94,Cameron Th E Things Honourable Members Have Been Com

When I first came here we scrambling to get away on Fridays as soon sat continuously with 3-day weeks. I as possible. To anybody who was here on believe a 3-day week is the best sort of Friday afternoons the place was almost like week for the Parliament.

However sit for more weeks. The trouble is we experience showed that if we sat continucannot always sit for more weeks because ously for weeks, be it for 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 of periods when there are Senate elections weeks, everybody became a little irascible or House of Representatives elections, or and cranky.

Honourable memelectorates or to attend to them so it was bers would not accept that, because there decidedI think in about 1958 or is a need for breaks. There is a need for 1959-that we should sit for 4 weeks and parliamentary teams to go overseas and to then have 1 week off. Somewhere in the travel around Australia. For those reasons 60s it was decided that we should sit for 3 I am afraid that I cannot accept the proposal weeks and then have a week off. I have noticed that on this sort of performance, sitting for 3 weeks then having a week off, we could not cope with the amount of work that was coming forward. Last year and this year it has been necessary to sit on Fridays-that is, to go into a 4 day week. This new proposal does have certain virtues. I think some of the other proposals, that is for altering the time of speakings, the sittings of the House and the quorum of the House, have great virtues; but to try to confine the work to 2 weeks and then have a week off, and to do that for the term of the session, would mean that we just could not get through the work. Parliament is the most unpredictable place imaginable. One is never certain when it will start or finish or what work will come forward. I believe the most important thing with Parliament is that if topics of national importance or of urgency come up there should be ample time for discussion so that all bonourabe members can state their point of view. Although this proposal might give more debating hours, before long we I'he suggestion that honourable members put forward. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson) [11.45]I will not detain the House for long. However, I am opposed to the motion. I am a country member. Many other honourable members have benevolently said that the motion is being moved for the country members.

254,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Minister will find ourselves having to sit on thenight. I take the same view as does the Minister Wentworth) that a person's responsibility is to the Parliament and to those people who elect him. An average of 30 to 35 people come into my office daily for 5 days a week. When I get home on Saturday or FridayI have enough work for 1 day and sometimes 2 days to try to catch up with because of the week I have been down here. It is all right to say: 'You can do this tude is pretty right. I think honourable by telephone'. But I find that after 3 days and 3 nights in this Parliament one needs a break. I agree with the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Anthony). It is not often that we agree on something; it is very strange that we seem to be agreeing on this proposal. As the Minister said, if we sit for 4 days, before we know where we are we will finish up sitting for 5 days. One has only to witness what has happened in this Parliament when we have sat on a Friday. It is the greatest scramble to get pairs and to get out of the place as fast as possible. I am not going to fall for the argument that we are all going to stay here as a happy family over the weekend and do committee work. I have never heard anything so nonsensical. I guarantee that there will be few members here at the weekend whether the Parliament sits for 3 days a week or 4 days a week. Those who will be here for the weekend in most cases would be staying here anyhow. I oppose the motion. I can see no advantage in it except in some cases where there is a problem of travelling, as in the case of the honourable member for Darling( Mr More work might be done in that way. FitzPatrick). The honourable member has a major problem in travelling to and from his electorate. It takes him a far longer time to get here than it takes me and practically every other honourable member who lives in a country area. But I am not going to accept this benevolent attitude that we all in the propoasls. I therefore inform the stay back on Saturday and Sunday, that the Library will be open on Saturday and Sunday and that we will all have our committee meetings on Saturday and Sunday. Just watch the flights out of here on Friday afternoon. There will be no-one left in Canberra on Saturday or Sunday. Sir [11.48]I will not keep honourable mempoint (a), to a vote tonight. Honourable bers for very long. I think honourable members have spoken about it and all members know that J am a very kindly for Social Services( Mr and co-operative person. I like to fit in with what people desire. 1 have been torn between the ideas of the honourable members who live a long way away and want to get bome and those who do not. 1 think what convinced me was when my friend the honourable member for Swan( Mr Bennett) disclaimed the idea and said that he would go home anyhow. I think this attimembers will find that this will happen in any case. I do not think there is any real merit in the scheme now before the House. Perhaps honourable members are attracted to it because it is a new idea and they may gain some benefits here and there. But I believe that what appeals to most honourable members who are going to support the motion is that they will get home for a week every second week instead of every third week. Of course, these honourable members want to get home. But1 cannot see that we are going to carry out any further parliamentary duties under the proposed scheme. I think that the proposed scheme will disorganise the arrangements in our electorates that have been carried out for many years. It is not easy to get people to change attitudes and patterns that have been adopted over many years. They wonder why a change is necessary. I would not mind sitting in the Parliament for 4 days over a period of 3 weeks, in the same way as we have been doing, but even that is not a very effective method. I would not mind sitting for 3 days a week right through the session, as has been suggested. However, 1 agree with the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Anthony) that that does involve difficulties for some members and it might not result in efficiency. I have given a great deal of thought to the matter. Frankly1 do not see any great benefit House that even though I am co-operative, I propose to vote against the motion. Motion (by Mr Fox) proposed: That the debate be now adjourned. Mr SneddenI ask for the indulgence of the House for a few minutes, Mr JOHN CRAMER (Bennelong) Speaker. I wanted to take the first point, honourable members bave the points in their minds. It therefore seemed proper to take it to a vote tonight. However, time has gone on and it is now 11.50 p.m. I therefore asked the Government Whip to move the adjournment of the debate. However, as we are not voting on party lines but as individuals, I would be very happy to ask thc Whip to withdraw the motion for the adjournment of thc debate so that we could take i! to a vote tonight. Mr FoxI withdraw my motion, Mr members from both sides of the chamber Speaker. Minister for Defence) [11.57]I wish to take only 2 or 3 minutes of the time of the House. I do not know how many Ministers nave spoken in this debate. Some very interesting points have been made. Personally, I am opposed to the proposals. I do not believe that they will assist the general working of the House or make the working of the House more satisfactory from the points of view of private members and the Ministry. The proposals involve virtually 8 consecutive days of sitting. This would establish a very crowded schedule and a very busy 2 weeks. Whatever may be the intention of the 10.30 p.m. rule, I am sure that the result would be a large number of late nights without any relief for members. 1 believe it would make it very difficult to provide time for parliamentary committees and for Cabinet to meet. This would be even more difficult to achieve than is the case at present. It has sit the times we want it to sit. Therefore, been said that one of the facts of life is that as soon as Friday arrived, under the proposals many members would be pressing for pairs in order to get away. It may be that some would be pressing not to return on the following Monday when the House would again be sitting. you may have thought that I would be more in favour of the proposals. Another point arises which is of importance to private members. I refer to thc number of weeks in a year in which private members have access to Ministers because thc House is sitting in those weeks. I believe that the proposals we are considering would reduce the number of weeks in which private members would have that kind of access to the Executive of the Government. I believe that this is a significant reason for opposing the general matter which is before the House at present. doubt it will surprise you, Mr Speaker, to learn that I intend to support the proposition before the House. I have listened with a great deal of interest to honourable who have put their views in this debate. The honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor), the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) and the honourable member for Sydney( Mr Cope) expressed their views as to the convenience they would wish all honourable members to enjoy. 1 feel quite sure that those members who spoke early in the debate will support this proposition now that they have heard of the difficulties and misfortunes that face some of us who are not fortunate to live closer to Canberra than we do. J am not naive enough to believe that just because this motion is carried we will not sit the hours and days in this Parliament that the Government decides it wants the Parliament to sit. The Government will make the decision because it has the numbers, and I suggest that when we are the Government after the next election and we have the numbers the House will in that particular situation, I think that those members who have spoken as though this would not be the case are drawing red herrings across the path. The Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth) and others have said that there are 2 particular points concerning the work of a member. They have said that a member is elected to represent, in this Parliament, the people of his electorate. I agree with them completely. This is so, but I suggest that if a member is to represent all the people of his electorate and not just the electors themselves he has to give the people the opportunity of presenting cases to him and of discussing their problems with him to make him aware of how he is going to represent them in this House.

This is one of the reasons why I support the motion. Personally I would be no more inconvenienced by the proposed sitting times than I am by the existing situation. J have become accustomed to getting home on Friday nights or Saturday mornings and leaving again on Sunday nights. The people of Kalgoorlie have become accustomed to seeing me on Saturdays or Sundays when the House is sitting. Perhaps if I adopted the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Newcastle, who objected to his schedule enabling him to see people on Monday being upset, 1 would object to the motion because 1 might be wanting thc people of my electorate to see me during the week when I was not in Parliament. 1 am a bit diffident about putting this because I may be accused of being somewhat selfish. But if I want to go to the far north of my electorate it takes me 2 days travel to get there and back. In other words it is impossible for me to undertake such a journey over the weekend. IfI want to go to other parts of my electorate where there is no air travel available it takes me 2 days by motor car to get there and back. Honourable members will appreciate that I will find it easier to contact the people of my electorate under the proposed sitting times than I do under the existing arrangements. be, as the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) said, that if I am around the place too long I will not be around here very long. Irrespective of whether that is so, I think the House should take some cognisance of the fact that the people of Australia should have an equal right, if they live in the country, to see their members, to discuss with them their problems and to present cases to them, as do people who live in city electorates or endorsed in electorates where members can get to them or they can get to the members more frequently. For that reason I support the adjourned. motion. Question put: That sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph (1) of ihe motion moved by the Leader of the House The House divided.

(2) How many agreement workers have been paid long service leave during the past 10 years. able member's question is as follows: (1) Long service leave is due to an agreement worker who has 5 years' continuous service with the same employer. (2) The provisions for long service leave were introduced into the Native Employment Ordinance in September 1967 to take effect from September 1966. On this basis the first long service leave entitlement will become due after September 1971. There is however provision for the grant of pro rata long service leave on completion of 3 years' continuous service with the same employer. Statistenders for the CANDU and SGHWR types but tics on the number of workers to whom pro rata long service leave has been granted are not availrelative costs for these two types until the tenders able. Papua and New Guinea: Radio Broadcasts for Political Purposes (Question No. 1260) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for External Territories, upon notice: (1) When did the Administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea learn of the formation of (a) the Mataungan Association and (b) Warmaram. (2) What members of these bodies have (a) sought and (b) been granted permission to make broadcasts from Radio Rabaul, and on what dates and subjects. (3) What persons other than candidates for House of Assembly elections are covered by the standing instruction that Administration radio may not be used for political campaign purposes (Hansard, 7th April 1970, page 786). able member's question is as follows: (1) (a) 29th June 1969 (b) 7ih May 1970. (2) (a) and ( b ) No one from the Mataungan Association has sought to broadcast from Radio Rabaul. On 25th March 1970 on the initiative of the Rabaul Station Mr Rumet, a Mataungan Leader, and Mr Tobunbun, a member of the Gazelle Local Government Council, were interviewed for a programme on the referendum issue. On 19th May 1970 the Warmaram Group sought an interview programme to explain the group's objectives. This was arranged as requested. (3) Candidates for Local Government Council elections. Nuclear Reactors: Operating Costs (Question No. 1272) Mr Stewart asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: (1) What are the comparative (a) capital (b) operating and (c) maintenance costs of S00 MW (i) CANDU and (ii) SGHWR type reactors. (2) Has any estimate been made of the number of (a) CANDU and (b) SGHWR type reactors, which could be constructed in Australia; if so, what was the estimate. able member's question is as follows: (1) Tenders for the Jervis Bay nuclear power station closed on IS June, 1970. They included it will not be possible to give accurate up-to-date have been fully' evaluated. (2) No. It is not possible to give an estimate of the number of these types of nuclear stations which can be constructed in Australia. When generating authorities decide to install nuclear power plants in their own systems they will almost certainly call tenders on a world wide basis as the Australian Atomic Energy Commission has done in the case of the Jervis Bay project. Decisions regarding the type and number of nuclear stations to be selected will be based on technical and economic grounds. Former Members of Parliament: Positions Held (Question No. 1276) Mr Daly asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) How many former Senators and Members of the House of Representatives in receipt of a Parliamentary pension at present occupy positions in the diplomatic service, the judiciary or the Government service.

Professional Engineers (Question No. 1297) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that there are approximately 1,000 advertised vacancies in Australia for professional engineers. (2) Is it also a fact that there is a large amount of engineering work not being carried out in Australia as a direct consequence of the acute shortage of professional engineers and that Australia is spending something like $50m per year for overseas designs which could be carried out by engineers in Australia. (3) If the position is as stated, will he take immediate steps lo upgrade the salaries now payable to professional engineers with the object of encouraging professional engineers to remain in Australia and encouraging students to undertake engineering courses. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) There is no official register of all advertised 1952 vacancies for professional engineers in Australia. 1953 However, the Professional Employment Offices of 1954 the Department of Labour and National Service 1955 record those vacancies for professional engineers 1956 notified by employers. These vacancies numbered 1957 284 as at the end of May 1970. (2) No official statistics are available on the 1959 amount spent in Australia on overseas designs I960 each year. However, as other factors are involved, 1961 such expenditure does not necessarily reflect a 1962 shortage of professional engineers in this country. (3) I have no authority to determine rates of 1965 pay for professional engineers. This is a matter 1966 for negotiation between the associations and em1967 ployers concerned and, failing that, for arbitration 1968 by the appropriate arbitral authorities.

Australian A r m y : Tests on Applicants (Question No. 1314) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for the Army, upon notice: (1) What medical, educational, psychological nnd other tests arc applied to persons who apply lo join the Army. (2) What criteria are applied and what minimum levels of attainment are required for each of these tests. able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The following tests and examinations are administered to applicants seeking enlistment in the Army: Medical: The medical test consists of an applicant filling out a medical history questionnaire, followed by a comprehensive physical examination by a medical board constituted of Iwo doctors. The aim of the examination is to determine the applicant's ability to serve in any geographical location and his functional efficiency to cope with the physical demands of Service life. Psychological cum Educational tests: This examination is administered by a psychologist attached to the Recruiting Centres. Tests used are: For Other Ranks-test s of literacy, arithmetical knowledge and reasoning ability. The literacy level required is comparable to that attained by the average student in grade 4 primary school. For Officers-test s of reasoning ability and speed of comprehension standards. No literacy test is administered as minimum education standards are set. They are: Officer Training Unit-Intermediat e Certificate Officer Cadet School-Leaving Certificate Royal Military College-Matriculatio n Officer candidates are also interviewed by a Selection Board, and Other Ranks by an Enlistment Officer to assess their general military potential after they have satisfactorily passed the medical and psychological examinations. Australian Army: Comparison of Minimum Standards with Other Countries (Question No. 1315) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for the Army, upon notice: Can he say in what instances thc criteria or .. . . 1 to 3.7 minimum requirements applied in his Department's .. . . 1 to 4.1 medical, educational, psychological and other tests 1 lo 4.6 differ from those applied by the Armed Forces of thc United States of America, Britain and Canada. able members question is as follows: No exact data comparing the standards in the four countries is available and in any case accurate comparisons of this nature between countries, particularly as regards education, arc very difficult to make. The medical classification used by the Australian Army is derived from the standards developed in Canada and also adopted by the United Kingdom. Standards in the USA are similar, by and large, to ours. In USA. the educational level is set at 'high school graduate'. This is the level generally attained ut the age of 17 or 18 years. No formal educational standard is set in the United Kingdom. Applicants are psychologically tested and if a satisfactory Selection Group Rating (approximately SGR3) is attained he may be enlisted. This system is similar to the Australian method. Canadian entry standard is Grade VIII, or the educational level reached by a child of 13 years. It is thc entry qualification for high school. In summary, the minimum medical standards for enlistment are about the same in the four countries, the minimum psychological standard is higher in Canada and the minimum educational education level higher in USA and Canada.

The procedure is not that reports are submitted by States to the Commonwealth Government, but that they are made available to the Commonwealth-State Officials Committee on Decentralisation, or its Technical Sub-Committee. (2) Both New South Wales and Victoria have completed reports on what are referred >v as their ""private costs"" studies. The.: studies are aimed at discovering why firms made particular location decisions and the nature of the particular costs flowing from such decisions. (3) The Victorian ""private rosts"" report was circulated to all members ot the Committee, including Commonwealth representatives, October 1968. The New South Wales ""private costs"" report was made amiable to the Technical Sub-Committee in May 1570 (all members of the parent Committee are repiesented on the Technical Sub-Committee). (4) The New South Wales private costs report has been published by that State's Department of Decentralisation arid Development, under the title: ""Report on Industry Location Survey"". The Victorian private costs report has not been made public. Hops (Question No. 1331) Mr Duthie asked the Ministerf o r Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Is he able to say whether Australian brewers are able to make known very soon their requirements of hops for the next season. (2) Can he say if the brewers intend to import hops and extract as in thc past; if so, in what quantities. (3) Is there a large stock-pile of hops, especially in Tasmania, where 80% of Australia's hops are grown. (4) If so, will the Government move to restrict the importation of hops and extract. (5) In view of thc export of hops to the United Kingdom and Europe, especially the Pride of Ringwood variety, at a price lower than the local price, will the Government consider subsidising the difference between the two prices. ourable member's questions are as follows: (1) 1 understand from representatives of the Tasmanian industry that substantial purchases of hops from both the 1969 and 1970 Australian crops could reduce the quantity taken up from next season's crop. In addition, the conversion of hops to extract by a major brewery resulting in a considerable lessening of hops used and the move by growers, both in Tasmania and Victoria, from the low alpha resin varieties to Pride of Ringwood and similar high alpha resin types could also have an effect on brewery requirements. (2) Importations of both dried hops and bop extracts have substantially decreased in recent years as the supply of Australian grown hops has been approaching brewers' requirements. It has been the practice of brewers to import only hops required for specialised beers and relatively small quantities of extract. The value of imports of hop cones and lupulin has declined from about Sl.lm in 1965-66 to $129,000 in 1968-69 and to $38,000 for the 9 months ended March 1970. Import clearances of hop extract were valued at only $1,642 for the 10 months ended April 1970. (3) I have been informed by industry representatives that the current surplus of hops in Tasmania is between 2,000 and 3,000 bales (bale average 250 lbs). (4) The domestic industry presently enjoys tariff in protection against imported hop cones, lupulin and hop extracts at the following levels of duty: General Preferential Tariff Tariff Hop cones and Lupulin per lb SO.037 $0.10 Primage sy 10% Extract of hops 25% or 5% and 45% or 10% SO.275 perlb and $0,425 whichever is the per Ib whichhigher. ever is the N.Z. 20% or higher if higher $0,275 per lb All imports this financial year have been on a duty paid basis, that is to say there have been no admissions under Customs By-law. Imports of hops and hop extract at present levels do not appear to pose a major threat to the local growers nor would prevention of imports do much to alleviate their problems. However, in the event of it being the industry's view that the current level of tariff protection is inadequate the way is open for an approach to be made by the industry to my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Industry, seeking an investigation by the Special Advisory Authority. I believe that, in 1968, when industry problems were discussed by Victorian and Tasmanian hop grower representatives with officers of the Department of Trade and Industry, the possibility of a combined approach by hop producers and factors to the Departments of Trade and Industry, Customs and Excise and Primary Industry for assistance in combating low priced imports of hops and hop extract was a method of action considered. However, no such approach along these lines has been made. (5) The Government has not considered the payment of a subsidy on exports of hops. To do so could encourage an expansion of production which would be contrary to efforts by the industry to regulate production to a level compatible with domestic requirements and to rationalise distribution and prices. It is also regarded as important not to encourage growers to produce for export in view of the difficulties that have been encountered in rinding suitable overseas markets for the quantities and types of hops presently available.",106,Fiscal Year
279,Mr Anthony,"The answers to the honPneumatic Shearing Equipment (Question No. 1334) Mr Kirwan asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that pneumatic shearing equipment has been invented and developed in Western Australia and that this equipment has won the 'New Implement Award of Merit for Australia and New Zealand because it represents a 1 significant breakthrough in engineering design. (2) Could equipment of the new design bring savings and greaier efficiency to those involved in woolgrowing. (3) Is he able to say whether the organisers of the Kiev Trade Fair have requested that this pneumatic equipment be demonstrated in the USSR. (4) Will the Government recognise the value and merit achieved by the inventors of this equipment by providing a research and development grant or some similar grant lo assist production of the equipment for the benefit of farmers and graziers. ourable members questions are as follows: (1) Pneumatic shearing equipment has been developed in Western Australia which won the Australian New Implement Award at the 1969 Orange National Field Day and the New Zealand New Implement Award at the Hamilton (NZ) Field Day in March 1970. (2) I understand lhat the equipment has certain advantages over traditional shearing machines, particularly in flexibility of handling. I am advised that there does not seem to be any evidence that the new design will bring savings and greater efficiency. (3) Yes, I understand lhat the Company involved has accepted an invitation to display the equipment al the Kiev Trade Fair. (4) The inventors of this equipment were not eligible for a research and development grant under the conditions laid down by the Industrial Research and Development Grants Act 1967. Building Trade: Long Service Leave (Question No. 1340) Mr Hansen asked the Ministerf o r Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Have workers in the building industry filed a claim for recognition of their eligibility for long service leave. (2) Will he consider introducing legislation to grant long service leave to building workers and other federal award casual workers, particularly in the Territories under Commonwealth control in Australia. (3) Will he confer with his State counterparts with a view to establishing a national fund for reserving credits for long service leave payments for these workers. ourable members question is as follows: (1) 1 am advised lhat no such claim has been filed with the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. (2) and (3) This is a matter for determination in accordance with the provisions of thc Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The nature of arrangements that might be made, including consultations between tbe parties, would depend on the terms of the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Exposure to Asbestos (Question No. 1280) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that ihe Waterside Workers Federation has told the Federal Advisory Committee on Waterfront Accident Prevention lhat more should be done to allay the fears of workers handling asbestos. (2) Isi l a fact that workers exposed to asbestos in their job face the dual threat of the lung scarring pneumoconiosis, of their calling, asbestosis, and the dangers of lung cancer associated with the inhalations of asbestos fibres. (3') Has his attention been drawn to a recent study in the United States which reveals that 50% of all workers handling asbestos insulation showed X-ray evidence of asbestosis, and that one in every ten deaths was caused by mesothelioma a cancer of thc lung pleura, so rare that it strikes only one in 10,000 in thc general population. (4) If the position is as stated, will he take appropriate steps to ensure thai all employers tinder CommonweaUh jurisdiction provide respirators lhat will properly filter out the invisible as well as visible asbestos fibres floating in the atmosphere in ail places of work where men are lequired to handle asbestos. able member's question is as follows: (1) I am advised that the Waterside Workers' Federation has drawn the attention of the Federal Advisory Committee on Waterfront Accident Prevention lo the fact that waterside workers on occasions handle asbestos. In accordance wilh a long-standing arrangement, the matter was referred for consideration to the Occupational Health Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council, and the Occupational Health Section of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. (2) Advice from the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine is that workers exposed to airborne asbestos fibres can be exposed to the risk of developing pneumoconiosis (asbestosis), and the danger of lung cancer. The degree of health hazard depends upon the severity and duration of exposure to asbestos and the protective methods adopted.

Stevedoring Industry: Communist Factions (Question No. 885) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact, as reported in the Australian of tions performed on small groups of people, 23rd May. 1970, that he attributes industrial unrest in tlie stevedoring industry to Communist factions in the Federation who, in an endeavour to improve their position, are engaged in a competition in militancy. (2) Has he information that the Federal Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, Mr C. H. Fitzgibbon, is a non-Communist and has his attention been drawn to Mr Fitzgibbon's description of his statement as utterly incorrect. (3) Has his attention also been drawn to the comment on his statement by the non-Communist President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr R. Hawke, in which it was declared that the Minister was still analysing issues in a reactiona ry looking-undcr-the-bed-for-Communists fashion. (4) Will he state in what way alleged Communists improve their position by becoming engaged in militancy. able member's question is as follows: (1) In a press statement on 20th March 1970, In addition to the efforts being made by Me State concerning the five day national stoppage in the Governments including that of Western Australia, stevedoring industry I set out in considerable the Commonwealth Government is endeavouring detail the main factors which caused the stoppage. to provide assistance by making additional finance I also stated that competition in militancy between available from the Aboriginal Advancement Trust communist factions was an additional factor in the Account which was created for this purpose in dispute.

Aboriginals (Question No. 7) Mr Webb asked the Minister for Health, were upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that, although Aborigines reprefor further research and specific action to correct sent only 2.5% of Western Australia's population, underlying deficiencies were made. Work has approximately 21% of all children who die under already commenced on some of these proposab the age of 1 year are Aborigines. (2) Is it also a fact that the proportion of Aboriginal children who die between the ages of 1 month and 12 months is approximately 20 times the death rate among white children. (3) If the position is as stated, what is the cause of these high mortality figures in respect of Aboriginal children, and what action is proposed to reduce them. able member's question is as follows: (1) From an examination of available material it could be estimated that Aboriginal or part Aboriginal persons probably account for around 2.5% of the population in Western Australia. The percentage of full blood Aborigines may well be much lower, possibly less than half this figure. There is no really reliable way of determining mortality rates in Western Australia for the Aboriginal section of the community since the basic data are absent. As the results of investigafigures reported from an analysis in Western Australia of deaths in the 2 year period 1967 and 1968 indicate that over 20% of infant deaths are contributed by persons identified as Aboriginal or part Aboriginal. (2) With the same sort of analysis it appears that it would be true to state that the death rate of Aboriginal infants between 1 and 12 months ot age is over 20 limes that of the remainder of the population in lhat area. (3) The causes of the high mortality figures in respect of Aboriginal infants and children arc largely the result of infections such as those producing gastro-enteritis, pneumonia or occasionally meningitis. Prematurity and dehydration are additional causes. Other problems exist, but the extant to which they contribute to the mortality rate are difficult to define. Some of these factors are: nutritional deficiencies, insanitary living conditions, overcrowding due to frequent pregnancies and the congregation of many members ot a family into 1 residence. 1968. My Department and the Office of Aboriginal subnormal health, particularly in Aboriginal children, and ways to correct them, convened a m -eting or 'Workshop' at which representatives from the States and Territories and experts in fields of anthropology, nutrition, paediatrics, nursing, welfare, administration, public health and medical research present in Sydney in December 1969.

Former Prime Minister: Official and Personal Papers (Question No. 42) Mr Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: f l ) What is the name and position of the officer of bis Department into whose custody Sir John Bunting gave all official papers discovered in the effects of the late Mr Molt. (2) Did these papers include the letter which was written by the honourable member for Ballaarat after discussion with him and which was published at page 184 of Mr Trcngove's biography of him. able member's question is as follows: (1) I am informed that official papers were dealt with in the ordinary course. (2) I do not know. I have not inquired and do not propose to inquire about any private letters or personal possessions belonging to the late Mr Holt. Aboriginals (Question No. 236) Mr Collard asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) What is the estimated mortality rate of full blood Aboriginal children in (a) the Northern Territory, (b) Western Australia and (c) Queensland in each of the age groups (i) birth to 1 year, (ii) 1 year to 1 years, (iii) 2 lo 3 years, (iv) 3 to 4 years, (v) 4 to 5 years and (vi) 5 to 8 years. (2) What are thc most common causes of death in each age group in each Territory or State referred to. (3) How does the mortality rate of full blood Aboriginal children compare with that of other children in Australia. able member's question is as follows: I) From an examination of available data it can be estimated that in the Northern Division of the Northern Territory for 1968 the Aboriginal infant mortality was 75.0 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate in the 1-2 years age groups 32.8 per 1,000 children in this age group. In the other age groups the number of deaths, amounting to 2 or 3 only, are so smail as tu make calculation unrealistic. There were 3 deaths of children aged 2-3 years, one in Ihe 3-4 years group, none aged 4-5 years and 2 between the age of 5 and 8 years. In the Southern Division of the Northern Territory the infant mortality rates for recent years have been somewhat higher lhan in ihe Northern Division, being probably between 90 and 100 per 1,000 live births. Whilst it is nol possible to give Aboriginal mortality rates for Queensland and Western Australia in the same detail it has been estimated lhat infant mortality calculated in respect of 10 Settlements in Queensland for the 5 year period 1962-66 was around 112 per 1,000 live births. From a survey carried out in 1967-68 in Western Australia, it is estimated lhat some 20% of infant deaths may be attributed to the Aboriginal population. (2) The causes of death vary according lo ihe particular age group and geographical area hut in general, prematurity, gastro-enterilis. chest infections, malnutrition and dehydration, infections such as those causing meningitis and deaths by accident all play a significant pari. The major role played by infections in causing death in Aboriginal infants between the age of 1 month and I year in Western Australia was highlighted by figures indicating that around 92% of deaths in this age group were associated with infections of one sort or another. In Queensland for the years 1962-66 gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and prematurity were responsible for the majority of infant deaths whilst pneumonia and gastro-enteritis and meningitis caused a significant number in the I to 16 age group. An analysis in the Northern Division of thc Northern Territory for 1968 showed lhat prematurity and contributing factors were responsible for a large proportion of deaths in early infancy, while gastro-enteritis, pneumonia, malnutrition and dehydration accounted for the majority of deaths during the remainder of the first 2 years of life. Drowning was (he cause of 2 of the 4 deaths in the 2-4 age group. In some areas malnutrition is almost certainly of greater significance than would at first sight appear due to its underlying effect in enhancing the development of terminal infections. (3) The mortality rales for the population as a whole for the year 1968 showed an infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births of 19.83 for males and 15.61 for females. The mortality rate for the age groups under consideration when related to the estimated mid-year population for persons of the age specific group were 1-2 years1.44 for males and 1.41 for females. 2-3 year group-1.0 4 for males and 0.87 for females. 3-4 years-0.7 2 for males and 0.65 for females, 4-5 years-0.6 1 for males and 0.55 for females. 5-8 years-0.4 7 for males and 0.38 for females per 1,000 of population at risk. Comparing these rates for the whole population with the Aboriginal mortality rates shown in ihe reply to part (1) of this question, it may be seen that the mortality rate amongst infant Aboriginal children is much higher than for other chifdren in Australia.

(2) Do the restrictions in any way conflict with the Articles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. (3) Has exemption been given by GATT for the restrictions; if so, what are the conditions under which the exemptions have been granted and for what period will they be effective. Mf McEwen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia imposes quantitative restrictions on the following: (a) Aluminium and aluminum alloy, unwrought or in the form of waste or scrap; (b) Used, second-hand or disposals machinery or equipment of various kinds such as tractors, rock buggies, dumpers, graders, loaders, cranes, fork-lift trucks, four-wheel drive vehicles, etc.; (c) Knitted coats, jumpers, cardigans, sweaters and the like; (d) Men's and boys' knitted shirts. Applications for import licences for (a) and (b) are considered on an individual basis in the light of the current market situation. The goods covered by (c) are restricted to the level of imports in 1966-67. Those in (d) are limited to 60% of imports during the period 1st April 1968, to 31st March 1969. (2) and (3) The abovcmcntioned import restrictions are in accordance with the recommendations of the Tariff Board or the Special Advisory Authority. Details of them have been advised to all GATT members through the GATT Secretariat. The question of the conformity with the provision of the GATT of these restrictions has not been the subject of any formal ruling by the Contracting Parties to that Agreement. No member has sought their withdrawal of adjustment on the grounds that they are in conflict with the GATT. I should add that certain imports are also prohibited or controlled for quarantine purposes and under various acts such as the Trade Marks Act, the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act, etc I assume, however, that the honourable member's question was not directed towards these particular measures. Housing Fisszace (Question No. 698) Mr Hayden asked the Minister representing the Minister for Housing, upon notice: (1) What were the sources ol finance for housing in Australia in each of the past 10 years.

A number of requests have been made over past years to extend ihe scope of the Pensioner Medical Service to include dental treatment. The Pensioner Medical Service was introduced to provide medical services of a general practitioner nature such as that normally provided by a doctor in his surgery or in tbe patient's home including treatment at his bome after an operation. Careful consideration bas been given from time to time to extending the scope of the Service to include allied health services such as those rendered by dental practitioners but it has been decided not to extend its scope. Nursing Profession (Question No. 1049) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Health on upon notice: (1) Has he or his Department conducted any investigations into the current unrest among Australian nurses.

On average, the costs of installing a service involving new lines or equipment in fhe metropolitan area of each capital city during 1968-69 were: $ Sydney .. 1,080 Melbourne 791} Brisbane .. 850 Adelaide. . 980 Penh .. 1,290 Hobart 920 The figures quoted refer to total expenditure the provision of telephone services inclusive of trunk facilities and buildings. The information is not recorded separately for Canberra. lt will be appreciated that the average cost of providing a telephone service can vary' from time to time and from area to area, depending on » number of factors, including the capacity of existing exchange and external plant at particular locations ro meet current demand. Basic plant and equipment have to be provided in as economic a manner as possible, having regard to achievement of this often involves considerable expenditure in an area at a particular point oi Queanbeyan Hospital (Question No. 1077) Mr Hayden asked the Minister for On what dates and by whom have requests been for the Queanbeyan Hospital",118,Number Of Registered Nurses Employe D By Organisations Participating In Home Nursing Subsidy Scheme

(2) If the fault lies with the Government Printer, will he bring to the notice of the Government the need for an extension of tile Government Printing Office in order to expedite the printing of Government publications. able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Staffing difficulties have caused delays in editing the reports. Commonwealth Arbitration Reports are now edited by the Publications Officer in the Principal Industrial Registry, who spends the major part of his working time on this task. However, as a result of staff changes, it was necessaiy to transfer the Publications Officer to another important position in the Principal Registry early this year.

(2) Have the Commonwealth and State Governments conferred on school dental services which the Nimmo committee regarded as an important matter for their joint consideration. D r Forbes-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In August 1968, the Australian Dental Association submitted identical proposals to the Commonwealth Committee of Enquiry into Health Insurance (Nimmo Committee) and to the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital costs. A copy of these proposals were forwarded to me by the Association. The submission of the Australian Dental Association embodied a number of proposals as follows: (a) That the Commonwealth Government should establish a Division of Public Dental Health within its Department of Health wilh the following main functions: (i) The investigation of the incidence and precedence of dental diseases and demand for dental services. 00 The co-ordination of present programmes of denial health education and promotion of additional ones. (b) That in view of the crisis envisaged in the supply of trained dentists to provide a denial service to the Australian community the Commonwealth Goverument should, through the Australian Universities Commission, give high priority to forward planning for dental education. (c) Thai because of the magnitude of the dental health problem Government School Dental Services should concentrate upon the treatment and maintenance of pre-school and school children on an incremental age basis with particular priority to the 'dentally indigent'. (d) That a Voluntary Dental Insurance Scheme Subsidised by the Commonwealth Government be introduced to cover the denial treatment requirements of children and that sucb a scheme -be introduced in an incremental age basis commencing wilh children 2 years of age. (e) Tliat patients of dental practitioners should be entitled to claim for medical benefits in respect of work carried out by registered dentists in accordance with the provision of the following items of the Medical Benefits Schedule. 2050. 2053, 2086. 2303, 2900, 2903, 2906, 2909. 2912, 3060, 3066, 3076, 3130, 3133, 3136, 3139, 3176. 3179, 3215, 3243, 3249, 3265, 3268, 3916, J9S3, 4199, 4202, 4214, 4217, 6300, 6303, 6545, 6548, 6551, 6554, 6557, 6560, 7153. 8385, 8388. 8391, 8394, 8397, 84J0, 8413. (f) That patients who are referred to medical specialists by dental practitioners should be entitled to the same Comonwealth benefit as applies when a patient is referred by a medical practitioner and that the Medical Benefits Schedule should be amended accordingly. (g) That the Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme be amended to allow patients a benefit when obtaining drugs prescribed by a demist in accordance with his rights under the appropriate State legislation. Consideration of proposals (a), (b) and (c) has not progressed lo the extent that any costing has been undertaken and there for no cost estimates are available. Proposal (d) was costed by the Australian Dental Association in its 1968 Submission based on the following assumptions(i) That sucb a Scheme be introduced progressively over 11 years commencing in 1969 with 2 year old children and in each successive year, introducing 2 year old children into the Scheme.",120,Number Of Registered Nurses Employe D By Organisations Participating In Home Nursing Subsidy Scheme
304,Mr Hughes,"The answer to the honour(ii) The children introduced into the Scheme each year continue to be treated throughout the 11 years required for its full implementation, (iii) Tbe proportion of total population participating in such a voluntary insurance scheme would be identical to that recorded during the first 11 years' operation of the existing Medical Benefits Scheme from 1953. namelyyear 1-(16% ; year 2-39% ; year J45%; year 6-63% ; year 7-67% ; years 8-10 68%; year 11-71% . (Iv) The Commonwealth Benefit to represent 50% of the estimated cost of treatment, based on the scale of fees approved for dental services by the Commonwealth Repatriation Department in force as from 1st August 1967, the remaining 50% to be borne equally by registered Benefit Organisations and the patient. (v) Tbe scale of treatment for alt participating children be uniform in each age group but decreasing between each successively older age group up lo the proposed 12 year old group. (vi) There will be no change either in economic conditions or in dental fees in Australia during the 11 years required to implement the entire Scheme. fc'ii) Net growth in the population of 2 year old children between 196.1 and 1966 census figures of 0.70% per annum (including net migration) will continue uniformly throughout the 11 years for full implementation of tbe Scheme. (viii) A net reduction in dental caries of 50% will occur in regions where the communal water supply is fluoridated compared with the level of dental caries in nonfluoridated areas. As from 1st January 1970, the Repatriation Department approved a revised scale of dental fees for treatment of Repatriation beneficiaries. Assuming the same basis of costing as that used by the Australian Denial Association in its 1968 Submission my Department has estimated thc cost of the proposal to the Commonwealth in the light of hfgher dental fees approved by the Repatriation Department as followsNon-fluoridated areas Year child $ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Proposals (e) and (f) have not been costed due to the absence of reliable National Statistics of utilisation of these services by dental patients. Proposal («) has been embodied in the new Health Benefits Plan as from l a July 1970 insofar as tbe Schedule items relate to oral surgery and associated procedures rendered in an operating theatre of an approved hospital by a legally qualified dentist or dental practitioner. Proposal (f) has been fully incorporated into the new Health Benefits Plan. year 4-51% ; year 5-60% ; Separate cost estimates for these proposals to the extent of their inclusion in the Health Benefits Plan were not derived but my Department estimated that the cost of the Services involved would have been small in relation to ihe estimated $33.5m additional cost of the new Health Benefits Plan. Proposal (g) to widen the scope of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to incorporate drugs prescribed by dentists has not been costed either by the Australian Dental Association or my Department due to to the lack of reliable statistics of current and likely utilisation on a national scale. (2) No. I would, however, remind the honourable member that, as stated ia paragraph 15.17 of the Nimmo report, the Australian Dental Association submitted to the Nimmo Committee n proposal for the introduction of a voluntary insurance dental scheme for children up to the age of 13 years. It was in regard lo this proposal and not school dental services, that the Nimmo Committee staled-'We regard it as another important matter for the joint consideration of the Commonwealth and State Governments.' Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority (Question No. 112?) Mr Clyde Cameron asked (lie Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Has bis attention been drawn to the decision of a meeting of members of the Federated Clerks' Union of Australia held in Sydney on 28th April 1970 requesting continuity of employment of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority's staff at prevailing rates of pay and conditions of employment after 1st July 1970.

(4) Arrangements have been made for redundancy situations affecting waterside workers. The details of these arrangements are contained in the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Regulations. Hop Research (Question No. 1149) Dr Solomon asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) Has arecentresearch grant of approximately $31,000 to Carlton and United 'Breweries of Victoria been used for research into hop extracts. (2) Is it known whether the results of such research might prejudice the competitive ability of Tasmanian hop-growers. Mr S&tclair-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Carlton and United Breweries Ltd received a grant of $31,440 from the Australian Industrial Research and Development Grants Board. Companies provide detailed information about their industrial research and development activities to the Board with the assurance that the information will be treated as confidential. However, I understand that Carlton and United Breweries has said that the research involved an improved process for extraction of resins from natural hops. (2) The Department of Trade and Industry has made some enquiries and it appears that in recent years there has been a trend for Australian brewers to require bop varieties with a higher lesin content and a growing number of Tasmanian growers are believed to be changing over to new strains of hops to meet these changing market conditions. I understand that the likely result of the new process developed by the Carlton and United Breweries would be to enable Australian brewers to obtain significantly higher production from a given input of hops. The effect this will have on the total returns to hop growers in future years will depend on the operation of a variety of factors, including the extent to which resin content may be related to pricesreceivedfor hops; the enhanced potential for development of an export trade in hop extract; the extent to which the new technology may be adopted by the Australian brewing industry as a whole; and the growth of Australian consumption of beer. TFX Aircraft (Question No. 1133) Mr Keating asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: Will he make available the papers submitted to the Menzies Government in 1963 by his Department and the other Service Departments outlining visions) Act, 1970, which was passed during the last the reasons and recommendations for the accepsessional period of the Parliament extends the tance of the General Dynamics TFX fighteroperation of the legislation until 30th June 1972. bomber concept for the RAAF., including the reasons why the other aircraft types then under consideration were rejected. Mr Malcolm Fraser-'The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 26th September 1968, the Prime Minister tabled in the House a number of documents pertaining to the purchase by Australia of 24 F-1U aircraft. These documents included the Memorandum of Understanding dated 19th October 1963, and the associated Technical Arrangement dated June 1964. At the time, the Prime Minister stated that any document or part of any document which had security content applicable to both the US. and Australian Governments would not be disclosed. These limitations are still valid. There is also to be considered the long established practice of not making public the various advices provided to the Government by the public service. The public service in our system of Government cannot engage in public debate on Government issues. On this point I refer you to the discussion in 1958 by Sir Philip McBride, the then Minister for Defence, regarding the tabling of the Morshead Report, (Hansard of 27th March 1958, page 776). Thereasonsfor not tabling that report are still valid and apply a further limitation to the limitation to which I have just referred in regard to your request. For both these reasons, I regret I cannot make available to you the types of paper you haverequested.It is my belief that the Government has already made public as much as possible in regard to the F l ll project. Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority (Question No. 1238) Mr Daly asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act andregulations,under which the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority exercises certain powers and functions, will cease to operate on 1st July 1970. (2) Has his attention been drawn to the grave concern of employees of the Authority regarding the Government's future plans for the Authority and the continuity of their employment. (3) If so, will he give an assurance that the continuity of employment of the Authority's staff on prevailing rates of pay after 1st July 1970 will be protected. (4) In the event of any reduction in the present functions of the Authority will he give an assurance to those affected that at least -12 months notice of the change will be given to enable them to negotiate with the Government.

(3) The ABC's inability to obtain rights to permit television coverage of the matches would no doubt have caused disappointment to soccer followers in Australia. The ABC was disappointed also that its negotiations for television rights were unsuccessful. However, the ABC was able to arrange a direct broadcast of a radio description of the last 15 minutes of the first half and of the entire second half of the final match. This description was beard from 64 ABC radio stations in Australia.

Aust. s 13.13 Public Hospitals (Question No. 1354) Mr Hayden asked the Ministeif o r Health, upon notice: Can he provide an estimate of the capital cost per bed in a new public hospital which accommodates (a) 200 beds, (b) 400 beds, (c) 600 beds and (d) 800 beds, respectively. D r Forbes-The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: I'he question cannot be answered simply as ihere are many variable factors which influence the cost of a new public hospital. Estimates of cost can only be made after careful examination of respective features and components, and isolation of common and differing elements. Any estimate of costs per bed would therefore have to be made with a defined type of project in mind. For example, costs, excluding land, for a sophisticated 'acute' public hospital could rise to $36,000 per bed. Infant Mortality (Question No. 1370) Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Can be provide from the latest annual figures available to him, a table which shows the infant mortality rates for various countries in the world commencing with lhat country with the lowest mortality rate per thousand of live births and proceeding to and including Australia. (2) If Australia had achieved for ibe year covered by the table the same mortality rale as that achieved by the country with the lowest mortality rale, bow many extra infants would bave survived. D r Forbes-Thc answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The United Nations Demographic Year Book' 1968 shows the infant mortality rates in 1967. the latest available figures, for countries with rates lower than Australia's as beingCountry Sweden Netherlands Finland Norway Japan Denmark Switzerland Australia 1966 figure (lutes! available) (2) If Australia's infant mortality rate for 1967 had been the same as Sweden's an additional 1229 infants would have survived. $ 8 t t S » $ * 16.39 9.7J 15.72 14.60 13.S7 20.60 15.53 14.33 Defence Contracts (Question No. T61) Mr Barnard asked the Ministerf o r Defence, upon notice: (1) What sub-contracts of defence purchases from the United States have been awarded to Australian companies since 1966. (2) What offset arrangements to defence purchases from the United States have been negotiated since 1966. Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l lows: (1) lt is not possible to provide precise information as some Australian companies have contracted direct with United States companies. Some of the major sub-contracts known are as follows, the values given being approximate: Supply of complete man camps and dormitory type huts to the US. Forces. Various Australian firms-$1,9(3,000. Supply of meat to the US. Forces. Hawker de Havilland Aust. Pty Ltd-$400,000 . Manufacture of helicopter tail rotor hub assemblies for Bell Helicopter USA. (This Company has also received three other contracts for machining). Favelle Mort Ltd-$285,000 . Manufacture ot two deck cranes for ihe US. Navy. (2) In August. 1968, my predecessor. Sir Allen Fairhall and Defense Secretary, Clark Clifford agreed that official representatives of both countries would explore ways and means to increase opportunities for Australia to participate competitively in US. Department of Defense procurements. This arrangment was reaffirmed in discussions between the Prime Minister and Defense Secretary Laird in April, 1969. Official conferences have taken place at six monthly intervals commencing October, 196R, and also there is regular communication with the US. Department of Defense.

Housing Ministers' Conference (Question No. 825) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Minister for Housing, upon notice: What was the (1) date, and (2) nature of the Commonwealth's response to each of the requests made by the State Housing Ministers at their conference in Brisbane in July 1968. has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) 4th March 1969. (2) The text of resolutions of the State HousResolution (iv)-Urban Renewal ing Ministers* Conference which include requests to the Commonwealth, and summaries of the Commonwealth responses to these requests are as follows: Resolution (i)-Lo w Rental Housing for Aged Persons 'Having regard to the need for low rental accommodation for Aged Persons this Conference of Ministers of Housing from all States resolves that the Commonwealth be requested to provide grants to State Housing Authorities similar to those under the Aged Persons Homes Act and that if the Commonwealth is not prepared to subsidise Housing Agreement funds in this manner that it do so in cases where the Housing Authority provides finance from other sources; but that the States accept that in any year the Commonwealth might place a ceiling on the amount available from it for subsidy.' Reply The Commonwealth agrees that the matter is of the utmost concern to all State Ministers and the matter is being kept under review. Shortly after this reply was sent, the States Grants (Dwellings for Aged Pensioners) Act 1969 was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. This Act offers the States non-repayable grants amounting to $25m over 5 years for the erection of self-contained accommodation for the more needy single age pensioners and those who qualify for service pensions by reason of age. Resolution (ii)-Encouragemen t Towards Saving for Homes' 'This Conference of Ministers of Housing from all States: (i) Agrees that young persons should be encouraged to save for home ownership; (ii) Considers that encouragement of saving by those persons who have to look to State Housing Authorities for bome ownership should have a priority no less high than encouragement of saving by other citizens; (iii) Requests the Commonwealth to review its policy in respect of the Home Savings Grant so as to include houses constructed by a State Housing Authority with funds provided under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.' Reply: As the Commonwealth is making long term advances at concessional rates of interest under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement for the construction of houses purchased from State housing authorities, it would be inappropriate to give the purchasers what would amount to further financial assistance by way of a Home Savings Grant. Resolution (iii)-Housing for Serving Defence Personnel 'That this Conference is of the opinion that Clause7 should be deleted from the next Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement' Reply: The Commonwealth has noted the view of the State Ministers on this matter. ' (a) That State Housing Ministers are firmly of the view that urban redevelopment is a matter of urgent National significance and one such as to call for the maximum participation of all the appropriate authorities concerned at the Federal, State and Local Government levels and that, in the first instance, the Federal Minister for Housing be asked again to present these views to the Federal Government. (b) The Commonwealth Government be asked to pay to the States the sum of $1,000,000 to be split up among the States according to a formula to be agreed between the States for the preparation of plans for urban renewal.' Reply: The Commonwealth is not unsympathetic towards the housing needs of those living in the more run-down areas of our cities, but it sees the responsibility for the task of improving the lot of these people as remaining with the region. Under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement the Commonwealth is already assisting the States to provide new and better housing for those who may be living in unsatisfactory dwellings. In view of the many and urgent claims on the Commonwealth budget, the Commonwealth does not feel that it should offer further financial assistance in this field. Resolution (v)--Research Grants That the Commonwealth, thopugh the Commonwealth Department of Housing, make grants to finance, wholly or in part, approved development and research housing projects by State and Commonwealth authorities.' Reply: This proposal is being investigated by the Commonwealth. War Serviee Hemes (Question No. 894} Mr Uren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Housing, upon notice: (1) What land bas been acquired and what estate development has been undertaken by the War Service Homes Division since July 1950.",125,Death Bate Per 1 000 Population A

(6) What was the location of the land acquired in each case. (7) Was any special power necessary to acquire the land for estate development; if so, what authority was used. D r Forbes-The Ministerf or Housing has supplied the f o l l o w in g answer to the honourable members question: Particular* of thc land acquired and estate development undertaken under the provisions of the War Service Homes Act since 1st July 1950 and other information requested by the honourable member are set out in the following table showing the position as at 30th June 1970.

(2) Is there a need for three separate ABC radio programmes when Parliament is in session. able member's question is as follows: (1) Currently about 26 hours per week on each of the ABCs First Network's stations. (2) Parliamentary broadcasts are not carried on ABC regional stations so that there is no interruption to programmes in country areas when Parliament is sitting. An alternative programme to Parliamentary broadcasts is available in each of the State Capitals and in Newcastle and Canberra. The provision of an additional channel carrying Parliamentary broadcasts has been examined on several occasions but no frequencies are presently available to allow development along these lines. Commonwealth Industrial Court (Question No. 1009) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Attorney General, upon notice: (1) Ts it the practice of the Commonwealth Industrial Registrar and/or his deputies to (a) interview informants and complainants who wish to bring proceedings into ihe Commonwealth Industrial Court with a view to discovering the merits of their cases and the evidence they have available to support such cases, (b) consult with a judge of the Commonwealth $ Industrial Court on the material thus .. 276,856 provided to him before determining whether .. 319,714 to act on the information or complaint, .. 126,680 (c) require all informants proceeding under .. 38,418 Regulation 76(2) to conduct a form of pre.. 157,196 trial of the worth of the proceeding, and .. 14,255 (d) insist that in addition to a formal informa.. .. 933,119 tion, the informant must swear an affidavit relating to the information. (2) Has the Registrar and/or his deputies on any occasion rejected an affidavit as being inadequate, and in such cases declined to issue a summons on an otherwise sound information. $ 13) If so. which section of the Commonwealth .. .. 418,406 Conciliation and Arbitration Act or which Regula.. .. 402,987 tion gives the Registrar or his deputies the right .. .. 137,216 to engage in any of the foregoing practices. .. .. 69,044 .. .. 18S.448 (4) Do the foregoing practices contravene ordi.. .. 2%825 nary procedures in summary jurisdiction. (5) If tbese practices do exist, do they impede 1,240,926 the access of litigants to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. (6) If so, does the practice force upon informants the need to enlist expensive legal assistance for the trying, settling, engrossing and defending of affidavits in support of information, thus imposing an unfair and .unnecessary burden of costs upon convicted defendants. ourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) Informants and complainants are interviewed not for the purpose of discovering the merits of their cases, but to ensure that their causes are within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and. for that purpose, some indication of the facts may be necessary. (h) No. (c) No. (d) Yes. Informants invariably supply affidavits without being so requested. The view lhat the summons has to be supported by an affidavit at the time of its issue, and certainty at the time ot its service, was expressed by Mr Justice Kerr in 1969 in proceedings in thc",132,Teaching Hospitals
314,Mr Hulme,The answer to the honour,133,Teaching Hospitals
315,Mr Hughes,"The answer to the honCommonwealth Industrial Court involving the Australian Stevedoring Inand Bor. dustry Authority and Bums Philp& Co. Ltd. (2) Yes. On one recent occasion, the Deputy Industrial Registrar, Sydney, declined to issue a summons on two grounds: firstly, that neither the information nor the summons stated the section of the Act against which the offence was alleged; and, secondly, that the affidavit filed in support merely stated that the facts in the information were true. The information contained only the allegation that a specified disadvantage had been suggested to the informants in contravention of the ACL (3) Regulations S3, 37 and 76. (4), (5) and (6) The duties of an officer of the Court inreceivinga complaint and issuing a summons were referred to in a recent judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in a judgment given on 4th July 1969 (ex parte Qantas Airways Limited: re Horsington and Another). The conclusions expressed by Sugerman, J. A. in relation to the duties of Justices of the Peace also express the general basis upon which Registrars of the Commonwealth Industrial Court act in similar matters. In no instance, of which I am aware, has this impeded the access of litigants to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. Since informants are invariably assisted by a solicitor from the beginning of the action, the additional cost of preparing an affidavit which, in any case, is required at the hearing before the Court, cannot result in any unfair or unnecessary burden of costs. In the instance referred to in answer (2) the replacement affidavit, which was provided within 24 hours, was a simple statement of facts involving the addition of six short paragraphs to the original affidavit.

What is the average delay in rhe provision ot private telephone services in each population centre with a population in excess of 20,000 persons. able member's question is as foUows: The answer to this question needs to be divided into two parts namely: . (a) cases where major extensions to Une plant and/or exchange equipment are necessary, and (b) cases where line plant and exchange equipment are available or only minor extensions are necessary. . In thefirstcase, the time taken to connect telephone services can vary between very wide limits, depending upon the nature and extent of the projects necessary to provide additional tine plant or exchange equipment. It is not meaningful, therefore, to endeavour to quote an average delay In these circumstances. In the second case, detailed statistics are not maintained on a continuous basis of the time taken by the Post Ofiice to provide telephone services at individual centres.

Because of this, such figures underestimate the total number of families received. However, a reasonable estimate of the latter can be obtained by taking the total arrivals of married male settlers. In the past 5 years, ths figures for these were as follows: D r Forbes-The Ministerf o r Housing has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: Parts (1) and (2): The details cannot be concisely summarised to show an unambiguous answer but the information is available in 'Housing Finance: Lending Terms and Conditions' which is published each 6 months by the Department of Housing. Copies of this publication are available from the Department of Housing and are in the Parliamentary Library. (3) Interest Rates on Housing Loans in July 1950 From information available it would appear that institutions which were lending at that time for new and existing dwellings did not differentiate in the rate of interest charged.

Estimates are not available for tbe number ot family units expected to arrive in Australia in each, of the next 5 years (1970-74).

(3) This is a matter for individual societies. However, where societies lend on a long term basis, and from funds subject to varying rates of return to investors, it is necessary for changes in interest rates to apply to both new and existing borrowers.

(7) If the rate of interest on a loan of $12,000 beyond that supplied in answer to your question of over 25 years is increased by 0.5 per cent per the 7th April 1970. annum, the additional amount payable per month will vary according to the interest rate charged before the increase and the basis on which interest is charged, i.e. yearly rests, quarterly rests, etc. No exact figure can therefore be given, but on the most common rates charged before the application of any increase, the additional repayment would be in the vicinity of $4 per month, provided of course the former interest rest period was not altered in any way.

Repatriation: Vocational Counselling Services (Question No. 1147) Mr Barnard asked the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice: (1) What vocational counselling services are provided for veterans of the Vietnam war. (2) What are the qualifications of the Army counsellors who interview these men. (3) Are any trained psychologists used by his Department to advise ex-servicemen about suitable civilian employment. (4) What extra vocational counselling and training is provided by bis Department for ex-servicemen injured in the Vietnam war. able member's question is as follows: (1) Except as indicated in the answer to the third and fourth parts of the honourable member's question, advice and assistance about employment Is provided to Vietnam veterans and to other members of the Armed Forces on the same basis. Information I have received in response to direct inquiries of the relevant Service Departments reveals that Navy, Army and Air Force establishments provide for units to have on strengths Resettlement Officers whose particular responsibility it is to be fully conversant with the procedures for re-settling regular servicemen, and re-establishing National Servicemen, in civil life. During their service regular servicemen are encouraged to undertake vocational training under the Services Vocational and Educational Training Scheme to enable them to adapt to civil occupations, and are counselled by their unit Resettlement Officers about employment prospects. In addidon, the Department of Labour and National Service has a Permanent Forces Resettlement Officer In each capital city to advise regular servicemen about employment, and help them obtain suitable employment through the Commonwealth Employment Service when necessary. National Servicemen are interviewed by officers of the Army and of the Department of Labour and National Service before discharge. They are notified of the full range of re-establishment benefits available to them as National Servicemen and have available the facilities of the Commonwealth Employment Service to help them obtain suitable employment on discharge if they are not returning to the employment in which they were engaged before call-up. (2) Although there is no standard academic or other qualification for appointment as unit Resettlement Officer, it is common for Education or Instructor Officers, many of graduate status, to occupy such positions. (3) and (4) Vocational counselling is not normally a function of the Repatriation Department, but of the Department of Labour and National Service. If necessary, ex-servicemen may be referred to the Vocational Guidance Section of the Department of Labour and National Service, staffed by qualified psychologists with special training in vocational guidance. However, for ex-servicemen receiving treatment for incapacities due to war service (including Vietnam service), or who are eligible under the Repatriation Department's Scheme for ex-servicemen unable to follow a former occupation because of a war disability, vocational training is provided by that Department as part of the rehabilitation programme and, where appropriate, Repatriation Department psychologists are available to advise on vocations and training.

(3) No. (4) Liquid propane gas has been used as fuel for internal combustion engines in some countries for many years, and numerous papers relating to such use have been published in scientific journals. Conciliation and Arbitration Commission (Question No. 1215) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: Has he any indications as to whether the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is satisfied with the number of conciliators now operating under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. able member's question is as follows: In his Thirieen:h Annual Report for the year ended 13th August 1969 the President of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission said: 'Tn my view we need al least four conciliators and it is urgently necessary to bring the present number to that figure by another appointment'. The current number of conciliators is four. Education: School Libraries and Science Blocks (Question No. 1245) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister [or Education and Science, upon notice: (1) How many (a) libraries and (b) science blocks have been built with the aid of Commonwealth subsidies in (i) government and (ii) independent schools in the Federal electorate division of Bendigo in each year since the inception of the scbeme. (2) What are the names of the schools in each case. MrN . H. Bowen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) (i) Libraries. Government schools.

I understand that plans for library building projects under the Programme are being developed in Victoria, but no details of individual projects are yet available for the remaining period of the triennium. Four State secondary schools in the Bendigo electorate were assisted by the State to purchase bookstock in 1969, the first year of the Commonwealth Libraries Programme. (1) (b) (i) Science blocks. Goveruaaent schools. Seven science laboratories have been constructed in State secondary schools in the Bendigo electorate with funds made available to the State of Victoria under the Commonwealth Science Facilities Programme. Construction took place in the following years: 1964653 laboratories 1966-673 laboratories 1968-691 laboratory (1) (a) (ii) Libraries. Indepeadent schools. No libraries have yet been constructed with funds made available to individual independent schools in the Bendigo electorate under the Commonwealth Libraries Programme. Grants for building libraries have been offered to three such schools in the electorate. Grants will be authorised and payment made as soon as I have been notified in each case that construction has commenced. (1) (b) (ii) Science blocks. Independent schools. Seven science laboratories have been constructed in independent schools in the Bendigo electorate so far and a building grant is available during 1970-71 for 1 school. Quite extensive reconstruction of existing science buildings has occurred in 2 schools. These building activities took place in the following years: 1965662 laboratories reconstructed 3 laboratories built 1966673 laboratories built 1968-691 laboratory built (2) The names of the schools concerned are set out below.

Nuclear Power (Question No. 1270) Mr Stewart asked the Minister for National Development the following question, upon notice: (1) Are fast breeder nuclear reactors a commercial proposition. (2) If not, when is it predicted that this will be the case. able member's question is as follows: (1) No. Fast breeder reactors are not yet a commercial proposition but a large effort is being directed towards their development in most of the countries with advanced nuclear programmes. (2) The first large commercial fast breeder stations are expected to be introduced into Great Britain and certain European countries (for example France and Germany) by about 1980. It may be some years later before they are introduced into the USA. Nuclear Power Stations (Question No. 1271) 1969 1970 1971 Mr Stewart asked the Minister for National Development the following question, upon notice: Not applicable (1) Has he any information as to whether privately-owned and operated industry in remote 28,000 1,000 areas of Australia is interested in the purchase, 2,000 4.000 construction and operation of nuclear power stations. 15,000 (2) If so, does the Government intend to grant 1.000 permission to private industry to enter this field of power generation. . . 24,475 52S able member's question is as follows: (1) The Government is not aware of any plans of private Industry to construct and operate nuclear power stations in remote areas in Australia. (2) Nuclear generating plant is owned by private enterprise in other countries and there would appear to be no reason in principle why this should",142,Tasmania

Such a plant however would be subject to whatever controls the Commonwealth or State Governments may consider it necessary to impose, e.g. in respect of safety, insurance against nuclear damage and, in the Commonwealth's case, of satisfying our international obligations, especially as to 'Safeguards' on the use of fissionable material. However, this question bas not yet arisen. Nuclear Power Stations: Supply of Plutonium (Question Nn. 1273) Mr Stewart asked the Minister for National question, upon notice: (1) Will an adequate supply of plutonium be necessary to operate nuclear reactors for power generation when fast breeder reactors become commercially feasible. (2) Has he any information as to whether the Japanese Government, is stockpiling plutonium to facilitate the introduction of fast breeder reactors. (3) If so. would it be to the benefit of Australia Health, upon notice: to follow suit when in a position to do so. able member's question is as follows: (1) Past breeder reactors operate most efficiently States Grants (Mental Health Institutions) Act and economically when fuelled with plutonium expires on 30th June (Hansard, llth September which hi the preferred fuelling material. They will 1969, page 1259). however operate with the fissile material uranium 235 but there is a significant cost penalty involved. The widespread adoption of fast breeder reactors have the State Ministers made this request. is not expected to commence until about 1990. It is not possible at this time to say for certain that adequate supplies of plutonium would then be benefits. available but those countries which have built thermal nuclear power reactors will have had the opportunity to accumulate plutonium for these before announcing or introducing legislation io purposes. (2) Japan, like a number of other countries such as the United Kingdom and France, has a large thermal nuclear power reactor programme and is able member's question is as foUows: actively engaged in fast breeder reactor development. Plutonium produced in the thermal reactors will almost certainly be used to supply fuel for has figures is New South Wales, where thc latest future fast breeder stations.

Nuclear Power: Gas Cooled Reactors (Question No. 1275) Mr Stewart asked the Minister for National Development the following question, upon notice: (1) Has a decision been made that gas-cooled reactors are unsuited to the present nuclear power needs of Australia; if so, why. (2) If the suitability of these reactors for Australian needs has not been considered, why is this so. able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) No. However when ail potential tenderers for nuclear power stations were invited in December 1969 to register as tenderers it was ascertained that none of them were interested in submitting a tender based on a gas cooled reactor; therefore there has been no occasion Development the following to consider tbe suitability of these reactors for Australian needs. Mental Health Institutions: Benefits for Patients (Question No. 1282) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for (1) How many patients in each Slate would Ministers for hospital benefits to be paid for patients in mental health institutions when the (2) At which Health Ministers' Conferences (3) What would be the cost of paying such (4) Will be provide an answer to this question take the place of the Act.
