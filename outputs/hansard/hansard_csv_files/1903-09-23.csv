As I indicated last night, I propose that this House shall agree to the motion which I have moved, with such amendments as may be considered, not merely desirable in accordance with the predilections of any honourable member, but necessary, and that the motion, as amended, shall be sent to the Senate with a message asking for the concurrence of that Ohamber. I shall ask the representative of the Government there to take such steps as will bring the question before the members of the Senate for their consideration, and I am not without hope that that procedure will bring about the necessary agreement between the two Houses.

The Government is not of opinion that it has persisted in a course which has evoked a want of confidence on the part of the House or of the country, or which disentitles it to either. Therefore, the ground of the honourable and learned member's question, in my view, disappears. BILL-SHIPPING . Minister, upon noticeWhat conclusion have the Government arrived at in relation to the letter of the Western Australian Government on the subject of oversea ships and the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill? to the honourable member's question is as follows:I have found that, before it is possible to deal fully and justly with the question, it is necessary to institute inquiries into the extent and value of the passenger traffic by mail steamers between Western Australia and the Eastern States. I bave directed sucb inquiries to be made, and have telegraphed to the Premier of Western Australia in tbe same relation, and asked for his assistance in obtaining full information. General, upon notice1. Is it true that in several cases postmistresses receiving £110 per annum have had deducted from their salary £20 for rent.; whilst postmasters are charged 10 per cent, only ? 2. Is this not contrary to Regulation 64, which limits the rent reduction to 10 per cent. ? honourable member's questions is as follows:I and 2. Deductions for rent of quarters as fixed under the State laws will remain in operation until the classification of the Service which is now in progress has been completed, and no distinction in this respect is made as between postmistresses and postmasters. Where vacancies occur, however, and it is necessary to advertise same, the rent deduction is fixed at 10 per cent., as provided by section 64 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. Upon the completion of the classification the whole question of rent deductions will be adjusted. Resolutions of the Committee of Supply formance for the services of the year 1903-4 agreed ment by section 125 of the Constitution, it is to. I will ask the Prime WAYS AND MEANS. In Committee: I beg pardon, posedThat towards making good the Supply granted to His Majesty for the services of the year ending 30th June, 1904, a sum not exceeding £2,648,939 be granted out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That towards making good the Supply granted to His Majesty for additional new works and buildings for the year ending 30th June, 1904, a sum not exceeding £422,283 be granted out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. should like to take advantage of this proposal to ask the Government why they allow Order of the Day No. 6-Conciliatio n and Arbitration Bill-to remain on the business paper? Do they propose to take any other steps in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, or are they allowing an idle order to remain upon the paper?"" The Prime Minister has already told the House that he does not intend to go on with the measure, and the usual procedure is to move the discharge of such an order from the business-paper. I should like to know whether the Government are relenting over the matter, and whether, after all, they mean to make an effort at the eleventh hour to put that Bill through ? Sir EDMUNDBART ON ( H u n t e r Minister for External Affairs) I question whether my honourable friend is very serious,, or as serious as he usually is, in asking thisquestion. His seriousness in ordinary is sogreat as to be almost jocose, and I am not quite sure whether he has not reached the stage of jocosity on this occasion. However,, the honourable member will not object to this patch on the face of that beauty known as the notice paper; because he will consider that as in the case of the -beauties of old days, even the existence of what he may consider to be a patch may bring outfchestronger points of adornment. We have nothing to say as to the question asked. The Bill is very well where it is. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolutions reported. Debate resumed from 22nd September,.

It is easy for some honourable members to criticise the action of the Government, but it is remarkable that no one has come -forward with any substitute for their proposal. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN agreed to it . orable member did not speak as if he altogether agreed with the motion. He referred to the delay that had occurred in submitting it , and also asked for more information. The general tone of the debate, so far as honourable members opposite is Concerned, has been one of fault finding. sentatives have been the principal objectors. very well to blame Victorian representatives. Honourable members opposite are in the habit of imputing all sorts of motives to those who happen to disagree with them. I recognise that the Victorian representatives have as much right as the representatives of their opinions, and I regret that the cry of State against State should have been raised in connection with the motipn. A very good example was set by the Prime Minister when he stated that every honourable member should have a'free hand, and that no attempt would be made to coerce any one into voting for a particular site. As a matter of fact it is well known that Ministers differ as to the best site for the Federal Capital. motion has been submitted ? is better that the Government should take up their present . position than attempt by a party move to force a particular site upon Parliament. We have to consider, in dealing with this question, that when once this question is settled it will be disposed of for ever. Possibly, I have been as impatient as' any honourable member to see the site fixed for the capital; but I have recognised the great difficulties that beset the Government. The Prime Minister said that he was quite prepared to consider any amendments that might be proposed, and I hope that some of the amendments foreshadowed during the discussion will prove acceptable to the Government. I am sure that whatever our views may be with regard to the merits of the proposed sites, we are all anxious to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. We have almost reached the stage at which we may hope to arrive at a solution of the difliculty. Notwithstanding the action of the Senatei n regard to a similar motion, We have all the discussion in that branch of the Legislature has disclosed the fact that",14,Barton

27,Mr Austin'chapman,"Surely i ta majority of senators have very carefully considered the question, and have made up their minds regarding it . Naturally they are a little bit shy about adopting a course which may result in a choice of which they could not approve, and we can easily understand their hesitation before taking the final plunge, which will commit them to a selection for all time. I am glad that it is not necessary at this stage to say anything regarding the relative merits of the proposed sites. It is better that that aspect of the matter should be dealt with at the Conference of both Houses. Whilst many of us have strong convictions, I do not believe that there is one honourable member who is not prepared to alter his mind if it can be shown that some other site is better than that which he advocates. bala ? be almost impossible to find a site better than Bombala; but. one cannot tell what may happen. I hope the Government will agree to accept, in a modified form, the amendment proposed, by the honourable member for North Sydney. It might prove very awkward for honourable members representing western districts if they had to make a direct choice between Orange, Bathurst. and Lyndhurst;.and the same remark would apply to honourable members representing other divisions of the State. It seems to me reasonable that we should at' first reduce the three sites in tlie western district to one, because there is no reason why an honourable member who is in favour of Orange should not also be well-disposed towards Bathurst. I think that we should make a mistake if we now attempted to select site for the capital. It is not necessary for us to do so at this stage. We are not armed with sufficient information to enable us to fix a site for the capital itself. ' The Commissioners point out not only that they are not prepared to select a site for the capital, but that much more information is necessary, and that much more consideration should be given to the matter before any determination is arrived at. Some honourable members seem to consider that there is a wide divergence between the reports of the Commission of Experts and the Commissioner appointed by tlie State of New South Wales, but the summaries of the reports practically agree. We should direct our .attention to the selection of a territory within which the capital may be established. Who will dare to say that we should with out the fullest consideration commit ourselves to a site, and to the expenditure of at large sum of money? We should make haste slowly, and if there is any reasonable doubt in the minds of honorable members, andif it is possible to obtain any more and betterinformation, we should not, because of any ou tside cry, rush in and perhaps make a mistake which we should ever afterwards regret^ which would cost the Commonwealth dearly,, and which could not be remedied. I hope that honourable members will forget for the time being anj' differencies that may have existed between New South Wales and V i c toria. Are the representatives of Queensland, of Western Australia, or of otherStates any less patriotic than those whorepresent the more populous States? In considering this matter we must not count, It would the cost that will be incurred to-day, or tomorrow, or next year, but the ultimate outlay. We must bear in mind the ultimate results, and we must rememember thati t is possible that, perhaps even in ouitime, some of the smaller States may become more populous than either New South Walesor Victoria. We must keep in -view the possible developments of the States, and we must consider that a site which would be convenient only for representatives of Victoria and New South Wales might be extremely inconvenient for those who represent other States. As a representative of New South Wales, I have yet to learn that, the people of that State have any divine right to the control and trade of the capital. I have yet to learn that we have any right, to select a site that will divert the trade toSydney. stitutional right. time that honourable members protested against the continuance of this old wrangle between New South Wales and Victoria. The representatives of the latter have been accused of a desire to cast a block vote in favour of a particular site. That such an accusation is ill-founded is proved by the fact that when the representatives of New South Wales"" held meetings to discuss this* question, no taunts of that character were indulged in. meeting to discuss the question of the capital site.",15,Barton

37,Mr Austin Chapman,"I wasabsence of a railway or a market, is worth practically only its prairie value, whereas another area which comprises land of the same quality may be worth five times as much. We all know that around some of these sites the land is very valuable. In my own district some of the best country in the world can be purchased for £ i or £ 5 per acre. honourable members have a very crude idea of the value of land. The land of which I speak is of the best quality, and is altogether unlike that sandy soil blown about the streets of Melbourne, with which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is familiar. He may make light of this question, but it is one of the utmost importance. We should enter upon the work of selecting a site just as carefully as if we were going to pay for it out of our own pockets. Wouldi t be reasonable for us to select a site com' tention of the honourable member for Parraprising land worth about £ 2 0 per acre when we might obtain another site comprising land of equally good quality, and worth in its unimproved state only £ o per acre? W it h the assistance of the money of the people, giving access and markets, we could readily raise the value of that land to £ 2 0 per acre. I was pleased to hear the statement made by the Prime Minister that he intended to place before the House an estimate of the value of land in the several sites submitted to us. I have no doubt that it will be complete in every reand there. His remarks might apply not spect, and enable us to come to a proper decision. Such information isabsolutelynecessary. In selecting a site we are very much in the position of a man who desires to purchase a house. He may see a magnificent structure which he would like to possess, but he would hesitate to pay for it five or ten times more than the price at which he could obtain an equally suitable building. While I recognise that sentiment must creep into the consideration of this question, I feel that we should not overlook the commercial aspect of it . We wish to obtain the best site at the least cost. Reference was made by the Prime Minister to the Crown lands situate within the sites submitted for our consideration, and I am pleased to know that New South Wales, through its Premier, has intimated its willingness to present the Commonwealth with any Crown lands that may be within the territory selected by us. But, after all, it would be unwise to attach too much importance to that fact. We> know that in view of the earth hungerwhich has existed in Australia for sometime, it is unlikely that any Crown land of value has not been grabbed up. sites comprise reserves. that a large area of land has been reserved is very often evidence that it is inferior, or Some possesses some other drawback. order. I submit that the honourable memberis travelling far beyond the bounds of this motion or any legitimate amendment of it .

If that is permissible, I regret that we were not made aware of it at an earlier stage in the debate, so that we might have discussed the matter from the same stand-point. matta to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Gippsland, which specifically asks that the price of land in different sites therein named shall be ascertained by the Government before this question is finally decided. It seems to me that the remarks made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro bear directly on that point. So far as I can understand, he is not dealing with the specific values of any one site as compared with another, but with the question of relative values hereto one or two, but to the several sites. I see no reason whatever to rule the honorable member out of order. able member appears to think that I am alluding to his electorate when I speak of"" the desert land in the west. The Prime Minister, in moving this motion, urged upon the House the desirableness of passing it, but I take it that honourable memberswould not be prepared to deal with this question in the absence of a thorough knowledge of the values of the variouslands. The Prime Minister informed us yesterday that he favoured the resumption of a large area, and we know that on a prior occasion he stated that he was in accord with the proposition submitted in favour of the resumption of a very much larger territory than 100 square miles.

If we are to spend the money of the people in acquiring a large territory and in building the Federal city, the people are entitled to the unearned in-crement. I take it that the Prime Minister inferred that at the proper time he would be prepared to show the House how the necessary funds could be provided. We have already heard a statement from the 'Treasurer showing that he is entirely in accord with the system now in vogue in Canada, where the banks are compelled to invest a certain proportion of their -funds in Government .bonds and securities.

B ut much as I want a Federal Capital, and strong as I am in upholding the compact embodied in the Constitution, I would, rather than put this unearned increment into the hands of owners of large estates, wait until we can come to some more patriotic arrangement. Surelyi t will not be contended that the land should not be resumed. No one will advocate that we should erect a Parliament House and other public buildings, lay out streets, provide a water supply, and go to great expense in other directions, and then allow the owners of property in the district to reap the added value which these improvements would give to it .

The best argument that could be adduced for that point of view has been put forward by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who has notified the House that in the report which was made by Mr Oliver, on behalf of the New land valuations of the proposed sites were given. to find that anything more is given than the value of the land' that would be required to make up the 100 square miles limit. ber's trouble is that the site which he favours is at the bottom of the list. site is at the top of the list in Mr Oliver's report.

But we have now arrived at that stage when I think it is necessary to explain my own views. Up to the present moment the subject has been discussed as though only two States were interested in this great undertaking. Whilei t may be very edifying to the representatives of those States to be slang-banging each other in connection with their local rivalries that? through the debate. The question has been discussed as though Victoria and New South Wales were the only States concerned. We have had an exhibition from the Government whip, who has complained bitterly of the attacks that have been made from this side of the Chamber; but, in my opinion, if the honourable member is in earnest about the matter he should have been more conciliatory than he has shown himself to be. I should have preferred to see the Government taking the responsibility which properly attaches to their position. The resolution is of such importance that they ought to have taken that responsibility by bringing down a Billi n the ordinary form. It has been said that there are hopes of an understanding being arrived at with another place. As far as I can judge from the debate which took place, there is a distinct opposition to anything of the kind ; and I am afraid that between the two stilesthe Government failing to take the responsibility ' for their action, and the unwillingness of the other Chamber to give up certain rights the session will end without anything whatever being done. Not being a representative of either New South Wales or Victoria, I can speak from a disinterested stand-point. Judging from the statement contained in the newspapers published in Victoria, and even in New Soutli Wales, there is an evident desireI clo not think I should be speaking too strongly if I used the word conspiracy-to prevent the provision in the Constitution relating to the selection of the capital site from being carried into effect. Not one reprelong enough ago to have given the Governsentative of Victoria will have the courage to stand up against the press of that State and advocate the establishment of what is termed the "" b u s h "" capital. I hold that this provision is one of the gems if the Federal territoiy is wisely selected ' the revenue derived by the Commonwealth will defray the whole cost of Federation. I believe, further, that if the capital site is not selected by this Parliament, there will be no chance of the selection being made by the next Parliament. What is the meaning of all the agitation against the "" bush "" capital ? Why all this clamour that either Sydney or Melbourne should be the seat of government ? honourable member will be courageous -> enough during the next electoral campaign to advocate the establishment of the capital. The honourable member for Gippsland has suggested that some steps should be taken to protect us against paying exorbitant prices for the land which may haye to be resumed within the Federal Capital area. I sympathize with his object, but do not think his proposal is practicable. Does he believe that we could obtain valuations from every owner of land within any of the proposed sites, and at the same time select a site before the expiration of this Parliament ? I am sure that the honourable member knows that his plans could not be carried out even if we sat here until Christmas. I hope that the Government will stiffen their backs in regard to this question. always stiff. of the Government I should insist upon a settlement of this question before the House dissolves. The matter is of sufficient importance to justify the Government in staking their existence upon its satisfactory settlement. They need not fear the result of assuming a firm attitude. They will obtain the support of a number of members of the Opposition. They, however, appear to be afraid of the Age and the Argus. I wish to know what the Government have done in connection with the 'acquirement of private lands within the Federal Capital area. On the 7th June, 1901-that was ment fair warningI directed the attention of the Prime Minister to section 125 of the Constitution, which provides that the seat of government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by Parliament, and shall",21,Barton

82,Mr Poynton,"If I were a memberbe within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth. I went on to point, out that a number of sites in various parts of New South Wales had been offered to the Commonwealth, and that probably within each of these sites some land was held in fee simple. I therefore asked the Prime Minister whether anything could be done to get such land placed under offer to the Government prior to the selection of the site, so that we should not be compelled to pay' very dearly for the properties which we might desire to resume. The Prime Minister replied that "" a l l considerations of that kind will come under the careful review of the Government, who are giving special attention to the question of the site of the Federal Capital."" I presumed from that answer that either the laws of the State would enable the Goveniment to acquire lands for public purposes on reasonable terms, or that it was intended to introduce legislation which would protect us against the payment of exorbitant prices. If we cannot insure that the land shall be sold to us at prices apart from any added value that may result from our action in regard to the capital site, we shall have to pay dearly for any property that we may require. I hope that before this discussion is ended the Government will tell us what they have done in this respect. If no action has been taken, and no inquiry has been made, the answer given by the Prime Minister amounted to nothing. I would urge the Government to stand firm. ' There is not the slightest chance of any choice being made by the next Parliament. We find that the candidates for the representation of Victoria in tlie Senate are already denouncing the proposal for the establishment of a ""bush"" capital. They are afraid of the press and of the electors. It is all very well for some honourable members to say that they are prepared to loyally abide by the terms of the Constitution, but as an old saying has it-""There are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with butter."" I submit that the proposal of the honourable member for Gippsland is intended to defeat the object of the Constitution. It will result in delay and place obstacles in the way of a settlement. It is of the utmost importance that we should take definite action before this Parliament is dissolved. Eveni f we select the site before the session closes, it does not follow that we shall not continue to meet in Melbourne for som'e time. If we allow the matter to stand over until the next Parliament is assembled, proposals will be made for a referendum with a view to secure an amendment of the Constitution by eliminating the provision that the capital shall be not less than 100 miles distant from Sydney. The question will then be raised that the seat of government should be either in Melbourne or Sydney, or alternately in both. The very moment that such a decision is arrived at we shall be called upon, either to pay rent for the buildings which we at present occupy, or to purchase land at a hundred or a thousand times the cost of that which is contained in any of the suggested capital site areas. Cannot honourable members see the conspiracy which is in progress t I feel so strongly upon this matter, that although it is a great inconvenience to many honourable members, including myself, to be compelled to devote so much time to their parliamentary duties, I hold that we should be justified in remaining here till Christmas in orderto have the capital selected. We can talk about the expenditure afterwards. If the question be not absolutely determined during the present session, there will be some justification for the complaint that the Government are not in earnest about the matter. Personally, I should have preferred the matter to be dealt with by Bill. However, the Government are still hopeful that the other Chamber will concur in these resolutions if they are adopted, and therefore I shall support them with the amendment suhmitted by the honourable member for North Sydney. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister for Trade and Customs) I desire to make a few remarks upon this matter, more particularly in reference to the observations of some honourable members upon the question of land values. If honourable members will turn to the first report of Mr Oliver, they will find that in the case of nearly every site he has given the value of the adjacent land up to 64,000 acres. sites upon whicli he reported are not identical with those upon which the last Commission reported. little difference in the sites. For instance, at Bathurst-as will be seen by reference",22,Barton

Orange, theimproved value of 64,700 acres (less 10,800 acres of Crown lands) outside of the municipal boundaries, is £365,000. If the town of Orange be included, the improved value of lands within the municipal boundaiies is 592, 26, making a total of £957,426. report does not give the cost of providing a water supply. Sir WILLIAM LYNE report sets out the cost of bringing an adequate supply of water to the various sites. In the case of Wellington, the improved value of 91,500 acres which are outside the municipal boundaries (less 15,890 acres of Crown lands) at £ 3 per acre is £226,830, and the improved value of lands within those boundaries is £167,535. The land 'values of the site at Carcoar-Garland, as roughly estimated for the whole area, including church and school lands, but exland resumed, as mentioned in sections 2 and 3 cluding the town of Carcoar, total £200,000, of this Act, shall be estimated without reference or at £ 3 per acre for 50,000 acres which are to anj' alteration in the value of such land arising outside the municipal boundaries,and£35,000 from any purchase or any appropriation or resumpfor lands within those boundaries, £185,000. establishing of any public works on any land the Therefore it is altogether a mistake for subject of any such purchase, appropriation, or honourable members to suppose that in nearly resumption. every instance a fair value has not been That is the law at the present time, so that, placed upon the Crown lands. upon which Mr Oliver reported the same petent for us to insert a provision that the site as that upon which the last Commission value of the land acquired shall be its reported 1 Sir WILLIAM LYNE Speaking of the lands adjacent to Bombala, that value?

I do not know municipal boundaries of the town of Bombala is what course the Prime Minister proposes to given at £72,665 ; forfcheresidue, about 74,000 adopt in reference to the amendment which acres, a fair average would be from £3 to £4 per has been outlined by the honourable member acre, some tracts being worth no more than 30s. for North Sydney, but personally I trust per acre, while others are worth £7.

I make these quotations in order to dispel the idea that no information is available as the New South Wales Government, free of to the value of the lands which are in close cost, the Crown lands upon the water-shed as proximity to the different sites. had a recent valuation made of a larger area. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I understand that the Prime Minister has obtained a valuation from the secretary of the lastCommission. In the case of Tumut there aro 41,000 Similarly in the case of acres of country lands which, in their unimproved state, are worth £ 1 0 4 , 0 0 0 ; 300 acres of town lands, which are valued at £ 3 7 , 0 0 0 ; and 500 acres of suburban lands, which, in their unimproved condition, are worth £10,000.

Honourable members will, therefore, see that there is really no necessity to go beyond Mr Oliver's report But the other to obtain an average value of the lands in the vicinity of the various sites. It was stated this afternoon that the Commonwealth would be compelled to acquire the land which it requires at its improved value. I interjected that we need not do so. In this connection I would point out that the Darling Harbour Wharves Resumption Act of New South Wales contains the following provision :The amount of compensation in respect of any tion for any purpose mentioned in this Aet, or the in passing a measure dealing with the the Albury site acquisition of the capital site, it is quite comvalue at the time of its resumption.

I am not prepared to say what the New South Wales Government will do in regard to Crown lands which are outside the Federal area. I feel sure, however, that they will meet the Commonwealth -Government as liberally as possible in every way. If I were Premier of New South WalesI should certainly grant the Commonwealth Government all the Crown lands, -irrespective of what area they might comprise, so as to assist in establishing an extensive site for the Federal Capital. are obliged to do. There is no question of the minimum of 64,000 acres. Sir WILLIAM LYNE -the right honourable member is correct I believe tliat the New South Wales Government will be required to grant all the Crown .lands within the area. MrA . McLEAN -The Constitution does aiot provide anything of the kind. Sir WILLIAM LYNE -some such provision in the Commonwealth law. 'the Government of New South Wales have -offered to give the Commonwealth only the minimum area provided by the Constitution? Sir WILLIAM LYNE that they have yet made any definite offer. We shall select a site, and, at the request -of the Commonwealth Government, the New South Wales Government reserved the land so that there shall be no further .alienation. I believe that the stipulation -applies only to the 64,000 acres provided for by the Constitution. They were not requested to go further. I do not think 'that they have yet made any offer in respect of a gift of Crown lands, but I have no -doubt that the whole matter will be settled in a way most satisfactory to the State Government. Whatever Crown land is contained in the Governany Federal area has to be given without payment. The motion proposes that a site shall be selected by means of an "" exhaustive ballot."" I do not quite understand what an "" exhaustive ballot"" means, but I take it that the interpretation placed upon these words will be that the whole of the sites are to be submitted together, and that honourable members will be asked to make a selection by one ballot. It . seems to me that that would be a most unwise course to pursue. For example, a large number of members from the north might favour the selection of a site in that part of New South Wales, while another large section from the south might vote for a southern site, with the result that the intermediate sites may be at once rejected. honourable meniber for North Sydney would overcome that difliculty. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I do not think so. It seems to me that this provision should be amended, and that honourable members should indicate by numbers the relative value in which each site is held by them. In other words, I think honourable members should number the sites in the order of their I think that preference. In that way the site which honourable members placed last on the list would at once fall out, and further ballots would take place until a final selection had been made. to a block vote. I think there is Sir WILLIAM LYNE No ; I think that the other system would have that objection. I have directed the attention of honourable members to this matter, because I consider it to be one of the utmost importance. I desire that, in any event, a fair method of arriving at the opinion held hy the majority of honourable members shall I do not think be adopted. It would be much to be deplored if any course were followed which would have the effect of accidentally destroying the chances of some of the sites which, although at first low down on the list, might, as the ballot proceeded, under the system suggested by me, attain a far' more prominent position. I think we should use every endeavour to prevent the rejection of sites in the earlier stages of the voting.

They are not dominated by either the Age or the Argus. Their fixed determination from the first has been to bring this question to an issue as soon as public business would permit. That desire has been in our minds from the very outset. the Government have had too much in their minds. Sir WILLIAM LYNE held this fixed determination the motion would not now be before the House. We have advanced the consideration of the question to its present stage, and it is the intention of tlie Government to do all in its power to secure its settlement during the present session. In these circumstances I do iiot think it is quite right for any one to blame the Government for the action which they have taken. This should not be a party question. I fear that the proposal made by the honourable member for North Sydney would not get over the difliculty to which I have referred. Another suggestion which has been made to me is that a vote should be taken on two sites at a time, and that the one receiving the higher number of votes should be included in die final list submitted to the House. similar to that proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney, but I do not think it would be a proper one to pursue. a thing should be done. member said that regard should be had to the geographical position of the several Sl< member's amendment is that the following words be added to paragraph 3 :Provided that before suoh exhaustive ballot be notice, but I fear the intriguing and wire taken the sites in each of the following groups be pulling that will go on outside of this reduced by ballot to one site in each group . . Thus, if there were two sites in one group, the House would be asked to decide between them, -and one of them would be at once thrown out. I do not think that would be a proper course to pursue. The honourable member suggests that a site should be selected from each group, and that a final selection should then be made. I believe that if honourable members will give my proposal careful consideration, they will recognise that it is a good one. I ask the House toconsider whether it would not be more equitable for honourable members to numbereach site submitted to the ballot according to their view of its merits. suggests something in the nature of a contingent vote. are nine sites, and what I suggest is that the site receiving the largest number of No. 9 votes on the first round should be rejected If we had not that there should then be another ballot, and that the site receiving the largest number of No. 8 votes should be allowed to fall, out.. The number of sites would gradually be reduced in that way until a final selection was made. ciple of the exhaustive ballot. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I know that it can hardly be described as an exhaustive ballot, but I think that it will be found the most equitable plan to adopt. I invitehonorable members to work out the problem and see for themselves whether the suggestion I have made would not be attended with better results than would be obtained from any other scheme. the' honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, that it is about time thatThat would be a course very honourable members representing States other than Victoria and New South Wales, had something to say on this subject. I did not intend at first to take part in this debate, but while I recognise that Victoria and New South Wales are very keenly interested in this question, I have to deplorethe fact that, during the course of the discussion, we have heard so much provincialism. It gives colour to the assertionsmade in the press in regard to the intriguing and wirepulling said to be going on. Such practices have not 'come under my Parliament if we fail to determine this question before tlie close of the present session. I feel sure that there are such powerf u l interests at work that if we cannot come to a definite decision during this session the intention of the Constitution will probably be frustrated for some considerable time.

I am anxious to see the Capital Site question settled, because I believe that the Eederal capital will supply an object lesson to Australia, and perhaps to the world. -am very glad that the members of this Parliament as a whole appear to be thoroughly seized of the advantage of the non-alienation -of this land, and I take it that it is precisely that principle to which so much objection is being raised. By its adoption a a very considerable revenue will, before many years are over, be raised from the land, so large that perhaps the whole expense of the Pederal Government may be met by it. The effect of such evidence of the' beneficent operation of the principle will be most striking to the people of Melbourne, a city whose land values amount to several millions of pounds, upon which not a penny of taxation k levied for the benefit of the State. Bo doubt the present condition of things in Melbourne is highly acceptable to the few favoured individuals who enjoy it , .and I apprehend that their hostility towards the selection of a capital in the bush is determined to no small extent by the principle that will be adopted in regard to the land and which in its beneficent operation will be an incentive to citizens elsewhere to obtain revenue on similar lines. that we cannot get away from the financial aspect of the question, I am far from agreeing with those who wish to be guided in this matter entirely by business considerations. Business considerations are all very well in their place; but, to look at this matter from a commercial point of view, would be to take -a very short-sighted view indeed. Business people do not usually concern themselves very much with posterity. But I take it that in this matter we have a very important duty to perform as regards the future generations of Australia, a duty some of whose circumstances at least far transcend the mere question of pounds, shillings, and pence. Moreover, I can easily realize a position in which we should be led entirely astray if we determined our actions wholly by the consideration of the probable cost of resuming the land of the Federal territory. Whab we have to consider is not so much the present cost as the value which the land is likely to obtain in the future. A great many considerations must enter into a determination of this kind, many of them view. I hope that honourable members will give them most careful thought. The future prosperity of the Federal Capital will not depend upon its initial cost, bub upon I its accessibility, its healthfulness, its picturesqueness, and the policy applied to its development. If we keep those aspects of the question carefully in sight, we may be enabled to make a very good bargain indeed for posterity. We may assure Australia of a capital which will be a favoured place of residence, which will develop into an important city, supplying in many respects an object lesson to the whole world. I hope that these aspects of the question will not be lost sight of, and that we shall, in all our deliberations, remember that thef uture of this territory is entirely in our hands. As regards the method of arriving at a decision, I do not agree with those who wish us to vote for particular districts. If the sites in any district had pretty well the same characteristics there might not be so much wrong with the method to which I take objection. But we know that the sites within some of tlie districts are entirely dissimilar. The voting therefore should be for particular sites and not for particular districts. the final selection. While I am willing to recognise we shall arrive at the final selection by gradually eliminating those which are regarded as the least suitable. I should like to see a vote taken upon a method of procedure which would leave us at the last, say, four sites to choose from. We should take what might be called a reversed preferential vote; that is, we should indicate our opposition to certain sites, and those which have no chance whatever would thus be thinned out. There would remain",26,Barton

Sir AVILLIAMM c MILLAN pretend to quite understand the legal position of the matter, but 1 take it that the principle underlying the land resumption Acts of the States and of the Commonwealth is that the Crown should be protected against persons who hold land for purposes of speculation, and should be asked to give only that value which the land had before there was a demand for it for public purposes..

We want a site which will be the best for Australia, and make the best centre of its dignity and prestige. Therefore, although it might have been desirable to obtain the information indicated by the honourable member, the fact that it has not been secured affords no reason for the delay which would be involved by adopting the honourable member's proposal. I agree with the honourable member for South Australia, Mr desires to act fairly to New South Wales, Poynton, that it would be most disastrous .to allow this matter to stand over until after the next general election. It has been reported that it is proposed to spend millions and millions of pounds upon the Federal Capital within the next few years, and although these reports are absolutely frivolous and unfounded, they have produced an impression upon the minds of the public which will probably operate against an early settlement of this question. A compact was made between New South Wales and the other States, and common sense, and reason urge that effect should be given to the terms of the Constitution by this Parliament. If the capital site question be thrown into the arena of general politics during the next election, the most unfriendly feeling may be created between New South Wales and the other States. I do not agree witli the honourable member for Perth in his objection to the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney. I think that it is only reasonable that we should bring the ultimate choice to within as small a compass as possible. We should group the geographical areas as the honourable member for North Sydney proposes, becausein some cases there is practically very little difference as regards the character of the country and the general situation between contiguous sites. Therefore, where two or three similar sites are proposed it will be best to reduce the number down to one. We must recollect that honourable members-and much less the people of the Commonwealth-ca n know but very little of these sites. The holiday touring which took place in connection with the inspection of the sites could not have added very largely to the information of honourable members, and it is our duty to reduce the .selection down to as small a compass as possible. For instance, if there are three sites which, apart from local feeling, do not differ 7ery widely from one another, why should we not decide which is the best, and thus gefc rid! of the complexity created by having to consider the claims of contiguous sites ? I think that the honourable member's proposal has. common sense to recommend it , and I hope that it will be accepted. I would urge the honourable member for Gippsland to withdraw his amendment, because it is clearthat if we are to make a final selection of the capital site during the present Parliament his proposal cannot be carried out. I am sure that the honourable memberalthough naturally he would like the Federal Capital to be situated as close as possible to Victoria. MrA .

As the honourable member foiEden-Monaro has pointed out, we must not consider the immediate necessitiesof the next few years. We must look forward to the possible developments of hundreds of years. £250,000 would be a very small amount to spend in acquiring an asset which would be at least worth that sum at the out3et, and which would increase in valuefcoa much greater extent than land of lower quality.

I had not intended to speak, and should uot have done so but for the course which events have taken. I regret the delay that -has occurred in dealing with this important -question. When New South Wales entered the Federation it was understood that the -capital site should be selected at the -earliest possible moment, and I believe that a majority of honourable members are anxious to carry out that compact. The -Government have not exhibited that expedition that the importance of the subject -demanded and they have not led the Housei n the matter. I am very sorry that the motion submitted by their representative in the Senate has been rejected. I admit that the objections raised in that Cliamber -deserve the consideration of honourable members, but at the same time the importance -of having the capital question settled warranted honourable members in agreeing to a departure from the ordinary course of procedure. Therefore I felt it my duty to support the proposal submitted by the -Government. I do not agree with those who prefer that this matter should be dealt with in a Secret manner. My name has ""been referred to as the representative of a district in which two of the proposed sites are situated, and I am quite prepared to ""take the responsibility of making my choice between them. I think that other members who happen to be in a similar position should take the same course. We ought to deal with the matter in an open and straightforward way, and be prepared to defend our actions at the proper time. W it h regard to the question of land values, ground of expense. A t the same time. I do I hope that the information in the possession of the Prime Minister will be submitted to honourable members at an early date. The honourable member for Gippsland urged delay because we had not f u l l inforwas taken before the Commission, because mation at our disposal, and because he feared that if a determination were arrived afc afc present land values would be raised, and the Commonwealth would be required to pay a much larger sum than if the land within the proposed sites were valued prior to the final selection. There will be no -difliculty in safeguarding the Commonwealth against any undue demands by land-owners. The State laws in New South e Wales provide that, in the case of land resumptions, compensation shall be paid upon the basis of the value prior to the date of resumption. The Minister for Trade and Customs has stated the position very clearly, and if the State laws should not prove sufficient to protect the Commonwealth against exorbitant demands, there would be no difficulty in introducing the legislation necessary to achieve that result. I do not intend to speak at any great length, because I feel that a protracted debate will involve further delay in the settlement of this most important question. I am anxious that expedition shall be used, and I regret that the Government are not exhibiting a firmer front, and are not displaying more determination in grappling with the difficulties which present themselves. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro pointed to the delay which had taken place in connection with the appointment of the Commission of Experts. Authority was given by this House for the reference of the sites question to'a Commission in October last, and a promise was made that the Commission should be appointed before the end of last session. They did nofc, however, commence their work until January last. Although the Minister promised that the report of the Commission would be laid upon the table of the House in A p r i l last, it was not forthcoming until the following July. Several weeks ago I preferred a request that the evidence taken before that Commission should be printed. able member knows that the Printing Committee declined to sanction that proposal. that objection was raised to it upon the not think that that objection was a valid one in view of all the circumstances of the case. Seeing that it was impossible to secure a f u l l report of the evidence which its printing would involve an expenditure of about £200, I asked that honourable members should be supplied with a precis of it.

126,Sir William Lyne,"Thafc summary willia some Victorian constituencies opposition is ofiered to any proposal to expend money upon the Eederal Capital site at the present time. fair to raise that objection at this late period of the day. As honourable members are aware, the electors of New South Wales refused to agree to the draft Eederal Constitution when the first referendum was taken. Premiers was held at which they approved of an arrangement by which New South Wales was to be granted the capital, and upon that condition she joined the Federation. That arrangement was subsequently endorsed by the people of Australia upon a second referendum. All that I ask is that that compact shall be respected. I cannot understand the reason underlying the agitation which is now in progress throughout Victoria to indefinitely postpone a settlement of this question. Quite recently one of the' newspapers in this city pointed out that the Constitution imposed no time limit within which it must be decided. It urged that it did not matter whether the' seat of government remained in Melbourne for an indefinite period so long as the Federal compact was ultimately ' carried out. ber say how the Government could raise the £10,000,000 which would be necessary to build a capital at the present time ? Minister has pointed out, there is no necessity to expend more than £500,000 at the present juncture. It is the policy of the honourable member and of other representatives of this State to hoodwink the people of Victoria by raising these fatuous objections. Personally I do not believe that the electors themselves agree with the view which is taken by them. A t all events, at a big meeting which was recently held in the Melbourne Town Hall:a meeting which was convened by the supporters of the Maffra movement to protest against the selection of the capital the great majority of those present carried a resolution in favour of keeping faith with New South WalesI would further remind the House that not very long since the people of Maffra strongly advocated the construction of a railway to a certain place which found favour in their eyes. Possibly they have arrived at the conclusion that the site I know that in question will not be acceptable to a majority of this Parliament, and accordingly have changed their attitude. If therecords of the State Parliament were conI n my judgment, however, it is unsulted, I think it would be found that the people of Maffra had done very well out of the Government of Victoria. must not discuss that matter. the movement which was started by the Maffra Shire Council is delay in the settlement of this question. pounds does the honourable member think the establishment of a Federal Capital will cost? necessity to spend millions of pounds. I agree with the statement of the Prime Minister that an outlay of £500,000 will be ample for some time. We ought to derive sufficient rent from the lands which we resume to pay interest upon the cost of their resumption. I repeat that it is the policy of the honourable and learned member for Corio to make it appear that a large sumwill require to be expended to carry out thecompact with New South Wales. But I would point out to him that when the peopleof Australia adopted the Constitution no stipulation was made as to the amount of money which should be expended upon the future Federal Capital. I regret that the lateCommission did not furnish us with estimates as to the outlay which would be involved in the acquisition of thevarious sites. Of course the principal question which we have to consider is the number of points which should be allotted to them on the ground of their distinctive features. I trust that I shall have anotheiopportunity of placing upon record thereasons which actuate me in voting for any particular site. There is no doubt that if the terms of the compact which was entered into with New South Wales are not respected, a good deal of dissatisfaction with Federation will be created-dissatisfaction which will materially interfere w it h the settlement of otherimportantquestions at theapproachingelections. In view of the brief period which is at our disposal prior to theprorogation of Parliament, I feel that I shall best be conserving the interests of New South Wales and ©f the Commonwealth by making my remarks as brief as.",30,Barton

That -feeling of regret is all the more pronounced because of the decision which has been arrived at by another place. It appears to me, however, that the Government are acting wisely in proceeding with this motion notwithstanding the action taken by the Senate. I have always held that, as the people of Australia, as a whole, have pledged themselves to New South Wales in the matter of the capital, a decision should be arrived at as soon as possible in regard to this question. Although we may select the site, it does not follow that we should incur a large expenditure in erecting buildings or carrying out other works upon it ; but, unquestionably, the site of the Federal capital should now be determined. The -earnest desire evinced by honourable members representing New South Wales that this question should be at once settled reminds me of the pictorial advertisement showing a baby in a tub straining to reach a cake of Pear's soap, with the statement at the foot of it that ""he won't be happy t ill he gets it . "" It is evident that they will not be happy until this question is settled, and it is equally clear that the Federal Parliament will not be very happy until it has been dealt with. Honourable members from New South Wales will not give us any peace until a decision has been arrived at, and for that reason also it seems to me that a selection should be made as -early as possible. If the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland werecarried, it would involve very great delay, people of Australia declare at the next and render it impossible for a site to be -selected during the present session. In the first place some time would be occupied by the House in determining which of the three sites should be selected, while another place would also be occupied for some days in -arriving at a like decision. As to the suggestion that if a selection were made in the terms of the motion we might be called upon to pay more than a reasonable price for the land, it seems to me that the Minister for Trade and Customs and the honourable member for Wentworth have shown very satisfactorily that we shall be protected by the laws prevailing in New South Wales, as well as by the fact that land in that State is valued from time to time for land taxation purposes. I u these circumstances, it is highly improbable that the pecple of Australia will be called upon to pay for this land a price largely in excess of its true value. While I agree that a site should be selected without delay, I wish it to be clearly understood that I do not advocate any extravagant expenditure. Notwithstanding the sanguine views held by some honourable members, a considerable sum of money must necessarily be expended on the construction, for example, of waterworks, and the interest on borrowed money expended in that way will not be met for some time. Then, again, if a site is selected which is not connected with the railway system of the State, a line will have to be constructed, and will not pay for some time to come. It remains to be seen whether any country can successfully manage its lands under a system of land nationalization. I have always advocated the making of the attempt, and it seems to me that although we should probably be unable to obtain from the various works a return sufficient to pay interest on the money borrowed for their construction, yet with good management, in a comparatively few years we should have no cause for regret. If there is a fear on the part of the people that extravagant expenditure will take place in connection with the construction of the Federal capital, it seems to me that we might wait for a time, and do no more than select the site. I believe I am right in saying that the site on which Washington is erected was originally swamp land, and that at least ten or twelve years elapsed before the Government of the United States took steps to build upon it. Therefore, if the elections that money shall not be expended by us in erecting the Federal city, we might follow the example of the United States of America and allow the work to stand over for a time. I fail to see why we should not wait. The people of New South Wales would be satisfied that the compact had been observed if we merely selected the site of the capital. They would know that when we were in a better financial position money would be spent in erecting suitable Government buildings and laying out the city.",31,Barton

SYDNEY SMITH -That would be only part of the compact. of the compact that a site should be at once selected, much less that the capital city should be immediately constructed. I have always held that the site of the capital should be selected as soon as possible, and I have not been led to change that opinion by the statements in the press, or by the opinions of my friends. As a matter of fact, I have not met a Victorian who is opposed to the selection of a site. All that many of the people of Victoria fear is that the selection of a site will be followed by extravagant expenditure in connection with the building of the city. Every Victorian with whom I am acquainted expresses a desire that the compact shall be observed. I intend to vote for the motion.

I must confess that, like other honourable members, I was at first sight somewhat taken with the amendment; but thei'e is no doubt that whatever other effects it might have, it would lead to the postponement of this question for the consideration of the next Parliament. I must confess that I do. not think that would be by any means an unmixed evil. I see objections to the determination of an important question of this kind during the last days of a moribund Parliament. It appears to me that some of the apprehensions expressed by certain honourable membersI do not think they especially those representing New South Wales-as to what might happen if the question were not decided during the present Parliament, are due to a feeling on theirpart that the people of Australia do not share their desire that the site of the capital should be selected forthwith. not. MrM c CAY I am speaking for the present of the eagerness displayed by some honourable members to have this matter at once settled. I can explain that eagerness only .by the supposition that they apprehend that the electors as a whole will not endorse the views now put forward by them. So far as the people of Victoria are concerned, I would point out that if the electors of this State are determined upon a certain course!, members will be found in the next Parliament who . will see that that course is adopted. The mere selection of the site will not carry very far forward those who desire to see the capital forthwith erected. people of Victoria wish to interfere with the compact. MrM c CAY I am dealing with one point at a time. I have never approved of the compact that was made at the Conference of Premiers, and subsequently embodied in the Constitution ; but I am one of those who for the sake of federation accepted that, with other provisions in the Constitution of which I did not approve. I , consequently, feel bound toassist in carrying out the compact which was then made, however much I may have disapproved of it at the time. I thinkthattheideaof some honourable members that the whole of this work was to be completed during the life of the first Federal Parliament is an utterly unreasonable interpretation of the Constitution. I am sure that the people of Victoria, at all events, never dreamt of any understanding such as that we should hurry off post-haste to the Federal Capital and take possession either of temporary or permanent buildings there. A matter of this kind is one in which deliberation rather than haste should be observed. I think that the selection of a site, the determination of the way in which it shall be laid out, and the time at which it shall ultimately be ready for occupation, are matters in regard to which undue haste should not be displayed.

I am not prepared to go in for heavy borrowing in older that we may hasten the establishment of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament there. While I am prepared to vote for the settlement of the Federal site question in pursuance of the undertaking which I , with other electors, gave when we voted for the Constitution in its present form, I wish to protect myself from being considered as pledged to proposals capital. learned member explain why the representatives of New South Wales do uot wish the knowledge of all the sites, because no onequestion to be settled 1 Some of them have can give the time necessary 'for the exbeen living upon it all the session.

I do not agree with the proposal to deal with the sites in districts, The best and the next best site might both be situated in the one district.

We should have heard a great deal about brutal majorities, or whatever is the parliamentary form of that phrase. This is not a matter which should have any party complexion at all, and the Government are acting wisely in preventing it from having that complexion. I think the amendment will have no practical effect but delay. That is not ostensibly its intention, and I do not think it is a subterfuge to cause delay. In my opinion, however, we ' have already sufficient material to be reasonably sure of getting, on the whole, our money's worth in any site we may select. shall vote agaiust the amendment,and support the motion in its present form, reserving to myself the right to say later how far and how fast we shall proceed with the building of the Eederal Capital. the Government have proposed the right method of selecting the site that is to be the future capital of Australia, but the adoption of the amendment suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney would be an improvement, because I think it would lead to a better selection. Failing the adoption of that suggestion, to which there does not appear to be much opposition, however, I suggest that the Government should consider the possibility of treatchosen temporary buildings should be ing the western district as one site. The actual location of the Federal Capital can be determined afterwards if that site is selected. Those in the western district of ""New South Wales -who took an active interest in this matter came to the agreement that there should be no competition between the various proposed sites in that district; that they would leave it to the Federal Parliament to choose the best site, and the Commissioners were asked to report upon three sites in the district, though practically those three sites may be regarded as one. Some of the representatives of Victoria complain because reference has been made to their action in favouring delay. I do not think that they have any right to complain, seeing that Victoria is the only State in which there is an organized effort to prevent the selection of a capital, and in which the endeavour to stave off the settlement of the question for an indefinite period is actively supported by the press. A l though it is always wrong to attribute improper motives to an honourable member, the the fact that several of the representatives of Victoria are in favour of delay justifies us in being very anxious for the settlement of the question this session. If the honourable and learned member for Corinella thinks that a delay of two and a half years is too short to be taken into consideration at all, we must. assume that in his opinion it would not matter if the capital site were not chosen for five or ten years. The honourable member for Wannon said that the New South Wales members will not be happy until they get the capital site chosen, and he and the honourable and learned member I for Corinella seem to think that the representatives of New South Wales are unreasonable inwishing to have the matter settled so soon. They overlook the fact that the people living in the districts in which these nine sites are situated are waiting for the determination of the question by Parliament. The Crown lands in those sites are locked up from settlement, and it is unfair both to the Government of New South Wales and to those who wish to settle on the land to allow this state of things to continue longer than is necessary. We need, therefore, make no apology for urging the Government to see that the provision of the Constitution is complied with as soon as possible. I think, too, that after the site has been erected, so that Parliament can meet there, and be free from local influences, such as the Maffra-Kyabram movement, with its pratings about economy. The honourable member for Gippsland has been lauded in the daily press of Victoria for his statesmanlike proposal in moving the amendment. He appears to assume that the people of New South Wales are desperately anxious to sell their land to the Federal Government, and consequently he proposes a Dutch auction, and wishes us to ask them to say at what price they will sell their land.

They were very strongly and decidedly opposed to it because they realized that the -capital would not be so close to their towns that they would receive any very great benefit from tlie new settlement. honourable meniber for Gippsland seems to think that those who have land within the proposed sites are likely to offer it at low prices, because they are anxious to get rid of it. idea of which I have heard. Although the houorable member claims to know all about land transactions, he shows an utter lack of acquaintance with the conditions which prevail within the areas reported upon by the Commissioners. The honourable member seems to think that in the event of our not having the land properly valued beforehand, the owners will claim boom prices. If that impression be correct, it is not at all probable that they"" would now offer to sell at low prices. The amendment proposed by the honourable member would involve, in the first instance, the selection of three or four sites. Theni t would be necessary to decide the area to be embraced in each case -whethe r it should be 100, 200, or 1,000 square miles. Having decided that point, 'we should have to send surveyors to msvrk out the areas. We should then require to -communicate with the land-owners in each area, and ask them to name the lowest price they would be prepared to take for their properties. Upon the receipt of their replies we should have to send round valuators to inspect all the properties, and afterwards the valuators would have to compare their -valuations with the offers made by the -owners. The honourable member is not prepared to say that we should select the site -obtainable at the lowest cost. He realizes that it might not be wise to take the cheapest « it e ; but he indicates that we should be influenced in our ' selection by the valuations which most nearly approach the assessments of the valuators. The honourable member apparently expects that a certain amount of patriotism will be -exhibited; but the land-owners in New South Wales, like those in other States, desire to get as much as possible for their ' property. We know that the State always has to pay a little more than other people -for any land that it may require, but the New South Wales laws provide safeguards -against any exorbitant prices being demanded. honourable members who profess to be anxious to observe economy should calmly contemplate the expense that would be involved in surveying four sites and having valuations made of the properties within four areas, The instead of one. I hope that we shall practise economy by insuring that there shall be no unnecessary expenditure in connection with the selection of the capital site. The selection should not depend upon But that is about the most amusing the price at which we can obtain the land, but upon the situation and climatic and other considerations. I do not consider that the Government should be called upon to take upon themselves the responsibility of selecting a .site. I believe that by the method they have proposed we shall arrive at a satisfactory .result in the most direct manner possible. If the Government had introduced a Bill naming any particular site, the whole of the nine sites would have been made the subject of discussion, and honourable members would have been required to come to a decision in respect to each of them. I give the Government every credit for having adopted the course best calculated to arrive at a selection independently of any party considerations. I hope that the Government will succeed in following out to a final conclusion the course which they have marked out in connection with this question. I shall support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney, because I think it will assist us in arriving at a fair conclusion. If that .amendment is not carried, I hope that the Government will agree to submit the three western sites together. We cannot say at what point within any of the proposed areas the capital will be situated, and I think that in the first instance it would be preferable to submit the -three western sites as one. I am untrammeled so far as my vote is concerned. Those who had the task of suggesting sites did not travel so far west as my electorate. Some of my constituents believe that they could point out very good sites for the Federal capital within the Darling electorate, but I am perfectly free to make my choice between those which have been reported upon by the Commissioners. I hope that we shall be able to make a final selection and dispose of the whole subject, once and for all, before the session closes. sooner we get rid of this Capital site question the better. I do not think that anything has I am astonished that those done more to provoke an anti-Federal spirit",36,Barton

I have always been content to leave the question absolutely to the untrammelled decision of the Federal Parliament ; but at tbe same time. I recognised that there were many others who were not prepared to do so. The result was that we had to agree to the stipulation made by New South Wales that the Capital should be located within that State, a certain distance away from Sydney. was not rejected on account of the absence of a provision regarding the Capital. granting of the Capital to New South Wales was the turning point between success and the failure in' connection with the adoption of the Constitution. I know perfectly well tliat there were other amendments of the Constitution to which I attached more importance, such, for instance, as that relating to the power of the Houses at a joint sitting. I thought it very important that a simple majority should rule instead of a two-thirds majority. I should have preferred to leave the whole matter of the Capital site to the Parliament, and I do not think that any injustice would have been done to New South Wales in the matter. I believe that the Struggle which New South Wales made for the Capital, induced something like resentment on the part of others, and so heightened a difficulty which was naturally serious enough. ticular struggle for the Capital. representatives of New South Wales, and the strong stand that was made by them and by the New South Wales Parliament on the point, and I believe that if we had not conceded the capital to New South Wales we should not have brought about Federation so early as we did. However, whilst I regret that it was necessary to do this, I recognise that the compact was entered into. I had the honour to represent the State of South Australia at the Conference of Premiers at which the matter was arranged. By the representatives of the other States, outside of Victoria, the question was looked upon as one chiefly between the two most populous States, New South Wales and Victoria, and when we found that Sir George Turner was willing to accept the proposal of the Premier of New South Wales with reference to the adjust-ment which now appears witliin the fourcorners of the Constitution, we saw clearly enough that the difficulty was capable of being removed in that way, and we assented to it . It would ill become any one of thePremiers who agreed to that arrangement, or, indeed, any one who voted for the acceptance of the Bill with that stipulation on the referendum to do less than carry it out at the earliest reasonable moment.. That is the position I intend to take. I hope we shall do all we can to settle this trouble in the way provided by the Constitution, and with the best of grace at I think that the the earliest possible and reasonable dategrant New South Wales the Capital. I do not say that we should hurry, and thus possibly make a mistake that would befraught with great trouble' to the Commonwealth ; but at the same time. I do not favour any suggestion as to the inexpediency of haste for the purposes of justifying delay that ought not to take place. I should be only too glad to see an arrangement arrived at, and to visit New South. Wales-if it be the will of the electors that I should do so-as a member of the Federal Parliament. We have been veiy happy here in Melbourne.' Victoria has doneeverything possible to promote our comfort, and to treat us in the way we ought to betreated, and we should be grateful accordingly. But the people of New South Wales will welcome us quite as heartily, as, indeed, would the people of any other State. There is a sentiment in this matter towards the Commonwealth Parliament that will induce the people to do everything possible to expedite its entry to the Federal Capital, and the sooner the terms of the Constitution are carried out the better. Of course theexpense that will have to be incurred in connection with the establishment of the Capital is an important consideration. I am not making that statement with the slightest intention of justifying delay, which should not take place'; but I trust that, before we reach the final stage, we shall at least be able to form a rough estimate as to the difference in cost of the proposed sites. Even without the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland, which commends itself to my mind, although I am not prepared tovote for it at this moment, because of the fear of unnecessary delay, I trust that the Government will do everything they can,.",37,Barton

167,Mr Kingston,"I know who were the'-before the two Houses are asked to vote, to lay before honourable members every possible 'information that could guide them to a right conclusion in this matter. I do not regard the Government as being in the slightest degree to blame for delay. The -question is a big one, and we have been very busy. Of course I might be expected to take a biased view with regard to a portion -of the time during which the delay is said to have occurred. I believe that the manner in which this question has been pushed and pushed and pushed by some honourable members at different times has not been calculated to assist the movement, but has -caused it to be regarded as of a party -character. I hope, however, that we shall now sink any party differences and deal with the matter in a business like way. What is the best way of doing it? A -regards this proposal, I say to the Prime Minister tliat if he can carry it-and I shall vote for it it is the best which can be adopted. I shall be delighted to see it -carried. As a member of the House of Bepresentatives, I should welcome more frequent applications of the principle of .joint sittings to the decision of various questions, though if I were a member of the other Chamber,I do not know that I should view the matter in quite the same light. The closer we can get to the Senate, and the more matters of national importance can be determined by a joint vote of the Houses the better. It is probably patent to members of the other branch of the Legislature that the Senate is not quite so likely to .get its way by agreeing to a joint sitting -as it is by the adoption of the usual course of procedure. When there are two . bodies, one of which is twice as strong numerically as is the other, and when the feeling of each runs in a different direction, what is the result of their meeting together ? The probable result i§ that the view of the more numerous House will prevail. A t present the Senate undoubtedly has the right of veto. It is not compelled -unles s it consents to a joint sitting-to submit itself to the will and weight of superior numbers. upon this question. stitutional position which renders the concurrence of the two Houses desirable, I am , inclined to think that if I were a member -of the SenateI should be disposed to prefer a proposal by one House and its submission to the other, or a ballot by each. If , under those circumstances, we arrived at the same conclusion, so much the better. As a matter of common practice, the two Houses do not sit together. In that ""way the Senate preserves a power which would scarcely exist if it consented in all cases to a joint sitting. However, let us hope for 'the best. I imagine that this step has not been taken by the Government without some attempt having been made to ascertain the feelings of the other branch of the Legislature, and, consequently, I hope that the best results may accrue from it . If , however, it should so happen -that the Senate, in the first instance, cannot be induced to consent to a joint sitting, possibly an agreement may be arrived at in the usual way. If that 8 were proved by actual experience to be impossible, I take it that the other branch of the Legislature would recognise that the solution of our constitutional difficulties is to be found in a joint sitting of the Houses, and would assent to that course with the best result. I merely wish to add that, whatever we may do as regards the selection of a site. I trust that we shall resolve not to part with the fee-simple of the land. The idea underlying the proposal for the establishment of a Federal Capital and for acquiring a country area, which will be our own property, is that it shall be retained so that the increased value which may be given to it by Federal expenditure shall benefit the Commonwealth. When people talk of expenditure and possible loss in this connection, and when they sneer at a bush capital, I venture to think of a capital which will be erected upon good land-the Crown land being a gift to the Commonwealth and the private land acquired upon reasonable terms-and which, as regards public expenditure, shall increase in value from year to year, such value being retained for the -benefit of the Commonwealtha handsome endowment for all time. In this connection we have only to look at the experience of other cities. Had an equally well considered policy been adopted in regard to any one of our capital cities, and had the not united land been retained for the public benefit by being let upon terms at a fair rental, with periodical re-appraisements, I venture to think that instead of private speculators monopolizing the improved value of city lands there",38,Barton

When people talk of extravagance, I say that in connection with Eederal management there has been no . extravagance which, in the slightest degree, justifies the criticisms to which we have been subjected. Rather, I believe, that we have set an example to the States Parliaments. I know perfectly well the sentiments of the Treasurer' in that direcof the experiment will be eagerly watched tion, and I am aware that he has never spared himself, either in. the State Legislature or in this Parliament, to give effect to the greatest practicable economy. believe that both sides of the House have supported that policy,and I am sure that careful as we have been in the past, we are not likely, in connection with this Eederal Capital, to rush headlong into thoughtless expenditure. I shall, indeed, welcome the time when, not only shall we have a Eederal Capital which is worthy of the name, and which is free from local colourAustralian in itself-bu t when we shall have satisfactorily settled a Jong-vexed question, which, under the terms of the Constitution, it is our duty to settle at the earliest possible moment. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) -It seems to me that the representatives of New South Wales should take advantage of the present opportunity to secure a decision upon this question, because after Kyabram has finished with the Victorian representatives there will be very little hope of settling it next session. Personally, I do not care twopence about it. It cannot affect.me upon the West Coast of Tasmania. Kyabramites with their tails cut off would not affect my position. A t the same time, I desire to see justice done to the people of New South Wales. I would suggest to the Prime Minister that in the B i ll dealing with the acquisition of the Federal territory a clause should be inserted providing that the land-owners interested must sell their lands at the price at which they were valued prior to the accomplishmentof Federation. vided for. MrO ' MALLEY have that assurance. When I was at Tumut one man who drove me out to see ' the site declared that it was a crying disgrace that his land was not within the five or ten miles limit. He affirmed that his. landlord had given him notice that when Tumut was selected as the capital site his. rent would be doubled, and that when his lease expired he would not be able to secure its renewal. It seemed to me that there was a capital confidence game upon the linesof the bunko-steerers of New York. I trust that the democratic members of the House will carefully consider this question before they arrive at a decision. The successby people in all parts of the world. We desire to get as far away as possible frcm the settled portions of New South. I Wales. I do not wish our chances of doing so to be jeopardized by the selection of any particular site, unless we have an absolute guarantee that we can acquire all the land that we desire. Suppose, for example, that' we select a site in New South Wales, a n i the State Government says to us, "" We willgrant the Commonwealth the minimum area prescribed by the Constitution, namely ten. miles square."" Naturally the Commonwealth Government offices would be built upon the centre of that area. A private syndicate would then be in a position to construct an electric tramway just outside the Federal territory. The result would be thafc the city would grow up outside the Federal boundary and the private syndicate would! reap all fche benefit of the Commonwealth expenditure. That is the trouble against which we have to guard. If we carry these resolutions and the Senate declines to agree to a joint sitting of the Houses, what will be the result ? We shall have wasted time in discussing an absolutely negligible quantity. Indeed, 40,000,000 Why should -we not get to work at once and select a site *!

I am not sure that we have sufficient material before us to enable us to finally determine this great question. I feel pressed to a great extent by the viewpresented by the honourable member for Gippsland, that if we passed the motion in its present form we should bind ourselves when the Enabling Bill is introduced to vote for the particular site selected at the joint sitting, and not to reject it under 'any circumstances. I feel undoubtedly embarrassed in that if we bind 11 B ourselves hand and feet, as we should do if we passed this motion, I am not quite certain that we should be able to acquire private lands-and , after all, I understand that ifc will be mostly private lands that will be required-as economically as we should be able to do if there were some choice left to the Parliament. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN W o u l d not the honourable and learned member's proposal reopen the danger of having one House proposing one site and the other another ? to an agreement. I do not anticipate any difliculty in that respect ; but I feel strongly that a difliculty will arise, in that we shall have to make a definite selection in the absence of sufficient information to enable us to determine what the cost will be. The Prime Minister may, of course, brush aside that difliculty by showing that the Government is in possession of sufficient information to enable us to arrive at the probable cost of acquiring the land. I do not feel prepared at the present moment,however, to say that I will accept, whatever may be the cost to. the country, any site which the joint sitting proposes. That is my position. I do not think we have the means or the materials to enable us to ascertain the probable cost. A t all events, I am not in possession of them. If we were to do what is suggested by the amendment-selec t three sites and eliminate all others-w e should act unfairly, but if the Government could see their way to allow three sites to be reported to the House, leaving the Parliament to decide, on satisfactory information as to the probable cost, which of the three should be finally selected, I think we should be relieved of a great deal of difficulty.

The site for which the lowest number of votes is cast on the second ballot is eliminated, and a third ballot is taken, and the voting continues in that way until one site alone remains. When a member loses his first choice, he transfers his vote to his second; when he loses liis second choice, he transfers his vote to his third ; and so on. The system proposed is similar to that adopted in the United States in. their Conventions, when they ballot until an absolute majority is obtained by one candidate. system allows arrangements to be made aud possible bargaining to take place between the ballots. WhatI suggest is that each member should give a preference vote for each of the sites, but that he should do it once and for all in the first ballot. If the system which I propose is adopted, one ballot-paper will be given to each member, ancl opposite his first preference he will place the figure 1; after his second preferencethe site he would choose in the event of his first preference being rejected-the figure 2; after his third preference-the site for which he would vote in the event of his first and second preferences being rejected-h e would place the figure 3. vote. it is. Instead of having seven or eight ballots before a final decision is reached, there would be one ballot, but the same result would be obtained. The system has the advantage that it makes the balloting free from any possible imputation of interference between the ballots. in arranging combinations or making bargains during the balloting? able member should vote for the sites in tlie order of his preference, and that no bargaining should be possible. I desire to prevent a man saying-""If you will vote against site X , I will vote against site Y, "" or, "" Let us combine to vote for site X , in order to secure the rejection of site A . "" It is desirable that we should avoid even the suspicion of bargaining while the ballot is in progress. in the amendment which will assist us in coming to a reasonable and clear decision upon the question. If the amendment were carried, we should have to declare at the first ballot the opinions we hold regarding every one of the sites submitted. The amendment means that honourable members cannot be trusted after the first ballot to give a second preference according to their second choice. It seems to be assumed that we do not recognise the responsibility attaching to our office, and therefore cannot be trusted to do what is right. The inherent weakness of the proposal lies in the .assumption that we can learn nothing to-morrow that we do not But the know to-day. Why should any honourable member be debarred from altering his mind between the first and the second ballots ? Why should he not learn something after the taking of the first ballot which would cause him to alter his opinion in regard to the remaining ballots? The honourable and learned member proposes that if I vote for site X as my first choice, and that happens to be the last on the list when the primary votes are counted, that site will be defeated and my second clioice will become my first choice in the second count, and so on right down the list. Does the honourable member seriously argue that in an ordinary exhaustive ballot I should depart from my second choice on my second count ? the kind.

I think the amendment should be agreed to. I explained on a former occasion that as the motion stands it would absolutely commit lionorable members fco vote for the site reported to the House as agreed to by the Conference -My difliculty is that I am not personally in possession of sufficient information to guide me as to the probable cost involved in the selection of any particular site. I feel that we ought to proceed in any event to the selection of a site now. Since we have been invited to do so, it would be a contravention of our duty to refuse. I desire, however, to proceed as economically as possible, and to feel sure that we shall not embark upon any unnecessary expenditure. I think that the capital should be established upon the most economical basis consistent with the object we have in view, and, therefore, carrying out the idea suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland, I think that it would be advisable to ask that three sites should be submitted so that the Houses may make a final -choice in the face of fair competition between the sites as to the cost. If the Prime Minister can afford the House the necessary information earlier so that we may judge for ourselves as to the advisability of selecting any one or other of the sites, that would probably be sufficient; but I do not like to vote blindfolded or to commit myself to support whatever site may be determined upon by an absolute majority of the Conference. Sir EDMUNDBARTON I am quite conscious of the excellence of the motives of my honourable and learned friend, but I cannot quite bring myself to believe that the amendment has as much practicality as generally marks'his proposals. I think, on the whole, that the project would plunge us into difficulties greater than those we must necessarily encounter. If we were to determine upon three sites at the Conference, those three sites would have to be dealt with in a Bill, and it would be very difficult to bring forward any Bil l without either leaving a blank to be filled up by selecting one of the three sites by each House in turn, or by including the whole of the thi-ee sites in the Bill in the first instance, and leaving the final choice to be made by an exhaustive ballot or preferential vote. One of these I feel very much consequences must ensue, and in case of either of them we should be involved in difiSculty. We should have to overcome the difficulty as to voting if we nominated three sites to be determined by the Houses either separately or together. If we left a blank to be filled in by the House of first instance, so to speak, that House would insert the name of a site or district, and if the other House differed-and , of course, we know that it is within the bounds of possibility that it would-that name would be removed and another would be substituted. Then we should have the whole trouble over again, and we should have to proceed by the usual parliamentary method of amendment, objection to amendment, and insistence upon the amendment of the amending House. A f t er that we should have a Conference, and after that what 1be great difficulties at any rate, because if the Conference of the two Houses disclosed an adherence on the part of each House to the site that it had named, it would not be able to report any agreement.

If that is the object of the amendment, no doubt the honourable and learned member for Werriwa will co-operate with his friends with the view to getting us out of the diffi-culty in which its adoption would land us. I am not so strongly wedded to the use of the word "" site"" as to make a long fight in its favour. A t the same time.

If the -House uses the word ""districts,"" instead -of itself specifically selecting the seat of government, it will have to constitute some delegated authority, which, within a certain area, will be empowered to select the seat of government for it . I do not think that any difficulty would be experienced in that respect. If the House selected the district in which the capital is to be located, it might be quite content to allow experts to determine the site of the city. Personally, I think that such a tribunal could select it better than we could. Upon that aspect of the question I should like to hear the views of honourable members. Probably tlie honourable and learned member for Werriwa will co-operate with his friends with a view to safeguarding us in the matter, otherwise I think we should adhere to the terms of the resolution. is no doubt good. When once we have decided upon the territory, no doubt an exhaustive consideration of the. whole area, with a view to throwing further light upon it, would be a very good thing. But in view of the saving of time which will thereby be effected, I think it is better to adopt the resolution in its present form, and to allow the Conference to consider the question which has been raised, especially as it involves a constitutional point. As the Goverument is at one with the honourable and learned member for Werriwai n his desire that the best site sliall be selected within the area, it might be possible-befor e the Conference meets-to frame a resolution which would be in the nature of an instruction.to the Government, in the drafting of the Bill.

But so far as The Commissioners themselves have already recommended that a proper contour survey should be carried out before any final selection of the site of the city is made. We are quite competent, no doubt, to fix the location of the capital in a general way; but I , for one, am convinced that in two instances a hurried selection, made primarily on the part of local residents, and an equally hurried inspection by the Commissioners, has ' led to an error in regard to the best position in which to build the city itself. In view of that fact I think that, in the absence of further expert advice, it would be highly unwise to come to a final determination in this respect. be. As the motion stands we shall have to We should have a detailed survey to assist us, and I think that the necessary provision could be made in the Bill, founded on the resolution arrived at by the Conference, or by the Houses sitting separately. I cannot help inferring from the speeches which have been made that we are disposed somewhat to depart from the right track in dealing with the motion as ifc stands. The resolution that has been carried relates to a determination, not as to the Federal territory to be acquired, but as 'to the seat of government. The first paragraph in the motion is, that a conference be held-""to consider the selection offcheseat of government."" The Constitution places no obstacle in the way of the extension of the Federal Territory right up to Sydney, as long as the seat of government itself be distant 100 miles from that city. The proposal to fix a district is a very vague one. What we shall have to do, if the motion stands, is to consider the seat of government, or, in other words, the particular place at which the Federal Capita] shall be erected. If honourable members look at section 125 of the Constitution they will see that it provides that the seat of government shall be determined by the Parliament; that if New South Wales be an original Statei t shall be within tliat State, and be distant nofc less than 100 miles from Sydney. There is no restriction, so far as the territory itself is concerned. able and learned member will find that, practically, there is a limit, because we have to deal with the State Parliament ofi New South Wales. Crown lands are concerned, they must be handed over to the Commonwealth without any payment. The difliculty occurs solely in regard to private lands. miles would run .only 10 miles in any one direction. an area of 100 square miles. As the Prime Minister has indicated, an area of 400, or even 1,000 square miles, may be acquired. But I think it is clear that it is a mistake to suggest that we are simply proposing to fix the district within which the seat of government is to fix the seat of government. We shall subsequently have to declare in the B ill what area of land adjoining the city itself shall be acquired, and in -what direction it shall be taken up. We have now, as it were, to fi x the centre and then to describe the circumference. ral territory outside New South Wales? express an opinion on that point.

MrL . E. GROOM -Quite so. If we raccepted the amendment, we should revert to ""the position which we occupied before passing the resolution for the appointment of a Commission to report on these several sites. My object is to ascertain what are the inltentions of the honourable and learned member. No doubt they are honourable, and therefore he should take care to see that his -amendment will give absolute effect to them. '-the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs that this amendment would practically re-open the whole question, and leave us as we were when the work of in. specting the various proposed sites was first ' -entered upon. When this matter, was remitted by the State Government of New '-South Wales to Mr Oliver, a large number of presumably suitable sites were put --before him for consideration. After a very exhaustive inquiry, he reduced the number to three-Orange, Yass, and Bombala. Subsequently, in appointing expert Commissioners to submit a report to the House, we decided to widen the scope of the inquiry by submitting to their consideration the nine sites which had been reported upon by Mr Oliver. The motion proposes that a Conference shall take place between the two Houses to deal with the sites reported upon by the Commission, and if we turn to the report of that Commission we shall find that it deals practically with the site of the proposed .city rather than with the broad question of the territory to be acquired. As a matter of fact, it does' not touch upon the territory to be acquired. All the information that we have as to the question of territory is that which has been compiled by Mr Oliver, and thus, if we adopt this amendment we shall practically set aside as useless the report presented by the Commission which we appointed. I think that that Commission would have been well advised if it had dealt with the broader question, and its failure to do so has to some extent placed us at a disadvantage. If we wish to arrive at a satisfactory decision we can dp so only by carrying the motion as submitted by the Government, with the modification suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney. We should deal with the question as the We shall otherwise reCommission appointed by us has dealt with it. Once having selected the site of the city itself we should decide upon the territory to be acquired. I feel that if we adopted this amendment we should re-open the whole question and be led into an almost interminable discussion that would practically defeat the object which we have in view. I quite agree with the object which the honourable and learned member for Werriwa has in view in submitting this amendment, I recognise with other honourable members that his proposal would leave the question to be determined so open that it would give rise to considerable difficulty.

260,Mr Glynn,"The word "" seat"" is used 1without the necessary care, and the discussion which has taken place shows that we should not be in too great a hurry to determine this matter. the Prime Minister might very well consider the point raised by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr quired."" Glynn. He has pointed out that no reference is made in the Constitution to the Federal capital site. The only thing mentioned is the seat of government and the Federal territory, and the site of the Federal capital will have to be fixed within that territoiy. I suggest that the word "" territory "" should be substituted for "" site "" in the paragraph now under consideration. Sir that would launch us into still greater difficulties, because the territory will have to be dealt with subsequently. adopted the word "" locality "" it would overcome the difficulty. position : Section 125 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament shall determine the seat of government. The view of the Government upon this matter was explained by me last night. First, we must determine the seat of government by Act of Parliament. When that determination has been arrived at, it will be for the New South Wales Parliament to pass a lawafter such negotiation as is necessary-sur rendering to the Commonwealth the territory which is comprised within the site selected. The Parliament of the Commonwealth will then pass a law accepting it as Federal territory. That step will bring the area surrendered under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. A t that process I stop. There are several other processes to be undergone, but that is as far as we need contemplate going at the present time. If at this stage we complicate the question under consideration by deciding as to the Federal territory, we shall be leaping before we come to the stile. Our first object should be to determine the seat of government. To fix the Federal territory before we have absolutely defined its extent and boundaries -eve n if we had the power to acquire it in that way-woul d be premature, because our first business is to determine the seat of government. ment 1 Sir EDMU ND BARTON -Undoubtedly . The honourable and learned member will see that, if he refers to section 125 of the Constitution. the seat of government shall be within territory which ""shall have been acSir EDMUNDBARTON I do not attribute too much importance to the words "" shall have been acquired."" In considering the whole of the ramifications of that section, I do not think they will bear the interpretation which the honourable and learned member would place upon them. If we deal with the question of the Federal territory we shall be anticipating what vernment has been selected. I am merely stating the view at which I have arrived after long consideration. But, apart from If the Prime Minister all other objections, if we use the word ""district,"" or ""locality,"" or ""territory,"" even if we do not encounter some such obstacle as I have mentioned, we shall be confronted with another difficulty. We shall be using an expression which requires some sort of definition without assigning any limits within which it shall apply. Therefore, quite contrary to our wish, the Federal territory might be almost cp-extensive with the whole of the State in whioh the capital is to be located. That is a difficulty which might be insuperable. If the word "" district"" is employed we shall have to use it in juxtaposition with otlier words, which will show the kind of distriet we mean. If we used the word "" locality,"" which has been suggested because it coincides with the expression which is employed in the Commission, and therefore has some sort of signification in that connection, we might guard it by omitting the word ""sites"" in the resolution, and insert in lieu thereof the words "" The following localities, namely A l bury, Armidale, Bathurst, Bombala, Dalgety, Lake George, Lyndhurst, Orange, and Tumut."" We might use some expression which would convey a definite meaning as applied to the localities which were reported upon by the Commission.

288,Sir Edmund Barton,"Then noone's mind. I shall ask the House to say that the absence of the application of the expression in question to other groups of sites referred to in the resolution for the appointment of the Commission is some evidence that the use of it in one particular case is exceptional, and covers no governing implication that should cause it to be applied to all the sites named in the report. Without wishing to adopt any . strained. view of this proposal, I really think that if the honourable member reconsiders the matter he will see the advisableness of withdrawing his amendment as being calculated in itself to prevent the Senate from coming to a oneness of purpose with us by agreeing that a vote shall be taken at a joint sitting of both Houses. In my opinion, anything which would lead to that result has, as I pointed out last night, some element of danger in it . should like to point out to the Prime Minister that the grouping of Orange, Bathurst, and Lyndhurst, in the resolution referring to the Commission the work of inspecting and reporting on these sites, was clue to no mere error in drafting. It was deliberately done. Minister in charge of the resolution said at the timeNowI come to Orange. I have always recognised that the neighbourhood of Orange and the sites proposed at Bathurst and Lyndhurst are really part and parcel of the same area, and would have to be included in tbe Federal terri-, tory if any site near the Canobolas were selected, otherwise the territory which is available at the latter place would be insufficient. I submit, therefore, that it would be unfair tp deal with these three sites separately, and to put them individual]}' against others when in reality they have been considered as only one. amendment-that it is desired that they shall not be pitted against each other ? the amendment is that the votes of honourable members representing the western districts of New South Wales may be consolidated. to make. the fairest of fair play to those honourable members just as it will extend fair play to honourable members who favour other sites -that embracing Orange, Lyndhurst, and ber has been talking about gerrymandering; learned member is a good authority on gerrymandering. that all these suggestions come from the representatives of one State whioh has always been protesting its bona fides in this matter? I am simply quoting Hansard to show that it has always been the Ministerial intention that these three sites-Orange, Lyndhurst, and Bathurst -shoul d be treated as one. Inasmuch as some honourable members hold different views as to the relative value of these various sites, we think it is. fair that they should be able to consolidate their votes when we are asked to come to a final determination. That is the main reason for this amendment, and if honourable members are prepared to determine this question upon lines of fair play they will not raise the faintest objection to it . The motion means that these three sites have been reported upon separately, and are to be dealt with Here is what the separately by us, in spite of the intention that they should be regarded as one. The amendment, however, proposes that we shall revert to what was the original intention of the Minister, and so enable the vote for the western sites to be consolidated when the final determination has to be arrived at. unable to consider this question from the point of view taken up by the Prime Minister, and I feel that he has overlooked certain facts in arriving at the conclusion which he put before the House. We are endeavouring to arrive at a position in which we shall be called upon to select one site. It is a question of the selection of one and only one site. It is proposed, however, that more than one site in a certain district shall be submitted to the Conference, notwithstanding that they are in certain respects similar. The amendment moved by the honourable member for North Sydney, instead of seeking to limit the Conference's choice, would give it a greater opportunity to make a satisfactory selection, inasmuch as it would enable it to make a selection first of all of the best site in each district.

The amendment introduces no difficulty, no -complication, and no injustice, but will secure a greater degree of justice and of special consideration. -five separate geographical districts. the wishes of honourable members supporting the sites in the Western District, because* they feel that a greater degree of justice will be done to each site than if the motion is -carried as it stands. If the adoption of tlie amendment would inflict injustice upon any -of the other proposed sites, it is open to honorevening. We hope that the best horse will able gentlemen who are interested in those sites to make that apparent. I feel sure that, if they do so, the honourable member for North Sydney will be perfectly prepared to meet them. The contention of the Prime Minister, that we should not agree to any amendment lest we widen the difference between this House and the other Chamber, might have been a pertinent one early last -evening, but it do«s not apply now, inasmuch as the Senate have rejected the motion as originally presented by the Government. It is as reasonable, if not more reasonable, to suppose that, by agreeing to the amendment, we should get rid of possible difficulties which may have presented themselves to members of the Senate, and led them to vote against the motion. I believe that the amendment provides a fair and reasonable way of arriving at a decision, and will insure the merits of each site being dealt .with with more special consideration than is possible under the proposals of the Government. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) -When the honourable member for North Sydney -suggested this amendment last night, it rather commended itself to my judgment, but, liaving considered it seriously since then, I see an element of danger ia ifc. The position is put in a nutshell by an interjection of an honourable member, who said that the' object of the amendment is to make the best horse in each stable start for the race. The unfortunate feature of the proposal is, to continue the simile, that there may be three high-class bipod horses in one stable and three wretched weeds in another, and it will be necessary to exclude two of the blood horses in order to admit one of the weeds. The three best sites might all be in the one locality. be selected. MrA . M c LEAN In my opinion, the system would provide a way for log-rolling. I think it is necessary that we should deal with each site upon its merits. Of the two methods I prefer tliat proposed by the Government. member for Gippsland has used a sporting simile, and says that he is afraid of a weed beating a blood horse. We are trying to weed out the weeds. Surely, he does not think that this is an alphabetical arrangement, such as he tried to provide for last win, whatever stable it mav come from. Nine sites were reported upon by the Commissioners, and the adoption of the amendment will reduce them to five. Surely that is in the direction of simplification, and in the interests of both this House and the Conference. The Prime Minister contended tliat fche motion should be allowed to remain as it stands, because if it were amended some difliculty with the Senate might be created. I cannot understand that argument, because tlie amendment leads to simplification, and does not create difficulties. The honourable member for North Sydney has made an admirable classification of sites. He makes Armidale to stand by itself as the northern site, Lake George to stand by itself as the central site; while Orange, Lyndhurst, and Bathurst are grouped together as the western sites; Bombala and Dalgety, which are only about thirty-five miles apart, and are therefore for all practical purposes one site, are grouped as the southern site; and Tumut and Albury as the south-western site. Surelyi t is in the interests of simplification to, in the first instance, deal with Dalgety and Bombala as one site. a split in the voting.",56,Edmund Bakton I Am Afraid Ought To Be Done After The Seat Of The Go

303,Mr Thomson,"Otherwis e there may bemay lose some of its support. What the honourable member proposes is that the best site should be chosen from each district. In the long run only one site can be chosen. The honourable and learned member for Corio is very much afraid of combinations, but it is very much better for him to have the sites in which he is interested-Albury and Tumut;-dealt with in the first instance as a group. The adoption of the amendment would not prevent the selection of either Albury or Tumut, but, to continue the sporting simile, it would give those who support them a preliminary canter, and might enable them to decide which was the better horse to enter for the final. The reputation of the honourable member for North Sydney is a sufficient guarantee that the object of the amendment is to secure simplification and fair treatment. do not know that I quite understand the amendment, bnt I do not like what I do understand about it . The wish of the House is to obtain the very best site possible ; it is not a question of districts at all. The proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney is, I understand, not to invite a vote in the first instance upon the sites, but upon certain districts. Erom that this may follow : One district may contain three proposed sites, one of them far and away the best under consideration, and two inferior. If the voting were upon the sites themselves, no doubt the first site in that district would be chosen; but the proposal is to lump the best site with the two inferior sites which may be contiguous to it, and to oppose the district containing them to another district in which there are, perhaps, three second class sites. The result would no doubt be that, instead of the best site being chosen, the district in which the three second class sites were situated would be selected, to the exclusion of the district in which the best site was situated. , That seems to me absurd. The proposal seems to me to provide for a gigantic system of logrolling in the interests of the various sites in a district. In this way a district may be selected which does not contain the best site, and the best site may be rejected. We require one site, and one site only. Are we going to take a fair, straight-out vote upon the question which is the best site available, or are we to first select some particular district ? It is not a question of districts, but of sites. several sites to the Commissioners as onedistrict. a mistake, and it is not too late to discoverand remedy it . I shall be delighted to hear that I have misunderstood the honourable member, but if I have not done so, I shall feel it my duty to record a vote against the amendment. We have to decide which is, in the interests of the Commonwealth, the best site to select; we have nothing to do with the districts in which the sites are situated.' worth) I think that the right honourable member for South AustraUa quite misunderstands the proposal. I am sorry that he used the word ""log-roUing,"" because what-. ever view may be taken as to the wisdom of agreeing to the amendment, the proposal is honorably made. I am surprised that the Government have not fallen in with the proposal. In view of the many claims advanced .on behalf of different parts of New South Wales, it was agreed to allow a wide range for the selection of the capital site, and we now have nine sites submitted to us. Do honourable members mean to say that if these nine sites are placed before them they will not be puzzled to make a selection ? As. some of these sites group themselves together naturally into geographical areas, it is proposed that we should first select one site in each group. ^ If there are three sites within a certain area, the attention of honourable members should be concentrated upon that geographical district in the first instance. If it be agreed that one of the three sites is decidedly tlie best, how can any injustice be done to the other two ? We should absolutely eliminate from our consideration the sites least suitable, and thus minimize the confusion. I do not understand how the choiceof honourable members could be in any way limited, or how the effect of the ballotcould be neutralized by adopting that course. The proposal of the honorable member is to reduce the selection to three, four, or five sites by eliminating those in the geographical groups which are least worthy of consideration. sites in one group, why should one be rejected at the outset 1 only select one in the long run.",57,Edmund Bakton I Am Afraid Ought To Be Done After The Seat Of The Go

Upon further consideration, however, I find mj'self unable to support it . Reverting to the Australian simile which was imported into this matter at an earlier stage in the discussion, it appears to me that, whilst we are all agreed that the first horse must of necessitj' be in one or other of the various stables, the amendment would compel us to assume that the second horse cannot by any possibility be in the same stable.as the first. It is said that the process of elimination must necessarily reduce the number of sites to one. But I would I do not care point out that a great deal will depend upon the particular stage in the votingat which our preference is expressed. It is quite possible that the final preference of this House may lie saj', between Orange and Lyndhurst, or between Bombala and Dalgety.. But the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney preludes anysuch assumption. It assumes that there can only be one eligible site in each group. I hold that as the amendment interferes with the free action of honourable members in voting upon the question of the final selection of the capital, it is objectionable upon that ground. It seems to me that the simple and effective means of deciding the matter is the exhaustive ballot which is proposed by the Government and I shall support it . We should have to MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) -There is no doubt that the reference of the honourable member for Gippslancl to a horse race was fairly illustrative of our present position in regard to this question.

This is merely a provision for an actual majority of the votes cast, and when that point is reached the exhaustive ballot must be regarded as concluded.
