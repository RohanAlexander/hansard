48,Mr West (East Sydney) [ 3 . 2 7 ],"Iwbich provides that any person who has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth shall be incapable of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Bepresentatives. I offer no apology for adopting this course. As a well-known resident of Sydney, my attention was called to what appeared to my informants an infringement of the Constitution. I do not know why those gentlemen approached me in particular, unless it was because last year I took action to have an honourable member's vote upon another measure disallowed: formed of an apparent irregularity, I asked these questions of the Prime Minister1. Is it a fact that the Government, on the 25th September approved of a proposed scheme in connection with the Australian meat trade to advance up to £50,000? 2. What advances have been made in connection with this scheme? 3. Isi t a fact that the honourable member for Macquarie and the honourable, member for Biverina are operating on the account?4. If so, will the Government notify the honourable members for Macquarie and Biverina of the provisions of section 44 of the Constitution with reference to disqualification of members of the House of Bepresentatives? The replies which I received Were very unsatisfactory, and for the sake of the honourable members concerned, ;and to preserve the honour of all members of this Chamber, I have been obliged to submit this motion. The answers were1. Yes. The agreement provides that this That means that the chairman of the amount will be subsequently reimbursed to the Meat Council signs a cheque in the same Commonwealth Government. 2.

I do not know when those honourable meat industry. members were appointed members of the the report of a sale of cattle in Australian Meat Council; they may have Queensland, and found that prices had been appointed prior to their election to increased considerably on the rates this House. On their election they should previously obtaining.

The honourable gentlesidered first principles only. voured to get the fullest information posthe account of the Meat Council are men sible, and therefore consulted the report who themselves are directly connected of the Auditor-General. In his report that officer statedOn the 25th September, 1922, the Cabinet approved of a proposed scheme in connection with the Australian meat trad§, and that, on the Treasurer being satisfied as to assurances for repayment, the Commonwealth Government would guarantee an advance up to £50,000 for the purpose of organizing the scheme. An account was opened at the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, styled the Australian Meat Council Advances Account, into which account the advances made by the Commonwealth were paid and held by the Bank as a guarantee against an overdraft account, which was separately opened under the name of the Australian Meat Council Having been in Account and which was operated on by the Council. I may be wrong, but I consider that the Auditor-General put the f u l l agreement in his report with the special object of drawing attention to it . It is not right that certain honourable gentlemen who are members of this House should have the right to operate on a Government account. The account cannot be operated on without their signgjtures. Such a power should not have been placed in the hands of members of this House. The Attorney-General w ill not deny that the agreement was drawnup by the Crown Law ofiicers, yet that agreement contains the following provisions: 5. That the said credit will be used only for the purpose of taking immediate action to place the ensuing season's output of meat to the best advantage. 6. That the said credit will be operated upon only by Mr J. B. Cramsie, in conjunction with either Mr A. G. Manning or Mr W. W.

It is for those reasons that I intend to do all that I can to remove any possible opportunity for belittling our Parliament-the pride of our race.

50,Sir Littleton Groom,"The Elecupon this matter j I am merely showing why Parliament adopted the procedure I have outlined, and asking the House to consider the proper course to be followed when in a proper case a question arises concerning the qualification of honourable members to sit in this Chamber. course taken by the honourable member for East Sydney, in asking the House to come ta a decision upon' the matter by agreeing to his motion, is unprecedented in this Parliament. clear. who has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth is in capable of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. Section 45 goes a step further, and declares that, if a member becomes subject, to any disability mentioned in the preceding section, his seat becomes vacant. The legal position is, if a member is found, upon a proper determination of the question, to have committed a breach of section 44, his seat becomes vacant. shall now refer to the second aspect of the issue raised by the honourable member. If we entertain his motion, we are asked to for m certain facts as submitted in the first place in the motion itself, and in the second place in the speech w i th which he has supported his motion. A fact set out in the motion itself is that the honourable members for Riverina and Macquarie have signed cheques for the payment of money from a Government advance. The honourable member regards this as a contravention of section 44, the disqualification provision of the Constitution, which provides thatAny person who has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Publio Service of the Commonwealth . . . shall be incapable of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. The motion itself does not allege that there "" was any agreement with the Public Service' of the Commonwealth."" Sir LITTLETON The motion simply refers to the signing of cheques. honourable member said that a Meat Council had been constituted, that the honourable members for Riverina and Macquarie were members of that Council, bhat an advance had been made by the Government to that Council, and that a certain agreement had been made and signed by five persons. The honourable member contended that because cf that advance, and because an agreement had been signed by five persons, the honourable The members for Riverina and"" Macquarie were involved in an agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth, in which they were directly or indirectly pecuniarily interested. I think that is The Constitution is how the honourable member put his caso Under section 44, any person to the House. Section 44 of the Constitution provides that three points must be established-Pirst, that the honorable members in question were pecuniarily in terested directly or indirectly; secondly, that there was an agreement; and thirdly, that that agreement was made, with the Public Service of the Commonwealth. Now, the two honourable, members in question were not parties to the agreement which the honourable member has put in evidence. The Auditor General, in his report for 1923, states that this agreement was made and signed I by five persons, the signatories being George Fairbairn, R. H . Edkins, JohnB . Cramsie, W . Angliss, and J . W . Durack. Clearly the honourable members an opinion upon for Riverina and Macquarie were not parties to the agreement on which the honourable member for East Sydney based the whole of his case. Mention is made in the agreement of a credit to' be operated on by Mr JohnB . Cramsiei n conjunction with MrA . G. Manning and MrW . W . Killen, but that is merely to provide machinery for operating the account. The honourable members in question were not specifically made parties to the agreement, the purpose of which was to establish at the Commonwealth Bank of Australasia a credit to be used by the Australian Meat Council. The parties to the agreement agreed that prompt action should be taken to give effect to the scheme proposed for organizing the meat industry and advising the Commonwealth Government in a manner to which I will advert presently. The Australian Meat Council was to take the Parliament legislation authorizing levies In his speech the on stock for the purpose of the scheme.

If honourable members w ill analyse the facts in this case they will find that the two honourable members who have been referred to had no contract with the Public Service, and no direct or in direct pecuniary gain accrued to any member of the Meat Council.

The council exists, not to benefit any individual, but to give advice and promote measures which w ill tend to the general advancement of the meat industry throughout Australia. succeeds, not only the owners of the cattle, but also the thousands of workmen engaged in the industry, will benefit.

I understand that a question was answered in this House. The agreement provides the method of operating the credit, but the mere signing of a cheque does not constitute the person signing a party to the agreement. not necessarily a pecuniary interest in doing so. stituted not for individual, but for general, purposes. add that the honourable members who have served on this council have done so in an honorary capacity; no fees are payable to them. They have given their services in a loyal desire to help the industry. I have shown that there is no possibility of their deriving any pecuniary gain, for there are no individual contracts by which they can benefit, and I say further that these honourable members have' not even had their expenses paid. form the House what the effect was of both members signing the agreement before they became members of this House? Sir have not signed it . drawn up before they were members of the House. were parties to an agreement before they entered the House, and if the agreement continued after they had become members of this House, they would still be liable. There is a continuing liability. A member cannot escape. the consequences of his action in that way. That would be an evil that the section in the Constitution aims at preventing. held in England that if an honourable member is a business man, and some one in the Customs Department, without his knowledge, buys goods from h i m for cash, that does not constitute a contract such as is referred to in the section. But if a man was a party to a continuing agreement with the Public Service, from wbich agreement he derived a pecuniary interest, he could not be elected to, let alone sit in , this House. It is to the credit of the honourable member for East the Minister Sydney that he has treated this matter impersonally. He has tried to keep malice out of it , and to that extent has achieved his purpose. He has stated his case temperately. the money when there is no agreement? not said that there is no agreement. I have said that there is not in this case an agreement which these honourable If a man signs a cheque he has members have signed. They are . not parties to the agreement in the sense that The Meat Trust was conthey are signatories to it . They are members of the Meat Council, and I have I would like to shown exactly what their functions are on that Council, and that they are not parties to an agreement such as that at which the section of the Constitution aims. The House, in the circumstances, should not have the slightest hesitation in rejecting the motion. I do not agree with the suggestion that the honourable members who sit on the M'eat Council sought a pecuniary gain, but the facts show to what a pass the GoW ill the Ministeri n vernment has come, for it has allowed money to be taken out of the Treasury to organize a union to raise the price of meat and protect the meat growers. A B ill will be introduced later, provided the give the meat growers power to strike a levy upon themselves according to the numbers of cattle they possess. We shall then be paid back the money the Government has advanced. If the representatives of a working man's trade union came to this House and said, "" We want a federation of labour, and we ask the Government to advance monthly the cash to carry on the propaganda,"" they would be laughed to scorn. I was anxious.to hear the names of the men who are members of the Meat Council. They are not poor men.

71,Mr Killen,"The y represent the poorabout this matter from the Treasurer, but I have always received evasive replies. A gentleman is employed to do organizing work for the Council, and he draws the large salary of, I believe, over £1,00 0 a year. W h y should public money be lent, without security, to such an organization, to be returned only if the Governments of the States pass the necessary Bills? We have no security except the names' of the men who have attached their signatures to the agreement. It is nonsense to say that they have no pecuniary interest. If they organize the business properly and effectively control the meat market every man pecuniary benefit. I do not accuse those honourable members who signed the cheques of doing anything against the interests of the country. Their object is to place the meatindustry on a proper footing; but I protest against the Government advancing money out of the Treasurer's Advance Account, free of interest, and without any security except the honour of the men who signed the agreement. It is not fair to ask the taxpayers of the country to pay for propaganda work for this organization. The propaganda, work ia all right from the stand-point of the organization, but why should the country be asked to pay for it ? Among these men are Henry Jones, of Tasmania, and Edmund Jowett. of them are millionaires, and yet they ask the Government to advance money to enable them to build up their industry. I take this opportunity of lodging my protest against the Government's action. 1 am not entering into, the question of whether the honourable members whose action has been questioned acted legally or not. I leave that to their sense of honour. have listened attentively to the debate, and have been unable to gather that anything has been done by either of the honourable gentlemen referred to in the motion which has given them a disqualifying interest in the contract between the Commonwealth and the Meat Council. tion 44 of the Constitution, any person who has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service is disqualified from sitting in this House. read to the House provides for the administration of a scheme established by the Commonwealth. I have not read the agreement; I have heard onl y portions of it read by the Attorney-General, and I do not say that I have heard enough to enable me to pronounce definitely whether or not the pecuniary interests of the honourable members for Macquarie and Riverina were directly or indirectly affected thereby. It appears to me that they were not, but this is a legal question which can be satisfactorily determined only by a legal tribunal. Pecuniary interest , in contracts arises in various ways. There is a law, of long standing, which disqualifies for membership of a municipal council a person who is directly interested in a coni n the organization will derive tract w it h that council, and several decisions have been given interpreting -the significance of that provision. One of the leading decisions _was that given in a case decided about the middle of last century,' in which the Court determined that the having of a pecuniary interest in a contract means the having of a pecuniary interest in the business or bargain, or at least Some interest therein whereby the person's legal rights, or liabilities are affected. It does not appear that this House; is-a suitable tribunal to determine whether the legal rights or liabilities of the honourable members for Macquarie and Riverina are affected by their connection w it h this agreement. As SomeI understand' their positions, they have merely been portions of an administrative machine; they have, not been parties to the agreement, and, therefore, they plainly did not acquire any direct interest in the-agreement. A t the same time, a person may be indirectly interested in an agreement to which he is not himself a party. For instance, AB might make an agreement w it h the Commonwealth and assign the benefit of that agreement I to CD, giving CD an interest in the agreement, although he was not a party to it . However, it does not appear from the facts which have been related that the honourable members mentioned did, by reason of the agreement acquire any pecuniary interest therein, directly or in directly. As potential meat exporters It ' is quite true that under secthey were, perhaps, interested, as any other citizen of the Commonwealth was interested, in the general scheme for the payment of a bounty upon the export of meat, but that interest arose under the The agreement which has been Statute, and not by virtue of the agreement. orable members were meat exporters? -",28,Littleton Groom The Y State Governments Pass Similar Bills To
72,Mr Lath Am (Kooyong) [ 4 . 3 0 ],,29,Littleton Groom The Y State Governments Pass Similar Bills To
73,Mr Fenton,"Suppos e that those honexporters of meat, and participated in the bounty, they would receive the money by virtue of the Statute, and not by virtue of the agreement. nothing has been done which even approaches a breach of section 44 of the Constitution, but, in any event, I , although only a comparatively new member of the House, venture to suggest that the Attorney-General is perfectly sound in urging that legal questions such as this cannot properly be determined by a vote upon the floor of this House. body seriously thinks that disqualification has been incurred by any honourable member, the proper course to follow is to move a reference in terms of section 203 of the Electoral A ct 1922. If that be done, the matter will be determined by the Court of Disputed Returns; a legal question will be decided by legally-qualified men, and free from the influence of party feeling. Doubtless the honourable member for East Sydney, who submitted the motion, has closely examined the facts of this case, but except him and the Attorney-General, no honourable member has made a sufficient study of the matter to be qualified to cast a vote upon the motion. not able to support a positive motion of this character; and if a proposal were made to refer the matter to the Court of Disputed ReturnsI should require to study it very carefully and to have the facts placed before the House more f u l l y than they have been to-day. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) has raised a very interesting question, which may well be described as a mixed question of law and politics, and as such it is a very fit and proper one to be discussed by this Legislature. I cannot join with those who appear, in matters of this kind, to regard the HighCourtwhich is the creature of this Parliamentas a tribunal superior to and controlling this Parliament. members also of the fundamental fact that Parliament is the guardian of its own honour, and in a very summary way has more than once exercised its right to expel members-sometimes , as many of us think, very arbitrarily, harshly, and wronglybut we have never denied the right of Parliament to determine in this way its own personnel, subject always to appeal to the electorate. raised by the motion, I do not pretend If they were actual that there are at present sufficient facts before the House to enable us to declare definitely that the honourable members mentioned have disqualified themselves to It appears to me that hold seats in this Chamber. I have already said that the question is a mixed one of law and politics, and the fact that emerges from the discussion is not so much that these gentlemen have acquired a pecuniary interest by reason of an agreement in which they are assumed to be in directly interested, or an agreement with the Public Service-that , I think, is not If anyperfectly clear-bu t that this Parliament itself by statutory means has enabled those honourable members to obtain certain pecuniary benefits which are not open to the general mass of the community. In that sense this is purely a question of politics, and if the honourable member for East Sydney has done no greater good he has done very useful service in calling attention to the partisan character of the legislation under which this Meat Council has been created, and some of the most safely-placed members of the community have benefited so greatly. The Attorney General( Sir Littleton Groom) looked at the question from the academic rather I am than the practical view-point, and followed the mover's arguments in detail to show that, technically, he had not sustained his case. Although the honourable member for East Sydney asserts the absolute right of -this Parliament-superio r to that of any legal tribunal-to discuss questions of this kind, he does not deny that the High Court has its proper functions, and that ultimately questions of law considered in relation to appropriate facts might be submitted to that tribunal. For the present he quite properly raises this question as a political issue, which, if this House thinks proper, might later come before the High Court for consideration. That stage has not yet been reached. The honourable member has seen in this matter an important question affecting the honour I remind honourable and privileges of honourable members, and he has thought fit to place upon the notice-paper, as he undoubtedly has the right to do, a motion for discussion. A l though I do not feel free to record a vote which would have the effect of declaring fchat the two honourable members mentioned were disqualified from occupying their seats in this House, I think the honourable member for East Sydney is In regard to the issue to be congratulated upon the care he has taken in adducing evidence that shows, as",29,Littleton Groom The Y State Governments Pass Similar Bills To

84,Mr Bruce (Plinders,"Prime Minisand which led to the formation of the Commonwealth O i l Eefineries. The original agreement was sanctioned by this House on the 29th May, 1920. A t that time the whole position was dealt with at great length in this House, and I do not, therefore, propose to repeat all the reasons which were then advanced for the Commonwealth having an oil refinery within its own borders. Nor do I propose to. refer to the necessity for obtaining supplies of oil and having it refined in Australia, in view of the increase in the use of oil in commerce, industry, defence, and other departments of social activity. Honourable members are aware that during the past ten or fifteen years there have been tremendous developments in connection with the use of internal combustion engines, and in the use of oi l as fuel for steamers. Mineral oil, both unrefined and refined, has become an absolute necessity to any country which is t<J' develop w i th any degree of rapidity. All these matters were discussed when the original agreement was presented to Parliament, and any honourable member who -desires to inform himself about them might well refer to the debates that then occurred. He would thus ascertain also all the circumstances' surrounding the original agreement. the oil supplies of the world was made at that time, but 1 think it will be interesting to honourable members to learn the world's crude oil production of the last 30 years. The figures are:-1910 , 328,000,000 barrels (seven barrels go to the to n ) ; 1914, 400,000,000 barrels; 1919, 545,000,000 barrels; 1920, 695,000,000 barrels; and 1923, 759,000,000 barrels. Those figures show that there is a constantly increasing market for oil and its products. ports of petrol into Australia in the last few years have also increased greatly. In 16,723,000 gallons. The figures for succeeding years were as follow :-1918-19 , 20,749,000 gallons; 1919-20, 24,891,000 gallons; 1920-21, 35,944,000 gallons; 1921-22, 31,963,000 gallons; 1922-23, 41,338,000 gallons; 1923-calenda r year49,754,000 gallons. In the first four months of 1924 the importations of petrol have totalled 6,000,000 gallons per month. If that rate is maintained for the remainder of the calendar year, our imports w ill total 72,000,000 gallons. O i l must now be considered a vital necessity, and if we are to advance our commercial, industrial, and agricultural interests we must make it possible for our people to avail themselves of it to the fullest possible extent, at a price reasonably cheap. It was stated when this matter was previously before Parliament that the oil supplies of the world were dominated by certain great interests. Most honourable members are familiar with the operations of the Standard Oil Company and the Royal Dutch Shell Group. On many occasions it has been said that the StandardO i l Company controls all the oil interests in the new world and that the Royal Dutch Shell Group controls all the oil interests in the old world. That subject also was dealt with in the debate to which I have already referred. Informatio n was given on the same occasion of the way in which the prices for this essential commodity had advanced, and it was stated that the increases could not be justified. On this aspect of the matter I shall content my-self by quoting from a speech delivered by the First Lord of the Admiralty in the British House of Commons. He saidA statement of We have experienced, together with private customers, a long, steady squeeze by oil trusts all over the world, and we have found -prices and freights raised steadily against us, until we have been forced to pay more than double what a few years ago we were accustomed to pay. In consequence of that position the British Government felt that it must acquire a controlling interest in some oil fields to secure its supplies, particularly for naval purposes, and to protect itself from the domination of the great oil in Imterests. In . 1914 it succeeded in acquiring such an interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the main oil fields of which are 1915-16 our imports totalled situated in the Persian Gulf. I shall give honourable members a few facts about that company, because it is the company with which the Commonwealth Government entered into the original agreement, and w it h which it is now proposed to make another agreement. From time to time it has been more than suggested that the Anglo-PersianO i l Company is a great Trust operating for the benefit of certain individuals. I shall place the facts before the House. The capital of the company is £20,000,000, of which £19,450,000 has been issued in the following way:-Eight per cent, cumulative first preference, £7,000,000; 9 per cent, cumulative second preference, £3,500,000; and ordinary shares, £8,950,000; total, £19,450,000. The company has also outstanding £4,500,000 of 5 per. cent, first debenture stock. The British Government, in June, 1914, acquired 2,000,000 ordinary shares and 1,000 preference shares, and in 1919 a further 3,000,000 ordinary shares, and other shares since, and although those shares do not give it anything like half the total capital interest in the company, they give it voting rights greater than the remaining voting rights of the company. the British Government was disposing of those shares. Is that so? Government voting power in the Anglo-Persian Company. way: debt owed by the company, naturally, carry no voting power; ence shares only carry one vote per share, and the ordinary shares carry two votes per share. reason of its holding of ordinary and preference than all the other shareholders. perfectly clear, therefore, that the British Government has the predominant power in the company. shares not held by the British ment are held by the Burma Oil Company, with the exception which are held by the executors of the late Lord Strathcona and Mr Knox D'Arcy, who was an Australian, and was concerned in the development Morgan.

There are seven directors on the board of the company, three of whom represent the Commonwealth Government's interests and f o u r the Anglo-Persian Company's interests. The basis of representation on the board of directors was carefully considered when the original agreement was submitted to Parliament, and it was definitely determined then that it was essential that the business control of the company should be in the hands of men who were thoroughly experienced in the oil business. Provision was made in the agreement and articles of association, however, that the three It was recently stated that Commonwealth Government representatives should have a power of veto in regard to certain matters set out in the The British agreement.

They knew that the motion of the honourable member for Bass would not be discussed, and that no other opportunity would be given to honourable members to vote on the subject. I ask the honourable member for Bass how he proposes to vote on the Prime Minister's motion ? There is an important notice of motion on the business-paper relating to the granting of titles, and upon that, too, if the motion of the Prime Minister be carried, honourable members will not be able to express an opinion. Honourable members need have no qualms of suspicion about my wishes in this matter. The title I now have w ill satisfy me for the rest of my life. It is remarkable that almost immediately an honourable member had given notice of a motion opposed to the granting of titles in Australia, the PrimeM in ister took action to abolish private members' mouths w ill be closed on the subject of titles; they will not be able to express their disapproval of the present practice. The Prime Minister's motion should be postponed until the notice of motions of the honourable member for Bass, dealing with the granting of financial assistance to Tasmania, and of the honourable memwith the granting of titles to people in Australia, have been dealt with. would not be parliamentary for me to say that the action of the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) is rank hypocrisy, and I confess that parliamentary language fails me when It r y to express my feelings about his attitude.

I am dying for an opportunity to record a vote upon that motion, but he will vote to deprive me of the right and privilege of voting against him. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) has a motion on the business-paper dealing with the important question of finance. He has now been taken into the fold, but how long it will remain a close corporation the Lord and Dr. Earle Page alone know, and I do not expect that even D r . Earle Page w ill tell us anything about ib. The speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs on that motion was one of the finest we have listened to for many a day. W ill he now vote to apply the closure to his"" own motion ? Surely not! I leave the argument at that, in the knowledge that honourable members, especially those from Tasmania, and particularly the Assistant Minister( Mr Atkinson), will have something to answer for to the people of that State. I ask them to remember thab Tasmania is in dire financial straits, and I urge them to hesitate before recording a vote which will prevent this Housef r o m giving it financial assistance. honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) has been very entertaining, and would have given honourable membersa gre'at deal of pleasure if he had not made such a decided attack upon the honourable day. Honourable members' member for Bass( Mr Jackson). I hope that he will repeat his statements later, when there is an opportunity to assist Tasmania. The honourable member for Bass, probably with a f u l l knowledge of what was on the notice-paper, gave a notice of motion for the next grievanceday. His notice of motion w ill appear on the notice-paper for that day's proceedings, and it is possible, though notcertain, that some notices of motion Iti n advance of it will prevent its-' being reached; unless the honorable member has been speaking for a majority of the members of the Opposition, and we may hope that, if there are notices of motion prior to that of the honourable member for Bass, they will be the business-paper his evergreen postponed so that his may be discussed. It does not come within the knowledge of the Parliamentary allowthe honourable member for Dalley that Notwiththere is a prior notice of motion, and he thinks that in ordinary circumstances the first question for consideration w ill not be the motion of tbe honourable member for Bass. He was most unfair and unjust to that honourable member.

Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [6.0] -This motion, having been submitted by the Prime Minister, will no doubt be carried, but I register my protest against it . During last session, when the right honourable gentleman submitted a similar motion, I and several other private members who had business on the notice-paper asked him to afford an opportunity for a vote to be recorded on those questions which, in the opinion of the honourable members in charge of them, had been already sufficiently discussed to enable the House to express its judgment on them. The Prime Minister promised that, if time allowed, he-would provide such an opportunity, and I was very disappointed when that was not done.. I believe that one motion standing in my own name, for the appointment of a committee to report upon the advisability of the Commonwealth instituting a steamer service between Melbourne and Hobart, would have been carried. I suppose that the right honourable gentleman was so busy in preparing for his trip abroad that he forgot his promise, but even in the hurry and rush at the end of the session time could have been found for votes to be taken upon several motions sponsored by private members. Now a similar position has arisen, and, if the Prime Minister's motion is carried, private members will be deprived of an opportunity of ascertaining the sense of the House upon the business which they have placed upon the notice-paper. I do not think it is necessary at this early stage of the session to take away the only chance that private members have to bring forward matters of particular interest to their constituents. It is not only the business promulgated by the Government that the country regards as important; the constituencies think that there are other He natuliament which are equally as urgent as Government business. The Prime Minister said that the alternative to this motion is to sit on Tuesdays, but the right honourable gentleman rightly construes the opinion of the majority of members to be averse to an extra sitting day at this stage of the session. Unlike South Australian members, Tasmanian members, in common with the representatives of Western Australia and Queensland, are unable to return to their respective States each week-end; and, if I were to study my own convenience, I should prefer the House to sit on Tuesday rather than that the opportunity for dealing with private members' business should be taken away. The lionorable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) has mentioned a matter which is of vital importance to the State of Tasmania. I do not know what was in the mind of the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) when he gave notice of a motion for the next grievance day, which is two or three weeks distant. I do not impute motives; the honourable member assists to represent Tasmania in this House. ' him was private members' day, and now that is being closed.

Apparently, there is truth in the saying: "" Great minds think alike."" I was very pleased to hear fche honourable member read his notice, and I would willingly support it if an opportunity to deal with it were presented.

I was a member of the deputation which waited upon him some months ago -Order! The 'honourable member's remarks are outside the motion.

Mr O'KEEFE I am of opinion that the Prime Minister's motion will_ prevent the consideration of the motion of which notice has been given by fche honourable inember for Bass. take precedence, "" unless otherwise ordered."" In view of the Mr O'KEEFE I know perfectly well that the Leader of the Government will otherwise order. Last year the Prime Minister practically promised that if there was opportunity, and if time allowed, he would permit a vote to be taken. But he did not make the opportunity, and time did not allow. Probably the right honourable gentleman will follow the same course this session. I feel it to be my duty to assist in securing the earliest possible discussion of questions of importance fco the StateI I understand that the Prime represent. I do not know whether we shall get any intimation of the intention of the Government, but the reports of the interviews between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, on the one hand, and the Premier and the Attorney-General of Tasmania, on the other hand, indicate that it is not the intention of the Government toi make any statement' at all, either to the Government of Tasmania or to this House, regarding the request for financial assistance to Tasmania until the Estimates are submitted. We orable member is again wide of the motion. Mr O'KEEFE I was trying to connect my statement with the question before the Chair by giving my reasons why I must vote against this proposal. At this stage of the session, I think it is absolutely unnecessary to take away from private members the only opportunity they will have to get motions of great importance to the States they represent discussed by the House. Most honourable members recognize that when a Government is anxious to get The honormore time to discuss its proposals, that time is taken, from an almost defenceless body of men-the private members. It is very rarely that a private member gets a motion passed. During a period of about seven years, I know of two motions only in the names of private members which have been passed. One had reference to Home Rule for Poland, and the other dealt with the referendum, initiative and recall. I would rather see the Prime Minister follow the course he adopted prior to his visit to the Homeland last year, and bludgeon measures through, than allow these important questions to be shelved.

Clause verbally amended. [8.5] -There are questions involved in this clause on which I desire some information from the Minister. Paragraph d of sub-clause 1 readsThe part or parts which may be resumed shall not comprise the head station, or any of the leased lands within five miles thereof, or the principal watering place upon the land. Many of these holdings have river frontages, which are certainly the "" principal watering places,"" and it w ill be impossible to resume them if the clause is agreed to in its present form. Another aspect of the matter is that numerous (CROWN holdings in the Northern Territory consist of a number of small leases, and holders of these leases will be able to retain the head station and principal watering place in each lease if we agree to the clause as it is drafted. I submitted that view to the Housei n making my second-reading speech, but, though the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) disagreed with my interpretation, he did not convince me that I was wrong. I cannot see anything in the B ill to prevent a man who has a holding made up of. a number of small leases from retaining' the permanent watering place in each lease. If dry land may be resumed under"" the provisions of the B ill . That w i ll be a serious matter from the point of view of settlers in the Northern Territory. Permanent water is essential on every holding. I am afraid that the practice of amalgamating leases, which is at present adopted by many land-holders, will defeat the objects honourable members have in view. On many runs there are eight or ten, and even more, permanent watering places, and they may be on land which is held under a number of separate leases. one head station. with this matter. Leaseholders may contend that there is a head station on one lease and a principal watering place on every other lease so held. A careful reading of the sub-clause w ill show that a head station has application to land only, and not to water. My argument is supported by clause 57, which readsWhere two or more leases held by different lessees are worked as one run the Minister may, upon application made by the leasees within six months after the date on which notice of the resumption has been received by the lessee or within such extended time as the Minister",42,Order Of Business

134,Mr Nelson,"Honorabl e membersallows, ancl on the reconimendataion of the Board, make a consolidated resumption from the lands included in leases so worked instead of separate resumptions from the land included in each lease. Under the provisions of that clause it will be optional for the lessee to surrender the whole of his leases or particular leases. I ask the Minister to give us an explanation of the intentions of the Government. We should be very careful in dealing w i th all these clauses, because permanent water is essential to the successful settlement of the Northern Territory holdings. also lent to my view of the position by sub-clause 1 of clause 62, which readsWhere two or more leases granted under this Division are held by one person and worked as one run, the lessee may surrender the leases for a single lease, including all the lands included in the surrendered leases. It w ill be optional under that clause also for a lessee to surrender the whole of his leases and receive one lease in exchange or to surrender particular leases and obtain other leases for the same areas. If that practice is followed it w ill mean that practically none of the valuable river frontage areas in the western district of the Territory w ill be resumed. Lessees w ill also be enabled to retain lagoons, lakes, and billabongs. The clauses I have cited w ill certainly prevent a large area of valuable land from being made available to new settlers. be advisable, in my stipulate that a certain area shall be included in each under this measure, and that the intending lessee may indicate which watering place shall be included.

However, the clauses dealing with the consolidation of leases are not applicable to my claim that the lessee should be obliged to nominate his principal watering place. Otherwise I can see no hope for future settlement in the Northern Territory without the expenditure of huge sums of money in conserving water or sinking bores. ber contend that miles of river frontage may be regarded as the principal watering place ? sible under paragraph d.

I take it that the lessee will retain the head station with, its waterhole, an area with a radius of 5 miles from the head station, and the water-hole at Longreach. I think the Committee should agree to this. vided in paragraph d that no land w it h in 5 miles of the head station shall be resumed for closer settlement purposes. I do not know much about the Northern Territory, but I think I am safe in saying that every head station w i ll have a decent watering-place within 5 miles. As I am not satisfied with the interpretation put upon paragraph d by the Minister, and as I wish to avoid the possibility of the whole of a river f r o n t being claimed as the principal watering place of a station, I move That the words "" or the principal wateringplace upon the land,"" sub-clause (1), paragraph (d), be omitted. I am sure that within 5 miles of every head station there will be at least one good watering-place. afc first inclined to agree that the paragraph was very reasonable, because no one would suggest that in resuming land from a station the lessee should be deprived of his principal watering-place; b u t there is no doubt the honourable memson) has pointed out a serious difficulty in that it would be quite possible for a lessee to retain quite a number of watering-places within 5 miles of his head station, and, as the honourable member for Bass( Mr Jackson) has pointed out, also a .very large watering-place, perhaps 40 miles away from the head station. There is nothing wrong in accepting the amendment, because it will not compel the Government to resume the principal watering-place on a station, but it will mean that the Lands Boar.d will be given the power to allow the station-owner to retain whatever watering-places can fairly Le allotted to him. The retention of the words which the honourable member for Angas seeks to have omitted would tie the hands of future Administrations. There is no reason why we should do so.

The land referred to is the land held under any lease to be retained, by the lessee. If honourable members will look at clause 57 they will see that it is entirely optional with lessees coming under this Ordinance to apply for a consolidated lease. They can go on as they have done in the past, and apply for the renewal of a number of smaller leases. If they adopt the latter course, each of the leases must be treated separately, and then,_ under the clause we are now considering, paragraph d will operate in respect of each of the separate leases. If honourable members can show that that interpretation is not correct I shall be satisfied, but the Minister's bald assertion to the contrary is not sufficient for the Committee.

I consider that the Bill, as drafted, achieves that object. that they now hold. Our experience with However, I am quite prepared to recommit clause 50, with a view to moving an amendment along the lines suggested by the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart). I also believe that we are at one in our desire that a lessee should have one permanent watering place, and that he should be able to retain all the land within 5 miles of his head station, and have access to the principal watering place, but I think that the objection to the language of the Bill taken by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr resume ah area not exceeding a quarter Nelson) is a good one.

I had some experience of a Tf the clause happening of that kind in Western Australia. I suppose that the finest pastoral land in that State is along the Gascoyne River, 200 miles of the frontage to which is held by one company. The back country there is somewhat arid, and because there is no right of access to the river it has not been developed. That is a serious position. Both the Minister in charge of the Bill and the Minister for Works and Railways are sincere in their belief about the meaning of the verbiage of the Bill, but we are in grave danger of locking up land if we make it possible for lessees to retain a principal watering place on each lease pastoralists is that they will risk their whole fortune to contest at law a point such as we are now discussing, and, as some honourable members have said, whatever may be reported in Hansard will be of little avail in a court of law.

It provides, further, that the average qualities and capabilities of the resumed part shall, as f a r as possible, be the average qualities and capabilities of the whole of the land. Paragraph d of the clause appears to be causing all the trouble. It provides, first, that the land resumed shall not comprise the head station. I do nofc profess to be an expert in pastoral affairs, but I have had some experience in construing Acts of Parliament, and in the light of that experience I say that unless some expression is inserted to define the boundaries of the head station the Administration may be caused serious trouble. It may consider that the head station Includes the station buildings and 100 acres surrounding it . The lessee may contend that it includes fche station and 10,000 acres surrounding it .

The head station must have some area of land surroundingi t , That and so must the principal watering place, otherwise neither would, be of any use to the lessee. Therefore, it seems to be wise to settle these matters in the B ill . We could fix the boundaries which should enclose a head station, and we could compel a lessee to state within a certain period after his taking up residence on the lease what he considered to be his principal watering place. As matters stand at present it appears to be possible for the Crown to resume a. quarter of a man's lease and leave him his head station and a principal watering place a considerable distance from his land, and in such a position that it would be of no value to him. If we inserted in the B ill a definition of ""head station "" and "" principal watering place,"" the difficulties with which honourable members are wrestling would disappear. It does not appear to me to be possible to deal in this measure with all the circumstances which w ill arise in the surrender of leases. Some matters w ill have to be lef t for administrative action.

292,Mr Nelson (Northern Territory),"out of a number of leases while, under clause 50, as proposed to be amended, the resumed leases would be consolidated under one lease. land held by different lessees. the Northern Territory, leases covering 300 or 400 square miles, held under different names, are often worked as one run by one firm. It could be successfully argued that they were different leases; but, with the amendment suggested by the Minister, if they were worked as one r u n they could be brought under a consolidated lease. I contend that it is essential that an alteration should be made in clause 57 to meet the alteration which w ill be made in clauso 50. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 58(1.) The Minister shall, on the request of a lessee, made at least two years before any date of resumption, in lieu of resuming any lands held under a lease, permit the lessees to subdivide, for closer pastoral settlement purposes(a) an area included in the lease approved by the Board as heing equivalent to tliat which the Minister .would be entitled to resume; and (o) any further area. (2.) The lessee may transfer the subdivisions to personB approved by the Minister for the remainder of the term, and subject to the terms and conditions (other than resumption) of the original leaso. (3.) The Minister shall issue leases in respect of the subdivisions transferred and thereupon the area included in the original lease shall be reduced accordingly and the lessee shall no longer be liable to the Minister for the ayment of rentals in respect of the subivisions transferred. toThat after the word ""lessee"" the following words be inserted :-""of a lease granted under this Division in exchange for a lease existing at the commencement of thiB Ordinance."" [10.30] I wish to m o v e That sub-clauses 1 and 2 be omitted, and that in sub-clause 3 aU the words after the word ""shall"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" in regard to expiring leases, make the land available in living areas, subject to a ballot of applicants."" The clause at present vests in the lessee the right to nominate his successor. Progress reported. That the House do now adjourn. During my absence this afternoon the matteiof the seaworthiness of the Port Lyttleton was brought to the notice of the House. I have since received a wire, signed by the secretaries of three unions i u the.Newcastle district, asking that an in quiry be instituted into.the facts of the case. They point out that this is a very important matter, inasmuch as, if a boat is allowed to go to sea in an unseaworthy condition, life is endangered. There appears bo be no doubt that the Port Lyttleton was unseaworthy, because, during her journey, she had to jettison a quantity of wheat on account of the volume of water she was making. It is unreasonable for departmental officers to permit a vessel to go to sea in an unseaworthy. condition, and thus endanger men's lives. We cannot treat such a matter lightly. I urge the Government to take action. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [10.36],-This matter was this afternoon the subject of a f u l l statement by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten). That statement traversed the whole of the circumstances, and showed that every reasonable precaution had been taken, and that no lives were endangered in taking the Port Lyttleton from Beauty' Point to Sydney to have certain necessary repairs effected. The facts regarding the wheat, as I understand them, are"" that certain pumps which were installed as an additional measure of safety became ologged to some extent by the wbeat that was in the hold, and as an act of good seamanship the vessel was taken to an adjacent port, where the wheat was discharged in order to prevent the recurrence of this clogging. The wheat was certainly not jettisoned to safeguard the lives of the people on the ship. I shall discuss the matter further with the M in ister for Trade and Customs, and let the honourable' gentleman know what view the Government takes of it . Question resolved in the affirmative.
