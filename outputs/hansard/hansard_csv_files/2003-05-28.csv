Wednesday, 28 May 2003 ----Burke Electorate: Smartwood known for the economic and social devastation brought by the closure of a large CSR site six years ago. I am happy to now bring some good news to this House about that area. In recent weeks I have had the good fortune of being involved in the phoenix like resurrection of a timber moulding and framing business called Smartwood, which employed 26 people in Bacchus Marsh. I was contacted on 29 April and told that the company had been handed over to administrators and that the Australian Taxation Office, its major creditor, was seeking before the County Court to have the company closed and its assets stripped and sold. After speaking with the former owners, Allan and Maurita Turner, and the administrator I was convinced that the decision to trash the company was premature. I wrote to the Australian tax office-and a copy of that letter was tendered to the court-seeking an adjournment until the creditors meeting that was to be held on 15 May. I argued that there was an opportunity for the company to be rescued and, as a consequence, for much-needed jobs to be saved in Bacchus Marsh. I am happy to say that the court adjourned the ATO’s bid to have the company closed immediately and to liquidate its assets. That was done on the strength of submissions made to the court by customers who have dealt with Smartwood. Submissions were even made by former employees about the worth and value that their lives had acquired as a result of their employment with that company. I am happy to say that, in some modest way, the court’s decision was also influenced by the letter I wrote which was tendered to the court and which referred to an alternative way in which to deal with the company, pursuant to the provisions of the Corporations Act. I am happy to announce that, as a result of that adjournment at the eleventh hour, Hugh Turner, the father of Allan, has stepped in and paid the company’s debts and he will take over the company forthwith. I am pleased to announce that more than half of the original employees will retain their jobs, with a reasonable expectation that numbers will rise as the plant recovers to full production. I acknowledge in particular the wisdom of the court, the professionalism of the administrators in dealing with this matter, the endeavours of Allan and Maurita and, most particularly, the never-say-die efforts of the work force of Smartwood whose deeds in the end saved the company. I will be on hand to assist the company in restoring itself to full employment and, in particular, my assistance will be there for former employees who are not currently employed. I will do anything I can to ensure that they gain employment. I hope that in the not too distant future they will again be employees of Smartwood.

307,Mr King (Wentworth) (9.43 A.m.),"I wish to draw attention to inaccurate commentsas a minister during his 18 years in office brought into question in a way that really was a bitter personal attack. Mr Ramsay has every right to question the policies of politicians past and present, but the way in which he wrote about Mr Bury has, with justification, caused great offence to his family. In his 17 May article in the Sydney Morning Herald, Alan Ramsey described Mr Bury as a ‘grim beanpole of a man’. Ramsey’s contention was that Les Bury, in his role as federal Treasurer in 1970, increased pensions by only 50c in the budget that year. That led Ramsey to conclude that ‘more than a pensioner or two around the country would have raised a glass to damn him to hell when Mr Bury died in 1986’. These claims were tasteless and undeserved. Another Sydney Morning Herald journalist, Ian Fitchett, wrote on 11 March 1967: When Mr Holt named his first Ministry on January 25 last year he promoted Mr Bury from the junior portfolio of Housing to Labour and National Service and also into the inner Cabinet, where he has remained ever since, with his reputation growing as the months go by. He is friendly by nature and has an easy manner, qualities which have attracted co-operative responses from the trade union movement. Added to this are an obvious sincerity and a hard-working application to his duties. It is his habit to go regularly to his department’s headquarters in Melbourne, and he is in fact one of the few Ministers who work with their departmental officers in their own central offices and are not content to leave their contacts with them to their offices in Parliament House. He was also referred to in the Canberra Times in 1970 as ‘a gentleman among piranhas’ as a politician. He was a fine parliamentarian, who spent 18 years working for the people of Wentworth and Australia. He was an extremely talented elected representative who served the parliament both as minister and Treasurer. Prior to his election he worked in the Department of the Treasury under the Chifley government and also worked for the IMF and World Bank from 1951 to 1956. Bury entered the parliament in 1956 representing my electorate. He became a minister in the Menzies government in 1961, serving as Minister for Air and the Minister assisting the Treasurer. His career also included service as Minister for Housing and Minister for Labour and National Service. In the former capacity, he introduced the first home owners grant, a scheme that survives today, providing benefits to so many thousands of Australians. Between 1969 and 1971, Les Bury served as this nation’s Treasurer, which included handing down the federal budget. It was in that budget, according to Ramsey, that Bury deserved the damnation of Australia’s pensioners by increasing pensions by 50c, which in today’s terms is the equivalent of $4 a week. It was a pension rise that attracted some criticism, although it was basically designed to offset CPI increases. Bury continued his parliamentary career by serving as the Minister for Foreign Affairs during the McMahon government, and then in 1974 retired from the parliament. From 1956 to 1976 Les Bury was one of the few parliamentarians who enjoyed respect from both sides of the House, a characteristic we see much less of today. Nick, his son, has told me how his father would attend football matches with Arthur Calwell in Melbourne and that the father of the current Opposition Leader, Frank Crean, stayed at the Bury home in Sydney. My own father-in-law, Ian Sinclair, has told me how Les Bury would always have a pot of coffee brewing in his Canberra office. He was a fine parliamentarian and Australian. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Workplace Relations: Industrial Action my electorate at a factory called Morris McMahon in Arncliffe. Workers there have been protesting against the failure of the company to enter into negotiations for a collective agreement. Those workers have been on strike for some 11 weeks and have been outside the premises of the factory expressing their opposition to the company’s actions. I have met on several occasions with those workers. They are primarily women from non-English-speaking backgrounds. Despite the torrential rain we have had in Sydney, they have loyally stayed outside the factory in support of each other in support of the claim. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations last Friday went out there and, with respect to the minister, feigned sympathy for them. He was reported on the radio as saying, ‘You have every right to go to the union and seek the union’s help. You have every right to do that, and you have every right to ask for a collective agreement-every right in the world.’ The trouble is that when he was asked to talk about what that right was on radio, he said, ‘You’ve got the right to ask for a collective agreement, but not to enforce a right.’ I do not know how you can have a right which is not enforceable. He said to Stan Zemanek: Sometimes people just don’t agree. Husbands and wives don’t always agree, and sometimes you just can’t resolve it. It can be resolved. The way it can be resolved is by giving the Industrial Relations Commission the power to direct parties to bargain in good faith. It was virtually invited to do so by Justice Munro, when he said on 8 May last in respect of the dispute: It follows that it is appropriate to place on record that, in my view, the Company by its bargaining conduct has contributed to, or engaged in a form of conduct, that would merit sanction and prevention if relevant powers or defences were available. It has engaged in a bargaining practice that is not a fair labour practice. It has not bargained in good faith with the representatives of the bulk of its employees. The minister should stop feigning sympathy. He should do something within his power: he should restore the power of the independent umpire to direct parties in an industrial dispute to bargain in good faith. If he does not do that, we will see Australians pitted against Australians on protest lines, police against workers. The only way to avoid that is by having the rule of law in industrial relations. The minister should act, and he should act now. Education: Boys Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.49 a.m.)-I bring to the House’s attention an initiative from the Minister for Education, Science and Training that provides understanding and real solutions to a problem facing school aged boys in our communities. Research over the past 20 years has examined ways to address gender issues, especially as they relate to girls. But much more recently we have noticed that, while boys are performing well, there exists greater potential. Research has found that 14-year-old boys are now doing worse in literacy tests than they were 25 years ago. In the year 2000, 89.6 per cent of year 5 girls achieved literacy benchmarks, compared to 85.2 per cent of boys. The problem illustrated by these results also carries through to later years, so that in 2002 the year 12 school retention rate was 80.7 per cent for females and just over 69.8 per cent for males. In higher education, males made up 43.6 per cent of the 61,076 domestic students in 2001, compared to 46 per cent in the year 1991. MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Statements By Members
308,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (9.46 A.m.),"I rise to express my concern about events inAs a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training, I was concerned when the statistics mentioned above were first discussed. However, through this committee we were able to look at the education of boys-and I note that the deputy chair of that committee is also in the chamber at the moment, and I acknowledge the fine work of the member for Port Adelaide on that inquiry. That inquiry led to the Boys’ Education Lighthouse Schools Program. The objective of the program is to establish across Australia 30 lighthouse schools that will champion, demonstrate and disseminate best practice in boys’ education to other schools around them. I was really pleased that two of the schools announced in the first round are in my electorate of Petrie. They are the Kippa-Ring State School and Southern Cross Catholic College. Both of these schools are important community beacons in my electorate, and they will receive grants of $5,000 for their respective programs. Kippa-Ring State School will use their grant funding for BRAG Week-BRAG meaning Boys in Reading and Growing. The program is designed to develop greater participation in class learning activities where reading is a component, and it will improve reading strategies and boys’ willingness to read. Role models from the local community will work in small groups with the boys to highlight the importance of reading in their lives. Follow-up activities will include a visit from a storyteller, individualised assistance and resources to supplement boys’ reading. Southern Cross College will fund a project called Seeking the Light of Literacy. It will focus on literacy and communication skills programs for boys across the four campuses of the college. These are just some of 110 projects around Australia worth about $860,000 in the first round, and they are part of the $4.3 million Commonwealth investment in boys’ education over the next two years. Education: Funding cation in the 2003 budget are nothing more than smoke and mirrors and a pea and thimble trick. These intentions amount to less than zilch. Let me explain in simple terms so that even those opposite can understand. There is one indicator and one indicator alone that needs to be examined when analysing a government’s commitment to higher education. I will repeat that: only one indicator can tell the truth. That indicator is the percentage of GDP spent on higher education, and that is it in a nutshell. When that indicator is analysed in the budget papers, a very different story emerges to the one spun by the government and the minister. At least one commentator has pointed this out-Ken Davidson from the Age in his Monday column this week. When the government came to power in 1996, public funding for higher education was 0.9 per cent of GDP. It is now 0.6 per cent-a 33 per cent cut. Part of that is due to the transfer of Austudy to Youth Allowance, but it does not explain everything. How could anyone reconcile that raw, unadulterated statistic with the government’s claims of more money for higher education? The budget forward estimates clearly show that spending on higher education has fallen from 0.9 per cent of GDP in 1996 to 0.6 per cent now, and it will not rise but fall to 0.5 per cent of GDP next financial year and again in 2004-05. In 2005-06, the forward estimates will again be 0.6 per cent-exactly what they are now. Extra money? No way. More money? Balderdash. If that is not smoke and mirrors and a pea and thimble trick, I do not know what it is. What sort of commitment to higher education is this? Shonky, I would have thought. Despite the bluster-actually fluster-it remains exactly the same today as it did when the govMAIN COMMITTEE",159,Statements By Members

There is no greater public commitment-full stop. However, there will be a larger private commitment by families. Universities will be deregulated; they are now free to increase their fees by up to 30 per cent. But something else has also happened. HECS contributions were 20 per cent of the price of a degree until 1997 but, under this government, they have increased to 40 per cent. If all the universities apply the surcharge, that will increase to well over 50 per cent and be on its way to 60 per cent. Funding for private schools is interesting. To sum up, the 58 former category 1 schools, which received $62 million in 2001, are now going to get $122 million in 2004, with $115 million going to schools in Victoria and New South Wales. In higher education the government encourages those with money over those with merit. In the schools system the government subsidises those who do not need it over those who do. (Time expired) Flinders Electorate: Western Port Oberon Association ern Port Oberon Association in my electorate of Flinders who, over a period of years, have worked tirelessly to create the Oberon Association Otama submarine display and are working towards that end. They have successfully won for Hastings and the surrounding area the Oberon submarine, which was a gift from the Commonwealth along with a $500,000 Centenary of Federation grant. These are community members who have worked for a community good with nothing in it for themselves other than a vision of building and developing the town of Hastings. The reason I raise this in the House today is that a former councillor this week launched an aggressive, unfounded and ultimately mean spirited attack on the members of the Oberon Association and the vision they have for Hastings of creating a world-class educational and visitors facility surrounding the Oberon submarine the HMAS Otama. As I go around to primary schools and speak to children from prep up to grade 6 in the areas surrounding Hastings-Baxter, Somerville, Tyabb, Crib Point and Bittern-there is one thing they ask me about: all of the children want to know about the submarine. There is incredible excitement about having a submarine within their area or within their town. They want to know when they can visit. They want to know when they can see the submarine, which is currently moored off the jetty at Crib Point. In that situation, for one member of the community to hold a different vision is entirely reasonable and acceptable, but for that member of the community to aggressively abuse, deride and downgrade the thousands of hours of effort that a group of volunteers has given to building Hastings is disappointing. I give my unequivocal, overwhelming and absolute support to the Western Port Oberon Association and their vision of a maritime and marine memorial area for submariners and a display of the HMAS Otama. In terms of the vision for Hastings and the surrounding area, this is a magnificent step forward which fits with the aquatic centre and the plan for a marine and maritime training centre and is part of the notion of building pride within the town-of building a sense of self-respect and creating a vision which brings people together.

In accordance with standing order 275A, the time forSecond Reading Debate resumed from 15 May, on motion by Mr Scott: That this bill be now read a second time. started to make when we were last in this place. Water is without doubt the country’s most valuable natural resource. To say that Australia’s primary industries and many of our inland country towns rely on this product to survive is an understatement. With the exceptional drought that is continuing to plague many parts of Australia, we absolutely have to address the issue of the sustainability of this resource which underpins so many of our rural economies and country towns. dicted by the year 2020 water shortage will be a serious worldwide problem. It will not just be one for Australia; it will be a worldwide problem. Already, though, many parts of Australia are reaching their limits of supply under current practices. TodayI would like to make the House aware-and I am sure many members and senators are aware-that this is the International Year of Freshwater, as proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly, with the aim to increase the awareness of not just a few who understand the issue but everyone about the importance of sustainable freshwater use, its management and its protection. I would like to quote for a moment from the executive summary of the UN World water development report, which was delivered earlier this year. It states: Globally, the challenge lies in raising the political will to implement water-related commitments ... Water professionals need a better understanding of the broader social, economic, and political context, while politiciansus in this caseneed to be better informed about water resource issues. On our part, the federal government, the Liberal-National Party coalition, is all too aware of the importance of water quality and of the need to sustain this valuable resource, especially because of its importance to our national economy. The Murray-Darling Basin, which is the focus of this amendment bill, is one of Australia’s largest drainage divisions, covering over just one million square kilometres of land. The Murray-Darling Basin is an extraordinary part of Australia’s economic wealth. Environment Australia figures show that some 30,000 wetlands are in the Murray-Darling Basin and that biodiversity and ecological processes themselves are under pressure. For this reason, the states which the Murray-Darling Basin extends across, including my own home state of Queensland, have representation on the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. These organisations play an integral role in the management of the basin’s natural and environmental resources. In the lower part of my electorate of Maranoa, the St George Water Harvesters and the Dirranbandi District Irrigators have undertaken their own monitoring program of the Lower Balonne, spending over $1 million in that process. We ask ourselves: why would a group like that be doing their own monitoring? Because the viability of their own enterprises and the towns that depend on the wealth created from irrigation in that area are so important to them. MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Statements By Members
312,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (9.59 A.m.),"I will reiterate some of the comments that IThey are not going to see the river damaged. They want to make sure that it is sustainable, and they are taking a very responsible part in ensuring that the river does not become degraded and that it remains sustainable. These people have an interest in being water-wise. However, it appears that they are only now winning the fight against the Queensland Labor government and some of its political agendas, which I have witnessed over the last 18 months. The Labor government in Queensland last year tried to sneak through a secret plan that would have seen the compulsory acquisition of a large irrigation farm, Cubbie Station at Dirranbandi-I admit that it is one of the largest irrigation operations in Australia-and reallocate that water into New South Wales, but over into another catchment. It was going to cross two other catchment basins and put it into another catchment area altogether. This issue has been very close to my heart because it is of critical importance to the people of my electorate. But I just want to revisit some of the facts for the purposes of reading them into Hansard. In July last year I refused to remain silent after discovering that the Premier of Queensland, Premier Beattie, intended to push through a secret Murray-Darling Basin sustainability initiative strategy paper that proposed to forcibly and compulsorily buy out Cubbie Station, ramp down the operations and reallocate that water. This was seen by the Department of Primary Industries in Queensland as the answer to sustaining water and land resources. But this move would have shut down a town without prior consultation or good science and with a politically motivated agenda. It would have seen Dirranbandi become a virtual ghost town. Furthermore, Premier Beattie, the leader of the Labor Party in Queensland, expected the federal and New South Wales governments to contribute some 85 per cent of the buyout price so that the Queensland government could contribute more water to the Murray-Darling Basin and avoid-and this is what they were after-some $128 million in compensation payments. The coalition government were not interested in the proposal asking it to buy out Cubbie Station. We were well aware that the Queensland Premier had based his motives on flawed science-on salinity maps that were prepared without proper community consultation and that were politically motivated. They were proven to be so when the Premier came to a public meeting in Dirranbandi and agreed to have a study done by independent, outside-ofgovernment sources and researchers. By the end of last year, when that study was completed, it had completely identified the fact that the river was in good health and had discredited the research that had been done by Premier Beattie’s own Queensland government department. This substantiated the argument that had been put by the local people, by me and by the opposition in Queensland that Premier Beattie’s agenda was political; it was not based on science or fact. It was a scandalous and outrageous attack that used misinformation to try to seek revenue for the state of Queensland and, at the same time, shut down a country town. During the whole process there were two large public meetings in the town of Dirranbandi. The Cubbie Station manager and the people employed there maintained their claim that they had been responsible agriculturalists. As long-term residents and investors-as farmers on the river system-they have, in fact, a greater commitment to the long-term issues of river health and salinity than most. We know that drought continues to rage in many parts of Australia and in this part of Queensland, and my electorate is no exception. But that part of the river has recently had a run from rains that have fallen further upstream. The interesting thing is that, when Cubbie MAIN COMMITTEE Station could have been harvesting the waters that came down the river, as responsible citizens they let the first three days of the flow go past Cubbie Station for users downstream and for the health of the river. They could have been harvesting for three days to store more water for a crop that they would grow later in the year, but they let the first three days’ flow go through. I think that demonstrates their commitment to being good citizens and also to considering the health of the river. They have some 30,000 acres there that they could irrigate. By letting three days go you might say that they have, effectively, let a commercial opportunity go down the river. They did harvest after the first three days and they have been able to store enough water to irrigate 3,000 acres later this year-some 10 per cent of the total capacity. The Premier of Queensland, Premier Beattie, has all but admitted to unjustly targeting Cubbie Station. As I said earlier, after two public meetings that were organised by myself as the local member, the local state member and the leader of the opposition, Premier Beattie agreed to commission an independent review of the science underpinning the assessment of the current and future ecological condition of the Lower Balonne river system. I want to touch on that report as it is important to get the facts into Hansard. The scientific review panel, which was headed by the highly regarded Professor Peter Cullen, produced the Cullen report which contradicted Labor’s claims that the Lower Balonne is a severely degraded river system. However, although this report was released in January this year, the Queensland government has remained silent to avoid any embarrassment over its own flawed processes used during the early part of last year. This is just another example of how the Queensland government ignored the importance of community consultation and listening to the people. We are seeing the same processes starting up again in relation to vegetation management in Queensland right now. This stands in stark contrast to the federal coalition government here in Canberra because we support the protection of property rights. We recognise that landholders have property rights. And, whilst we acknowledge the need for water reform, we see the notion that you can compulsorily acquire property as morally incomprehensible. I want to bring to the attention of the Main Committee the marked difference between the coalition’s efforts to manage and protect the environment and those of the state Labor government, which stand in stark contrast. The Australian Labor Party in this place opposed the creation of the Natural Heritage Trust, which was introduced by this government and stands as the largest environmental protection program developed in Australian history. On that note, let me add that the coalition government has also established Envirofund, the community component of the $2.7 billion Natural Heritage Trust, which has been one of the most proactive community assistance initiatives ever started. This year alone rounds one and two of the drought recovery round, which is putting money into those drought areas, has seen some 76 separate projects in my own electorate of Maranoa receive a total of more than $1½ million to carry out specialised environment works. Under a Labor government, these 76 initiatives would never have eventuated because they opposed the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust fund and of course the Envirofund which has flowed from that. I would like to record in Hansard that Labor has never had a real interest in addressing the core issue of the environment. In contrast, in the 2002-03 financial year the coalition government has spent more than double on the environment than Labor did in its final year in office, and I think that gives credibility to what I am saying in this place this morning. The coalition government is committed to supporting communities in their efforts to develop local solutions MAIN COMMITTEE to local environment and natural resource management challenges. In fact, this is the very essence of the Australian government’s Envirofund: harnessing the local knowledge, expertise and enthusiasm of community groups, like those in my own electorate, to help their local environment and, in the case of the drought recovery round, to combat the effect that drought is having on the community. Almost 40,000 volunteers have contributed to more than 12,000 Natural Heritage Trust projects to repair and restore the local environment and communities right across Australia. The Natural Heritage Trust has funded native vegetation work on over 773,000 hectares of land, and this includes more than 98,000 hectares of predominantly cleared land replanted with native vegetation. At the other end of the spectrum, when Labor want to be seen as acting on environmental interests in this great land of ours, they go about it in entirely the wrong way. They seem to want to pander to minority pressure groups rather than addressing the real core issue of making sure that you can get money to repair some of the damage and make sure that agriculture, towns and the environment are sustainable for future generations. Another current issue that is confronting landholders in my electorate and their battle against the Queensland Labor government is one that causes me great concern, as it demonstrates that government’s failure to acknowledge the property rights and civil rights of farmers as landholders in Queensland. The Queensland Labor government’s draft Southern Brigalow regional vegetation management plan proposes to lock up some 12,500 hectares of land in the Murilla shire near Miles because of local wild flowers. This land comprises freehold, leasehold, state forest, national park and reserve land. They have now identified this particular area of my electorate as having a high conservation value, yet 10 years ago, when the Labor government under Premier Goss wanted to establish a new toxic waste dump in Queensland-the Willawong one near Brisbane was fullthey went out and found this area, and the report done internally by the department said that it had no conservation value at all. Ten years later, with a different agenda, they say that this area that they established a toxic waste dump in is an area of high conservation. That supports what I have been saying this morning: that the Labor government in Queensland has a political agenda. They seek a solution by manipulating departments for their own agenda. I could talk a great deal more, but I will conclude on that point. (Time expired) Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002 and, like other speakers, I will probably range a little wider than the specific target of the legislation. The purpose of the bill is essentially to amend the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement to enable the sharing between the states of water made available in the Murray River catchment above the Hume Dam as a result of the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. The amendments also provide for the management of environmental flows in the Murray River. Obviously the Murray River-and given your particular background, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you would be an interested spectator in relation to this particular bill and the various arguments that have taken place over some time in relation to the Murray River-is an essential part of our part of the world. It is an essential part of the Australian economy and, as such, should be looked at as an essential part of our future. I think the member for Maranoa raised a couple of interesting points towards the end of his speech, particularly in relation to the Queensland government and the property rights issue. MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Unesco The United Nations Educational Scientific And Cultural Organisation Has Pre
313,Mr Windsor (New England) (10.16 A.m.),"I am pleased to speak on the MurrayTherein lie a number of the problems-partly through constitutional fault, I guess-in that the states are deemed to have a certain degree of control over water resources within their boundaries, while something like the Murray River does not stay within state boundaries but travels through a number of states. That immediately introduces a political dimension in terms of water reform and the way in which governments, both state and federal, can react to particular issues of water quality, salinity et cetera. In my view, one of the major problems that this bill confronts-which governments, both state and federal, do not confront on a broader level-is that there has not been enough money put in place to address some of these major reform issues. I congratulate the independent member for East Gippsland in the Victorian parliament for reacting to the people’s concern and essentially taking advantage of a political moment within that state to drive this bill. However, more important than the recognition of some of the problems that the Snowy was having and the various arrangements that have been put in place with the various irrigators west of the range, is that within this bill there was a coming together of the various states and the Commonwealth, with money, to embrace a solution. A lot of politics were played prior to the solution being obtained. I can remember being in the state parliament when, I think, the Hon. Robert Webster was appointed commissioner for the Snowy River inquiry, and a tremendous amount of politics was played-not by him, but by various parties and people in New South Wales and Victoria. Even though that argy-bargy took place at that stage, the fact that everybody in this House is agreeing with this particular bill today means that the introduction of money into the argument to help with the reform process has been able to achieve an outcome. One of the great difficulties we have in relation to future debates about the Murray-Darling system-particularly the property rights debate, which is raging in all states and at a Commonwealth level-is that we have not introduced enough money into the system. It is all very well for the member for Maranoa to talk about how wonderful the Natural Heritage Trust has been in terms of funding environmental reform-and I am sure other government members will also talk about this-but a tremendous amount of that money has been wasted. A lot of it was not targeted properly. A lot of it was politically motivated and was used to indicate that there was some sort of lip-service being paid to some of the very real environmental problems that impact on the Murray-Darling system. I believe that there needs to be a much greater injection of money. Obviously governments, through their budgetary constraints, cannot just produce new money and they cannot keep on selling Telstra to produce some of the funds that are poured into the political dimension in some of the marginal seats-and that leads to the need for a solution in terms of this particular problem. No doubt Mr Deputy Speaker Causley will let me know if I am out of order in mentioning that I think that he and a number of others in a committee that he was on at one timeI cannot remember the name of it-recommended that the government of the day look very seriously at the use of an environmental levy to fund some of these remedial arrangements. That is a very important point. We need to inject new money. We need to stop this argument between the states and the Commonwealth and those of different political persuasions to inject new money into the system. I would not recommend that it be funded by asset sales-as some other things have been funded in the past. I would suggest that the parliament, and particularly the government, look very seriously at having a transparent package in terms of an MAIN COMMITTEE environmental levy and that the money be used in an accountable process, as the former CEO of the National Farmers Federation suggested some time ago-which was pilloried to a certain extent when Rick Farley suggested that an independent body be set up to administer the Murray-Darling remediation money-so that we, in a sense, remove some of the politics. Let the politics determine what the target is, but we should then hand that process over to an independent authority so that it cannot be impinged and impugned by the political process. That has been one of the great problems in the past. A simplistic way of looking at this fundraising issue is that $1 a week from all Australians raises $1 billion in a year. That is the magnitude of the funding that we are talking about. I forget what the Natural Heritage Trust arrangements were. I think it was something like $1 billion or $2 billion, which was spread over many years. Funding for the national salinity and water quality action plan-NAP-was $1.46 billion to be spread over a number of years. In my view those sorts of sums are not sufficient. We should be looking in the realms of $1 billion a year to be spent, particularly on targets like the Murray-Darling system-and some of that money should also be used in relation to the property rights issue. The COAG arrangements were put in place then-I know that the current government was not in power then, but there has been a general agreement in relation to the processesessentially to formulate a process of water reform. Other competition policy arrangements were made that embraced transport, gas, water and another thing I cannot think of off the top of my head to embrace a number of very important cross-border issues and issues that had an important dimension in terms of the running of the nation. That occurred in 1995. Within those various discussions between the Commonwealth and the states at that time, certain principles and protocols were put in place and certain moneys were applied and tied to certain processes being agreed to by the states. Certain benchmarks were set whereby the federal government would not allocate the funds to the states if, in fact, the states had not met those particular benchmarks. That was in 1995 and we are now in the year 2003. The issue of property rights was raised back in the early days of 1995 and, under the protocols, a definition of property rights was to be recognised prior to the flow of money to the states; Commonwealth money would not flow to the states unless the states recognised an appropriate definition of property rights. That has not happened. A series of other agreements was made over that number of years. We had COAG. We had the competition policy where a call for a definition of property rights was made and certain protocols were put in place. Even yesterday we still had the minister for the environment extending the NAP arrangements because of Western Australia not having come into the tent in relation to agreement on some of these arrangements. We had intergovernmental agreements and bilateral agreements. Then, I think it was in the year 2000, we had what was seen as a very important step forward-the national action plan on water quality and salinity. On a number of occasions at a state level, prior to coming into this place, I raised these issues in the New South Wales parliament. I was on the water inquiry committee within that parliament and on a number of occasions in that capacity I raised the issues. Also, in a federal capacity since coming here, I have raised these issues with the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In fact, a year ago within this very place I raised with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in terms of last year’s budget documents, MAIN COMMITTEE the money flows to the states through the national action plan and how the minister would interpret the property rights issue when the Commonwealth government had continually given the states, particularly New South Wales, national action plan money and other funds without appropriate recognition of property rights being given. I am quite pleased that within the New South Wales government we have a new minister, Craig Knowles, who, in my view, is prepared to address this issue in a fashion it should have been addressed in years ago. I encourage the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and any of the various ministers responsible, particularly the Prime Minister, to really get behind this issue of property rights. It is about money and it will require an injection of it before any worthwhile reform process can take place. You cannot, through various legislative or regulatory arrangements, force the farming community to deliver appropriate actions without the injection of some degree of money. There has to be a proper recognition, a proper definition of property rights, and that recognition needs to be converted into compensation where it is appropriate, where there is going to be a loss of capital or real income by the application of government policy. I refer to the year 2000, when the national action plan was launched by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Prime Minister. They all made great play-and rightly so-of the inclusion of the property rights in the funding arrangements. In welcoming the $1.46 billion announcement in October 2000, Mr Truss said: The plan recognises that actions required to sustain the environmental health of a region may affect the property rights of individuals and some local economies. Compensation must be payablethese are his words, not mineunder the plan to those adversely affected. That has not happened. It is a redefinition of the 1995 COAG and competition policy arrangements. In his briefing note titled ‘The Action Plan at a Glance’, Mr Truss further said: In regard to policy improvements, the Action Plan proposes Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments agree to supporting an agenda of key land and water-use policy initiatives. These include: Land-clearing controls in salinity risk areas; caps on surface and groundwater allocation; improved security of property rights for water, together with improved water pricing and trading arrangements; “buying back” water allocations to achieve sustainable water use. A number of people in this parliament have seen the absolute fiasco at the Commonwealth level-and at the state level as well-that has occurred in the Namoi region, where the very principles embraced by the minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister back in 2000 of buying back water allocations to achieve sustainable water use were built in and could have been funded through this $1.46 billion national action plan. Only last year the Prime Minister signed off another $200 million to the state of New South Wales without the buy-back arrangements-the very principles lauded at the announcement of this process. A Prime Ministerial communiqué dated the day of the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments at which the states and the Commonwealth government agreed on six elements to the plan-‘all of which are necessary to achieve lasting improvements’, according to the communiqué-stated: MAIN COMMITTEE … an improved governance framework to secure Commonwealth-State/Territory investments and community action in the long term: including property rights; pricing; and regulatory reforms for water and land use; That still has not happened. Moving forward a short time, Mr Anderson issued a press release, after some degree of criticism from me about the national action plan bilateral agreement which was signed off without any recognition of property rights. Mr Anderson said in the press release: The inter-governmental agreement on water quality and salinity signed by the Federal and NSW Governments provides that compensation and structural adjustment issues will be dealt with under regional catchment plans. There is no need for the issue to be dealt withas I had raised and been critical ofagain in bilateral agreements. This was just to brush aside the seven years of history. He was saying, ‘Don’t worry, it’s all still coming. We are going to recognise property rights. Mr Anderson continued: Regional plans will require the agreement of the Federal Government and I make it quite clear that plans will not be approved, and Federal funds will not flow, unless property right issues are dealt with to the Federal Government’s satisfaction. Last year the minister was asked what definition he would apply to ‘the Federal Government’s satisfaction’, and he was unable to answer. I think the point that is very valid now is that we are rapidly running out of excuses on this particular issue. There are regional blueprints on the table now; I have seen a number of them. There is no mention of property rights in these regional blueprints that are going to supposedly take care of the property rights issue. SoI ask ministers concerned to start to look at the 21 regional catchment blueprints which are in New South Wales alone and explain to the community how they are going to use those blueprints to achieve property rights when most of them have not even mentioned property rights as an issue. I asked the Prime Minister a question on 18 September last year-given recent comments by both the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestryregarding the government’s intention to withhold national competition policy payments from the states that had not adhered to the principles of the COAG arrangements in 1995 relating to water reform. The question was: what benchmarks does the government intend to use as a trigger for this process? The Prime Minister answered the question by saying that he had put in place the appropriate benchmarks. Time is dragging on, Prime Minister. I do not believe the appropriate benchmarks can be achieved through the regional blueprints, because most of them have not even got a definition of property rights-but hopefully some of them have recognised it. It is time that the various ministers concerned recognised-and this has been going on for eight years-that we do need two things to happen. Firstly, we need recognition of property rights so that the farming community, when it is impacted adversely by structural change, can be compensated in an appropriate way. That does not mean that everybody who has ever had a water licence suddenly becomes a millionaire, but there are people who are impacted very strongly. Secondly-and perhaps this is the way to in fact fund this-we need to look at using an environmental levy across all Australians as a source of funding not only to compensate for MAIN COMMITTEE property rights but also to fund the many issues to be considered in relation to salinity and water quality reform. (Time expired) powerhouse of rural Australia, and I think that is something we all know, with all due respect to my colleague from Kalgoorlie. It is a catchment for the Murray and the Darling rivers and their many tributaries. Quite obviously, my whole electorate of Parkes forms part of the watershed for that system, mainly going through the rivers of the Lachlan. About once every 50 years it does actually reach the Darling, the Macquarie and the Bogan. They are the main river systems that flow through the whole region of Parkes and eventually into the Murray, and whatever part of that flows out the mouth. I was rather surprised to hear the Leader of the Opposition talk about using 1,500 gigalitres of water-and we are not sure where he is going to get it from-to wash out the mouth of the Murray. You could not actually carry enough water in a short enough time to wash out the mouth of the Murray. That is a long-term thing. The build-up of silt is well known to have happened over a long time. Simply pouring out 1,500 gigalitres to wash it through is far and away from being any kind of a solution, not to mention the fact that there was no talk of how it was going to be funded and where it was going to come from. The Murray-Darling Basin stretches from the north of Roma in Queensland to Goolwa in South Australia and takes in around three-quarters of New South Wales and about half of Victoria. It extends across one-seventh of the continent and encompasses about two million people, and probably another million people depend very heavily on it. The Murray-Darling Basin generates about 40 per cent of the national income, and that is obviously mainly from agriculture and grazing. Figures suggest that around one-quarter of our nation’s beef herd, about half of our sheep, almost three-quarters of the irrigation system and about half of the crop land actually come out of the basin. I am proud to say that a good portion of all those things come out of my electorate of Parkes. There are about 20 major rivers and ground water systems involved. I represent the largest electorate in New South Wales-it is just under 270,000 square kilometres-and agriculture and mining are its main industries. Obviously, to them water is the lifeblood. Our future depends upon water in one way or another, whether it be for stock and domestic use, whether it be for growing crops or whether it be for maintaining our towns and industries. The uncertainty over water allocations is without doubt one of the greatest hurdles facing the agricultural sector. There is no doubt that we have a duty to be sustainable, to use water properly and to be environmentally sensible. This means using common sense, not-as so often in this debate and in many debates-using environmental correctness to appeal to a voting sector in the cities. The New South Wales government makes a particular habit of doing that: bowing to people who use environmental correctness rather than environmental common sense as the criteria. This bill deals in the main with the great Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. We all know that that was one of the great engineering feats of the world. The scheme was designed and constructed over 25 years, until 1974, at a cost of over $800 million. I wonder whether in this day and age we would have the guts, the foresight and the push to undertake a scheme like that. Yes, it is probably true that it changed the natural landscape to some extent, but what everybody forgets-with a great deal of passion, at times-is that nature and time change the MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Unesco The United Nations Educational Scientific And Cultural Organisation Has Pre
314,Mr John Cobb (Parkes) (10.36 A.m.),"The Murray-Darling Basin is the economicnatural landscape as well. It seems that in this day and age there are a great many people who feel that we must put a stop on time-that nothing must go forward and nothing must develop. AllI can say is that, if businesses took that attitude, they would all go broke. On average, the Snowy Mountains scheme diverts 2,360 gigalitres of water each year west of the Great Dividing Range for irrigation and river management. The additional water is shared between New South Wales and Victoria-approximately 75 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. Much of inland Australia owes its existence to the Snowy River and the great scheme that turned waters inland to regional areas. It provides power and it has provided an awesome amount of production for the Murrumbidgee and the Riverina-something that only somebody who has seen it and knew what it was like before could believe has happened. It has been quite incredible. The change to the landscape and the production of that part of Australia, and particularly New South Wales, has been phenomenal. As I said earlier, a lot of people refuse to accept the fact that the world and the environment change of their own accord and think that if man has anything to do with change it is totally untenable. That is a short-sighted and unscientific view, because science and history show us that we have always changed and the environment has always changed. As a government we are prepared to think outside the square and do the hard yards to work with the states in order to come up with a system that addresses common sense environmental issues without compromising the productivity of Australia’s agricultural sector. In this case, the corporatisation of the Snowy scheme will mean that, for the first time, water users on the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers will receive guaranteed levels of annual releases of water from the scheme. This will be made available from increased efficiencies in the way we use the water in the river. To me, that is a lot of common sense. I cannot help but compare it to what is happening in New South Wales and Queensland at the moment in relation to both water and native vegetation. Queensland in recent times seems to have caught up with environmental correctness rather than environmental common sense; it seems to have caught up with New South Wales in one heck of a rush in the last year or so. When you look at what has happened and at the number of farmers coming to see us, you will see how dependent they, their families, our communities and the towns in our particular region along the Lachlan, the Darling and the Barwon are on this water. They keep saying to me, ‘Why aren’t we getting any recognition for the fact that what we produce is so important to the region and so important to our communities?’ The state government keeps pulling back the entitlements of farmers, without any sign of compensation. The government is looking at the situation now, and is attacking the ground water issue. It was the river water, but now the ground water situation is being dealt with as hard and fast and as unscientifically as the river water was. As recently as 1996 Kim Yeadon, the New South Wales Minister for Land and Water Conservation, was writing to our farmers in the lower Macquarie encouraging them to take up licences to make use of the ground water allocations. Today they are being threatened with the annihilation of their industry. They are being told that they have to take account of the environment to an extent which would not only allow the water levels to rise, but make salinity a threat as well. There is no common sense in this. It is being driven by Sydney, and being paid for by the few thousand farmersnot even a few thousand-along those river systems. MAIN COMMITTEE The Lachlan, which is being treated as though it is part of the Murray-Darling system, does not even reach it. Once in the last 50 years it may have run into the Darling, yet the Lachlan River is being treated for environmental flows, and it has had its entitlements and its cap cut down. It is being treated as though it is a permanent part of the Murray-Darling system. The result is that livelihoods and communities are being put at risk all the way down the Lachlan, whether it be Forbes, Condobolin, or Hillston. Hillston is one of the success stories in country areas in Australia in the last 20 years. It was discovered that Hillston’s climate was fantasticthey could grow almost anything. It had the ground water and river water systems combined. Its water has not been over-utilised, but it is being treated as a resource that has been overutilised. There are cutbacks going on there which do not make sense. I have had a lot of contact with the irrigators along that line. They are asking COAG to look very hard at the use of Lake Brewster for permanent storage to allow better utilisation of water down there. So far, that has not happened, but I would hope that the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council will look kindly on a scheme which is designed to make better and more efficient use of water for that region, which is becoming-certainly in the last 15 years-one of the success stories of country New South Wales and of Australia. One of the problems in this system is that in New South Wales, in particular, the environmental movement are far more concerned with power and with frustrating productive communities than they are with common sense environmental business, and insist on environmental flows at a time when there is not much water, when it is dry. The natural result is that, when water is put down when people are not irrigating and when there are not natural flows, that water is soaked up and totally wasted. It does not even get anywhere. Whether it be the Macquarie, the Bogan or the Lachlan river catchments, to send flows down at a time when nothing else is running defies imagination. It does not clean anything out. It does not necessarily fill up reservoirs. It just wastes money, because the banks are dry-the whole system is dry. As anybody who knows anything about water realises, if you send water into a dry state on its own for a specific period, up to half of it can be totally wasted; 40 per cent is a figure that is often used. The issues of the Murray-Darling Basin system, the main water system in Australia, are enormous. When I look at what New South Wales and Queensland have joined forces on, if we are going to do some common sense things about good use of water out of that system, we have to acknowledge a few things. Firstly, New South Wales uses about 6,000 gigalitres of water to produce about $2.5 billion worth of output, Victoria uses about 3,300 gigalitres to produce about $1.5 billion and South Australia uses about 500 gigalitres to produce something over $1 billion. Partly that is because of the different crops grown, but obviously we have to do it better. The point I am making here is that we all realise there have been overallocations but we all realise also that we are talking about the productive powerhouse of Australia. If we are going to do anything about easing down further on water usage, we have to do it over a long time and we have to pay people for what we are depriving them of and pay the communities who depend upon them. It is no good coming up with a scheme which simply says, as New South Wales has done and as Queensland is in the process of doing, ‘You, the farmers of New South Wales and Queensland, are going to pay for environmental correctness as envisaged by Sydney and Brisbane.’ It is totally unjust. I think the way the farming community and the towns MAIN COMMITTEE and communities that depend upon them have been made to pay for the environmental correctness, and the totally unrealistic expectations on the farmers right around those two states is one of the great rip-offs of Australia. A lot better management could go on. Certainly the Department of Land and Conservation in New South Wales could have done a lot more, for example, to ensure better water facilities for Broken Hill, where at one stage water was let go down the Murray when water quality was taking a high dive in that area and the salinity factor of the water in Broken Hill was coming into serious question-and still is. The issue is that there should be not environmental correctness but environmental common sense. The livelihoods and the way of life of people who produce all the primary production one way or another and the regions that produce those things have to be taken into account. It is not good enough for the state governments to simply strip communities of their resource, their way of life, without even hinting that they can be compensated for it, especially when you look back to the fact that over many years state governments of all political persuasions encouraged and begged people to clear land to get into irrigation. Now they are saying, ‘You are going to pay for an ideal that the rest of us have.’ I recall at one stage putting to the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, the question of compensation for all the cutbacks. His comment was, ‘We can’t afford to pay for that. The community can’t afford to pay for these cutbacks.’ If the whole community cannot afford it, how in the heck can a few thousand farmers afford it on their behalf? 2002 amends the Murray-Darling Basin Act and implements an agreement between the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Commonwealth with respect to water sharing. It implements the corporatisation of Snowy Hydro and also a very major scheme for transferring water to generate environmental flows back to the Snowy River. It also establishes additional mechanisms for water accounting, notification, consultation and modelling with respect to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. Most importantly, in my view, this legislation implements an agreement between the Labor governments of New South Wales and Victoria designed to return to the Snowy River 28 per cent of its natural flow over a 10-year period, with the cost of approximately $300 million to be borne by those two state governments. This effectively will increase the flow of the Snowy from the figure of seven per cent up to 28 per cent. There are sections of the Snowy which have been in recent years flowing as low as one per cent. This is a matter that is very close to my heart, because I actually come from a town that is on the Snowy River, near the mouth of the Snowy River-Orbost. My father recently sold the farm that he had owned since I was a teenager-a farm that I worked on-which was on the banks of the Snowy River. Having grown up in the area, I have been very aware of this particular problem. It is to the great credit of the Bracks and Carr governments that they have intervened to ensure that the Snowy River can have some future, some prospect of being revived, and that the terrible situation that has prevailed there for many years with respect to the health and environmental quality of the Snowy River will finally be addressed. I first spoke on this issue in the parliament in 1997. It was very interesting that, after having made that speech, I was contacted by a former Labor state member of the Victorian parliament who had been a member of a parliamentary committee considering the proposed Snowy Mountains scheme in the early 1950s. He wrote to me, pointing out that the consideraMAIN COMMITTEE",170,Unesco The United Nations Educational Scientific And Cultural Organisation Has Pre
315,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (10.53 A.m.),"The Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Billtion of the prospective impact of the Snowy scheme on the Snowy River itself at that time was predominantly focused on the need to ensure that adequate drinking water was provided for the people of East Gippsland. So the only issue from the point of view of the impact of the Snowy scheme and diverting the waters from the Snowy inland that was considered by that parliamentary committee in the early 1950s was the amount of drinking water that would be available to the people of East Gippsland. When you consider that, at that time and subsequently, the number of people for whom that drinking water was needed was literally only several thousand-the entire Orbost Shire, as it then was, had a population of only about 5,000-you can see the appalling lack of scrutiny of the environmental consequences of the Snowy Mountains scheme at that time. It was understandable, given the lack of concern for and the lack of knowledge about environmental issues at that time, but it was nonetheless disastrous for the longer term. For most people in Australia the Snowy Mountains scheme is a great icon and a great achievement in engineering and nation building. I accept that picture, but it has had a downside for the people of East Gippsland, and that downside has been the degradation of the Snowy River, the reduction in the environmental quality of the river and a reduction in economic opportunities for people in East Gippsland. There are great farming traditions in East Gippsland, just as there are around the Murray-Darling Basin. Some of the richest soil in Australia is in the Snowy River flats. There are a lot of farmers there; there is a lot of dairying and mixed cropping-the kind of things that my father was involved in. They were entitled to their opportunities just as much as other farmers, and they were denied them. I visited my former home town back in September 2000 in the company of Craig Ingram, the Independent member for East Gippsland, who was elected largely on a platform of pursuing the issue of the Snowy. I went with him to look at various parts of the river, including one particular section near Bete Bolong, which is very close to a place where I lived as a child on a property which backed onto the Snowy. At that point the depth of the river was only one or two feet; of course, during summer everything in the river died because of the shallowness of the river and the lack of environmental flows. It took the election of the Bracks government, and indeed the election of Craig Ingram, as the Independent member for East Gippsland, to finally get something done about the issue. things about the issue but had failed for a long time to do anything seriously on behalf of the people of East Gippsland with respect to the Snowy River. It took the election of the Bracks government and the election of Craig Ingram to ensure that action was taken. I am very pleased to see that those promises have been delivered on, but there are still many difficulties and issues that need to be addressed. Understandably, there has been some local controversy about the implementation of these changes-as we are dealing here with a very great challenge: to restore one of Australia’s great icons to a proportion of its natural health. I look forward to the day when the Snowy is back running at something like the state that it was decades ago before the waters were diverted. I look forward to the Bracks and Carr governments continuing to implement their commitments to ensure that that occurs. I am pleased that this legislation provides a framework in which those commitments are implemented.

316,"The Member For Gippsland, The Minister For Science, Mr Mcgauran, Had Said Some Nice","The broader picture is even more serious. The Murray-Darling system is dying; the Murray River is dying. We face the unbelievably critical challenge in our society of dealing with these issues and dealing with them urgently. The amount of water that is taken out of the Murray-Darling system for agricultural purposes has virtually doubled over the past 20 years. It is widely known that within the next decade or two, unless we have very substantial action, Adelaide’s drinking water will be below World Health Organization standards for two days out of every five. We have serious silting up. The river mouth is closing, and there are areas where the water is sometimes flowing backwards. In addition, of course, there is the rapid spread of salinity. The situation is absolutely critical, and the Prime Minister and the current government are doing virtually nothing about it. We can see why in the speech of the member who preceded my contribution, because the current government is shackled to the interests of the irrigators in the Murray-Darling system. They are at the very heart of the National Party, and their interests are very vigorously represented at the federal and state levels by the conservative parties. As a result, the conservative parties and the Howard government will always be a major barrier to reform. They will have to be dragged kicking and screaming to tackle these problems. All they do at the moment is blame the states. The Howard government’s approach to dealing with the crisis in the Murray-Darling is simply to blame the states. We need to accept that our society has made silly decisions in the past. We need to understand that there are crops being grown in the Murray-Darling Basin that should never have been established there. It is absurd that Australia is growing rice. When is our next monsoon? It is inappropriate for us to be growing these kinds of crops. Water is massively overallocated and is misused as a result, because not only are we using too much water but it is being used for crops that are inappropriate because they are extremely thirsty kinds of crops. It is not going to be easy to address these problems; it is not going to be a simple matter. Quite clearly, it would be wrong and inappropriate for any government to simply march in and put ordinary farmers out of business. That, clearly, is unacceptable. Equally, it is unacceptable for farmers to expect that they are going to get 100 per cent, rolled-gold, universal compensation and that they will not be forced to bear any of the pain. The community is going to have to bear some pain. Governments, state and federal, are going to have to bear some pain. It is only reasonable that farmers also will have to bear some pain. What they need to understand is that, if that pain is not borne, ultimately none of us have a future; ultimately the future for Australian agriculture is dire. Salinity, the misuse of water and gradual environmental degradation will destroy the very lifeblood of Australian agriculture, for which the Murray-Darling Basin is the hub. We cannot make these changes overnight, but they have to be undertaken. That requires some serious political courage and an acceptance across the board that there is going to be pain and difficulty. Farmers involved in this have to be treated with fairness and dignity, but they are not entitled to Rolls Royce treatment. In my electorate, I have very large numbers of textile, clothing and footwear industries. I have more TCF establishments than any other member of parliament in this place, in spite of the fact that there have been enormous job losses and a substantial closure of factories in the electorate. Those changes occurred to benefit all Australians, to free up the market for the items of clothing and footwear that we all have to wear, and to ensure that we had more competition, lower prices, greater innovation and MAIN COMMITTEE better quality. There is a debate as to how much that has occurred, but I do not think that there is any doubt that there have been substantial improvements in that regard as a result of freeing up those markets. The people who lost out, the ordinary footwear, clothing and textile workers, including some in my electorate, did get some adjustment assistance-not enough, in my view. Some were able to get new jobs; many did not. But they were not compensated for the total loss of livelihood that they suffered. They received adjustment assistance and the same principle should apply in dealing with the problems in the Murray-Darling. If it is good enough for people on very low incomes working in textile, clothing and footwear factories to get retraining and adjustment assistance then the same principle should apply in respect of farmers in the Murray-Darling Basin if we are to save Australia’s environment and ensure that we have a future for our agricultural industries across the board and also for many communities to be able to access decent drinking water. There is an alternative that Labor leader Simon Crean has put on the table, and I am very proud to support that alternative as a major step forward for tackling these issues. It is a fundamentally important alternative which consists of the following commitments. A Labor government will restore, in our first term of office, 450 gigalitres of environmental flows, which will be enough to guarantee that the mouth of the Murray remains open-a small but significant step-and over 10 years we will commit to restoring environmental flows of 1,500 gigalitres, which is widely accepted as the minimum level required to restore the health of the river to a moderate level. This is seen by scientists as the absolute minimum necessary to revive the Murray-Darling system. Labor will also create the Murray-Darling Riverbank, which will be a bank of capital designed to fund the restoration of the Murray-Darling system with an injection of $150 million of capital to enable that to be funded. We will establish an environmental flow trust to manage environmental flows. There are some difficult and complex issues that the previous speaker alluded to about how you deal with the ups and downs of environmental flows, the differing levels in the river and differing rainfalls; there are some difficult issues that need to be addressed there. Labor will ensure that there is a sustainable future for irrigation agriculture by restoring the health of the river and that we have viable, long-term agricultural industries built in the Murray-Darling system. And we will commit to ending large-scale, indiscriminate land clearing, which is a significant contributor to the environmental problems in the system. And of course, more broadly and indirectly, a Labor government will ratify the Kyoto protocol. One of the things that always staggers me about the attitude of the government to the greenhouse issue and the Kyoto protocol is its blithe disregard of the potential negative impact of global warming on the agricultural industries that provide the heartland of support for its own side of politics. The CSIRO estimates that a negative or downside possibility for global warming by the end of this century could see the flows in the Murray-Darling system reduced by as much as 45 per cent. When you consider how overused they already are, contemplate the prospect of those flows being reduced as a result of global warming by 45 per cent and you have got an economic and an environmental disaster on your hands. And yet even though the CSIRO assesses this as a possibility-it is at the extreme end of possibilities-clearly we have to be deeply concerned about the prospect of global warming on the Murray-Darling system. The government regards that as some kind of illegitimate issue that it MAIN COMMITTEE is not particularly interested in and it refuses to sign the Kyoto protocol, which is not perfect but it is all there is and it is a major start to the world dealing with questions of global warming. We face a huge national challenge here, and it is the kind of challenge that only Labor governments are capable of dealing and grappling with. The Howard government is simply about ducking responsibility; it is about ensuring that somebody else tackles the problem in future years, even though that will guarantee that the problem will be much worse and much harder to deal with. Labor is prepared to take the difficult decisions. Labor is prepared to confront the difficult problems. Labor is prepared for the challenges that lie ahead to save the Murray-Darling. The commitment that Simon Crean has put forward in his budget reply speech two weeks ago is the first and most important instalment in ensuring that we as a nation can save our agricultural heartland, our environmental heartland; that those vital river flows are there for everybody, to sustain our agriculture; that the communities relying on the system for drinking water are able to continue to do so; and that we have a healthy natural environment which we can all enjoy and benefit from. I conclude by returning to the question of the Snowy River. We have to learn from our mistakes. However great the Snowy scheme may have been, however great an engineering achievement it was, however great a set of economic opportunities it generated, it still involved significant mistakes-the most important of those being the degradation of the Snowy River. We need to recognise that there is a limit to the extent to which we can exploit the environment without seriously degrading it and therefore killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. That is the great lesson from the Snowy debacle, and we have to now apply that lesson to the Murray-Darling system as a whole. The Snowy River is finally being given a chance of life again, courtesy of the Bracks and Carr governments and the great work of Craig Ingram. We as a community should learn from that lesson and understand that we have to take a similar approach with the Murray-Darling system and that the future of our nation depends on tackling this problem. Water is Australia’s number one national security issue. For all of the attention that is legitimately paid to threats of terrorism, to war in Iraq and to the threat of other nations, water remains our number one national security issue. That is what we have to address. This legislation is important because it follows through on commitments directed at tackling that issue but is of little real credit to the government because it is pursuing commitments that have been driven at a state level by state Labor governments. But at least these things are happening; they are an important start. I commend the legislation to the parliament, and I look forward to the day when a Labor government will be implementing our commitments to return decent environmental flows to the Murray-Darling system and to ensure that we have a sustainable future for our agriculture, our people living inland and our major cities. It will ensure that we operate our water systems on a sustainable and intelligent basis, we stop abusing them, we stop overusing them and our environmental footprint on this fragile land is sustainable.

We face a situation with our environment, our water flows, of a much greater magnitude, yet very little in relative terms and in real terms is being done. I find that quite staggering. Some might ask why I am standing here today discussing this issue, particularly given that I represent an outer metropolitan electorate. It is very far away from the mouth of the Murray River at Goolwa; it is a very long way away. My electorate is noted not so much for irrigation issues but much more for the number of houses there and the number of people who shift there each year. So why would I have an interest in this issue? The reason is that I served on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage, which examined this substantive issue in 2000-01. It was an excellent committee, and its recommendations are contained in two bipartisan reports: Co-ordinating catchment management and Public good conservation. Mr Ian Causley, the member for Page, was an excellent chair of the committee. He is not someone whom you would have thought would have been saying that we have got to fix this issue and do something about the wastage of water. This committee came up with two great reports that recommended that substantial and dramatic action be taken. What has happened? The first report, Public good conservation: our challenge for the 21st century, was tabled on 27 September 2001. It has had no response. The Co-ordinating catchment management: report of the inquiry into catchment management report was tabled on 26 February 2001. It has also had no response. What does that indicate about the government’s priorities on this issue? Our nation is, in effect, rotting beneath us. A white plague is drifting through the Murray and destroying it. That was addressed in these reports. They identified this issue as a matter of national urgency. They spoke about the implementation of an environment levy. A bipartisan committee-members from both sides of the parliament-recommended that urgent action be taken, that a national summit be convened and that a national authority to address issues like water property rights et cetera. What has actually happened? The government has not even responded to these reports. What does that say about the government’s priorities on this particular issue? I think it is a disgrace. Members of that committee flew over the Murray and saw the scenes of devastation. They heard that people from Adelaide were not going to be able to drink water from the Murray two days out of five because of the salinity problem. Yet they saw that the government took no concrete action to address these concerns and did not even bother to respond to the reports. What does that indicate about the government’s priorities and commitment towards fixing this issue? The committee took evidence from the retiring Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, Ted Evans. He said that two issues were of the greatest structural threat to budgets now and in the future. The first was the environment and the second was defence. When we touched on the issue of the environment-and I subjected Mr Evans to fairly intense questioning-he said that there were two ways of fixing this problem. One was implementing a levy, because the expenditure was going to have to be so great. The other was making the consumer pay. Either way someone will have to pay. Either the taxpayer will pay and enable the government to raise money to seriously address the issue of salinity-which is touched on in this bill-or we will have to pass the costs on and increase food prices, which was what Mr Evans effectively conceded. MAIN COMMITTEE I turn to some of the estimated costs of fixing this issue. I have heard some people talk about the Natural Heritage Trust and I will discuss that a bit later on. The CSIRO estimated that the cost of fixing salinity in our soils would be $100 billion. We have heard some of the speakers talk about the fact that we have expended $1.4 billion on the Natural Heritage Trust. Yet the CSIRO, one of its own agencies, says that it will cost $100 billion. In a joint report the ACF and the NFF talked about $60 billion. These are people who do not go around creating figures for the fun of it. They are saying it will cost $60 billion. So the CSIRO says $100 billion, and the NFF and the ACF say $60 billion. I hear speakers from the other side talk about the rights of property owners, and I accept that that is a legitimate concern. But of graver concern is that, if this issue is not fixed, we are not going to be discussing property rights because there will not be any usable properties to have rights over. That is the atmosphere that must be considered. There is a sense of crisis that has been consistently ignored. Words are being said, but commitments are not being made. We are running out of time to make solid commitments, solid expenditures and solid programs. Notwithstanding the shortcomings of our Constitution, it is time to come together in a national forum to address this concern. Labor has consistently indicated that COAG should be the vehicle to fix this particular issue. It examined it in 1994 but, obviously, it was not of sufficient concern. There has to be a national summit about these particular issues-water catchments and salinity. It has to be undertaken, and it has to be undertaken now. As I said, the one thing we do not have, and this was touched on by the member for Melbourne, is time to get political about this. One person on one side of the chamber talks about property rights and we talk about the fact that we need something done. We need something done. The time for semantics on this issue is over. If you talk to the people on that committee who were there, they effectively said the same thing-and they were members of both sides of the House. Having said that, I will touch on the particular aspects of the bill. The basis of this is an agreement and deal between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria to allocate an additional 70 gigalitres per annum in environmental flows for the Murray River and to improve the environmental outcomes for the rivers in the Kosciuszko National Park. A key element of the arrangement is the absence of adverse consequences for irrigators’ water entitlements, South Australia’s water security, water quality or existing environmental flows. The agreement has been subjected to extensive consultation and it enjoys a high level of support. It is a first step. It is long overdue. We obviously support this bill and we do so out of necessity. But it is a start. As I said, we conduct this debate as though we are in a vacuum. We are not in a vacuum. The starting point has been too long in the making, too limited in vision and, therefore, too meagre in the delivery. We on this side believe that the bill does not go far enough. It is piecemeal and goes only part of the way to addressing the serious concerns that I have delineated, and it leaves all the other problems-salinity, vegetation loss and sustainable land usefor another day, another government, another generation and another group of taxpayers. And it is based on blind faith that creating markets will solve all environmental problems. The tragedy is that in this House we, like the Australian people, know that there are problems. As I have said before, this House is also aware that two reports were tabled and that the government has not responded to those reports. On a personal note, we flew over the Murray-Darling MAIN COMMITTEE Basin. I was struck, in flying over that very fragile river, by how much we are obliged to this generation and future generations to ensure that it is protected, enhanced and developed. We cannot continue to exist in an atmosphere of complacency. I will touch on some of the issues that we addressed in the report. In Western Australia, Victoria and the western suburbs of Sydney, salinity is undermining houses, buildings and infrastructure. Some 60 per cent of the urban area of Wagga Wagga is at risk from highly saline watertables rising by half a metre a year. About 20,000 kilometres of major road and 1,600 kilometres of railways are in regions of high salinity risk. By 2050, this will increase to 52,000 kilometres of road and 3,600 kilometres of railways-meaning that salinity will erode the roads and railways to the point where we may not be able to use them. If we continue to do as we do now, by 2050 two million hectares of remnant vegetation and associated ecosystems will be under threat from salinity. The Great Barrier Reef is under threat, as is biodiversity in each state. Species disappear each day. According to the New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation, salinity is of concern in Western Sydney, Wagga Wagga and many other towns in central, western and southern New South Wales, including Blayney, Boorowa and a list of others that I will not read out now. Already in the Macquarie River west of the Great Dividing Range, about 630 ute loads of salt pass Narromine every day. In Western Australia, land affected by salinity will increase to 32 per cent of agricultural land within several decades. Environment Australia advised the committee that lost agricultural production as a result of salinity has been estimated to cost $130 million annually. Damage to infrastructure costs another $100 million annually, and loss of environment assets costs a further $40 million annually. Other estimates placed the cost of salinity alone, without including other difficult to quantify costs, at $335 million per annum. In April 2000, the ACF and the NFF estimated the annual cost of environmental degradation to be about $2 billion. We see the problem, but what does it mean? In the Murray-Darling Basin agricultural production is valued at about $10 billion per annum-that is approximately 40 per cent of the gross value of Australia’s agricultural production. Tourism and the recreation industry in the Murray-Darling Basin are valued at about $3.44 billion. The Productivity Commission found that soil erosion and run-off from fertilisers and chemicals pose a significant threat to the Great Barrier Reef, particularly the inner reefs. Tourism fuelled by the Great Barrier Reef, under threat from the run-off of inappropriate agriculture, is worth about $4.2 billion per annum and employs some 47,600 people. What is actually being done about the run-off? Nothing. In 1991-92 in the Murray-Darling Basin there were some 3,280 manufacturing locations, which employed over 62,400 people, with sales of produce goods exceeding $10.75 billion or 6.4 per cent of the Australian total. Look at the magnitude and the scale of production and its meaning to Australia. In the 1996 census, the Murray-Darling Basin had a population of almost two million people, almost 11 per cent of the total Australian population. Outside the Murray-Darling Basin, another one million Australians are heavily dependent on the River Murray for their water supply. None of these figures take into account the many millions of Australians living in the suburbs of our major cities whose jobs in manufacturing, office work, and light and heavy industry depend indirectly upon the health of the rural environment. This is why this issue must be of concern to urban members like me, notwithstanding my commitment to and participation in the environment and heritage committee. MAIN COMMITTEE We believe that there has not been significant action undertaken. Half of the profit in 199697 from Australian agriculture was generated from irrigated production systems. Surface water allocations-and this is quite critical-and use in Australia’s eastern breadbaskets, coastal Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, exceeded sustainable flows. In fact, water extracted for irrigation between 1985 and 1997 increased by 76 per cent-in just 12 years. Of the 12,000 gigalitres flowing into the Murray-Darling Basin, 10,000 gigalitres are used for irrigation, and it is not returned. Eighty per cent of all agricultural production comes from less than one per cent of the total area used for agriculture and pastoralism. I believe that this bill is a chronicle of lost opportunities. It shows that the present system is cumbersome and too vulnerable to being held ransom to the brinkmanship of whoever is the Prime Minister of the day and people who will not take responsibility for exercising national leadership on this particular issue. It is at best an interim solution, which leaves the real work to later generations when the damage has already been done and the solutions are much more difficult to implement. The bill fails to address the underlying policy issue that confronts us: how the states and the Commonwealth will work together to develop a coherent national policy. The bill is a start but it is not enough. It is symptomatic of the inability of the Howard administration to develop nation-building and nation-sustaining policy and plan rationally for the future. What have they actually done? Launching the NAP, Our vital resources: a national action plan for salinity and water quality, the Prime Minister said: Most Australians will accept that this is one of the most significant ... environmental challenge and natural resource management challenge that this country has. And what is needed is a national plan, flowing from Commonwealth leadership but working closely with the states and with local communities ... Since that, what have they done? The Auditor-General found irregularities, questionable administration and ineffective allocation processes in the operation of the Natural Heritage Trust. The Howard administration has reduced funding for every year of the operation of the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. The Howard administration has reduced expenditure on the environment collectively over the past four years. After seven years of the Howard government administration, there has been little progress in real terms, particularly given the problems that I have detailed. Under the national water reform agenda, land clearing continues at unacceptable levels, water quality continues to decline and there is no national approach to ensure ecologically sustainable use of Australia’s catchment system. Again, in terms of their priorities, why haven’t they responded to this report that I have tabled? In finishing my contribution in this debate, what needs to be done? The major recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage reports that we need to integrate water management with land use into a properly funded and coherent policy. The committee noted in Co-ordinating catchment management that the expectation within the community is that legislators will act sooner rather than later, decisively rather than timidly. Australians want the talking to stop about this issue and the action to begin. Furthermore, they do not want a piecemeal approach but a national approach, coordinated at a national level and founded upon a national policy to which all stakeholders should subscribe and in which all Australians have the opportunity to participate. MAIN COMMITTEE We need to stop the piecemeal approach to this particular issue. We need to get serious. We need to seize the opportunities that the present situation offers and move catchment use from the unsustainable to the sustainable. We need a national plan, national leadership and a national catchment authority that coordinates and fosters all facets of catchment management across Australia, across all levels of government and all parts of society, and that does so through existing agencies, institutions and community groups. Even the Prime Minister has acknowledged this. In launching our vital resources National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality in Australia, the Prime Minister said: Most Australians will accept that this is one of the most significant, if not the most significant environmental challenge and natural resource management challenge that this country has. And what is needed is a national plan, flowing from Commonwealth leadership but working closely with the states and with local communities ... And since then he has done nothing. We need to adopt better water management policies. At present too much water is used on agricultural activities that are environmentally unsustainable. The present approaches are not only poor environmental management but also poor economics. We need to reform not only water usage practices but also land use practices and the way we value land use. One major change that we need to make is to stop thinking that the market will solve everything. Professor Peter Cullen, who supports water trading, added this particular warning: We are seeing water being privatised, we’re starting to see the emergence of what people call water barons, who are buying water up from the market place and you can see an image where all water is controlled by a couple of big businessmen and we have a lot of peasant farmers who are dependent on it. ... We cannot afford to just let the market run wild and say we’ll fix the problems at a later date. We haven’t proved capable of doing that with say the media laws, so let’s not get into the same mess with the water laws. Markets fail in the delivery of a nationally imperative issue like this. We can see the consequences of this. I will finish at the starting point. We face a national crisis. It is up to us to determine whether or not we as legislators exercise the collective will to address this particular issue. If not-and we are debating what happens with a further Murray-Darling rescue package which is piecemeal at best-we will not only have our generation to answer to but future generations as well. put forward to amend the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1993 and to give effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria on the new arrangements for sharing water in this catchment. It removes references to the Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Authority that is in the Snowy Mountains agreement that looks at increasing water flows in New South Wales and Victoria. This amendment is supported by the federal Labor Party and also by the participating state governments, but it does not go far enough. We really need to find funds to pump into saving the river now. If we do not, then Adelaide is going to continue to be short of drinking water and there will be other environmental issues concerned with that state’s river systems. We have to start now to develop a national water policy to ensure that there is an adequate and sustainable supply of water in rural and regional Australia.

318,Mr Adams (Lyons) (11.32 A.m.),"The Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002 isweather patterns much better than we do now, and we need to try and make use of natural events to store water for times when the supply of water is short. First of all, we certainly need to help the Murray River. I am a member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, which is undertaking an inquiry into water in Australia, especially regional water. One of the issues that we have come across that needs to be addressed is the need to break away from having committees and groups right through to premiers and prime ministers looking at the Murray-Darling Basin. We have to somehow get some honest brokers and break down the situation whereby the people who sit on these things either represent the states that they come from or the Commonwealth position. As I said, I think we need to get some honest brokers. I do not know whether we could get a group of people from Tasmania, Western Australia, the ACT and the Northern Territory to be independent of those who are looking after their own interests. That might be too much to hope for. Tasmanians, of course, always play that honest broker role. We need to pick people with good credentials, good expertise and no vested interests in anything other than finding solutions to this problem of the Murray-Darling Basin so that we can move forward. There is so much science now available. A lot of very good people have put a lot of work into this area, and we should be moving much further forward than we have in the last two years. I would think that we are two or three years behind where we probably should have been in some of the decisions in this area. The inquiry I am working on is seeking a lot of information in relation to understanding water evaporation and new sources of water. One of those, of course, is the reuse of some of the grey water in Australia. We do not seem to do that very well, whereas other parts of the world do. In Queensland the Brisbane City Council has to spend, I think, $200 million to meet new environmental standards for grey water that they put into Moreton Bay. I am sure you would understand that, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay. There is a nation building plan to take that water back to the Lockyer Valley and even over the tops of the ranges to the Darling Downs to put water back into those two areas. This will of course cost a lot more than $200 million, and we really need the federal government to stand up and start to be counted in this sort of nation building. The farmers in the Lockyer Valley have told me that they are quite willing to pay fair and reasonable prices for this sort of water. There are great opportunities like this to do something major-a way of doing things differently in Australia. Aquifers pose a special problem, and they have not received much attention until recently. The Salisbury City Council in South Australia are being innovative in the way they use the city’s underwater storage of grey water. They pull out that water and recycle it into their parks, gardens and sporting ovals when they need it. They find that any pathogens that might be in that water are dead within a couple of days of going underground. So very interesting and innovative work is going on in the City of Salisbury, and I congratulate the city council for taking those opportunities. Through state legislation in Australia we do not allow any recycled water to re-enter rivers or creeks. This may be the right way to go or it may be something we need to revisit and put modern thinking into. Many countries reuse grey water to grow vegetables and fruits in places where water is at a premium, and this is the lifeblood of many small farmers in other parts of the world. In Australia, on the other hand, we are very extravagant users of water. In my state MAIN COMMITTEE of Tasmania, in particular, we are so used to having water freely at our disposal that we have tended to be pretty wasteful in the past, but we are starting to work on that. Most areas now have meters for home usage, except some of the bigger cities in the south which still need to tackle that problem. Bringing farmers up to best practice and using water more efficiently is not as easy as we might think it is. I have been told by several people that, with the methods used in irrigation today, some of that water runs back into the rivers through the water table, underground rivers and other ways. By improving the delivery system to slow drip or modern technologies such as modified pivot systems, we will be putting less water back into the rivers, not more. Therefore, although the farmers are being more efficient, there needs to be a way of decreasing each farmer’s allocation of water without detriment and using the saved water to increase the environmental flows. Then no-one loses: the farmers have to pay less for water and the river benefits from the additional water. But this is not an easy concept to sell. The farmers have been worried that any changes to water supply will affect their ability to farm. However, providing their needs are dealt with and they are assisted to improve their irrigation methods, everybody should be able to gain from this. Change is always difficult. We should be looking at the way we have restructured other industries. The restructuring of rural industries in the use of water needs to be dealt with as a new model or concept. I think there is some work being done in that area. When we are dealing with environmental equations, we must factor in the social effects they may have, particularly on families who live in the rural and regional areas. We do not want to depopulate inland Australia. There are several things to achieve. One is to move farming back from the river and to use the best soils in the most productive areas, while reducing farming and irrigation in some of the less productive areas with less arable soils. People thought that the market for water might achieve some of these things, but this is much harder to achieve than many people thought some years ago. I believe that it is going to be very difficult to do that because of the way we move water and the ageing infrastructures that are in place. A lot of the old infrastructure in Australia needs to be renewed. Pratt industries have put up the idea of piping water and moving away from the old canal system, which may help, but there needs to be much more flesh on the bones of Mr Pratt’s ideas so we can see what is being proposed. We are going to face many changes in the way we farm in Australia. One example comes from my electorate. I am told there is a farmer growing feed using two double garages. He waters seeds of oats and barley and when they get a green shoot, after several days, he uses that to feed a number of deer which run on a very small acreage. He uses that feed on a continuous basis to maintain his deer and to fatten them for the market-using a very small acreage, but a whole new concept. Australia will need to face up to those changes in the future. The use of grey water has been demonstrated in my electorate. In 1995 I was fortunate to take Prime Minister Keating to the Pittwater Golf Course, which is in southern Tasmania, not far from the Hobart airport, where an economic solution was put forward regarding the problems of cleaning up the blooms in the Pittwater lagoon and the lack of water to irrigate the golf course. The algae was blooming and dying, causing a terrible smell for the residents of the suburb, and the golf club was losing members because of this. It was tragic. The blooming problem was caused because the area was a very shallow lagoon and water from a sewerage MAIN COMMITTEE plant put a high level of nutrients into it. By allowing more water to flow into the lagoon through the tidal flow and removing the grey water from the sewerage works into collecting ponds and then diverting that water out to other ponds which were going to be used by the golf course, it was possible to supply the golf course and local farmers with very much needed nutrient rich water. I have been following this issue for some time and I am pleased that this outcome has been so successful. The Orielton lagoon is a Ramsar site, and this was declared during the time when I was state minister for national parks in Tasmania. Things do not happen in a hurry, and sometimes environmental thoughts on these things go back to the late 1970s and early 1980s. I am very pleased to have played a part in maybe solving a problem and setting up something for the long term. The golf club uses this water. It sprays it of a night because golfers pick up and handle their balls and therefore if there was a lot of water about they may pick up something from that. The club has taken that into consideration when using the water. This has certainly improved things enormously. The golf course has become a lot greener with a lot more fairway trees and shrubs. Membership is growing now, and it has been a great opportunity and a great thing to happen there. In relation to some of the farmers, only recently I took some South Sea Island politicians to show them reuse of this grey water in the area. A farmer I have known for 30 years is now using this water for seed production. We still have issues in Australia whereby we do not use this water straight onto a vegetable crop; there are consumer issues that might come out of that. But a lot of seed for cauliflower, cabbage and many other vegetable crops is grown in my electorate. By drip-feeding this water in an apricot orchard onto the base of the trees, they put it straight into the root system and it does not touch the fruit itself. Those things are working very well and it is a win-win situation for everybody. The next project using grey water is likely to come from the Hobart scheme, where very soon water will be flowing into the next valley, the Cole River Valley, which takes in the township of Richmond, which is a beautiful tourist town on the outskirts of Hobart in my electorate. It will increase the ability to have further production in that beautiful valley, especially seed production. We have another project on the drawing board at the moment which is also extremely important, and that is the Meander Dam. That is also in my electorate. We are doing a lot with water around Tasmania. Today in Parliament House the state government minister and members are meeting to put forward the economic and environmental case for the establishment of that dam. This project will enable another valley in Tasmania to maximise the use of water while ensuring that environmental flows are maintained-and increased in this case, if anything, when the river is most under pressure. The project has been on the drawing board for over 70 years. I met a woman who is 85 and her brother who is 79, and the brother left school as a nine-year-old and was going to get a job building this particular dam. I hope that during the next 12 months this dam will come into play, some 70 years later. It has been on the drawing board for 70 years and it is only now that people are beginning to understand the worth of such a project, both environmentally and economically. Knowing the amount of water that you have to deal with is half the battle. Indeed, Tasmanians are learning the hard way that water is not infinite and that actions have to take place to ensure that water is available for the future. It does not matter where you are in Australia, water is imporMAIN COMMITTEE tant, and Tasmania is no exception to that. We are beginning to value our water more and to understand what it means to other states too. The Murray-Darling has become an icon for the issue of water restoration, and we want to assist in getting it back to health. This amendment bill does little to really improve the water situation in the Murray-Darling, as it does not follow up with a whole strategy for water issues in the nation. If you add to it some restructuring in the agriculture industry and providing funds for research and incentives to help farmers make much needed adjustments to their farming practices and to help restructure some communities, then we can start. We really have to start now, and we have pledged that a future Labor government would provide the funds to get on with the job. I know we are not there at the moment, but work that is being undertaken-like that of the House parliamentary committee-will be useful in helping all parties develop sensible policies while opening up avenues to possible research. While I support the bill, it really does not touch the problem. Hopefully this government can revise its direction once the report of the committee that I am sitting on is finalised. I hope that it will take some notice of the findings and recommendations in that report and maybe move forward. The Labor Party have established our policy with Riverbank and a pledge of $150 million. This country really needs some vision and a national approach from the Howard government, but I am of the opinion that we will probably need a future Labor government to really make things happen. Amendment Bill 2002, continuing from where I left off in my speech on the budget, which is most relevant to what is taking place here today. I mentioned the era of Mr Whitlam, with the 25 per cent tariff cut across the board-and I will relate this to the Murray-Darling legislation in one moment. I spoke about Mr Fraser with his monetarism: monetary growth had to equal goods and services growth, and that meant that the government withdrew from developmenpolitics. I think that most people in the ALP would agree with that comment. There was his corporatism, his laissez-faire capitalism, the rule of law being replaced by the rule of fang and claw, and the abolition of all government presence in the marketplace. To paraphrase Chalmers Johnson, who wrote the quintessential book on the Japanese economic miracle, we had a policy in Japan of developmentalism while in other countries we had regulatory industrial policies. Now Australia does not even have a regulatory regime, as the Coles-Woolworths phenomenon shows. That brings me to the Murray-Darling. You may ask why this country is going bad. Last night in my speech in the parliament, I gave a breakdown to show that real incomes for the average Australian have fallen by a whopping amount-over $8,000. That is huge when one considers that an average income is, in monetary terms, about $40,000. So Australians have gone backwards. Why have they gone backwards? In the speech yesterday, I mentioned the economic reasons for this disaster, but today we are dealing with the other reasons for this disaster. Our dairy herd is down 15 per cent, our cattle herd is down 10 per cent and our sheep numbers are down over 30 per cent. Obviously, wheat production is almost non-existent as a result of the drought, but who knows what the overall, long-term effects of the wheat situation are going to be? Sugar is down 10 or 15 per cent. MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Unesco The United Nations Educational Scientific And Cultural Organisation Has Pre

320,Talism. Then We Had The Onrush Of Mr Keating,"truly a great disaster of recent AustralianWhat is happening here is that agriculture is closing down. In a fit of rage, when we deregulated the dairy industry, I said that in 10 years this country would be a net importer of food. Having shot off at the mouth, I did mean that in a metaphorical sense. I did not mean to say 10 but that is the number I used. I went to the library to face the music and find out what the true figure was. I found out that I was wrong and that the country would not be a net importer of food in 10 years; the country would be a net importer of food in nine years. In nine years time, Australia-the greatest food-producing nation on earth-would be a net importer of food. It would not be able to feed itself. We have all these lovely assurances from the minister, but three years ago the sugar industry got assurances that it was not going to be deregulated. Yesterday the ALP in the Queensland state parliament, under a negotiated agreement with the federal government-with Mr Truss as the architect-deregulated that industry. Three years ago the industry was given an undertaking that it would not be reviewed again for six years. In return for that promise it took a tariff abolition-which was extremely damaging to the industry. So much for politicians’ promises. Today we are assured: firstly, allocations of water to environment must not adversely impact on irrigators; secondly, allocations must not adversely impact on the rights and interests of the state of South Australia; thirdly, the commercial viability of the Snowy scheme will be maintained; fourthly, water for environmental flows will be sourced principally from verified water savings; and lastly, water for environment flows cannot be consumed. It must flow through the river system to the sea. This is a pretty good trick. We are going to commit ourselves to all of those undertakings, and yet we are going to increase the flow in the river by 28 per cent. Maybe there is some sort of magic out there that I do not understand, but there is no way in the world-even if we were to put the water into pipelines and installed 20,000 kilometres of canals. And there are fewer than 20,000 kilometres of diversion channels in the Murray-Darling system. Even if we were to do that, we would end up with less than five per cent savings. We all know that is never going to happen. Even if we did that, we are talking about five per cent, not 28 per cent. We are being told one thing by Mr Truss and, right at this very moment, the New South Wales cabinet has three discussion papers: one saying five per cent reduction awarded to farmers, one saying a 10 per cent reduction of water to farmers and one saying 15 per cent. So if we take a 10 per cent reduction in the water going to farmers, that means a 10 per cent reduction in their gross production. For anyone familiar with farming, if you are making a 20 per cent or 30 per cent profit on your gross income, you are doing very well indeed. What we are talking about here is about a 30 per cent or maybe 40 per cent cut to the net income for farmers in New South Wales. The statements are positively misleading. I will get up here and say that, because history indicates and will clearly prove that the farmers are going to lose their water. If we were to build a monument in this country, the monument should be built to the people who created the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. I look at it with awe. It is one of the greatest achievements that this country has ever achieved. It was regarded as one of the eight engineering wonders of the world when it was completed. It enabled us to produce nearly one-tenth of the power for the golden triangle of Adelaide to Sydney and northern New South Wales. The electricity was produced for free, forever, under that scheme. Here was a MAIN COMMITTEE scheme that turned a barren wilderness into a place where beautiful cities existed. I have been to some of those cities and they are wonderful places. What a magnificent achievement: land that was thought to be wasteland was found only to be land wasted. What we get paid for in this place is to sometimes show a tiny little bit of moral courage. When the media is out there baying and screaming for your hide over some issue and the media does not know what they are talking about you should have the courage to stand up and state the truth. I, of all people, was the only member of parliament who went to all of the seminars, forums and public addresses on the Murray-Darling system. AndI have none of the Murray-Darling system in my electorate. I am from one of the few country electorates in Australia that does not have any of the Murray-Darling in it, and yet I went to all of those meetings. At the conclusion of the last one I said, ‘We’ve been hearing this now for the last 12 months to two years. What do we do: go and slit our wrists?’ The reply was, ‘No, you haven’t been listening to what I’ve been saying here. If we put five per cent of the cleared areas back under a deep-rooted plant such as a tree or lucerne then clearly you would again lower the watertable. But every farmer has to do this.’ If your worry is that the Murray is lacking in flows, the vast bulk of the tributaries and the main river system of the Murray-Darling-and I include the Darling here-actually ceased to flow in days past on a fairly regular basis. It ceases to flow now, but it ceased to flow then as well. We wonder what exactly is going on here. If you say, as Dr Kemp has said, that we cannot clear any more land in Queensland and that we are down to 0.5 per cent and that is all that is available to us, then you are saying we cannot enhance our land, we cannot improve our land and we cannot increase the productivity of our land. That is what you are saying to us. You are saying, ‘You are frozen where you are now forever.’ What sort of primitive landscape Luddites are running amok in this place and in this government and in the state governments of Australia? The manufacturing sector under these brainless policies simply collapsed in this nation, going from some $36 billion to $86 billion in imports. We took a hit on the current account, on the income of this nation, of $50 billion a year on the stupidity of these free trade policies. As far as agriculture goes, the last time. I looked at the figures, albeit some time ago, within nine years we are going to be net importers of food. But even if you want to take a 20year or 30year time frame you will find that imports will increase about 600 per cent and exports will increase about 300 per cent. Clearly, this country cannot survive in agriculture against the massive subsidies-the over 60 per cent average subsidy, and increasing-in the OECD; it cannot sell profitably in Australia because of Woolworths and Coles, the only two companies to sell to; and it cannot compete against Third World countries where people work for nothing. On top of that, we are talking about no more land clearing in Queensland, which means we cannot increase our production anywhere at all. There is not a single farmer on the Queensland coastline that does not believe that the area he has under production at the present moment is not going to be cut back. So all we can look forward to is a gradual decline in agricultural production in this country. Having run cattle for all of my adult life, I can tell you that if you cannot clear some trees you cannot improve the pasture of the land. Anyone who thinks there is going to be some massive wholesale clearing in Queensland believes in the tooth fairy. It costs about $200 to $300 a hectare to clear land-the last time. I had a quote, anyway. MAIN COMMITTEE We are talking about land worth about $20 a hectare. Only the greatest fool would be out there clearing land. It is not land that loans itself to cultivation. If it were down in the southern part of the state I would say yes, but all of that land has been cleared. Anyone who wants to cultivate has already cleared land and is cultivating it at this very moment. But where they did clear land in Queensland-and we are talking about land clearing as well as the reduction in water for farmers-they had the Brigalow scheme. Some of my relatives-young men who had no hope of getting anywhere in life-suddenly won a ballot. One of them lived in a shed for eight years of his life with his wife and kids. They wereuntil recent years-very wealthy and prosperous people. I thought, ‘What a wonderful achievement we have here. What an absolutely fantastic achievement.’ But nature does not stand still. If you think that by withdrawing the water rights from these farmers in the Murray-Darling Basin you are somehow going to make the Australian landscape more wonderful than it is at the present moment, then you simply do not understand agriculture. The very sad thing in this country is that the decisions being made on water are being made by people who live in the concrete pleasure domes of Sydney and Melbourne. The people who love the landscape and the bush and who live in it are the people on the land. That is why they live there. Most of them are reasonably intelligent people who could make a very good living wherever they went. Some of them are very bright people indeed who could make a much better living. The only explanation for them living in the middle of nowhere is that they love the Australian bush. That is why they are there. There is a great bumper sticker that says: ‘No matter how much you say you love my land, I love it 10,000 times more.’ That is the absolute truth. We are dealing here with people who do not understand what they are doing. They do not understand the economic ramifications of what they are doing to this country-a country that not only has taken a hit of $8,500 in average incomes, but also is now running a current account in the first half of this year of $42 billion. Yesterday I quoted both the present Prime Minister and the last Prime Minister. When the current account was $11 billion a year, one said that this country was in danger of becoming a banana republic and the other-the present Prime Minister-said that far and away the most overwhelmingly important problem that needs to be dealt with in this country is the balance of the current account. When he said that, it was $16 billion. It is now $42 billion. I quote no lesser persons than the leader of the nation, Mr Howard, and the former leader of the nation, Mr Keating. I quote their own words. They say this is the worse problem, yet here we are, cold-bloodedly deciding that we do not need agriculture. Half of Australia’s agricultural production comes from the Murray-Darling Basin. We are talking about taking 28 per cent of the water away from the farmers, regardless of the assurances that are given here-because they are a joke. Instead of moving forward, and instead of saying that we can enhance and protect the banks of our rivers in Queensland by taking water out of the rivers and putting irrigated pastures and tree plantations on the banks of those rivers, thus enhancing our landscape magnificently, we are saying, ‘You can’t take any water at all.’ We are not saying, ‘If we clear some of these trees, we can put improved pasture in.’ Near my home city of Cloncurry, turpentine trees have gotten right out of balance. No-one knows why or how-there are hardly any cattle in the area in which they grow. You need to wear very tough clothing these days to walk through most of the places where I ran as a kid. MAIN COMMITTEE Nature does not stand still; nature moves on. Down amongst our gullies, creeks and tiny waterways, there is a thick cover of buffel grass that stops those turpentine trees from getting away. The buffel grass is an introduced species. So, instead of all of that magnificent topsoil being torn up and ripped away into the Gulf of Carpentaria, it is kept and protected and we have massively greater numbers of native flora and fauna, such as kangaroos and everything else that follows from having that grass cover. We have the ability to make our land better. Those of you who read the Good Book from time to time will know that there is a story in there where some blokes were given a few quid. One bloke was given a hell of a lot, and he went out, took risks and made a hell of a big quid out of it. Another bloke was given a moderate quid, and he made a few quid out of it and did all right too. The other bloke said, ‘Oh, jeez, I might lose this money; I’d better go and hide it.’ What we are saying with this legislation is, ‘We are frightened to use this water: we might lose it, we might destroy this country. Do not clear the trees and do not make any changes, because we do not know what these changes will bring.’ I am very pleased that these landscape Luddites were not around when we were inventing the wheel, because they would have had all sorts of reasons why we could not change things. I come from an area-my homeland-where kangaroo numbers have probably increased 100or 1,000-fold with the coming of settlement and the coming of the cattlemen. When I first went up to the area, in the part where I owned a lot of country, there was a fire that went for 1,500 kilometres. That fire started near our property. It took every single tree out for 1,500 kilometres. There will never be another fire of that nature in that country because we have built fences, we have built fire plough lanes, we have gear and equipment and we volunteerwhen a fire occurs, all of us drop what we are doing and go off collectively to fight the fire. The fire regime that destroyed so much of our Australian flora and fauna will be no more. But how well are the naturalists, the national park people, the greenies, the environmentalists and the department of environment people looking after their land? Two million hectares south of Canberra have vanished. But our land is not vanishing, because we love it and we get out there actively and we cut fire ploughs, we do some moderate burns-as the first Australians used to-and mosaic burning from time to time as well when we get a dangerous buildup. We husband that resource because we understand the land. We know how to work with that land. Today, that wonderful resource that God gave this country, the Murray-Darling water system, has been taken away from the people of Australia and frozen forever. It is a very sad day indeed. (Time expired) reply-In summing up the debate on the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002, I thank the members who have contributed to it. There has been a long list of speakers, and that demonstrates the keen interest that there is in water issues in Australia and, indeed, in the future health of the Murray-Darling Basin system. These issues are especially highlighted in a time of drought. When there is a shortage of water, all Australians keenly focus on the importance of using our water wisely and well. I thank members who have made a contribution to the debate for the constructive way in which they have generally approached the issues. The debate did deteriorate towards the end, as the member for Kennedy, as is his wont, gave us another diatribe of doom and gloom.

The minister will be heard in silence. claims, even though it was proved to him two years ago that the statistics he was using were being completely misused and that he was dishonestly reflecting the situation regarding Australian food exports. To suggest that Australia, a country that exports two-thirds of all that we produce, will be a net importer of food in nine years time is completely erroneous. Of course we will have bad times. We have a drought at the present time, and that has meant that we are importing grain into this country-something we do very rarely. Those sorts of extraordinary circumstances will occur from time to time. But the reality is that Australian farmers are continuing to be increasingly productive, and our capacity to boost our exports remains substantial. I have no doubt that Australian farmers will not only continue to more than adequately provide for the variety of food needs of the Australian people but also have the capacity to increase their exports as the years go by. The member for Kennedy also threw around a stack of other statistics that were simply wrong. This is not a particularly important point, but the figure he gave about the percentage of production coming out of the Murray-Darling system was wrong. I do not know where on earth he got the idea that people were talking about having to cut back their use of water by 28 per cent. Even the extraordinary claims of the South Australian Premier would not require a cutback of 28 per cent. Certainly none of the proposals in relation to the Living Murray initiative talk about reductions in water use of anything like that magnitude. I needed to put a couple of those things on the record-not that it will have any impact on the member for Kennedy; he will go out and say the same kind of rubbish time and time again. But I think it is important that some of the facts be accurately reported so that there is at least some degree of balance. Many of the members who have spoken have-I think rightly-referred to the challenges facing the Murray-Darling Basin system at the present time. I cannot overstate the seriousness of the current water supply situation in the Murray-Darling Basin system. The ministerial council was told at its last meeting in Toowoomba a couple of weeks ago that the inflows into the Murray-Darling Basin system this year are 15 per cent lower than ever previously recorded. That has nothing to do with who is using too much irrigation water or whether there should be additional environmental flows; it is simply a fact of the drought. There has not been enough rain, and so the inflows are way below anything we have previously experienced. If we were to have a second year of below average rainfall, the whole Murray-Darling Basin system would move into completely uncharted territory. There would be severe difficulties in providing water just for urban supplies, let alone there being any capacity to meet the desires of the irrigators and other industrial users. Certainly the Murray-Darling Basin system is on a knife edge. There are real difficulties that we could confront in the season ahead if in fact the drought continues. Obviously we hope that the slightly improved weather conditions over recent months will flow on to significant rains across southern Australia and the situation will be eased. It is certainly too early to make statements about what the dire implications might be. MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Unesco The United Nations Educational Scientific And Cultural Organisation Has Pre

337,Mr Truss,"The member for Kennedy continues to run around the countryside with theseI think it is right that, at this stage, governments, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and others be cautious about allocations, to ensure that we do not have an even greater catastrophe in months ahead. I feel very much for the irrigators, especially in New South Wales but also in Victoria, about the cutbacks that they have had to face in their water allocations. In Victoria, where there has been a very conservative approach to water allocation, these cutbacks are almost without precedent. In New South Wales, in some areas, particularly in the southern parts of the state, the allocations of water have been very low. Some farmers have borrowed forward, so their prospects for the year ahead are especially gloomy. There is a risk that they may have to pay back water that they have borrowed. In a year when there is going to be a real risk of very low allocations, that puts enormous stress on that entire system. In spite of the short-term difficulties that we face, we need to also look at the longer term approach to the life and the health of the River Murray system. There is simply nothing that governments or new regulatory systems can do to address the drought. Frankly, if man had not intervened over the last 100 years or so, most of the River Murray would be completely dryyou would be able to walk across it, probably from Swan Hill down to the mouth. Without doubt, if man had not intervened, the Murray mouth would have closed at this time, just through simple natural forces and the movements of sand up and down the coast. It has only been the fact that we have been able to get in there with dredges that has essentially kept it open. Barrages are preventing the movement of the salted water further upstream than otherwise would happen. One wonders about the magnitude of the ecological disaster that would have occurred during this drought had there not been the interventions and the storage facilities that are in fact enabling the flow of water to go down the Murray-that simply would not happen if nature were acting alone. The fact that we are moving such a lot of water down to Lake Victoria to supply Adelaide’s needs has actually provided some bonus environmental benefits, with flooding of wetlands that are not often flooded. The quality of water that is being delivered to Adelaide is probably the best ever, because it is actually snow fed water coming out of Victoria and New South Wales. So there have been some unusual side benefits. The EC readings at Morgan are the lowest that have been recorded in ages. We need to keep those sorts of things in balance. There is a lot of talk about doom and gloom, and the system certainly faces threats, but the reality is that the intervention systems that have been put in place by the commission, funded by the Commonwealth and the states, are consistently reducing the salt loads in the river. We also have in place now a range of new engineering measures which will further reduce the salt loads in the system. I was present at Loxton over the weekend for the opening of a new irrigation scheme there which will significantly reduce the salt levels flowing into the Murray-Darling system from the irrigation users of Loxton. We have announced two new systems which between them will, from memory, reduce by about 50 EC units the salt levels going into the system. That and a number of the other systems that have been put in place are progressively improving the water quality in the river. In spite of what you might hear, the figures and the statistics speak for themselves: there has been a progressive improvement. It is slow, and a lot more needs to be done, but there is a genuine commitment to doing some things to ensure that this wonderful part of Australia’s ecosystem is effectively preserved and enhanced. MAIN COMMITTEE The Living Murray initiative is a major approach to addressing these issues for the future. I agree with those who have spoken previously about the importance of involving the community in that process. These decisions will not be easy. No-one should ever assume that, because the flows are being given to the environment, somehow or other they will just miraculously appear. The only way you can get bigger flows in the environment is to take the water away from something else. That means taking it away from cities and from irrigators and perhaps diverting it from one environmental purpose to another. These are difficult decisions that have to be made. In this process we need to examine and choose between perhaps 30,000 wetlands that we might like to flood in the Murray-Darling system. There is clearly not enough water to flood them all; nor would that be technically or even environmentally sensible. We are going to have to make choices about which areas are to be flooded. We are going to have to make decisions about whether the highest priority is a natural flushing out of the river mouth at Goolwa, whether we are going to have in place permanent or semi-permanent dredging arrangements there and use the environmental water for other purposes, whether there are systems that can be used to bring waters into the Coorong that make better use of the environmental flows that are potentially available and what priorities should be engaged. That is one side of it. The second part of the debate is clearly the question of where the water is going to come from. You have to be honest with people and ask, if you are making an assessment about a particular environmental flow, who is going to have to give up water to achieve those objectives and then-most importantly, if the community wants people to make that sacrificewhat compensation we are prepared to pay to those people who are being asked to make a sacrifice in the national interest. All of those issues need to be addressed honestly and fairly and the community must be told the upsides and downsides of these issues to effectively make decisions on them. minister to give way? ing about compensation, the rights of people and allocations, you, the Deputy Prime Minister and maybe the Prime Minister have spoken about the property right issue being recognised in the regional catchment blueprints.

343,Mr Truss,"That is a fairly involved and detailed question. Most of the plans that have sohave confidence that if they invest in water savings measures on their properties they will have sufficient access to water to be able to meet their obligations to the banks and others who are providing the funding. We can do a certain amount of that through the regional property plans, but a certain amount also needs to be addressed in the context of the Living Murray initiative. I think the COAG meeting that is coming up in August-September will be a critical turning point. I have to say that at the last Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council meeting there was stronger cooperation on this issue from the states than I have ever previously experienced-a willingness to address the parameters and a commitment to ensure that we have an appropriate regime in place as part of underpinning the security of the water supplies of the region. For the first time. I detected some movement from the states, and that was encouraging. I hope that the new ministers from New South Wales and Victoria in particular may provide some leadership in achieving a satisfactory outcome. In the couple of minutes that are left I will return to the key issues in the bill. Obviously these relate to amendments to the Murray-Darling Basin agreement that are designed to provide for accounting of water resources within Snowy Hydro Ltd, which will be obliged to release annually some amounts of water as a consequence of the corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electricity Authority which occurred on 28 June 2002. The amendments also delineate the Murray-Darling Basin Commission’s advisory role in the acquisition of River Murray and Snowy River environmental flows which will be provided as a consequence of the outcomes of the Snowy water inquiry. The amending agreement sets out arrangements for the management of the 70 gigalitres of River Murray environmental entitlements that the Commonwealth is funding, including the development of environmental objectives and a strategy for retaining and releasing the environmental entitlements. The Murray-Darling Basin amending agreement has been agreed by the Commonwealth government and the governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The amending agreement will also require the approval of the parliaments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia before it can be implemented. This particular bill is just one small piece of the jigsaw in addressing improved environmental flows and improved management of the water resources in the Murray-Darling Basin system. We have a lot of work yet to do. There is, I think, a spirit of cooperation in the community to achieve these sorts of objectives. Governments need to work, as other speakers have said, harmoniously together to endeavour to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Suggestions by some that the Constitution should be changed to give the Commonwealth total power over all of these issues might have some attraction from an efficient management perspective but are politically unrealistic. We need to work within the framework and the architecture that is available at the present time. The Commonwealth has a clear commitment to do that. We have put $4 billion on the table through the NHT and the NAP as part of our commitment to the Murray-Darling Basin to ensure that happens. We want to work not only with the state governments but also, most importantly, with local communities and landholders to achieve the very best possible outcomes for all of those Australians-something like two million people-who are dependent upon the resources of the Murray-Darling Basin system for their livelihood and for their social and cultural life. MAIN COMMITTEE I commend the bill to the House and I thank the opposition and others for their support for these proposals. The bill is likely to receive similar unilateral and bipartisan support in each of the state parliaments so that these important amendments can proceed. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. 2002 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 December 2002, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms GILLARD (Lalor) (12.33 p.m.)-I rise to outline Labor’s view on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2002. Clearly, given we are dealing with this bill in this chamber, Labor supports the bill. However, Labor does have a suggestion about improving the function of the bill, which I will outline in this contribution. This suggestion is for future consideration by the Howard government and does not affect matters to do with the processing of this bill. I also seek to take the opportunity to make some more general comments on matters related to the migration field before coming to the specifics of this bill. The heart of this bill deals with visa cancellation matters. Under the Migration Act 1958 a ground for visa refusal or cancellation is the character test. The character test is defined in section 501(6) of the act, and a person fails the character test if he or she has a substantial criminal record; he or she is associated with other persons or groups or organisations associated with criminal conduct; he or she has engaged in continuing criminal conduct; or there is a significant risk the person would engage in criminal conduct, harass or molest another person in Australia, vilify a segment of the community, or incite discord or represent a danger to the community. A person in Australia who has a visa cancelled as a result of failing the character test is entitled to challenge the cancellation in the Federal Court. This bill deals with the question of what information will or will not be available and how it can be used in those Federal Court proceedings. I will come to the details of those matters in due course. But, clearly, this bill is squarely about visa processing, how we deal with visa cancellation matters and how we deal with information in the course of those visa cancellation matters. As we know, the question of who gets to get a visa to be in Australia is not an easy one in the public debate in this country. I would cite in that regard the recent Four Corners report, which I believe presented disturbing images and testimony from a number of former employees of Australasian Correctional Management at the Woomera Detention Centre. As you would be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, clearly the purpose for detaining people is that they have sought to enter Australia unauthorised and they are seeking to make a visa application; in the ordinary course, the visa they are seeking is as a refugee. I am sure that those who witnessed the Four Corners report would have been distressed by what they saw. The program raised important allegations that go beyond the performance of ACM, the detention centre management, and go to the heart of government. The program conMAIN COMMITTEE tended that there were overpayments to ACM and that the local Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs manager knew and passed that information on to were raised with DIMIA centrally. The program contended that hundreds of incident reports dealing with suicide attempts, self-harm and, potentially, child abuse were lodged with If these allegations are true in whole or even in part, it means that the Howard government has provided what can only be seen as a management fiasco in relation to the Woomera Detention Centre and possibly more widely. It is no answer to these allegations for Minister Ruddock to say DIMIA will investigate itself; we need a full and independent judicial inquiry, and the Howard government must call one. If it continues to fail to do so, the only conclusion that can be reached is that the cover-up continues. If your record is clean and allegations are raised, the ordinary response would be to be happy to have those allegations investigated in the public domain because it gives you the opportunity to publicly clear your name. The fact that the government continues to refuse to hold an independent judicial inquiry can only lead to the assumption that it is afraid of what such an inquiry would find. As members of parliament are aware, Senate estimates is meeting today. In coming clean, the Howard government does not even have to wait for an inquiry to start; it could begin that process today at Senate estimates by releasing details of every payment ever made by DIMIA to ACM, by releasing details of every incident of self-harm and by allowing DIMIA staff stationed at Woomera during the period mentioned on Four Corners to speak to the media to test the veracity of claims that they were involved in any cover-up. Having started with that down payment on some form of accountability, the Howard government should then call an inquiry. I note claims by Senator Bob Brown yesterday that the Australian Federal Police are investigating this matter. As verified at Senate estimates last night, that is not true: the Australian Federal Police are having a preliminary investigation about having an investigation. That is not anywhere near good enough. We need the full and independent judicial inquiry for which Labor has called. I note that, at the time of the Four Corners allegations, Minister Ruddock dismissed them as outdated. Nothing could be further from the truth. As we stand here today, ACM remains in control of Australian detention centres. Why is that? That is because, even though the Howard government re-tendered the contract to manage Australia’s detention centres and selected another company, Group 4, to take over from ACM five months ago, the Howard government has been unable to conclude a contract with Group 4. This means that, at the moment, ACM is overholding the contract, knowing it will not be the contractor in the longer term. What do staff do in circumstances where they rightly fear that the new contractor will come in and their employment will be terminated? Those staff obviously do the rational thing: they look for other jobs. One of the key allegations in the Four Corners program was that there were not sufficient staff in detention centres to provide the appropriate care for the people detained. As we stand here today, as a result of Howard government bungling of the tender round, the situation in Australian detention centres is as follows. At Baxter, there are approximately 40 staff positions vacant, which is putting pressure on the 90 existing staff to work overtime to cover the vacancies. Employees at Baxter have been working 60-hour weeks for some time because of the lack of availability of staff. At the Perth detention centre, MAIN COMMITTEE employees are also working large amounts of overtime. At Villawood, some new trainees were recruited by ACM, even though ACM are shortly to lose the contract, because staffing levels had reached crisis point. Therefore, whilst Villawood might not be technically understaffed, with all of the uncertainty many staff are resigning and searching for new jobs and many are on sick leave as they have been working large amounts of overtime. At one stage, 15 officers resigned from Villawood in one fortnight-that is, 10 per cent of the total number of staff. Villawood currently has a high number of casuals-in the vicinity of 50 per cent of the staff. I do not blame ACM or the staff for this situation. They have been put in an impossible situation, overholding a contract month after month with no long-term security as the Howard government bungles the contract negotiations with Group 4. The short-staffing and any problems arising with the care of persons detained are squarely as a result of the actions of the relevant minister, who is here today, and the Howard government. I ask the parliament to note that, under the contract with ACM, it is the department, DIMIA, that retains the final responsibility for the safety and welfare of persons detained. Therefore, it squarely rests on DIMIA and the minister responsible for DIMIA, who is here today, to reassure us that the safety and welfare of persons detained are being adequately catered for in circumstances of such staff shortage. I now seek to raise another matter that fundamentally goes to transparency and truth telling. On 12 March 2003, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs announced that he had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Iranian government in relation to immigration matters. Minister Ruddock’s media release states: Australia and Iran have agreed that their first priority is to work together to promote the voluntary repatriation of those Iranians currently in detention in Australia. However, arrangements for the handling of those who do not volunteer to return have also been established. On2 May 2003, a letter was sent to Iranians in detention detailing a voluntary repatriation package. The letter included the following statement about the agreement between Australia and Iran: The agreement also allows for the involuntary removal of Iranians in detention who have no outstanding protection applications. Labor is also aware that there are claims of a leaked department of immigration memorandum that details a strategy to create a credible threat of deportation for Iranians. In addition, a number of contradictory statements about the existence and terms of the memorandum of understanding have been made by members of the Iranian government. Labor believes that it is wrong for the Howard government to enter such an arrangement and then seek to keep its terms hidden. If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. I call on Minister Ruddock and the Howard government generally to release the memorandum of understanding publicly so that everyone can ascertain whether the memorandum deals with forced removals or whether the Howard government is engaging in a cruel strategy of pretending that it can effect forced removals. The argument that has been put in the past about failing to put this agreement in the public domain is that the Iranian government might have something to say about that. I am sure they would have something to say about that; their consent should be sought. As a matter of course now, we have a process in this parliament where treaties entered into by the Australian govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment are put before a relevant parliamentary committee and people are able to examine their terms. I do not see why an agreement of this nature should be dealt with differently. I would be calling on the Howard government to table that memorandum of understanding. If it says what they say it says, well and good-it will be there in the public domain for everybody to see. If it says something different then obviously we would have something to say about that, having seen it. BeforeI move to the details of the bill, I will raise a related matter about a person from Iran that has received considerable public attention. I am glad the minister is here, because I think it is a matter which he needs to deal with as a matter of urgency. People would be aware of the circumstances facing an Iranian person who is detained. His name is Ebrahim Sammaki. He is the Iranian national who was in Indonesia for several years before coming to Australia on a boat and entering Australia unauthorised. His Indonesian wife has died tragically as a result of injuries sustained in the Bali bombing. There are two children of that relationship who are in Bali and who are currently being cared for by persons not related to the family but obviously trying to do their best in acquitting a duty of care to the children involved. Clearly this is a difficult migration circumstance. We have an Iranian national who entered Australia unauthorised and whose refugee claim has not been upheld. Given the several years he spent in Indonesia, one can understand why the processing authorities came to that conclusion. We have two children whose status in Indonesia is uncertain, their father not having lawfully entered Indonesia. They are not children who have any real connection with Iran. They were not born there; they were born in Indonesia. What happens in these circumstances? It seems to me that at some point you have to say, whilst the technicalities of migration law might dictate this or that outcome-and certainly the Iranian national who is the father of these children has failed to make out a valid refugee claim-in the face of tragic circumstances, where a woman has died as a result of a terrorist bombing in which many Australian nationals tragically died as well, you have got to let compassion come to the fore and do the right thing. What is the right thing in these circumstances? The right thing is for the father to be with his children. How can that be achieved? As I understand it, the department of immigration is suggesting that that can be achieved by the children-who have never been to Iran, who were not born in Iran-going to Iran. I cite in that regard some recent advice that has been given to Mr Sammaki. He is being told that information from the Tehran office of DIMIA indicates that Mr Sammaki’s children have the right of entry to Iran. I stress that: they have the right of entry, not the right to reside, not the right to be a citizen and not full rights. To achieve this right of entry, it is necessary for Mr Sammaki to apply to an overseas Iranian consulate or embassy to obtain birth certificates for the children. This will then allow the children to be issued with travel documents. It is being suggested here that children born in Indonesia to an Iranian father and an Indonesian mother who has subsequently and tragically died should seek birth certificates and a right to enter Iran. Let us leave aside whether they will have the right to reside in the long term, whether they will get schooling, whether they will get access to hospital care when they need it and all of those sorts of things. It is suggested that the way this family should be brought back together is to try and achieve that result. MAIN COMMITTEE I say to Minister Ruddock that I can understand why as minister he always fears precedent setting. But I do not think that there will be too many times when a woman dies in these circumstances in a tragedy like this so connected with Australia. In those unique circumstances, in an exercise of compassion this family should be reunited, and reunited in Australia. While the minister is considering that long-term solution, I believe he should reconsider the allocation of visitors visas to these children so they can at least see their father, affected as they must be by the tragic death of their mother and events that have happened in terms of their care since. As I stated earlier, the bill that we have before us today deals with the protection of information when a visa cancellation is proceeding, the visa cancellation has been challenged in the Federal Court and the visa cancellation is founded on the failing of the character test under the Migration Act. Currently, the protection of information issue in these matters is dealt with in section 503A of the act, which was introduced in 1998. Labor supported the introduction of this section, which protects from disclosure information that is given to DIMIA by a gazetted agency on the basis that it is confidential. Gazetted agencies include Australian and overseas intelligence and policing agencies. Clearly, such agencies will cease to provide DIMIA with such information if it cannot be kept confidential. Such information may be supplied as confidential because its disclosure would put at risk the source of the information or prejudice law enforcement or intelligence-gathering operations. As it currently stands, section 503A cannot protect confidential information given by gazetted agencies from disclosure in proceedings in the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court. Such proceedings would arise where a noncitizen contests a visa cancellation. Minister Ruddock and the department assert that such proceedings have been prejudiced because there is no ability to bring before the court information supplied on a confidential basis by gazetted agencies and protect that information from disclosure to the noncitizen who is the subject of the visa cancellation. Indeed, it is suggested by Minister Ruddock and the department that some visa cancellations have been contested solely for the purpose of accessing the confidential information. This bill enables the minister to approach the Federal Court or Federal Magistrates Court for a non-disclosure order in relation to information relevant to a visa cancellation matter that has been given to the minister or an authorised migration officer in the department by a gazetted agency on the basis that it is confidential. If the Federal Court or Federal Magistrates Court accepts the minister’s submission and makes a nondisclosure order, then the court is permitted to rely on the information for the purposes of the visa cancellation proceeding but it is not able to disclose the information to anyone, including the noncitizen who is appealing the visa cancellation and that person’s legal representatives. This bill provides that, in making a determination about a non-disclosure order, the court needs to have regard to a number of considerations. They include the fact that the information was originally communicated to an authorised migration officer by a gazetted agency on condition that it is treated as confidential. Australia’s relations with other countries are also a relevant factor. The need to avoid disruption to national and international efforts relating to law enforcement, criminal intelligence, criminal investigation and security intelligence are other factors. MAIN COMMITTEE In a case where the information was derived from an informant, the protection and safety of informants and of persons associated with informants is a factor. Australia’s national security is a relevant factor. Another relevant factor is the fact that the disclosure of the information may discourage gazetted agencies and informants from giving information in the future. The effectiveness of the investigations of official inquiries and royal commissions is relevant, as are the interests of the administration of justice. If the court determines not to make the non-disclosure order, the minister has two options. The minister can still adduce the evidence in the visa cancellation proceedings and it can be supplied to the noncitizen applicant andtheir legal representatives. Alternatively, the minister can withdraw the information from further consideration by the court. In that case, the information will not be disclosed but also cannot be relied on by the court as evidence in the visa cancellation proceedings. In addition to the introduction of this system of non-disclosure orders, the bill has been amended by the government to deal with two related matters. First, the bill provides that sufficient gazettal of an overseas agency applies if the country of origin is gazetted. This avoids technical difficulties arising from the misdescription of overseas agencies and also protects from disclosure the details of such agencies. Secondly, the bill amends the Freedom of Information Act to ensure that a noncitizen facing a visa cancellation matter cannot obtain through freedom of information the type of information he or she cannot obtain because it is subject to the amended section, 503A. Clearly, in opposition Labor does not have access to the specific details of the sorts of visa cancellation matters with which this bill is designed to deal. It therefore becomes difficult to objectively assess the dimensions of any defects with the current legislative scheme. Even in the absence of such detailed information, it seems reasonable to assume that there would be a very limited number of matters in which information is so sensitive that it must be completely protected. However, denying an applicant and his or her legal representatives information on which a court will rely in making a decision is a very significant matter that warrants serious consideration. The bill ensures that the final decision on these two competing considerations is made by a court. If the court accepts that the security arguments are so serious that the information cannot be disclosed to the applicant or his or her legal representatives, it can make the nondisclosure order. If the court does not accept the security arguments, it can decline the nondisclosure order. By the scheme described in the bill, the minister for immigration is also put under pressure to behave reasonably in relation to these matters. If the minister seeks to protect information that does not in truth need protection, it can be expected that the court will reject the minister’s application for a nondisclosure order. If this occurs, the minister can only continue to protect the information by prejudicing the likely success of the case for visa cancellation. If the minister wants to rely on the information in the visa cancellation proceedings, then, in the face of the court determining that it is not worthy of a non-disclosure order, the minister will have to disclose it. If the minister fails to disclose it, the minister will be unlikely to succeed in the visa cancellation proceeding because the key information will not be available for the court to rely on. All in all, the bill should be supported, given that, under this scheme, as contained in the bill, the court remains the ultimate arbiter. However, Labor makes the following suggestion MAIN COMMITTEE that ought to be considered by the minister in respect of future legislation. As members of parliament may be aware, the parliament is still dealing with the ASIO bill. It is not my intention to go to matters within that bill, but I think even people who have not followed that debate closely but who have followed it through the media and in other places would be aware that one of the suggestions that has been made by Labor during the process of dealing with that bill and the discussions with the government that that bill has provoked is that the government should security clear a number of lawyers who can deal with sensitive matters relating to security and relating to the representation of people who are being questioned because of security issues. If that were done, I would urge Minister Ruddock to consider relying on that system so that a lawyer with an appropriate security clearance could view the protected information in order to provide appropriate advice to the visa applicant. As I say, that is not a suggestion we are making for the immediate consideration of parliament in the context of this bill but a future policy development possibility depending on where this parliament ultimately ends up in terms of the development of the ASIO bill and the issue of lawyers being security cleared in the context of that. As I said at the outset of my remarks, this bill is in this place because Labor is prepared to support it. It is prepared to support it because the court remains the ultimate arbiter of rights in this regard. Consequently, the bill will enjoy quick passage through this place and through the Senate. Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2002 I want to take this opportunity to bring to the notice of the parliament something that we as a nation should be thoroughly ashamed of. I know that, as an Australian and particularly as a member of the federal parliament, I am ashamed. I am referring to our detention centres and the way that we have treated those seeking protection visas. The ABC’s Four Corners brought to the attention of the Australian public a scandal that would be nerve-racking even as the plot of a horror movie. It is even more chilling when we realise that this is a documentary about something happening in 21stcentury Australia-not a work of fiction. In my past life I was a prison officer in Western Australia and also trained as a group worker, enabling me to work with repeat juvenile offenders in our juvenile institutions. I was trained to work with prisoners who had committed a vast array of crimes-from non-payment of fines to wilful murder-in many of Western Australia’s prisons. In almost 14 years of working with offenders, I can never recall seeing any of the prisoners dealt with in the same way that people were being dealt with at Woomera. If the departments responsible for incarcerating people had conducted their prisons in the same way that this department has allowed these people to be treated, there would have been a public outcry. This might be a good time to remind everyone that the detainees in Woomera had not been convicted of any crime. Their crime was to arrive in Australia without visas, to seek a new life-a better life-away from the despotic countries from which they had fled. This was away from regimes such as that of the Taliban and Saddam Hussein. These people thought that they were coming to a better place-a place that would protect them. These are the same people about whom the Prime Minister then told our troops on return from the Gulf that they had been sent to liberate from oppression. These people had often endured horrific conditions in their countries of origin and had taken great risks to get to Australia, often at the mercy of MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Unesco The United Nations Educational Scientific And Cultural Organisation Has Pre
344,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (1.00 P.m.),"In speaking in support of the Migration Legislationpeople smugglers. Many had used their life’s savings, and some had borrowed money to get to Australia and a new life. They had travelled on small boats, many not seaworthy, risking death, and when they arrived, we detained them in centres with limited facilities, put men, women and children together and took many months to process their applications. We should remember that 80 per cent of those people incarcerated were eventually found to be genuine refugees and given temporary visas. Woomera is, for want of an alternative description, a prison-it is a prison camp in the desert five hours from the nearest city. In the summer, temperatures can reach 50 degrees centigrade and, as it is in the desert, night temperatures can drop to below freezing. Woomera detention centre is, at best, a group of transportable buildings ringed by razor wire. It could never be described as a place where people could feel safe and cared for. Minister Ruddock described it as a detention centre. ‘It is not a holiday camp, nor should it be seen as one,’ he has stated. I cannot imagine anyone getting confused and thinking that Woomera was a holiday camp. Woomera was opened less than four years ago and was only recently mothballed-not closed permanently, as should have been the case. It was built to house 400 people. In reality, it housed more than 1,400 at any given time. In fact, in April 2000, Woomera had nearly 1,500 detainees; that is, 1,500 people living in a compound with limited facilities and designed to cater for 400. The detainees were understandably desperate. This gave rise to riots, protests and breakouts. The detainees were at the end of their tether. Anyone involved with the detention of people will tell you, Deputy Speaker Corcoran, that, if you treat people poorly for long enough, even the most patient will react. There were claims that mental illness and self-harm were rife. I know from information supplied to me directly by a psychologist who worked inside one of the detention centres that these claims are true. But it goes beyond that. The psychologist I refer to came into contact with many children who were suffering from various forms of mental illness. She commented that there was an overwhelming sense of sadness amongst the children, in particular, and despair amongst the mothers. She met children who had lost the ability to smile or take interest-children who no longer knew how to play. Children at Woomera had been reported as self-harming. A 14-yearold boy at Woomera smashed his own head with a rock, and a 14-year-old girl who saw him do it had cut herself. Nurses from Woomera reported that cases of sexual abuse of children were an open secret. A 12-year-old Iranian boy was being sexually abused, and nurses were concerned that he was being used as a male prostitute. But when the matter was brought to the attention of the centre’s upper management, they were reported to have made smutty remarks. Sadly, the minister’s response in the program was: People drew all sorts of inappropriate conclusions which were fuelled by people who had no first-hand knowledge. No first-hand knowledge. Why does the minister think that the nurses and staff working in the centre would have no first-hand knowledge of what was going on, and what first-hand knowledge did he have that made him choose not to act? I am a father, and I cannot imagine how I would feel if my children, through my doing-that is, trying to take them to a better life-lost their ability to smile or play or, worse, were subject to sexual abuse. One of my concerns that I want to raise today is the veil of secrecy that surrounds detention centres. We could blame the contractors, ACM, and their drive to make money, but what MAIN COMMITTEE about the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the minister of that department-the people ultimately responsible for the management of the contract to run these centres? Let us not forget DIMIA and the minister. There has been and still is a monumental cover-up going on. Senior officials of DIMIA knew what was going on. Therefore, Minister, you knew. Just as Reith used the children overboard for political purposes, this minister has used Woomera and its detainees in exactly the same way. According to Four Corners, the centre at Woomera was understaffed. We have heard the same complaints from all of the detention centres in relation to staffing levels. They are understaffed and often staffed by detention personnel who are not well trained, who work long shifts and who are underresourced and under constant stress from the residents and the management. Four Corners reported that Woomera had only enough riot gear for six officers. During the riots at the Port Hedland immigration detention centre, the same complaints were made in relation to riot gear. During their biggest riot, there were only enough sets of equipment for six officers. The rest made do with whatever they could find. That riot resulted in an officer having a miscarriage and a number of officers never returning to work. How can these officers and other staff be expected to do a good job when they are not allowed to complain and, if they do complain, they lose their jobs? The minister might run away, but he cannot hide from what was going on in detention centres. Allan Clifton was ACM’s Woomera operations manager. He was at Woomera for 16 months. Prior to his employment at Woomera, he had had a long career in private prisons. In his interview by Four Corners he told of cover-ups and lies. He told the reporter that his time at Woomera had taken its toll on his health and state of mind. He believes that the trauma will have a long-term impact not only on detainees but also on many staff. He said that he had warned ACM senior management of a planned escape but was told he was being paranoid. The inaction by senior staff resulted in a breakout occurring. We all know about the breakout. It was covered very well by the media. Without the media, I am sure there would have been another cover-up. Four hundred detainees pushed through the fence due to the lack of staff. They could not be stopped. Several guards were injured. This escape and the resultant injuries should never have happened. The injuries were a result of understaffing and of DIMIA and ACM ignoring information given to them. The understaffing of centres run by ACM appears to be a constant criticism. Mr Allan Clifton said on Four Corners: In the times that I was there we hardly ever had a full FTEa full-time equivalent. He continued: In other words, we hardly ever had the required number of staff that I might add that ACM were getting paid for by DIMIA ... ... ... ... They would send in reports stating that we had the required number of staff when in fact we didn’t and quite often we were told at a local level to fudge the figures. In other words, if we were asked by the local DIMIA business manager we would say yes, we had enough staff, we had the required number of staff. At times we got down to where we were 40, 50, 60 staff below the number that we were supposed to have and, I guess, more importantly, the number of staff that ACM were getting paid to have on the ground. Later in the interview he said: MAIN COMMITTEE We’d breached unsafe staffing levels. We just did not have enough staff to adequately maintain the security of the centre, and just as importantly maintain the security and well-being of the detainees and the staff ... I had a lengthy conversation with the managing director about this, expressed my concerns quite clearly. And ... he quite clearly told me that I didn’t know what I was talking about and that the FTE or the Full Time Equivalent was a number that he’d pulled out of his arse to satisfy DIMIA. I am astounded that this was going on and that DIMIA and the minister claim they were not aware of it. It was further stated in the program that Woomera was ACM’s most profitable detention centre, making around $1 million per month. This was at the same time that the plumbing and sewerage were a major problem and there were not even lighting in the women’s toilets. In the August 2000 riot by detainees at Woomera, 32 guards and a number of detainees were injured. I remind you that I am talking about a detention facility in Australia, not some Third World country or Iraq. May I further remind you that all of this was going on while women and children were present. It amazes me that television footage can be taken of a man sitting on a razor wire fence, with a razor in his hand, and that same man cannot get the attention of DIMIA officials for his plight. This unfortunately was not an isolated incident. Stories of self-harm in detention centres are constantly being told. Hunger strikes occur. The Four Corners program showed a video made by a very distressed ACM staffer of some of the 189 people on hunger strike-of those, 62 had sewn their lips together, including two women and five children. I cannot tell you how pleased I am that Woomera has been mothballed, and hopefully it will never be reopened. There has to be a better way of looking after asylum seekers. Women and children do not pose a threat. They should not be locked up for extended periods of time. We must move towards a better system of speedy processing and placing of people into the community. Locking people up in conditions that beggar belief is a sad indictment on Australia and the Australian people. The people who staff these centres have an extremely difficult job to do. We are talking about ordinary people who are expected to do an extraordinarily difficult job, with little or no support. Working with people who are incarcerated is always difficult. The difference here is that they are working with people who have often suffered extreme trauma and sometimes torture. These people do not know what is in their future, unlike prisoners who have a sentence and a release date. These people do not know if they will be allowed to stay or if they will be returned to their country of origin. They often have no news of people they have left behind and do not know if remaining family are alive or dead. Asylum seekers are people living in trepidation, not knowing what is coming next but knowing only that they want to live in freedom in Australia. This minister has used these people and their misery for base political purposes, criticising them when he should have been protecting them. This minister has failed to provide any leadership in this area. While he is negotiating a new contract with Group 4, the same company that mismanaged Woomera remains running other facilities. In an era when we consider ourselves to be a civilised society, this minister has demonstrated how low the coalition will go to destroy that view when it suits their political purposes. I support this bill because it is a common sense approach. I commend the bill to the House while condemning the government. MAIN COMMITTEE Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (1.13 p.m.)-The Migration Legislation Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2002 is designed to confirm, if it were needed, that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs’ authority to disclose information required in character decisions is non-compellable and to restrict the disclosure of such protected information to and by the Federal Court or Federal Magistrates Court in any review of the minister’s exercise of discretion to refuse visas on character grounds. It reflects, I suppose, the inherent tension between public interest and procedural fairness. However, the need for the bill is debateable, given that the general legal opinion seems to be that the minister already has adequate control over the initial disclosure of such information to any party, including courts and tribunals. Furthermore, courts have almost invariably supported ministers’ decisions in such matters. However, this bill represents part of a pattern of increasing resistance by the minister and his government to the long standing principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. We are dealing here with an increasingly paranoid minister who wants to place his decisions and the consequences of his decisions beyond scrutiny and outside legal correction. The pattern is also evident in the government’s lying over the Tampa affair, the ‘no children overboard’ incident and the so-called Pacific solution, and in its failure to provide for public scrutiny of remote detention camps and the minister’s attempts to eliminate court and parliamentary oversight of his decisions. The vivid depiction on Four Corners-about which we have heard from other speakers-of life in the Woomera detention centre reminds us of the secrecy which surrounds the institutionalised sadism that is the official government policy on asylum seekers. It has at its core the systematic degradation and torture of our fellow human beings-treatment we would normally abhor. And this is not in the past tense, as the minister would have us believe. People are being brutalised today in all the detention centres. Like those at Woomera, many of the staff responsible for the care of detainees will never fully recover from the experience of carrying out their government’s cruel policy. The ill treatment of refugees is confirmed not just in the Four Corners report but in a series of reports which have documented the breaches of numerous international conventions to which we were willing signatories and effects of current policies on those who are detained as well as those who are on temporary protection visas. These include the United Nations Human Rights Commission, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Human Rights Watch and so on. Like many who are connected with the network of refugee advocates and supporters, I receive daily reports of suffering and degradation that make a mockery of our claim that we are a nation that respects human rights. Just today I had further reports, which I have sought to have investigated, about a man who is seriously depressed, is now suffering from bleeding every time he eats and apparently is not getting adequate medical care. I do not know the accuracy of that allegation, but it is typical, and it is almost impossible to verify. We cannot pretend we do not know what is happening. Others are certainly aware of the way we treat those who seek asylum. The Australian government’s uncompromising stance on asylum seekers was the subject of critical comment at a recent postwar conference in Iraq. Following a speech by Australia’s deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Peter Varghese, conference delegate Sheik Sayed Jamaluddin, a Shiite cleric, was critiMAIN COMMITTEE cal of Australia’s detention of Iraqi asylum seekers who had fled Saddam Hussein’s regime. He said: I call on the representatives of the Australian government to ask the government to accept the human rights of those Iraqis who are held prisoner in some capacityhe is right about the prisoner bitthat they might be treated in a humane fashion … If you come here and tell us that we need to build an Iraq that is democratic and respects human rights you should respect the rights of the Iraqis who happen to be in your prisons. Australia is one of the few countries to automatically detain those who arrive without authorised documentation. Those seeking asylum, including children-some 100 at last count-are held in secure, mostly remote camps for months or even years while their claims for refugee status are assessed or because they cannot be returned to the place from which they came. Despite the cold reassurances of the responsible minister, we know that such detention has profound effects on the physical and psychological well-being of detainees. There is no escaping that. The government encourages us to turn our faces away from the refugees and even to deny, as the minister has done recently, that depression is a mental illness. Forgive me, I am a psychologist. Depression can be a mental illness in its severe form. We are not talking about the blues here. We are talking about a serious mental illness. He implies that we need not worry that the experience of detention is harmful, even though so many of those in detention are depressed, because-and this is what he said on the 7.30 Report-‘I’m not sure that everybody would regard depression as a mental illness.’ Nudge-nudge, wink-wink, he goes to the community. At least sensible people like you and me would not regard it as a mental illness, the minister wants you to think-just bothersome groups like the World Health Organisation, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatry and the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing. When asked about rates of mental illness in our detention camps, the minister always conveniently overlooks depression. It is simply not counted-as if it would therefore disappear. The plague of self-harm and suicide attempts is, in the minister’s eyes, not the companions of mental illness but a rather crude attempt to engineer refugee status. He told Kerry O’Brien last week: … there were perceptions in the centres themselves that, by action of self-harm, people had achieved outcomes … and it led to a belief amongst a proportion of the Afghan population that the only way in which they were going to obtain visas was to be involved in the same sort of conduct.’ That is, self-harm, suicide. The minister refused then, as he has always done, to contemplate even briefly the possibility that locking people away in remote areas without certainty and hope may drive them to destructive acts. He specifically refused to accept O’Brien’s proposition that such acts might be construed as acts of desperation. He actually said that he did not know the meaning of despair in that context-which is amazing. I believe that we have to confront the immorality of this policy and its destructive consequences and invite Australians-and the minister too, for that matter-to exercise their empathic imagination, which is something which the Howard government has been at pains to prevent us all from doing. The government clearly understands that keeping a safe distance and reducing the opportunities to humanise asylum seekers is necessary to ensure the continuing acceptance by the Australian people of the more brutal elements of the asylum seeker policy. Asylum seekers are housed in remote camps in Australia and thousands of kilometres MAIN COMMITTEE from the mainland on Christmas Island and on Nauru where visas are refused to journalistsand human right activists in the case of Nauru. It is impossible to visit; we cannot know what is happening there except by rumour and the occasional letter. The government’s refusal to allow any photographs or personal contact with those who were stranded on the Tampa is another example. It was part of a deliberate campaign to prevent any identification with the people on board and to cultivate fellow human feelings. The defence minister’s press secretary gave explicit instructions to the defence department that there were to be no personalising or humanising images taken of the asylum seekers. I wonder why. Nonetheless, it is imperative that we ask ourselves, despite the government, how we would feel in similar circumstances if our freedom were taken away; to imagine how we would feel if our children were denied an education; how distressed we would be if we could not call on our own doctor when we were ill; how humiliated we would be if we were forced to be strip-searched at regular intervals; how desperate we would feel if we knew we might never be allowed to bring our families to join us; and how hurtful it would be to be treated as liars and cheats. Many asylum seekers are here precisely because they are the victims of torture and persecution, fleeing human rights abuses and often leaving family and loved ones behind. Others have lost family members to brutal regimes and are still grieving their losses. Some of them come from war zones where they have seen their communities bombed into oblivion. Yet their coming here is an expression of hope. They want to rebuild their lives and give their children a better future. On arrival in Australia they are hopeful of compassionate and humane treatment; instead they are rebuffed, humiliated and tormented still further. Their indeterminate detention leads to mounting stress, not least because of the disappointment of their optimistic expectations. The result is frequently severe depression and thoughts of despair and helplessness, which I referred to earlier. Some detainees, on the other hand, demonstrate aggressive, destructive and self-harming behaviours that are reflected in suicide and acts of mass violence, group break-outs, rioting, burning of facilities and hunger strikes. These actions then feed the hostile attitudes that are already prevalent and cultivated by the government in the wider community. The government insists that such behaviour of people in extremis is a form of bullying and manipulation. The detainees, as the minister puts it, are crudely trying to exploit our decency. This, in my view, is an obscene reversal of the facts: just who is being bullied here? Given the grim situation of many detainees, it is surprising that there is not more of such behaviour. Among children detention produces a well-documented range of psychological disturbances, many long lasting, including mutism, withdrawing from contact with others, bed-wetting, refusals to eat and drink as well as acts of self-harm and suicide in young people. At the time of writing, despite the fact that there had been no unauthorised arrivals by boat for over a year, records showed that many children were still in detention in Australia and on the island of Nauru. We should ask our government and our fellow citizens a few simple questions. Contemplate for a moment, if you will, the care you lavish on your own children, your thoughtfulness in protecting them from exposure to violence and suffering, your careful planning of their education and their access to opportunities to learn and to explore the world from a secure, MAIN COMMITTEE loving base. How can your children safely explore a world from behind barbed wire? There is certainly a world there to be explored, but it is one that will destroy them. We should think collectively, even if the government cannot, about the importance we place on protecting our children and ensuring their physical safety. How can parents in detention camps, with no private place and no control over their daily lives, provide such a safe environment? Child abuse is taking place today, despite the minister’s denials. We do not need elaborate research to conclude that asylum seekers are going to be damaged by these experiences. It is obvious to anyone who is prepared to imagine their own responses in thinking about what would happen to their families if they were put under that sort of stress-the sort of stress that is experienced daily in detention centres. One man who has been detained for over four years describes it simply as ‘dying every day’. The mere fact of indefinite detention is bad enough but degrading treatment is also regularly meted out. There are numerous reports of naked hostility being expressed by the staff towards the detainees. In letters to supporters, people in detention report that they are often treated with disrespect and endure petty humiliations and intrusions into their privacy. Isolation, detention and force are routinely used. Despite denial, people are identified by numbers and not names. Following the fires that were lit in several of the centres around Christmas 2002, strip searching, including full cavity searching, became routine. Many were placed in isolation and were denied any communication with people outside who attempted to contact them. Two weeks ago, I received reports-which have yet to be confirmed; we have made complaints and I do not know whether they are being followed up-that one detainee was bashed and then taken to an isolation room with a hook on the wall two metres off the ground. They should have read the report into Aboriginal deaths in custody. He was allegedly handcuffed with his hands in front of him and his arms extended upwards so that he hung on a hook, his feet just touching the ground. He was apparently left for over an hour before he was taken down. I understand the matter has been brought to the attention of the police. Random acts of meanness are also commonplace. On 24 April, Ebrahim Sammaki, who is in Baxter, was sent a video tape of two recent episodes of the 7.30 Report specially recorded for him on new blank tape because the report included images of his two children, from whom he had been separated for some time. Ebrahim’s wife, Endang, was one of those who died in the Bali bombing and their two children are still in Indonesia because the minister refuses to allow them to join their father. Ebrahim has still not been permitted to see the tape because the guards allege that there is other material on the tape. Those who sent the tape are adamant that there is nothing on the tape that has not already been broadcast by the ABC. The minister, as we know, is now refusing to allow the children even a short visit. Those who do not meet the strict criteria for refugee status face the constant threat of deportation, often to places where they believe they will be further persecuted or even killed. The government had apparently signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Iran to return asylum seekers whose refugee claims have failed. The government has refused to make the terms of the agreement public, perhaps because there are reports that the Iranian government has not actually agreed to the return of their nationals. Although the Iranian government will be forced to accept those returned, they have made it clear that they will refuse passports to those sent back. I put a question on notice to the minister and asked why MAIN COMMITTEE he would not make that public. He said he did not consider it to be in the public interest to make it available at this time and it was a confidential agreement between the governments. The Howard government, despite joining in the US Hollywood style depiction of Iran as part of the axis of evil, will take no responsibility, apparently, for the fate of Iranians or any others who may be returned to their countries of origin. Those whose refugee status is confirmed and who are released on temporary protection visas fare only marginally better. They are forced to live in a permanent state of suspended animation because under the current government such visas may never become permanent. The government reserves the right to reassess their claims in the light of changes in conditions in their countries of origin. For example, Afghanis fleeing persecution under the Taliban and eventually granted refugee status are now being sent back because it is judged that they no longer need fear persecution in Afghanistan. I think we should send the minister there, especially to somewhere outside Kabul, for a little bit of a holiday. Just this week, Human Rights Watch warned that Australia would put Afghan refugees and asylum seekers at risk if they were returned to an unstable Afghanistan. They also pointed out that the government’s four-page country information report, which they are giving to people whom they want to return, contained little substantive information and gave a very misleading impression of human rights protection in Afghanistan today. Human Rights Watch has documented many cases of security forces committing rapes, assaults and murders and attacks on girls’ schools in local populations, especially outside Kabul-a nice and secure environment to which to return children. The government proposes to return women and children, including several who entered Australia as minors. They will be returned to Afghanistan alone. Human Rights Watch officials describe this haste to send people back to Afghanistan as ‘rash and irresponsible’ since: … vulnerable women and children are being sent to unstable and dangerous regions … where in some places: … women are still facing Taliban-era restrictions. The same experience of uncertainty and civil disorder in their home country confronts the Iraqi people who fled Saddam Hussein and to a lesser extent the East Timorese who have lived here for a decade. Those on temporary protection visas are forced to live in limbo, denied hope and the opportunity to begin their new lives. They are also denied basic resettlement services and are prevented from bringing their families to join them if they have been separated. Just yesterday the last words of Dr Habib Vahedi were read into the Hansard of the South Australian parliament by Chris Hanna. I commend them to members. They are very moving. Dr Vahedi was an Afghan Hazara who committed suicide in the face of continuing uncertainty about his fate and the prospect of return to continued persecution in Afghanistan. He had been separated from his wife and four children for over three years and was clearly desperate that he would never rejoin them. The denial of family reunion is the reason why there are so many women and children among the 352 asylum seekers who drowned when the boat which became known as the another boat sank after catching fire and why there were so many women and children on the MAIN COMMITTEE vessel which broke apart and provided the photos which the government used as ‘evidence’ that the asylum seekers had thrown their children overboard, a claim subsequently shown to be a complete fabrication. As a result of these policies, seven Iraqi women and their children who attempted to come to Australia in one of the unauthorised vessels were held for a very long time on the island of Nauru. They may still be-it is impossible to determine. They languish there even though their husbands are here in Australia on temporary protection visas, having been found to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of Saddam Hussein’s murderous regime. A Senate estimates committee was told that the women could not claim refugee status because, while their husbands were the victims of persecution, they were not. In most cases when people seek asylum because of persecution, it is the men who have been subjected to explicit threats-we know that-and in the past this was sufficient for the immediate family to be accepted as refugees. Changes to the legislation now require every individual to be assessed, which means that women who try to join their husbands will fail and run the risk of being deported, while their husbands are unable to leave Australia without relinquishing their rights to stay, a vicious double bind. When asked what would happen to the women on Nauru the officials told the Senate committee, in the bloodless language of DIMIA and its minister: The individuals on Nauru are free to return to their homeland or to any other country they may wish to travel to. Thank you very much! This was at exactly the same time when Iraq was about to be attacked by the combined forces of the US, the UK and Australia. On the very day the Senate was told the women could return to Iraq, the foreign minister, Alexander Downer, spent the major part of question time providing gruesome details of what women in Iraq could expect should they fall foul of the regime-rape, torture, mutilation and murder. When challenged about the gross hypocrisy of the government’s position on radio the next day, the minister said: We don’t send people back who would be at risk. We send people back if we think they are rorting the system. There is no evidence that these women were rorting the system other than to try and join their husbands. One of the tragedies of all this is that the community is not being given an alternative point of view. I think as a community we can do a great deal better than this. Far from welcoming those who come across the sea, as our natural anthem suggests, and sharing in our good fortune, we are as a nation, through our government, rejecting the most traumatised people and adding to their suffering-and all in this climate of secrecy and silence. These people, small in number, have not come to embarrass us but to beg for our compassion and help, believing us to be a nation that values human beings equally, regardless of race, creed or colour. We have yet to justify their faith in us or to earn the description of us as a fair and humane people. the member for Kennedy, I want to get on record what is happening here. During debate on the Murray-Darling Basin Amendment Bill 2002 I understand that the member for Kennedy wanted to rise to correct a misrepresentation. He was not given that opportunity. It is unusual, but I will now allow him to do so. I draw his attention to the fact that he is on his feet to correct a misrepresentation but he cannot discuss any further matters. Debate interrupted. MAIN COMMITTEE",202,Dimia Centrally
345,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Corcoran),"BeforeI suspend the sitting, and before I callclaim to have been misrepresented. The minister alleged that figures that I had cited about Australia not being a net food exporter in nine years time were not correct. I quote from a memorandum from the Parliamentary Library, dated 2000. I am quite happy to table the document: If we assume that the fall in exports and the rise in imports in the period 1996-97 to the period 1998-99 is continued into the future, Australia will become a net importer of food and live animals by the year 2009-10. That was one misrepresentation. The minister said that the figure was misleading because it was out of context with others. I also seek leave to table documents which indicate a three per cent rise in exports and a 32 per cent rise in imports for a longer period of time, and then a 167 per cent increase in exports and a 414 per cent rise in imports over a longer period of time. Finally, the most up-to-date figures indicate a rise in exports from $5,803 million to $20,760 million, and a rise in imports from $732 million to $4,771 million. So we are going from $6,000 million to $21,000 million, which is nearly 350 per cent, and from $700 million to $4,800 million, which is nearly 700 per cent. So no matter how the minister wants to draw the graphs, they cross, and we will be a net importer of food. That is why I claim to have been misrepresented.

Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation) (4.03 p.m.)-in replyThe Migration Legislation Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2002 is to amend the Migration Act. As members are very much aware, it is to ensure that confidential information is protected from disclosure where a decision to cancel or refuse a visa on character grounds is challenged in the courts. Importantly, it gives the Federal Court and the Magistrates Court the power to make nondisclosure orders where confidential information comes before them for the purposes of a review of proceedings. I think it is important to recognise that one of the reasons for the protection of confidential information is that, if you do not protect it, you will not get it. If you are dealing with security agencies that might be able to give you information in relation to people who are potential terrorist risks, and they think that the information they provide to you is going to be publicly disclosed or disclosed to the person about whom it is held, you will not get the information. The same applies in relation to character issues. When you are dealing with police forces and other organisations, they may be getting information about people who are involved in organised crime. When a person who is significantly involved in organised crime is seeking to access Australia and you would rather not have them, it is appropriate that you are able to access information which will help you underMAIN COMMITTEE",211,Sievx Sank Or Was Deliberately Scuttled In Late 2001 It Is Why Two Women Drowned When

348,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenousstand the nature of the activities in which that person is involved. But you also have to protect the people who may have provided information to that agency that is providing the information to you. I heard a statement about immigration fairly recently from a New Zealand minister; that immigration is a privilege not a right. The idea that people have rights to use our courts to obtain information which may enable them to do some harm to people who have legitimately tried to help in the public interest in identifying people of character concern is not something that should be accommodated. That is the reason for this legislation. I would hope that the courts, when confronted with dealing with these issues, will accept the genuine need for confidentiality in the sorts of cases that we are raising. But where a court declines to make a nondisclosure order, and the Migration Legislation Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2002 is seeking to put this arrangement in place, and we are then not in a position to proceed with the matter-that is, to put the information before the court which will in effect prejudice the decision-it is to protect the third parties who have provided that information to us. That is the reason. We want to be in a position not to be forced to disclose it, so we want to be in a position to be able to withdraw from those proceedings. But the concern that we have is that, of course in a circumstance like that, the courts would be putting us in a position where a person would be accessing Australia who might well be of substantial cause for concern. So this legislation is of the utmost importance and I would like to foreshadow that I will be moving some amendments at the committee stage to ensure that the government’s intention here is given full effect and to ensure that we do have the capacity to use confidential information and that the sources of information will have the strongest possible protection. In the course of this debate, as is often the case with immigration issues, some other matters were raised. I will take the opportunity of dealing with some of those for the purposes of the record. The fact that they were raised may suggest that some of those comments had some veracity. People who took the Four Corners program in relation to detention centres-the closed Woomera detention centre-as having any veracity should understand that these were allegations that had all been aired before and which were well known. On the suggestions that there had been incidents of self-harm, that there had been escapes, that there had been riots, there must be something naïve about me: I seem to have a vivid recollection of those things happening. Maybe others have not. We have not sought to disguise them. The public knew that they were going on. All that was confronting was that they saw some of the difficulties that detention officers were faced with in having to manage those sorts of difficult situations. They are very confronting, very difficult situations for people to have to manage. But the allegations themselves were not new. The allegations that were made in relation to the contractual arrangements evidenced an abysmal knowledge of the nature of the contract. I want to make some very important comments here in relation to the contract we had with ACM. It does not require them to provide us with information about staffing levels. The contract provides that certain detention standards have to be observed and they have to meet those standards and they have to make the provision of staffing sufficient to ensure that those standards are met. We are relying upon their professional judgment in relation to the Woomera centre and those that are covered by the principal contract. MAIN COMMITTEE For completeness I want to say this because I do not want people to think that I have in any way handled these issues without putting all the facts on the table, there are some specific and separate contractual arrangements which we had with ACM that deal with some other issues, particularly when it is necessary to remove people from Australia. We have contracts where numbers may be specified in relation to the arrangements that should be made to escort people from Australia. So escort arrangements have some requirements in relation to numbers. We also have some separate arrangements in relation to the detention centres that were offshore at Christmas Island and Cocos Island. They were not covered by the principal contract, and the arrangements there were quite separate and need to be understood as being separate. Some further matters were raised on the new contract that we are negotiating with Group 4. I do not want to spend a lot of time on that, save to say that the contract negotiations are significantly progressed with the current focus on resolving technical matters, some of which involve third parties such as insurance companies, and where issues on the final form that the contract would take need to be sorted through. These are not matters that would be dealt with in the tender situation. They are dealt with under the contract or the tender in the discussions that occur after you have identified a preferred tenderer. That is what Group4 is: it is identified as a preferred tenderer, and the current focus is on resolving the detailed contractual negotiations. They are more complex than they have been in the past because of many of the issues relating to detention standards and providing the most appropriate arrangements to protect the interests both of the Commonwealth and the detainees. There are, under the agreements that we have, arrangements to continue with ACM under its present terms and conditions until 23 December or until completion of transition to Group 4. The agreement provides for payments to occur in relation to a successful transition and to cover some of the costs of the transition process. I understand that this can create some uncertainty, and it may mean that some people have had to work some overtime. I do not think that is a bad thing. I suspect that the people who have got the overtime probably do not think it is a bad thing either. But in terms of staff uncertainty, yes, there would be some uncertainty; but Group4 has communicated their planned recruitment arrangements to ACM staff, who will be entitled to apply for positions with Group 4-and that, we hope, will help in maintaining a successful transition. Two other matters were raised by the honourable member for Lalor which I would like to mention. One of them relates to the agreement-the MOU-that we have with Iran. The honourable member knows that, if she wants details in relation to these matters, she can always approach me. Frequently, I approach her. But it is not a one-way street; it is a two-way street. If she wants information about particular matters, I am more than happy to communicate with her about those matters. The agreement with Iran is confidential at the moment because Iran wants it to be confidential. The reasons for it, I suspect, have more to do with Iran’s concern about the implications of this for their foreign policy-that is, their dealings with other governments. I think that is the reason. But let it be clear that there is an agreement, and the agreement makes it known that there are arrangements in place where people, Iranians, can return home in dignity with a relocation package, an assistance package. But if they do not, they will be going home in any event. MAIN COMMITTEE I know that there was a leaked document last year, before we had an agreement, in which we worked through whether or not we ought to offer the re-integration package before we had an agreement. We looked at the question as to whether or not we could say to detainees, ‘There is a re-integration package and you are able to accept it now, and we are continuing negotiations with Iran in relation to ensuring returns.’ Some people saw that as our trying to put people under duress. In the end, we did not pursue that objective. We kept the reintegration package to be part of the MOU. The fact that we looked at trying to implement it earlier should not be seen as suggesting in any way that I would go public in relation to an agreement and its terms-particularly in relation to ensuring that people are able to be returned to Iran-and leave myself exposed because we did not have an agreement. Why would I do that? The fact is that we do have an agreement. There is nothing contradictory in relation to what has happened and the earlier leaked document, but the fact is that well meaning people ought to be encouraging Iranians-rejected asylum seekers; people who have no need for protection-to go home. They ought not to be encouraging them to hang on in the expectation that there will be some other outcome. The last matter that was raised by the honourable member for Lalor involved Mr Sammaki and his children. It is a tragic case; there is no doubt about that. He is here as a rejected asylum seeker. He had spent some years in Indonesia and had had a relationship with an Indonesian lady. She tragically died in the Bali bombing. There were two children of that union. They are children who have Indonesian citizenship. If Indonesia were Australia, the view would be that it would be in the best interests of the children for them to be reunited with their father in Indonesia. That would be the proposition. The children are Indonesian children. It would be in their best interests to be reunited with their father. At the moment, we are having some discussions with Indonesia. To date they have been inconclusive, but I would like to think that they could be conclusive. The honourable member for Lalor said that the children are Indonesian and the father is Iranian, but they have no connection with Iran and, therefore, they ought to be allowed to come to Australia and settle in Australia with their father. The children are Indonesian children. The father is Iranian. If you accept the argument of the honourable member for Lalor in relation to Iran-that is, that the Indonesian children have no links with Iran-then the argument equally applies to Australia. What is it about us that we say that you should always assume that it is in the best interests of people to be settled in Australia? What is it about us, culturally and in terms of the nature of our society, that says that that is always the best outcome? It seems to me that, as difficult as this case is, it is important to properly work through what the entitlements are in the countries with which there is the closest nexus. When we have been able to look at those issues fully and completely and we know the position, we might well be able to further consider the matter if necessary. I do not rule that out. It may surprise people to know that sometimes after a second, third and fourth approach, I am asked to intervene in some matters, even though I have refused to intervene to that point in time. It might surprise you to know that that can happen. But I do not think it is an appropriate time to intervene. I have made that clear. We ought to be pressing to obtain an outcome in the best interests of the children where the greater connection exists. Finally, let me say that there have been a lot of assertions about people’s entitlements in other countries. Again, the honourable member for Lalor suggested that the children might only have a right of entry to Iran. My understanding is that they may MAIN COMMITTEE have a far greater entitlement than that, but that is something that we are working through at the moment. There were others who spoke. NormallyI would respond fulsomely to the comments made by honourable members but, in the spirit in which their comments were made, I do not think they need a detailed response from me. The member for Swan persisted with this view in relation to the 12-year-old Iranian child who, it was alleged, was the subject of sale by his father for sex at Woomera. Those matters were the subject of a very full and complete examination, not only by the Flood review but also by the South Australian Department of Family and Youth Services. It was a very comprehensive review. The South Australian Department of Family and Youth Services had a senior magistrate review all the work that was undertaken by the officers of FAYS to make sure that every i was dotted and every t was crossed. It was the most thorough and complete review of allegations of that type. The people who appeared on the Four Corners report and again put those unsubstantiated allegations could not substantiate any allegation themselves of something they witnessed. They could not do that. They were the subject of discussions with FAYS. FAYS went to all the people who could offer information to investigate this question. They could make no finding that there was abuse of this child. The real hurt that somebody like I have in relation to this is that the child has been wounded. The child has been hurt. The relationship between the child and his father has been, in all likelihood, irreparably damaged because these allegations-that are not proven; that are unsubstantiated-have been made again and again. If you are looking at the question of child abuse in relation to this, the abuse of this child has been by those who have made these allegations, when it has been shown that they are untrue, and have repeated them. I have not heard, but I imagine that the difficulty the boy and his father experienced and had to address when these matters were first raised-the way in which they were seen by other members of their community because of the nature of the allegations-has probably resurfaced again, and all of the hurt and trauma has been raised again. I think that it is incumbent on members to find out what the facts are before they come into the House and repeat the sorts of claims that have been made by Four Corners-which were demonstrably untrue-and reassert them in the House as though they have some veracity. They had none on Four Corners and they had none when they were raised by the honourable member for Swan. If he had some information that was new or that raised a substantial issue that ought to be investigated, I would expect him to bring it to me. I can assure you that I am not in the business of protecting people who are involved in harming children. If there are serious issues that have to be raised, let that fall where it should fall. That is the approach I take in relation to these matters. Please have sufficient confidence to bring the information forward if you have it, so that it can be properly investigated. There was an investigation by Phillip Flood into these matters. Incident reports were seen to be inadequate at the time, but if you read the Flood report you will see the efforts that have been made to ensure that there has been proper reporting of incidents and that these issues have been fully dealt with. In summary, the amendments contained in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2002 protect the national interest by ensuring that security and law enforcement agencies continue to have confidence in Australia’s ability and willingness to protect their information. I commend the bill to the chamber and thank the opposition for supporting it. MAIN COMMITTEE Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.

Cognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 May, on motion by Mr Williams: That this bill be now read a second time. rules for determining whether goods originate in least developed countries, in East Timor or in Singapore. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 determines the actual tariffs and complements the first bill, so it is being debated cognately. The explanatory memorandum for the Customs Amendment Bill points out at page 2: The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 (the Customs Act) to: introduce rules of origin for goods that are the produce or manufacture of a Least Developed Country (LDC), which will enable such goods to have duty-free access to Australia ... and introduce new rules of origin for goods that are the produce or manufacture of Singapore, to give effect to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA). These amendments will enable such goods to also have duty-free access to Australia ... The explanatory memorandum for the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill states at page 2 that its purpose is the amendment of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to: Add East Timor to the list of Developing Countries; Define Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and provide for the duty-free entry of goods originating in LDCs and East Timor; MAIN COMMITTEE",217,Migration Legislation Amendment Protected Information
350,Mr Melham (Banks) (4.24 P.m.),"The Customs Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 insertsProvide for the duty-free entry of goods originating in Singapore in accordance with the SingaporeAustralia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA); and Implement related amendments to the Tariff. The Customs Tariff Act identifies and lists developing countries, preference countries, forum island countries and least developed countries as specific categories for the purposes of tariff rates. The amendments proposed by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill will include East Timor for the purposes of the Australian system of tariff preferences. With some exceptions, goods originating in developing countries benefit from a five per cent reduction on the general tariff rate. The amendments to the Customs Act provide definitions of the rules of origin for goods that are produced or manufactured in these countries. ‘Qualifying area’ is the area from which materials may be sourced and counted towards the allowable expenditure of a factory on materials. The last process of manufacture must be performed in that country and the goods must have a local content of 50 per cent. In addition, inputs from the other developing countries may be included in the calculation of local content but only up to 25 per cent of the total factory cost. The amendments to the Customs Act schedule 2 give effect to Australia’s agreement under the proposed Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Goods will be considered to originate in Singapore for the purposes of duty-free entry if they are wholly obtained or manufactured in Singapore or if they are partly manufactured in Singapore. This will include some particular accumulation provisions applicable to manufacture in Singapore. The Customs Amendment Bill also provides for duty-free entry of goods originating in Singapore. Should goods not meet the rules of origin requirements, these goods will continue to receive the preferential treatment that they now receive. Other amendments contained in the Customs Amendment Bill include the listing of Palau as a developing country, the inclusion of Papua New Guinea in the list of forum island countries and the introduction of two-character International Standards Organisation country codes throughout the tariff. As they stand, Labor would have no problem supporting these bills. It is appropriate that Australia assist least developed countries. The opposition takes no issue with the amendments in the bills relating to the favourable treatment of countries still in the process of developing. I do, however, wish to place on record Labor’s concerns about the parts of the bill relating to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The explanatory memorandum of the Customs Amendment Bill states on page 2: The amendment contained in schedule 1 will operate from 1 July 2003. The explanatory memorandum further notes that these bills in part result from formal talks between the governments of Australia and Singapore to establish a free trade agreement between the two countries. This process began in November 2000 and the negotiations concluded in October 2002. The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement was signed on 17 February 2003 and tabled in parliament on 4 March 2003, ‘subject to Australia’s treaty process and the exchange of diplomatic letters’. Australia’s treaty process involves the review of the proposed agreement by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. As I understand it, that agreement is currently still with the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, and the tabling date of the report from the committee’s MAIN COMMITTEE review of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement has not been determined. The national interest analysis prepared by the committee secretariat states: ... the Agreement will enter into force with an exchange of notes confirming completion of the Parties’ respective domestic procedures. This will take place following completion of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties’ review. I am very concerned that this House is debating a bill which pre-empts the result of a committee inquiry. I note that the chair of the treaties committee is in the chamber at the moment. This inquiry by the joint committee is the only chance that parliament will have to scrutinise the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement in its entirety. I have been advised that these amendments, if passed, will give effect to the detail of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Further, as my colleague the member for Rankin will explain, this means of preempting the results of the committee report establishes an unfortunate precedent both in terms of future free trade agreements and other legislation requiring committee review. While Labor will not oppose the passage of these bills through the House, we will insist that, before the Senate deals with these bills, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties tables its report. I note that the chair of that committee is present today and due to speak on these bills. Mr Billson interjectingcommittee. We ask that the government pay heed to the process that is in place now, where these agreements are reviewed by the committee. I recommend to the House, and to the government in particular, that they do not pre-empt the committee report on this matter. We are obviously urging the passage of this bill subject to the committee reporting. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin) (4.32 p.m.)-The matters contained in the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 before the Committee today reflect the government’s policy commitments in the area of trade and investment. The two issues-the duty free treatment for the importation of goods from least developed countries and East Timor, and the elimination of tariffs on goods imported from Singapore under the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement-are indicative of our broader trade agenda. The recent white paper on foreign affairs and trade, entitled Advancing the national interest, articulated what must be the most ambitious and wide-ranging trade policy agenda of any federal government since Federation. Our trade policies are connected to our broader economic, political and security aims. While this may confound protectionists, the special interest groups and the antiglobalisation nihilists, our trade strategy must reflect our national values and aspirations. Essentially, the policy is one of competitive liberalisation which embraces trade liberalisation on a bilateral and regional basis, thus complementing and stimulating multilateral trade liberalisation. We are promoting free trade globally, regionally and bilaterally. Our policy recognises that the global economy has been transformed over the past decade, from APEC’s defining goal in 1994 of free trade and investment by 2010 for developed economies and by 2020 for developing economies to the self-proclaimed ‘triumph’ of the antiglobalisers in Seattle, to the success of the multilateral trade negotiations in the Doha round just two years after Seattle. All this recognises that the global trade agenda is more complex, more sophisticated and multilayered. MAIN COMMITTEE",220,Customs Tariff Amendment Bill No 1 2003
351,Mr Melham,"She is an able member of parliament. She is an able chair of an ableBut the self-evident truth is still emerging, and that is that trade liberalisation has a profound effect on growth, in fostering development and in reducing poverty. Let me restate why we seek to advance the virtues of free trade. Free trade opens economies to competition; it opens societies to comparison. Free trade creates opportunities by allowing resources to flow to where they can be put to productive uses and to raising standards of living. Free trade lowers the cost of basic necessities such as clothing and food. It leads to a better quality of life. By liberalising trade, we can build open investment climates. Through transparency, it discourages corruption. It encourages the flow of ideas and concepts, enabling democracy to develop and to grow. Developed democratic nations are testament to this and there can be no doubt that countries that enter the global open market system invariably prosper over the long term. We have seen their political systems and their societies become more open and more democratic. Free trade has a significant role in both economic growth and poverty reduction. The experience of the postwar years has proven this time and time again. Recent empirical studies by the World Bank have concluded that where developing countries have lowered trade barriers and thus increased trade then they have also experienced stronger economic growth. Economic growth is the primary means by which countries reduce poverty. As all but a handful of dissenters would acknowledge, trade is indeed good for poorer countries. This is why the meeting of WTO trade ministers in Doha in 2001 was such a significant meeting, coming as it did just two years after Seattle. This round included the word ‘development’ in its name-the Doha development round. There is no doubt that over the last few years the WTO has concentrated a deal of its efforts into improving the condition of least developed countries-that is the phrase we find in the bills before the chamber-inside the multilateral trading system. This is both in terms of market access and technical assistance. Least developed countries, or LDCs, are those designated as such by the United Nations. I believe there are some 50 or so LDCs on the United Nations list. Some 30 or more are members of the WTO. Others are in the process of accession to the WTO or are WTO observers. The list includes countries such as the Solomon Islands, the Maldives and Myanmar; countries in sub-Saharan Africa such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Lesotho, Malawi and Uganda; and countries such as Rwanda, Bangladesh and Cambodia. Australia recognises that trade must be an integral element of any growth strategy and poverty reduction strategy. By increasing developing countries’ access to markets they can generate significant benefits. It has been estimated that, if developing countries increased their share of world exports by just five per cent, this would generate $677 billion per year. That is seven times as much as they receive in aid, and aid can never by itself be the long-term solution to the state of least developed countries. The empirical studies by World Bank economists that I referred to earlier also suggest that openness to trade leads to declining absolute poverty rates and it does not increase income inequality. There are examples of developing countries in the 1980s and the 1990s that reduced barriers to trade and then grew an average of 3.5 per cent to five per cent on a per capita basis. Income inequality in those countries did not increase. In fact, the incomes of the poor tended to correlate with overall growth in gross domestic product. For the benefit of the free trade doubters who are still out there, the contribution of free trade to growth is not only quantitative; it can boost the internal strength of economies by inMAIN COMMITTEE troducing competition to domestic firms. It can also contribute to foreign direct investment, which is important in financing development. Foreign direct investment is attracted to the economies of developing countries that are committed to participation in the world trading system. These developing economies are attractive to foreign direct investment if they follow the global trading rules-if they are part of the global trading system and thus have heightened the transparency and predictability of economic transactions within their borders. It is a win-win situation. Trade does not have to be a zero-sum gain in which gains by one country are losses for another country. In pursuance of the link between trade liberalisation and capacity building, Australia has provided, over at least the last 25 years, trade preferences for all the least developed countries, as well as for developing countries more broadly, in general recognition that their integration into the world economy requires practical market access. But at Doha-and I come back to this point-the mandate for a new round of negotiations after the anti-globalisation triumph at Seattle reflected the priorities of developing countries. The emphasis was on capacity building so that developing countries could participate fully in the multilateral trading system. It concentrated on implementing WTO commitments, especially the obligations of developed countries to open their markets to products from developing countries, particularly textiles and footwear, and it focused on special and differential treatment through measures such as tariff preferences. Australia has acted to respond to the concerns and priorities of developing countries. These bills specifically reflect the Prime Minister’s announcement on 25 October 2002 during the APEC leaders summit that Australia will grant tariffand quota-free access to the 50 least developed countries from 1 July 2003. This demonstrates our commitment to opening markets to the world’s poorest countries more than ever before. It is significant that the benefits from this initiative will also extend to East Timor. East Timor was admitted to the United Nations in 2002 but it has yet to gain a formal least developed country status designation by the United Nations. The Australian government did not want to wait for that designation; it wanted to ensure that East Timor is not left behind, so East Timor is specifically included in this initiative. It is a fact that East Timor is one of the poorest nations on earth. Even prior to the crisis of August 1999 about 80 per cent of its estimated 750,000 people living in villages and rural areas depended upon subsistence agriculture. Estimated GNP per capita had dropped to about $US246 during the East Asian financial crisis of 1997 and it is believed to have halved again during the 1999 violence and ensuing crisis, so, well before its birth as a nation on 20 May 2002, East Timor faced enormous development challenges. We know that after the crisis its infrastructure was destroyed, the agricultural cycle was severely disrupted, nearly three-quarters of the population was displaced and all its functions-government, the public service, law and order, community services, health and education-collapsed. Australia was then, and still is, absolutely committed to supporting East Timor through these difficult times to a point where it can reach its full potential as an independent and successful nation. So, in recognition of East Timor’s continuing development needs, the Australian government first committed substantial aid. Further, the Timor Sea Treaty negotiated between Australia and East Timor has also provided a means for the long-term development of the oil and gas resources in the Timor Sea, and this is going to provide a much-needed revenue flow to East Timor. MAIN COMMITTEE Now, with this legislation, in amending the Customs Act 1901 we are providing access free from tariffs and quotas available to not only the 50 LDCs but also to East Timor from 1 July 2003, thus bringing to East Timor the opportunity to share in the benefits of free trade, which I have articulated, and to ensure that it can integrate into the world economy-recognising as we do that it is trade and investment and not just aid that drives development and recognising as we do that aid in itself will not be the solution to the economic problems that beset East Timor and other LDCs and that open economies are the fastest and most sustainable means of achieving improved living standards and greater wealth. The second aspect of these bills is amendments which will give effect to Australia’s obligations under chapter 3 of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. As to that agreement, yes, the matter is before the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I am well aware of the timetable of that expected report and I am conscious of the timing of the tabling of that report, given that this matter is before the House, but I am satisfied that there will be no difficulty arising from that. For Australia to fulfil its obligations under the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the Customs Tariff Act and the Customs Act will need to be amended to incorporate these changes. There is no doubt that the coming into force of the SingaporeAustralia Free Trade Agreement is going to result in direct benefits for many sectors of the Australian economy. I say this without pre-empting the report of the Joint Standing Committee on TreatiesMs JULIE BISHOP-The member knows I am not permitted to discuss the content of a report not published. The benefits that have been stated in the press, in commentaries and in other observations are in accordance with our commitment to pursuing bilateral and regional trading opportunities as well as supporting and giving full effect to the Doha round. On that basis the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act and the Customs Act 1901 are in accordance with our broader trade policy and our wide-ranging trade policy agenda, and I commend these amendments to the House. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (4.47 p.m.)-This legislation, consisting of the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 and the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003, provides for more favourable tariff treatment of less developed countries, including East Timor. To that extent obviously Labor supports the legislation. As someone representing the Labor Party on trade matters, I consider that it is normally in the national interest of countries that tariff barriers be reduced over time and in a way that nevertheless still protects those most adversely affected by such reductions. That has been the history of Labor in government. It is true that we had presided over very substantial reductions in tariffs and other forms of protection against imports. Therefore obviously Labor sees real merit in those aspects of this legislation which involve reductions in those import restrictions. It is gladdening that those reductions are being applied to some of the poorest countries in the world and to the newly independent nation of East Timor. So not only do we have no difficulty with those proposals in this legislation but we positively embrace them. The legislation also, however, provides for the elimination of a range of tariffs between Australia and Singapore pursuant to the recently concluded Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. It also prescribes rules of origin for determining whether goods qualify for those eliminated tariffs. MAIN COMMITTEE",222,Customs Tariff Amendment Bill No 1 2003
352,Dr Emerson,"Yes, you are.The high farce of all this is that the parliament has in place a system of scrutiny of trade deals and other treaties. That system of scrutiny is called the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties-otherwise known as the treaties committee. The treaties committee has taken an interest in this legislation in respect of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The great farce about the way the government has handled this is that it has brought this legislation into the parliament while the committee is still examining it. Therefore, it follows that the government is completely ignoring any recommendations of that committee, because none have been completed and none have been presented to the parliament, yet this legislation is going through the House of Representatives. Labor’s position is that the treaties committee should not be treated with such contempt by the executive of this parliament. Therefore, we say that this legislation should not pass the Senate until the treaties committee has had a proper opportunity to examine the provisions of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement and to complete its report, which is not due until June. This legislation should not pass the Senate until that meagre scrutiny, which is available under the parliamentary processes, has had an opportunity to bear upon this legislation. It is quite dangerous for the Australian parliament to operate in this way, to set up a committee-an important committee, the treaties committee-to ask it to analyse trade agreements and other treaties and then to indicate that, irrespective of the findings of that committee, those findings will be ignored because the legislation by that time will have passed. What a farce. These are not small agreements. The Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement, although not massive on a global scale, is important in its own right. In addition, it will form in many respects the model for the US-Australia free trade agreement and for the parliamentary processes for handling the US-Australia free trade agreement. I want to take this opportunity to make some observations on the parliamentary processes and the content of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. In another and very important free trade agreement, the North American Free Trade Agreement that was established during the mid-1990s, there is a provision called chapter 11. That provision effectively allows companies to sue federal, state and local governments in the three countries covered by tions or laws that adversely affect the profits of those companies. It may disturb members to know that a similar provision, not an identical one, has been included in the SingaporeAustralia Free Trade Agreement and a similar provision is almost certainly going to be included in an US-Australia free trade agreement. I have with me a submission from AFTINET in relation to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement to the treaties committee. This has been completely ignored by the government, but I will not completely ignore the submission, nor will the treaties committee. I will draw upon some of the observations made in that submission. The submission says: The state and local government regulation of services is covered by the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement and states have only one year to list their exemptions to it. There has been no community consultation about the implications of this for state government services. We are confronted here with the possibility of restrictions on the ability of state governments to regulate and to provide essential services-that is what is being provided for in this agreeMAIN COMMITTEE ment. Not only that but also any future new measures by local government would be covered by the agreement. I wonder how many states and local councils around Australia know this. It is echoes of the past. This is a derivative of chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Senator Robert Matsui was a supporter of the North America Free Trade Agreement. He has observed much more recently that, when that agreement went before Congress, they did not even look at chapter 11 and they did not know about its implications. Shades of recent past; it is all happening again. How many Australians would be aware of the similar provision in the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement? How many Australians are aware that it is almost inevitable that a similar provision will be inserted in the US-Australia free trade agreement? How many Australians are aware that these agreements have the capacity to prevent future federal, state and local governments from regulating for the social good? I would say the awareness of these things would be approximately zero. One mechanism, one device for raising the awareness of the community about these serious issues is the treaties committee. But the government’s plan is to rush this through before the treaties committee has even finished its deliberations and before it has even considered submissions such as the one from AFTINET. I have said that such provisions would allow companies to sue governments. SAFTA has two enforcement processes: a specific one for investment, and a general one for the rest of the agreement. In this regard, SAFTA is not fundamentally different in its origins or its genesis from the infamous MAI, the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. But this would be a bilateral agreement on investment between Singapore and Australia, or between Australia and the United States. Lest this all sound a bit theoretical and that these provisions do not happen to have much force, I would disavow members of this parliament from any such view, because a number of cases have already been taken in NAFTA and I will just cover a few of them. US corporations have used the NAFTA rules to sue Mexican and Canadian governments for hundreds of millions of dollars. The US Metalclad Corporation was awarded $US16.7 million, later reduced to $15.6 million, because it was refused permission by a Mexican local municipality to build a 650,000 tonne per annum hazardous waste facility on land already so contaminated by toxic wastes that local groundwater was compromised. Here was a local council saying, ‘No, you can’t build a hazardous waste facility in our area’, and it got sued successfully for $US15.6 million. The second example concerns the Ethyl Corporation, a US chemical company. That company produces a fuel additive called MMT that contains manganese, which has a few nasty features. Ethyl Corporation successfully sued the Canadian government when that government tried to ban MMT. In April 1997 the Canadian parliament imposed a ban on the import of MMT. It did so on grounds of public health as well as to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. That government was forced to settle the suit by reversing its ban on MMT and paying $13 million in legal fees and damages to Ethyl Corporation. So there is a second example of government seeking to regulate, in this case on environmental grounds, and it could not in the end so regulate and had to pay the legal costs of the company involved. I give another example. The US-based Sunbelt Water Inc. is suing Canada for $10½ billion because the Canadian province of British Columbia interfered with its plans to export water to MAIN COMMITTEE California. However, Sunbelt Water has never actually exported water from Canada but claims that the ban reduced its future profits. I will provide yet another example. The US company, United Parcel Services-or UPSwhich is the world’s largest express carrier and package delivery company, is suing the publicly owned company Canada Post. US has argued that Canada Post’s monopoly on standard letter delivery is in violation of NAFTA’s provision on competition policy, monopolies and the state-run enterprises. It is arguing, among other things, that Canada Post abuses its special monopoly status by utilising its infrastructure to cross-subsidise its parcel and courier services. There is a very clear parallel here in Australia, because Australia Post has a monopoly on the standard 50c letter. I do not know whether Australia Post uses some of the proceeds of that monopoly to cross-subsidise its courier service, but what is absolutely clear from the letter and the practice of the North American Free Trade Agreement is that, if a similar provision was included in our own agreement with United States, it would be open to an American company to sue Australia Post. Do Australians know about this? No. Why do they not know about it? I will tell you. More to the point, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will tell you, because this is what it said in its submission to the Senate inquiry that Labor initiated on the US-Australia free trade agreement: It is not possible to provide detailed commentary on the strategy for the negotiations as the content of the negotiations will be confidential between the Australian and US governments. There you go. We have a trade minister, Mark Vaile, saying, ‘We’re very open about this.’ How? They are holding negotiations in Hawaii behind closed doors, working on provisions similar to chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which allows multinational companies to sue governments-federal, state and local-that want to regulate for the social good. It is very easy to anticipate an example of how that could apply here in Australia beyond the postal services. There is a lot of debate about Medicare at the moment, and so there should be. The government has developed and released its plan to destroy Medicare. Labor will save Medicare. Labor built Medicare and only Labor can save Medicare. If a future Labor government decided to extend the coverage of Medicare into dental services, for example, or into allied health services such as physiotherapy, and there were in place at that time a US-Australia free trade agreement and an American private health insurance company was operating here Australia, under the provisions of chapter 11 it may well be open to that company to sue a future Australian government for trying to extend the coverage of Medicare. Trying to extend the coverage of Medicare would potentially affect the profits of that private health insurance company. Do the Australian people know what is at stake? Of course they do not, because the negotiations are being conducted behind closed doors. It is all very real, because a similar provision-though somewhat modified-is contained in the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. This parliament is being expected by the executive government to pass this legislation, which is a very important step in implementing the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. But we do not know exactly how these provisions will operate, because we have not had any benefit from the treaties committee. That is why Labor says that this legislation must not pass the Senate until the treaties committee has reported and made recommendations and the government has genuinely considered those recommendations. Is that too much to ask? How can the government credibly state that the procMAIN COMMITTEE esses that it has been adopting in relation to the negotiation of these bilateral free trade agreements is open and transparent and that it has involved the public in the consultations? What rubbish! The public has not been involved at all-not at all. I want to conclude by making a few observations on preferential free trade agreements, of which the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement is an example. The US-Australia free trade agreement would be a further example, and a very large one. Before the Second World War-indeed, before the Depression-the world descended into regional trading blocs, where countries got together and lowered their tariff barriers among themselves but discriminated against others. With the benefit of hindsight-and, for some at the time, with the benefit of foresight-that was considered to be a very substantial contributor to the Great Depression. It was also, in some measure, a precursor to the Second World War because groups of countries banding together and doing deals among themselves that discriminated against other countries helped to create strategic tensions. It was all about trade diversion-about diverting trade from one country or group of countries to another. That is exactly what the US-Australia free trade agreement would do: it would divert trade and could create trade tensions. The nightmare scenario for Australia is that the countries of East Asia, led by China, will respond to these trade-diverting policies of Australia and say, ‘If you don’t consider yourself part of the region, do your deal with the United States; we will do our own deal and form an East Asian trading bloc, and you won’t be part of it.’ Fifty-five per cent of our merchandise exports go to East Asia. Can we afford these risks? There needs to be proper public scrutiny of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement and of the US-Australia free trade agreement-particularly the latter-before they are rammed through this parliament after being negotiated behind closed doors without anyone bothering to wait for the treaties committee to even consider them. It is a contemptuous way to treat the parliament and a committee of the parliament. That is why Labor will not support the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement provisions in this legislation until they have been properly reviewed by the treaties committee. Rankin talk about the need for us to not act until the treaties committee has looked at the bill. It is important to remind the member for Rankin that, under his government, such a committee did not exist. It was this government who instituted the need to have such a committee, so all of this is hollow rhetoric. We hear his anti free trade agenda. He is not about liberalising trade between our important countries, particularly Singapore. He is raising all the problems about what the implications will be if we strike these free trade deals. rum for a debate! countries might establish their own trade agreements. That is fine. If you look at the trade relationship between us and Asia, you see that it is very complementary. Our primary products go to Asia, and their manufactured products come back-and vice versa, in terms of some of our manufactured products. That relationship is working very well. Where the relationship between Australia and Singapore sits at the moment shows its strength. Singapore is Australia’s seventh-largest overall trading partner and seventh-largest export market.

The problem is that the member for Rankin, who operates in the old socialist system of putting up all types of restrictions and uses his union ticket to enter, likes these restrictions. We on this side of House like a free market and free agreements, and this is what this is about. This is about Australian banks being able to compete in Singapore against the other multinationals and against Singapore banks-which they have not been able to do the to the same extent in the past. Secondly, it allows law firms to operate in Singapore, which they have not been able to do to the same degree in the past. It allows the recognition of Australian qualifications of lawyers and other professionals so they can operate there. Across the board, the significant part of this agreement is in the service sector, which is worth some $2 billion. It does not make a huge impact on manufacturers; the strength of this agreement is in the services sector.

I would have thought the member for Rankin would be totally in favour of negotiations in the Doha Round liberalising trade and ensuring that we have a free environment. You guys are all about restrictions and quotas. your support for a free trade agreement which will allow Australian professional companies to operate in Singapore. I would have thought the member for Rankin would be highly supportive. I, for one, think that it is a great initiative by this government contrary to the Labor opposition. Contrary to the Labor opposition, we look forward to the negotiation on the free trade agreement with the US, which I know they are desperate about because they realise that this would be a very popular move amongst Australian manufacturers, Australian producers of lamb and beef and Australian service providers-it would be a great plus. But all I have heard from the other side of the chamber is criticism of the free trade agreement with the US. This bill has a number of provisions. It provides further access for least developed countries. Australia has a very strong record on providing special access for LDCs, the poorest countries in the world. I am sure that all members of the House would support that and also support access to Australia for goods from East Timor, encouraging its fledgling industries to send their products to Australia. Although they represent more than 10 per cent of the global population, these countries account for less than 0.5 per cent of world trade. Currently our leading LDC suppliers are Bangladesh, Burma, Yemen and Samoa. The inclusion of East Timor is, I am sure, welcomed by all members. The fact that we are negotiating a free trade agreement with Singapore has been warmly received by industry and by service providers. I am sure that if the member for Rankin allowed himself time out from those leadership discussions in the ALP he might find that it is warmly supported and received by the Sydney business community and the service providers are looking forward to opening up their operations as a result of the great initiatives by this government in the trade area.

My understanding is that everyone in the House supports these particular initiatives. The amendments in relation to Singapore result from the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement that was signed on 17 February this year. Those amendments will commence on the day the agreement enters into force, which is expected to be later this year. The member for Banks made a comment suggesting that this legislation is pre-empting the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It is not, my friend, and I will explain a little later why that is the case. I reiterate that these amendments will commence on the day that agreement enters into force, which is expected to be later this year. The agreement will not enter into force until the Australian and Singaporean governments agree, via an exchange of diplomatic notes, that it should do so. The agreement will not come into force on 1 July 2003.

I believe that the intervention procedure in the Main Committee is a very important innovation and I would like to see it used more. I think that it does encourage more interactive debate across the chamber. This chamber does have a more intimate atmosphere, and it is important to look closely at all of the matters discussed in the bills. The member for Rankin asked about the role of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, particularly if this legislation passes through the parliament. I pointed out a moment ago that this legislation will not become law until such time as the Australian and Singaporean governments decide that it should and set a date via an exchange of diplomatic notes. What is important is that the legislation pass through the parliament, and I will not give a commitment to the member for Rankin that it will not be put to the Senate before the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties reports. I point out to the member for Rankin and also the member for Banks-who I think made a similar point-that there will be ample time for the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties to bring down its report and for the government to consider the report before there is an exchange of diplomatic notes.

All of us know that at times it does, regrettably, take a considerable period for legislation to pass through the parliament. In summing up with respect to the questions, we want the legislation to pass. The free trade agreement will not come into force until there is an exchange of diplomatic notes. That will not happen until the Australian and Singaporean governments agree that it should. The Australian government will not be exchanging a diplomatic note until after the committee has reported and until the government has been able to consider the contents of that report. cessful in holding up passage of this legislation until the treaties committee has reported, would the government consider legislative amendments to the agreement after it has been through the parliament-that is, will it bring the legislation back into the parliament, in light of the recommendations of the treaties committee, or will it ignore those recommendations? at any recommendations from the treaties committee. The government will consider those recommendations prior to the free trade agreement coming into effect. It is a matter for the minister responsible, Senator Ellison, as to the actual procedures to be followed. But the legislation, I am advised, is to be enacted before 1 July 2003 to give effect to the initiative on least developed countries, and the Senate needs to consider both bills before 1 July. So you have the two matters in the one bill. I do not really see what the problem is: everyone is keen that the least developed countries matter should proceed and I have given an assurance that the government is not going to exchange diplomatic notes with the Singaporean government to bring the free trade agreement into effect until after the committee has reported and after the government has considered the report. I think that is entirely reasonable. What is important-and I can see from the way the member for Banks is nodding that he accepts this-is that the legislation should go through the parliament, firstly, because of the importance of the least developed countries initiative and, secondly, so that the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement can come into effect expeditiously after the committee has reported and after the government has considered the contents of the report. Turning to the substance of the bills, I want to point out that the rules of origin for Singapore contain accumulation provisions for manufactured goods in recognition of Singapore’s special offshore processing arrangements. The accumulation provisions will allow for value adding in Singapore and Australia before and after overseas processing to be included in the calculation of local content. The provisions do not apply to textiles, clothing and footwear, passenger motor vehicles, products or jewellery. The rules of origin for Singapore also contain special consignment and origin certification provisions. These provisions are designed to ensure that goods that are transported to Australia through Singapore cannot claim to originate in Singapore.

385,Mr Slipper,"AllI am prepared to say is that the government is particularly keen to lookThe Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2003 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. Those amendments include the addition of East Timor to the list of developing countries in schedule 1 of the tariff. This will enable imports from East Timor to receive a five percentage point reduction on the general tariff rate. This amendment took effect on 1 July this year through Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 2003. The bill also amends the tariff to implement the decision of the government to give duty free access to goods originating in least developed countries and in East Timor. Those amendments will commence on 1 July 2003. The bill also amends the tariff to allow goods originating in Singapore duty free access to Australia. These amendments will commence on the day that the Australia-Singapore Free Trade Agreement enters into force. That is the difference between the two elements of this bill, as I have indicated to honourable members a moment ago. The bill contains a number of other amendments to schedule 1 of the tariff, which contains a list of countries and places to which preferential rates of duty apply under the Australian system of tariff preferences. Palau is removed from the list of places treated as developing countries and added to the list of developing countries in that schedule. Papua New Guinea is added to the list of forum island countries, and the country codes for each country listed in schedule 1 and elsewhere in the tariff are changed from the current four alpha codes to the two alpha codes used by the International Standards Organisation. These changes do not alter the treatment of imports from those countries to Australia but do improve the accuracy of the tariff. A number of minor related tariff amendments are also contained in the bill. The member for Rankin, who has now left the chamber, claimed that there was no consultation with the states and local government on the provisions of the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement on services and investments.

The buyback was announced after last December’s meeting of the Council of Australian Governments here in Canberra. When that COAG meeting ended on 6 December, the Prime Minister appeared at a press conference with the state premiers to announce that the ‘most important area of agreement has been in relation to a very significant strengthening of laws across Australia in relation to hand guns’. The meeting endorsed the 28 resolutions made by an earlier meeting of the Australasian Police Ministers Council, and there was a commitment to put the legislative and administrative measures in place by 30 June this year. In two areas the COAG decision went a little further than the police ministers’ decision. It agreed that hand guns would be limited to a maximum .38 calibre, except for specially accredited sporting events, where hand guns up to .45 would be permitted. The Prime Minister promised that details of that would be worked out quickly. The second area where COAG went further than the police ministers was to agree that semiautomatic hand guns with a barrel length of less than 120 millimetres and revolvers and single-shot hand guns with a barrel length of less than 100 millimetres would be prohibited. Highly specialised target pistols, some of which have a barrel length of less than 120 millimetres, would still be allowed. The Prime Minister went on to say that this was a very important step to making the streets of Australia safer. Overall, about 20 per cent of illegal hand guns in Australia will be removed from the community. Here we are in late May, with 33 days left before the Prime Minister’s deadline for the introduction of these measures to remove dangerous hand guns from the Australian community; yet the detail has not been worked out. There is only one month to go, and the community is still in the dark about how this buyback scheme will work on the ground. It is shaping up to be a total shambles. So much for the government’s commitment to make the streets safer. It is exactly because Labor is committed to fighting crime that we will support this bill. At the same time, we will continue to work with our state and territory colleagues and with the government to tackle hand guns. Let me turn to the detail of this bill. The buyback will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states, with the Commonwealth meeting two-thirds of the cost. The total cost MAIN COMMITTEE",234,Asean Plus One Dialogue That Is China Plus The Asean Countries Specifically Directed
391,Mr Melham (Banks) (5.29 P.m.),"The National Handgun Buyback Bill 2003 appropriof the hand gun buyback to the Commonwealth is expected to be $69 million. The money will come out of the consolidated revenue fund. States will meet all the costs up front and will then seek reimbursement from the Commonwealth. A total of $15 million that was left over from the 1996 firearms buyback following the Port Arthur shootings remains unspent. The COAG agreement specifies that the hand gun buyback will be funded firstly from the $15 million left unspent, with the balance met on a two-thirds/one-third basis between the Commonwealth and each state. The remaining payments made by states will be funded on a costsharing basis, with the Commonwealth reimbursing two-thirds of the payments made by the states. The majority of payments are expected to be made in the 2003-04 financial year. The hand gun buyback will run from 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2003. The appropriation is for two main purposes: to reimburse states for payments made by them to compensate persons for their surrender of hand guns, hand gun parts and accessories during the hand gun buyback; and to reimburse states for payments made in connection with the hand gun buyback or with the Council of Australian Governments hand gun reforms. This bill also provides appropriation for the Commonwealth to make payments in relation to the implementation of the COAG hand gun reforms. I commend the bill to the House. Bill 2003. As the member for Banks mentioned, it essentially aims to allocate the funds needed to implement the Commonwealth’s undertakings under the COAG agreement and to provide for Commonwealth financial support for the national hand gun buyback program. Essentially, the Howard government has driven the efforts to strengthen the control of firearms-and that is something that I and the community I represent welcome-and also to reduce, in this case, the number of hand guns in our community. Specifically, the bill fully implements the Commonwealth’s commitments under the COAG hand gun reforms agreed in December 2002. It does this by initially seeking to draw on the $15 million left unspent from the 1996 firearms buyback program and then sharing the additional costs with the states and territories on the basis of two-thirds from the feds and one-third from the states and territories. In total, the bill is estimated to cost the Commonwealth about $69 million; the bulk of the expenditure will be in financial year 2003-04. The reason why the bulk of the expenditure will occur then is that the hand gun reforms have as their key feature the national buyback program that I mentioned earlier. That starts on 1 July this year and runs until the end of this calendar year, 31 December. There is a bit of work to be done, because this bill does not set that buyback arrangement in train; it provides the framework to implement not only the buyback arrangement but also some other elements of the agreement between the heads of government. The key feature that I would like to talk about today concerns the motive to have hand guns taken out of the broader community and to maintain the opportunity for sporting shooters with a legitimate need for hand guns to have access to them. There is also some law enforcement availability, which I will not go into here, but it was part of the 28 recommendations that the police ministers agreed upon before the COAG agreement. The funds provide for the states and territories that make a claim within 12 months of the conclusion of the buyback program to be reimbursed for the money they have provided as compensation for hand gun owners who have surrendered their guns, hand gun parts and some associated equipment. MAIN COMMITTEE",235,National Handgun Buyback Bill 2003
392,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (5.34 P.m.),"I rise to support the National Handgun BuybackThere are a couple of things I would like to touch on. We recall with some shock the episode at Monash University that highlighted public concern about the availability of hand guns in our community. I for one find it very hard to understand why a regular neighbourhood needs hand guns washing around in it. We have seen from the 1996 buyback program some evidence that the reduced availability of firearms purchased during the buyback program has resulted in a reduction in firearm related crimes. We are encouraged by that. Even though there are some residual concerns around theft of firearms and the like, this is unquestionably a positive step in the right direction. For those with a legitimate need to have access to hand guns-as I mentioned, sporting shooters and people in law enforcement areas-that availability will continue. Shops making available those firearms can continue to sell those firearms. In that respect, where the legitimate need is there, weapons will be available and those making them available at a retail level can continue to do so. Members would be aware that the discussions centred around what the banned list of firearms should be and what were recognised sport-shooting disciplines. That has been canvassed quite widely. I believe there is general consensus about the firearms that continue to be available. Some people have criticised this measure in that the individual that carried out that horrendous crime at Monash University had a range of hand guns and the banned list does not include every hand gun that individual had. What it does, though, is pick up those where there is no legitimate sporting reason to have one. Also, it puts in place a number of requirements on the states and territories to make sure that they are properly managing the firearms that are lawfully in the community. Part of the Commonwealth’s role is to fund the reimbursement of the states and territories not only for the money they have expended in compensating people but also for the funds that they have expended in direct connection with the recovery of these now unlawful firearms and in building awareness around the COAG reforms. All of that is positive news. Certainly, in the community I represent, fewer hand guns in the hands of people with no legitimate reason to have them is a good thing. This proposal passes with flying colours on the tests of what are we trying to achieve and who are we trying to please. Before those funds start flowing, the states and territories need to get their own acts together. An intergovernmental agreement will need to be entered into and the Commonwealth will need to be satisfied that the plans of the states and territories actually fulfil the undertakings all governments provided as part of the COAG agreement. There is a test there. It is amazing how state governments are frightfully interested in getting these things done in the lead-up to elections but once the dust from the election settles they are not so hasty in getting their act together. It is not long before the buyback timetable begins and there is still work to be done by a number of jurisdictions in demonstrating that they are in a position to implement these reforms and will fully satisfy the Commonwealth that the intergovernmental agreement meets the requirements of the COAG handguns decisions of December. In that light I would like to suggest and put on the table not only a need for these intergovernmental agreements to properly deal with the accountability and administrative procedures relating to the handgun buyback arrangement but also something that is not canvassed specifically in this bill but I think should be canvassed by the minister in his discussions with the states and territories. The 1996 guns buyback arrangement has been lauded as universally successful and it has made communities safer places. In my view, it has been implemented in MAIN COMMITTEE a suboptimal manner in the state of Victoria. I have evidence of firearms retailers who took compensation from the Australian taxpayers to supposedly close their business, only to open days later under another name. I detest that sort of behaviour and think most clear-thinking Australians would think likewise. To take compensation money provided by Australian taxpayers on the premise that they will no longer be in the business of selling firearms only to change their title from, for instance, Clayton Firearms and Fishing Pty Ltd to Clayton Trigger and TackleI do not find terribly clever; I find it quite repulsive. It is entirely inconsistent with the spirit of why that compensation has been made available. Sadly, it is not the only case of this kind in Victoria. The Western Australian government at the time had the wit to put in place what is a very basic commercial undertaking where any person buys a business. That basic commercial undertaking is that the person you are buying the business from will not open the same business within a certain distance or within a certain period of time. Otherwise, what are you buying? You are not buying much. You are certainly not buying the goodwill, because the person will go and open another business around the corner. In this case the Western Australian government recognised that that would be a suboptimal outcome. It recognised that if we were to pay Australian taxpayers’ money to businesses on the premise that they were shutting then they should shut. Not only were we buying the business’s goodwill, not only were we buying the unlawful stock, we were buying all the other stuff that was in that business, some of which was lawful, some of which was out of date, some of which was junky and some of which a competitive, contemporary retailer would not want on their shelves. What happened in some cases in Victoria? The administration of this program lacked the wit that the west had. What happened was that hundreds of thousands of dollars in some specific cases that I have brought to the minister’s attention were paid on the basis of these businesses shutting and they did not. There might have been some sweet little deal where one of the brothers or another family member rocked up and got a licence to trade and they opened. Some even advertised in shooting magazines: ‘If you thought we were out of business because we’ve taken the money, we’re not. We’re back, back in exactly the same place, and we’re going to use a thesaurus to find a new way to brand our business that makes it sound exactly like it was beforehand. And thank you for the several hundred thousand dollars. Thank you for taking off our hands, Australian taxpayers, crummy stock. Thank you for taking off our hands bits that we cannot get a decent return on. Thank you for cashing up our business so that we can be as competitive as we possibly can be selling the lawful product.’ Okay, you might think that is clever-I think that is too smart by half. WhatI also know is that it damages the decent people that did the right thing during the guns buyback program. John Miall at Mialls Gun Shop in Frankston is a classic case in point. That guy said, ‘If all these businesses are going to shut and there’s going to be a shrinking of the market, I’ll stay open. I’ll keep all the crummy side by sides and .22s that now no-one will want because they have to go through a quite rigorous licensing arrangement. I will stay open because I will be the only retailer in our region.’ What a surprise to find that his competitors, cashed up on taxpayers’ money, opened again, free of all the shrapnel stock that they could not sell and that was burning a hole in his pocket! He still had that stuff. His competitors-that were supposedly closed-reopened with premium stock. They had no shrapnel stuff that they could not sell-no last year’s gear, gun packets, daks, jackets or the associated paraphernalia that was MAIN COMMITTEE burning up cash in John Miall’s business. They did not have any of that. They were free. They were cashed up; they just cherry picked what they wanted and away they went. That is not good enough. The explanations that have been provided to me by the firearms registry in Victoria are pathetic. Mr Katter interjectingto take taxpayers’ money on the basis of doing something then they should do it. are some 11 people who have made those transgressions, and every single one of them had a sale in Queensland. same team, as rare as it is. Thank you for that. They might think I am your love child; I hope not. It is good to be on the same team on this one. The point we are making here is that that delivered suboptimal outcomes for the nation, for the policy-which was an excellent policy-for the serious real money Australian taxpayers put into it and for the businesspeople that did the right thing. That is what it delivered. We will be going through the intergovernmental agreement with the states and territories. They are all gung-ho in the lead-up to an election, but they are a bit slow now. But let us assume, in our immense generosity, that they will do the right thing and implement these reforms. When they do, let us not just check off the intergovernmental agreement against the COAG resolutions. Let us not just check off the intergovernmental agreement and the plans of the states and territories against the police ministers’ 28 recommendations-of, I think, a few months earlier than December. in 1996. If they did not do the right thing in 1996, let us ask why, when we have jurisdictions that did do the right thing. Then let us take some of the $15 million that was not spent from 1996 and soak up this stock that is now washing around in communities. Let us soak up the several thousand guns in my city of Frankston, held by John Miall at Mialls Gun Shop, at great concern to him and at the great displeasure of the Victorian firearm registry. Let us go and buy that crummy stock that no-one will want to buy now, that is burning a hole in his pocket, that represents a public safety risk and the single largest collection of firearms anywhere in the state of Victoria. Why has he got them? Because he did the right thing. He did not stooge the taxpayer. John Miall is as straight as a gun barrel. He is up against competitors who are cashed up and without the shrapnel stock he is carrying-and that is wrong. That is not what the outcome was meant to be. We have to get those firearms out of circulation. This bill is a further sensible step to improve safety and well-being and the appropriate availability of firearms where there is legitimate justification. This is a sensible measure. But let us go back and make sure the first bit of the picture is done well and done right. Let us provide some remedies to John Miall and whoever Bob Katter has been talking about-I am not as well versed on Queensland. MAIN COMMITTEE",236,National Handgun Buyback Bill 2003

Let us do the right thing. Let us reward the people that have done the right thing. Before we start spending $15 million on the hand gun buyback, let us spend some of it making sure the first buyback was finished properly. Let us soak up those thousands of firearms which need to be accounted for, stored and secured at the expense of the John Miall’s gun shop. Let us take that problem off his hands and let us take it out of the community that I represent. Then we will be moving forward in another stage of a very sensible firearm buyback regime. that allows for interventions. It may be more appropriate for the honourable member to seek to intervene rather than interject. us of that, because I was not aware of it until earlier today. I rise to speak on the National Handgun Buyback Bill 2003. I think many of us have been perturbed at some of the comments coming out of Indonesia. The opinion they voice is that the Americans should not have a base in Australia-and that is deeply disturbing. I sometimes wonder whether we people in northern Australia have a much greater sensitivity to these issues. In the last war, for those decision-that we be handed over to the Japanese. I do not think anyone in this place would deny that our nearest neighbour has a great deal of instability in their country. That always poses very great dilemmas for neighbouring countries. There is a similar instability in both halves of New Guinea. It is not a situation which Australia can walk away from. When I left boarding school, after finishing 12th grade, I was only 16 years of age. The next year I was touting an SLR rifle and on 24-hours call-up to go and fight Indonesians in Borneo. At that time, there were 150,000 good, serviceable SLR combat rifles. My view, as a person who has been reasonably familiar with firearms all of my life, and the view of my sergeant instructors in the Army is that the SLR is a good combat rifle. Standing behind those 150,000 rifles were a million semiautomatic firearms, which were available to the people of Australia if the terrible day arose when we had to defend our country. Australian security is in a much more tenuous situation now, and there are no 150,000 combat rifles; there are only 50,000 combat rifles. There are no one million semiautomatic rifles standing behind those combat rifles. There are no semiautomatic weapons at all in this country. As I have said before, people will curse the day that the people in this House carried out the actions that they did. One of my colleagues-and I do not want to mention his namerang me after parliament had adjourned for the night and said, ‘Turn on your television.’ I said, ‘I have already got it turned on.’ It was on SBS and a little old lady, who was on the Barbarossa campaign where the Germans invaded Russia, was being interviewed. The interviewer said to this little old lady, ‘Two-thirds of the population of your country were under German control; two-thirds of your army, three or three-and-a-half million men, were dead or in German prisons. The war was over.’ This little old lady said, ‘I didn’t know any of those things. I just got out the family rifle and went and shot a German soldier.’ He said, ‘Did they MAIN COMMITTEE",239,National Handgun Buyback Bill 2003

402,"Who Are Familiar With History, It Was Decided By Mr Curtin","and Mr Menzies reinforced hisretaliate?’ She said, ‘Yes, they picked three villagers at random and shot them dead.’ He said, ‘So you gave up shooting German soldiers?’ She said, ‘Ooh, no. I went and shot three German soldiers.’ He said, ‘And they retaliated?’ She said, ‘They got a small village, surrounded it, and shot every single inhabitant-102 people.’ The interviewer said, ‘So then you stopped shooting German soldiers?’ She said, ‘Ooh, no. I got some of my friends and they got their family rifles and we went and shot 102 German soldiers.’ I was very friendly with an Israeli colonel who was involved in the Six Day War. I said, ‘Those Arabs are not good fighters?’ He said, ‘The Arabs are the worse people in the world to fight against. You threw the whole might of the British Empire at them, and they never made it off the beaches.’ He was referring, of course, to Gallipoli-which was in fact true. He said, ‘They do not care. They just keep coming at you. You can kill them and more just keep coming.’ He said that a lot of their weaponry is very good, and they are people who are wellversed in warfare. I said, ‘How come you blokes win all the time?’ He said, ‘Because even if they can get an army of one million men together, when they take on Israel they take on an army of three million men.’ It is more than passing strange that, for the last century or two, the Swiss have been left alone. Let us turn to Switzerland. When I think of the great geniuses who dreamed up all these initiatives-and I have heard so many speakers say how wonderful it is to take all the guns off us-I think, ‘Don’t these people do any research?’ Don’t any of them make any effort to find out whether there is any intellectual basis for a decision of this nature? I have not done these figures recently but, the last time. I did, the country with the highest death rate from guns was East Germany, where private gun ownership was banned-at the time, under the Communist regime. In Switzerland, every single family has a semiautomatic weapon at home. Guess which country has the lowest death rate from guns in Europe? People say, ‘What about America?’ A very superficial answer to that question would be that America has a very high death rate from guns. But that is superficial. If you go and climb down to the coalface and find out which states have the high death rates from guns, you will find that states like Illinois-whose capital is Chicago-states like New York and places like Washington DC have the highest death rates from guns in the United States. In all of those places, guns are virtually banned. The states with the lowest death rates from guns are states like Arizona, Nevada and Texas, where there is little control on guns. If one makes a superficial analysis, one comes up with a crude conclusion: take away the guns and no-one will get killed with guns. If you are a halfwit and you do not do much thinking about things, I suppose that is a fair enough conclusion to come to. We need go no further than our own country to find similar figures. In the state of Queensland in the days of Bjelke-Petersen, there was no gun control at all. In the last year of Johannes, there were eight deaths from guns in Queensland. New South Wales, with twice Queensland’s population, should have had 16 deaths from guns; and Victoria, with a 40 per cent larger population than Queensland, should have had 12 deaths from guns. Did New South Wales have 16 deaths? No. Did they have 24 deaths? No. Did they have 36 deaths? No. They had 39 deaths from guns. So a state with a very restrictive gun regime had something like 300 per cent to 500 per cent more deaths from guns. So where is your argument that, by restrictive gun ownership, you are going to stop deaths from guns? Let me move to Victoria, with a 40 per cent larger population than Queensland. If Queensland had eight deaths, Victoria should MAIN COMMITTEE have had 12. Did they have 12? No. Did they have 24? No. Did they have 36? No. Did they have 48? No. They had 58 deaths from guns in 1988. So look no further than our own country for the answers. Many people felt very strongly about the new arrangements. The political party that I belonged to in those days was completely shattered, as was the ALP in New South Wales, and people reacted enormously strongly. It was not about guns so much as it was about the underlying principle that a person has the right to defend himself, his home and his family. If that right is taken away from him and is made exclusively the province of the people with uniforms-the government-that is a form of government which does not appeal to me. In countries where the only men who have guns are the men who wear uniforms, one has to be a little bit worried. Our laws in Australia have evolved. In Great Britain a Bill of Rights was written down in the 1600s. The American Constitution was signed in 1787. When wise men sit down and think hard about these things, in every single case-whether it was the UK Bill of Rights or the American Constitution-they have written into those great documents of human progress the right of the individual to bear arms as one of the most important rights that belong to people. If Mao Tse-Tung said anything that was correct, it is that power grows out of the barrel of a gun. If an individual-a private person-does not have that power, the state has all the power. If anyone in this place is serious and not just wanting to grandstand in front of the media about guns, they should look at the Tarasoff rule. In each of the three cases of Surry Hills, Port Arthur and Hoddle Street, the man responsible was clearly mentally unbalanced. He was well known to be mentally unbalanced and dangerous and to have firearms. The Tarasoff rule reverses the onus of proof, if you like, with respect to psychiatrists and psychologists. The Tarasoff rule says that, if a person elucidates a threat to somebody else specifically, the psychiatrist has a legal obligation to disclose. But, if the person is a danger only in a general sense-in the sense that he is a dangerous person and might run amok with a rifle-the Tarasoff rule works the other way, and the psychiatrist is bound by the obligations and responsibilities of his profession not to divulge anything at all. Clearly, on the basis of Surry Hills, Hoddle Street and Port Arthur, the Tarasoff rule needs to be reversed and addressed. To this very day no-one has done the slightest thing about coming to grips with the real problem, which would involve taking weapons out of the hands of dangerous people. I have been in hotel bars where people have been openly discussing the form of firearm they were going to buy. I took off like a scalded cat, I can tell you, because it sounded to me as though none of those discussions concerned firearms that anyone would consider to be legal. It seems to me that there is no difficulty whatsoever with a person getting a firearm. For those of us who have done shot firer training or military training with rifles, a good 20 or 22 minutes with a lathe is all you need to machine up a firearm. If you know a lot about firearms, you know that banning them is quite silly, because they are the very simplest of things to make. Explosives are also enormously simple to make. Naturally, I do not want to go into the details of that. One has to worry about the government of a country that is so mistrustful of its own citizens that it disarms them but so enormously trustful of its neighbours that it disarms the country. One really has to wonder about the sort of government our country has. Has this initiative been successful? Has anyone stood here and quoted the figures? I have not got the latest figMAIN COMMITTEE ures-they do not come out until tomorrow or Friday-but I have taken the three years before the gun buyback and the three years after. The average number of deaths with guns in the three years before was 55; the average number of deaths in the three years after was 58. So we disarmed the entire population of the country and saw an increase in the number of homicides with guns and an increase in the number of homicides overall-they rose from 308 to 310. The NHMP-the National Homicide Monitoring Program-quotes a figure of 381 homicides for this year, up from an average of 308 before the gun buyback. These figures indicate that the program was an absolute, abject and miserable failure. It was never going to take the guns from the people that kill people with guns, but it was most certainly going to take the guns off those who wanted to protect their wife and kids in their home or maybe those who were bought up in a culture and a bush tradition in which having a gun had always been part of their lives-and those people resented very strongly having family heirlooms taken off them and bent. At no stage during any of this debate have I seen any of this material argued or any of this material trotted out. I was quite amazed to find out that no-one had even rung up the Institute of Criminology. IfI am wrong-as the honourable member putting his hand up suggests-I stand corrected, but that was the information that they provided to me. Nobody worried about finding out whether it had been successful in Europe, whether it had been successful in America or whether it had been successful in Australia. Nobody worried about that and nobody seems to worry that we are now down to 50,000 fairly awful combat weapons to defend the country with. For those who say that modern warfare is not about a man with rifle, people of my age remember that the greatest military power threw the most sophisticated technology on earth at a little country in South-East Asia whose people belted the living daylights out of the people with the technology and the vast armada of resources because they were people that believed in what they were doing and had access to a rifle. That is what enabled the Russian people to fight off the criminal oppression of the Germans in the late 1930s and early 1940s. It is what has enabled country after country on earth to stay free and independent and to protect its citizens. All of those rights have been taken away from us in this country-our right to collectively protect ourselves and our right to individually protect ourselves. There is no sense of sincerity here. If there was, the Tarasoff rule would have been addressed, as it should have been addressed, on numerous occasions in the past. It was not addressed at Surry Hills, it was not addressed at Hoddle Street and it was not addressed after Port Arthur. There was a feeding of the media frenzy-that is all it was. A lot of people got their names in the paper and made big reputations for themselves, but history has a funny way of turning around and biting people, and I suspect that that is what is going to happen in this case. Let me conclude by referring to one of the great advocates of taking all the arms from everybody-the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie. He interjected when I was speaking in the state house in Queensland. The issue was so enormously unpopular that only two speakers were going to speak on it. What Mr Goss was doing was very mild, actually, compared with what followed. I said, ‘ Mr Beattie, suppose you’re in Surry Hills and this person is wandering around with a machine gun blowing everybody apart. What would you do if you had your wife and kids to protect?’ He said, ‘I’d call the police.’ I said, ‘You’d call police! That is very good. I was waiting for you to say that. It was very foolish of you to say that, Mr Beattie, beMAIN COMMITTEE cause in Surry Hills the man had a shotgun.’ For those of you who do not know, a shotgun can be heard a kilometre away. Everybody in those units knew that death was approaching them. Of course, they rang the police immediately. The police arrived some 40 or 50 minutes later, when the murderer had walked up the street and was having a cappuccino-after some seven or eight people had been murdered with no ability whatsoever to protect or defend themselves. That ability is now a monopoly of the state. We have made a terrible error and we are continuing in that error today. Bill 2003 and to quickly reiterate some of its provisions. The bill fulfils the Commonwealth’s commitment to the implementation of the Council of Australian Governments hand gun reforms. The buyback means that sporting shooters and dealers who surrender prohibited guns, parts and related accessories will receive fair compensation. With this legislation the government has moved to implement the agreement, as has been elaborated on already. I think that the point the Prime Minister made at the COAG conference is important. He recognised the importance of balance-and I want to come back to the question of balance-when he said: The sporting shooters have been properly accommodated and I think any reasonable sporting shooter will see this as a fair outcome. The buyback encompasses a whole range of points-including, as I say, sporting shooters and dealers. There will be an amnesty during the second half of this year. The bill also brings in a number of important provisions to deal with matters that arose from the tragedy at Monash University. It outlines the participation rates for sporting shooters who wish to continue to use acceptable hand guns. It also talks about the role of historical collectors, a group who have some very significant collections of great historical importance not only in their own right but also as part of early Australian history. The bill deals with the question of consultation, which I think is a very important point. The Commonwealth has established a Sporting Shooters Advisory Council which seeks to get the views of sporting shooters and others affected by the changes. This includes representatives from the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, Pistol Australia, the Australian Shooters Association and the National Dealers and Traders Council, which have all been consulted on the reform package. The historical collectors have also been consulted through the Historic Arms Collectors Council of Australia. Clearly there will be an ongoing need for the Commonwealth and the states to work together, because of the divided responsibilities of these laws. I pick up the point that the member for Dunkley made about the need for an intergovernmental agreement on some of the problems that still have not been fully resolved from the earlier buyback of long arms. I will now go into a bit more detail on a couple of these points. While it has been said that dealers will be properly compensated, there are nonetheless some concerns about what exactly that compensation will be. In particular the concern is that people who decide that they are going to exit from the sport of pistol shooting-either because some of the pistols that have been legal in the past will have to be handed in and will be compensated for or because it becomes too onerous to meet the requirements for accreditation-should be compensated for all their pistols, because clearly they can no longer participate in the sport because of the changes in the law. It would be only fair-and, I believe, good policy-to fully compensate MAIN COMMITTEE",240,National Handgun Buyback Bill 2003
403,Mr Hawker (Wannon) (6.09 P.m.),"I rise to support the National Handgun Buybackthem for getting right out of pistol shooting, even if that means getting rid of firearms that are still legal if you carry the right licences. That brings me to the second point. With the change in the law there will be some dealers who may be sent out of business. Consultations with people involved suggest that it would be less than 10 dealers Australia wide, but nonetheless they will need to be compensated, and the first port of call will clearly be the governments of the states where those people operate. To date the state governments have been fairly tardy-certainly the Victorian government has been very tardy-in admitting that they have any responsibility. Another point is that ammunition for guns that are going to be prohibited clearly will no longer have any value in Australia. It makes good sense for there to be compensation for that. Apart from anything else, we all know that many of these prohibited hand guns and other weapons will still be circulating in the community, albeit illegally, and that ammunition would clearly find a home if it were not brought back in. I think there is a very important point there. It is important to recognise that, through this legislation, we still are not dealing with the black market. It is also significant to note that part of the problem with illegal firearms, particularly hand guns, relates to the tardiness of some state governments-particularly New South Wales-to deal with relevant issues. Hand guns that were being taken out of circulation in Victoria, for example, were going across the border in parts and being reassembled. Under New South Wales law, it is suggested that thousands of hand guns-about 8,000, it is suggested-just disappeared on to the black market because the New South Wales government refused to take the hint when it was told this was going to happen. It refused to act and refused to change its laws. This avenue for people wanting to get rid of these pistols was there. People could sell them into New South Wales. It was quite legal to do it in Victoria, but in New South Wales they disappeared and were no longer on the register. It is also important to keep some perspective on this. One of the points to remember is that hand guns have been strictly controlled in Australia since 1926. It is equally important to recognise that, notwithstanding that, we still have tragedies; that is why we have had these changes to the law. I now come to the question of how we might get some balance in this whole question of firearm regulation. In its annual report on the National Homicide Monitoring Program, the Australian Institute of Criminology noted that only one registered hand gun was used in homicides during the period 2001-02. That was the year before the Monash incident. The point is that it was one registered hand gun. It does not say that hand guns were not being used. Of 48 offenders using a firearm to commit homicide during 2001-02, only five were licensed to own a firearm-in other words, 10 per cent. Only four used a registered firearm, and one offender actually used a firearm that was licensed and registered to the victim. Only one of the registered firearms used to commit a homicide was a pistol. The rest were rim-fire rifles or double-barrel shotguns. The institute also made the point that licensed firearm owners are not responsible for the majority of firearm related homicides. In over 90 per cent of the firearm related homicides, the offenders were not licensed and the weapons were not registered. In other words, the black market is thriving; the people who live on the other side of the law are the ones who are causing 90 per cent of the offences. Not one hand gun used in a homicide between 1997 and 1999 was used by a licensed owner. MAIN COMMITTEE I make that point because I want to compare that with what are nothing more than barefaced lies from some of the people who claim to be concerned about firearms in the community. Let me give one example, the National Coalition for Gun Control. On 16 June last year, Samantha Lee said on radio ‘that most of our violent crime in Australia is committed by licensed shooters’. The facts from the Australian Institute of Criminology show quite clearly that that is patently false. It is an utter lie, yet it seems that some people think they can get away with it. Let me look at the work that has been done by the Australian Institute of Criminology and at an article called ‘Australia: a massive buy-back of low risk guns’ by Peter Reuter and Jenny Mouzos. The statistics are quite interesting. In the last 20 years, firearm homicides have dropped from about 40 per cent of all homicides to little more than 15 per cent. In other words, over the last 20 years, there has been a steady decline of homicides where firearms are involved. I also want to refer to a chart about suicide, because that issue is also often cited in relation to the issue of firearms. While the level of suicide has not declined in the last 20 years-in fact, tragically, it has gone up a bit-the proportion of suicides involving a firearm has dropped. The level of people using firearms for suicide is less than half of what it was 20 years ago. Another point that comes from the statistics used by Peter Reuter and Jenny Mouzos is that, if you look at the proportion of armed robberies by type of weapon over the last 20 years, firearm involvement has been dropping and the use of other weapons is rising. The use of knives is considerably greater than that of any other weapon and is rising. In fact, knives have gone from a little over 50 per cent to significantly higher proportions while the number of armed robberies using a firearm has dropped by half. So by any measure, when we look at those figures we can see that there has been a steady drop in the use of firearms over the last 20 years-not just in the last few years-and that trend has been going on for some time. A press release from the Institute of Criminology dated 3 April says: In 2001-2002 there was a 25 per cent decrease in the use of firearms to commit homicide. Further on, amongst its findings, it says: Compared to previous years, a knife or some other sharp instrument was consistently the most common type of weapon used to commit homicide (36%). The next most common weapon/method was the use of assaultive force (25%). I now come to a very interesting paper written by a professor of criminology from the University of Vienna, Dr Franz Csaszar, in which he goes into considerably more detail than I can today. I want to quote some of his concluding remarks because I think when we are talking about getting the balance into this debate we have got to remember that in getting that balance we also have to look at what the effort of society ought to be to deal with crime-armed crime and not just firearms crime. In his conclusions, Dr Csaszar comes up with some fairly interesting points. He talks about getting a balance and about the risks of that, and that if we go too far with arms reduction we will be stimulating and enlarging an illegal black market. He also talks about the fact that there is considerable evidence of that and says: MAIN COMMITTEE Moreover there is sufficient evidence for the possibility of increased criminal misuse of guns following a radical disarmament of legal gun owners, by giving violence-prone criminals an ever greater advantage. And he talks about what he means by ‘advantage’ in the paper. Another conclusion he has is: … a reduction in the number of guns available is of no measurable influence on the incidence of other harmful events. An example is provided by the occurrence of suicides ... That is reinforced by the statistics of the Australian Institute of Criminology. He goes on to talk about the costs and benefits given the scarcity of state resources looking into gun control and the difficulty of diverting ‘scarce resources away from other, more important duties’. He makes another point which I think is quite significant: … every single new restriction on the way towards ever stricter gun control might be viewed as small and reasonable, in total it will amount to a serious impairment of basic civil rights for everyone. The tenet that the law abiding has nothing to fear from the state holds no longer true against a growing tendency to view the very people as basically suspect. All these tendencies, which are growing in other fields than the issue of private gun ownership too, will on the long run destroy the very roots of a free and democratic society of reasonable and responsible citizens. In the long term, there is a clear warning there about what could happen if we go too far with gun control. Franz Csaszar is certainly not against sensible gun control, but he does say that we should be looking at the right balance. I think what he says in conclusion makes the point very clearly. He says: In practice, the efficiency of gun control seems to be coupled with social acceptance. This basis suffered from an ever faster succession of ever more restrictions in most cases enacted under severe media pressure. Very often it is obvious that a new provision is far off the mark of a real problem. For instance, when neglect in administering existing laws is hidden behind the new laws or when a new law is called for before the latest law has even come into effect. The member for Dunkley spoke about one aspect of that. If we look at it from a number of points of view, I think it is quite a valid point. There is another point that I would like to touch on in terms of the buyback that we had in 1998 and some of the statistics that came from that-again from the Institute of Criminology and adapted from the Attorney-General’s Department. When you look at the total buyback of the long arms-there were nearly 660,000 firearms collected at a cost of $360 million-you see that the proportion of buyback varied quite significantly from state to state. As an example, in New South Wales, the number of guns per 100,000 of population in the buyback was 2400, or 2.4 per cent, and in Victoria it was 4,300, or 4.3 per cent. This does beg the obvious question: is firearms ownership that different between New South Wales and Victoria? I would have to dispute that that is not necessarily the case, because Victoria and South Australia both had the same rate. The significant thing is that both Victoria and South Australia had firearm registration in place before the Port Arthur tragedy, yet New South Wales did not. While one can only go on anecdotal evidence, one really has to wonder whether in fact the number of now illegal and unregistered firearms in New South Wales is proportionately higher. If we look at the statistics we find that Queensland was somewhere in between, Western Australia was low and Tasmania was the highest. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate these tables in Hansard. Leave granted. MAIN COMMITTEE The tables read as followsTable 4-3.

MAIN COMMITTEE MAIN COMMITTEE do want to open up that wider debate, because I think that, when it comes to gun control, we do have to keep it in perspective. We have to recognise that, these days, law-abiding citizens are only one group of firearm owners. There are illegal ones out there and the numbers are probably significant. We cannot be definitive about that, but when we look at some of the international work that has been done on gun control, particularly from the Professor of Criminology of Vienna University, we see quite clearly that if we go past the optimum level of gun control it can be quite counterproductive and have some adverse effects, particularly in the long term, with respect to the society we want to have. I am pleased to support this bill. to appropriate funding for a national hand gun buyback program commencing on 1 July 2003. The Greens support the idea of such a program but believe it is destined to fail for a variety of reasons. We support the government’s aim to improve public safety by attempting to remove from the community the dangers presented by semiautomatic hand guns. However, while this bill goes part of the way towards achieving this end, it will unfortunately only reduce the risk to the community to a limited extent. Indeed, the National Coalition for Gun Control is calling the government’s buyback scheme a waste of time and money. While the Greens do not entirely agree with this statement, we recognise that the proposed buyback has severe limitations. This bill arose out of the tragic event that took place at Monash University on 21 October 2002, resulting in the deaths of two people and the wounding of five. Many more lives were traumatised in connection with this incident. As a result of this tragedy, the Prime Minister announced a proposal to further strengthen gun laws in Australia in cooperation with the states and territories. During question time the day after the shootings at Monash, the Prime Minister said that there was independent evidence suggesting that the federal gun buyback scheme that followed the Port Arthur tragedy had successfully reduced the murder rate involving guns in Australia. The Greens have always supported and will always support the banning of guns and dangerous weapons, as we believe that this is one of the ways in which we can protect our communities from violence. This bill seeks to remove from the community some of those hand guns that are not used in genuine sports shooting. I wish to draw a clear distinction between the interests of gun owners generally and sporting shooters more specifically. The interests of genuine sporting shooters should be taken into account. The rights and interests of gun owners who are not genuine sporting shooters should be secondary to the long-term safety of the whole community. The safety of the community is paramount. We support the government in this attempt towards lessening the availability of hand guns in the community. However, we are of the firm view that this proposed legislation represents a compromise that inexcusably and unacceptably jeopardises the safety of the community. The National Coalition for Gun Control claims that the proposal developed by the Council of Australian Governments last November will not reduce the number of semiautomatic, military style hand guns in the community, but will merely reduce the types of semiautomatic hand guns in our community. The buyback initiated in 1996 successfully reduced the numbers of high powered, semiautomatic firearms in Australia. However, this current proposal will simply act as a means of gun owners trading one type of semiautomatic weapon for another. MAIN COMMITTEE",244,National Handgun Buyback Bill 2003

405,Mr Organ (Cunningham) (6.29 P.m.),"The National Handgun Buyback Bill 2003 seeksThe government is only banning certain models of semiautomatic, military style hand guns. Two hundred and fifty hand gun models will be banned. However, 850 will remain legal. Under this proposal, the banned hand guns will be handed in in exchange for monetary compensation. This monetary compensation can then be used to buy any of the other 850 semiautomatic hand gun models that will remain legal. When the buyback scheme is activated, many gun owners will most likely trade their shorter barrel hand guns for something with a longer and more accurate barrel length. As the National Coalition for gun control stated in their press release today: The new legislation will be a waste of money and resources and should not be considered a buyback but a trading post for hand gun owners to trade in their old, unpopular hand gun for a newer, more macho model. The Greens are concerned that this proposed hand gun buyback will fail to make any impact on reducing hand gun violence in our community. Most illegal guns start out as legal weapons which are then stolen-like Kerry Packer’s gun, which was stolen from his office. The government has congratulated itself for acting to address the tragedy of the Monash University shooting and deal with the threat posed by the misuse of legally registered hand guns. We are concerned that semiautomatic hand guns that have been excluded from the banned list include models that the perpetrator of the Monash shootings owned. The community deserves an explanation as to why this is the case. The poll taken after the Monash University shootings indicated that there is 83 per cent support for the banning of semiautomatic hand guns in Australia. I call on the government to finish the job that it began in 1996 after the Port Arthur massacre and to ban all semiautomatic firearms. There are well over 150,000 legal hand guns in Australia, and the proposed hand gun ban will leave many of them fully legal. Each state government was meant to have legislation in place by July to support and implement this hand gun buyback scheme. As yet, Victoria is the only state to do so. The Prime Minister must get tough with the states and make sure semiautomatic handguns get the same treatment that semiautomatic rifles received after the Port Arthur massacre. Following that tragic episode in our history, the Australian Institute of Criminology issued a report which found that the national gun buyback scheme significantly helped cut the number of murders involving firearms. Six hundred and forty-two thousand firearms were handed in during the one-year gun control program introduced after the April 1996 Port Arthur massacre of 35 people by gunman Martin Bryant. The federal government spent half a billion dollars in compensation for that scheme, which aimed to diminish the number of self-loading and pump action rifles similar to that used at Port Arthur. The Treasurer has been quoted as saying the gun control measures have saved lives. He said: Prior to the Port Arthur massacre, almost unseen and invisibly a gun culture had been developing in this country, a gun culture which, but for that awful tragedy, would have been unchecked, would have grown so strong it would have been in an invincible position. After the gun buyback scheme post the Port Arthur massacre, there was a consequence that no-one predicted: an increasing availability of hand guns, which have become the criminals’ weapon of choice in shootings, murders and armed robberies. With this point in mind, unless the government takes a tougher stand on hand guns, the supposed ban on semiautomatic hand guns announced last year is headed for failure, and the Australian public will witness further MAIN COMMITTEE tragedies at the hands of licensed semiautomatic hand guns owners. As the National Coalition for Gun Control has pointed out, a weak government acts once an incident has happened; a strong government acts before a tragedy occurs. support the National Handgun Buyback Bill 2003. And it gives me pleasure to be part of the Howard government, which has delivered on so many policies for the Australian people. When people look back in decades to come upon the legacy of the Howard government, they will recognise a government which acted very positively in relation to many issues. The gun buyback scheme, as it has operated in its various forms since 1996, and now with the support of this bill, will be one of those legacies. The Howard government has as its hallmark the aim, I suppose, of providing for a safe and more secure society which all Australians will have the opportunity to enjoy. This scheme is part of delivering that aim. This government has very much been about providing for families, and we saw that most recently in the form of the budget, where we provided for an environment for families to prosper. We have seen it through the Tough on Drugs strategy and we have seen it through the gun buyback system, which commenced in 1996. This bill enables the Commonwealth to appropriate funds to reimburse the states for payments to buy back hand guns and for payments made in connection with the Council of Australian Governments-COAG-hand gun reforms. The total indicative cost of the hand gun buyback program to the Commonwealth is expected to be $69 million. This is to be appropriated out of the consolidated revenue fund. The buyback period runs from 1 July to 31 December this year. In this latest bill, the federal government builds upon the very positive result that arose out of the 1996 program. Between 1996 and 1997, 640,000 guns were handed in. The program was a great success, despite some of the words similar to those that I heard earlier from the member for Cunningham and also the member for Capricornia, who seek to politicise this process to serve their own purposes by spreading around rumours, untruths and conspiracy theories which provide no positive input to this argument. I want to touch on some of the things that the member for Capricornia said, because I had the very disturbing benefit of being able to listen to his speech and to hear some of his wacky ideas that we quite regularly hear in headline-grabbing exercises by the member for Capricornia. The member for Capricornia subscribes to all sorts of conspiracy theories; this is but one. working, dedicated and decent member for Capricornia. Of course I speak of the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter, and his wacky ideas. It is all coming together now. People understand what it is that I am talking about. They would have seen his contributions before and they would have heard some of his conspiracy theories in relation to our near neighbours in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia and his belief that he must not sleep well at night and he must keep his gun loaded under the pillow, fearing attack or some sort of revolution from the north or the north-west. It is, of course, a conspiracy theory that is run round by only the wackiest in our society, and he certainly fills that criterion. It is important, I think, that we spell that out in this debate, because this very sensible program and policy is about providing for a safer community for all Australians. It is only a matter of common sense that if guns-hand guns, MAIN COMMITTEE",250,Peter Reuter And Jenny Mouzos

408,Mr Dutton,"I am sorry-my mistake. I apologise most sincerely to the very hardlongarms or whatever the case may be-are removed from our society, then it provides for a much safer environment for all Australians, including young families. We have problems in our country, as we do right around the world, with people who have mental health issues being in possession of hand guns. That is one of the great aspects that this gun buyback scheme addresses. By removing those hand guns and those longarms, as we have done since 1996, we achieve in some way the desired effect of removing those guns from people who should not have them. This society also deals with a great number of domestic violence and alcohol related issues both in domestic scenes and in a broader sense. We know the tragedies that can arise when alcohol and illicit drugs come together, and we know the tragedies that can arise when someone who may not be completely in charge of their faculties is in possession of a hand gun. If this program serves to lessen the effects of one of those incidents, I think all Australians would be very happy. We have a scenario which was raised by the member for Cunningham, who was talking about sporting shooters. They are, of course, an important part of Australian societyparticularly those people who go on to represent Australia in a similar way to the way athletes from other sports do. The Howard government has been very conscious of trying to protect the rights of those people, because it is important for those people to be able to practise and to hone their skills in their attempts to represent their state or their country in that sport. It is very important that we recognise their concerns and that we recognise the benefits that they bring through their incredible talents. That is part of what this government has provided. I spoke before about this government’s desire to provide for a healthier, happier, more secure and safer environment for all Australians. I want to reinforce, with some third-party endorsements, what this government is doing through this national hand gun buyback legislation. Professor Peter Reuter from the University of Maryland and Jenny Mouzos from the Australian Institute of Criminology conducted a study which concluded that the previous weapons buyback introduced by this government dramatically reduced the rates of gun murders and robberies. They concluded that it was possible that the government’s past gun controls and buyback reduced the overall homicide rate by 10 per cent. Between 1989 and the buyback in 1996 there were six mass killings in Australia in which a gun was the murder weapon. In 1993, 37 per cent of armed robbers used a firearm and by 2000 the proportion had declined to 14 per cent. So there are some very definite and clear indicators that the government’s policy is working-coupled with the fact that, as I said before, 640,000 weapons were handed in between 1996 and 1997, which serves to show how successful this policy has been. I will touch briefly on some of the hand gun crime statistics in Queensland to show how serious the problem of hand guns really is in Australian society. In 2001 the following crimes were committed using firearms. There were 49 murders in Australia, four of which were committed in Queensland, using firearms. There were 132 attempted murders Australia wide, 23 of which were committed in Queensland, using firearms. There were 1,686 armed robberies in Australia, 270 of which were conducted in Queensland. There were 867 assaults with a firearm, 118 of which were in Queensland. Across Australia there were 37 sexual assaults and 69 kidnappings involving hand guns. All of that highlights the fact that hand guns are a very serious issue in our society. This government will again serve the purpose of providing for a safer community and it should be commended for that. It is also appropriate at this time to call MAIN COMMITTEE on the states to come quickly into line with their obligations by 1 July. That is a very important part of this process. I conclude by reiterating my support for this bill and the fact that it is very important not just to the people of Dickson but to people right across Australia that, if we are to provide for a safer community for families and for all Australians to enjoy, it is imperative that we continue to pursue this good policy of reducing the number of hand guns, which are a problem in Australian society. I commend the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice and Customs for this progressive legislation and I commend the Prime Minister, who started this whole program back in 1996 following the tragic circumstances that have been outlined to the House on many occasions. piece of legislation which has gone to the very heart of the rights and responsibilities of all Australians. It is not surprising that, as a National Party MP, I want to speak on this legislation. I do so because it is a matter of concern and interest to my constituency of Hinkler and to the rural sector in general. I can assure those people that the national gun buyback affects only sporting shooters, hand gun dealers and to some extent historical collectors. Farmers, graziers, members of the armed forces, police and security agencies are not impacted in any way. I imagine that my office would be one of many which have been contacted by members of the public concerning their right to possess firearms. I have no argument with right-minded people who use hand guns for legitimate reasons and with due regard for safety and responsibility. I certainly do not want any of the misunderstandings that took place at the time of the last buyback. However, in the aftermath of the tragic shootings at Monash University on 21 October last year, the last thing the coalition intends is that other shooters should be treated, or feel that they are being treated, like criminals. It is individuals such as the person who carried out the Monash shootings that this legislation targets. In that specific instance a young man walked into a university tutorial room armed with two hand guns-a revolver and a semiautomatic-and proceeded to kill two students and injure four other students and one of the tutorial staff. He was a licensed shooter who legally owned seven high-powered pistols, including a Smith and Wesson Magnum, a CZ nine-millimetre semiautomatic and a Taurus .40-calibre semiautomatic. I find it difficult to believe that any person could possibly justify owning so many hand guns. It is hard to countenance the purchase of six hand guns in as many months. It is even harder to countenance that this was done under a licence regime. It must be acknowledged that this disturbed young man, a novice and only a minor gun club participant, should not have had access to so many hand guns. It is one of the sad truisms that, when countries need to reregulate gun laws or instigate buyback schemes, it is generally the law-abiding citizens who comply. Sadly, the criminals do not seem to operate under the same constraints. Nevertheless, another truism is that, if you remove unnecessary weaponry from the community, it becomes a much safer community. However, all this must be balanced by the right of law-abiding citizens who have a legitimate use for a hand gun-be it for sport, competition or civic protection-to exercise that right. One particular interest group that springs to mind is the Sporting Shooters’ Association of Australia, a highly respected body with 125,000 members around the nation. It has worked closely with the government to craft these proposals. There has been a multistepped approach. MAIN COMMITTEE",252,Peter Reuter And Jenny Mouzos
409,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (6.48 P.m.),"The National Handgun Buyback Bill 2003 is aFirst, the government met with established parties through the interim advisory committee comprised of firearm dealers, sporting shooters and the like. The next step will be to refer its deliberations to the Sporting Shooters Advisory Council, a forum to bring matters to the government. When through this process the principles are established, they will become the subject of another intergovernmental agreement, and the states will implement the laws and regulations. Let me talk about another community group that I believe has to be considered in the context of responsible hand gun ownership. I refer here to Australia’s historic re-enactment groups and black powder clubs. There has been little reference to them in the talk about the legislation, and I would just like to put in a plug for them. I have one of these groups in my electorate: the Early Settlers Re-Enactment Club, which is based around Gladstone. They put on public displays of historical firearms, competitions and demonstration firings. They use period costumes such as early military uniforms and early American settler uniforms, and they fire their weaponry against a backdrop of colonial and pioneering imagery. It is a very fine club. I have visited them and enjoyed my outings there. I cannot see that, just because they might have muzzle loading weapons of a higher calibre, they should be excluded from this particular activity. I feel that they should be treated as a sporting shooters group. The upshot of the negotiations between interest groups, state governments and the Commonwealth that began in November last year was a piece of legislation that ensures that genuine sporting shooters can continue their chosen sport and not be adversely affected by changes which promote greater public safety. The coalition has put forward a number of proposals which give due recognition to thousands of law-abiding, responsible sporting shooters who want to ensure the sport is both safe and respected. The advisory council to which I referred before was established as the first step in the Commonwealth’s response to ensure that legitimate shooters are seen as a responsible element in society. After all, it is the shooters and the shooting clubs who have the greatest interest in seeing their sport properly controlled and administered and held in public respect. Sporting shooters are also the people closest to the problems, who best understand the loopholes in existing laws and regulations which need to be closed. Indeed, pistol clubs proactively raised some concerns surrounding safer methods of using hand guns in the community. For example, I know that pistol clubs have been concerned that they do not have the legal power to reject or expel members who they consider are unsuitable. It is important to mention in regard to this legislation that clubs should be given the authority to scrutinise potential members. I understand that two character references are going to be required in some states as part of the regulations. I just hope that we have sensible measures which give the clubs a measure of control to identify responsible shooters but which do not become so onerous that they spoil the sport and make it burdensome to own a pistol. The Commonwealth is in agreement with many of these concerns and understands that Australians need to be safe from people who use firearms inappropriately. But by the same token we do not want law-abiding and responsible gun owners treated as criminals. This bill actions those intentions by way of prohibiting the importation, possession and use by sporting shooters of small concealable hand guns above .38 calibre and those with a magazine capacity in excess of 10 rounds. In turn, gun owners who surrender applicable weapons between 31 July and 31 December this year will be fairly compensated, using the $15 million surplus MAIN COMMITTEE from the 1996 firearms buyback scheme and then on a two for one basis with the Commonwealth, states and territories. These terms have met with consensus from the Australasian Police Ministers Council, have been endorsed by COAG and will be implemented by all the states and territories. I do have three minor concerns. It is good to see the minister here, and I hope that these are included. My only fear with this legislation-and I did have some reservations about the previous buyback-is that there is the possibility of unintended consequences, as we go through these various steps and processes and then pass those on to the states for implementation. There are three areas of concern that I would like to make sure do not become unintended consequences. First, a lot has been said about Commonwealth Games and Olympic shooting. We do celebrate those people, and they brought a lot of credit to Australia. But there are, within the sporting shooters organisations and other pistol clubs, people who shoot other weapons for competition in quite a legitimate way-even though those particular competitions may not have a national or an international flavour to them. I do not think those people should be excluded, providing the pistols stay within the calibre restrictions. The second group, the one I referred to in my speech, is the historical clubs-not just the historical collecting clubs but the historical clubs who fire those weapons, like muzzle loading weapons of various calibres. They are sometimes referred to as black powder clubs. They too should be able to pursue their sport in a legitimate way. I have always found them very responsible in the way they conduct their affairs. The third group is the rural community. Although we are assured that this legislation does not refer to them-and I have checked with the National Farmers Federation, and it is quite content that this legislation does not further restrict farmers’ use of hand guns-I would like to make a plea to the minister that we make doubly sure that, as this legislation cascades down through the various levels of committee to government to COAG and back to the states and territories, we do not see some of the unintended consequences that occurred in the first gun buyback. Those that restricted legitimate use of weapons by primary producers, especially those in the grazing and fishing industries. I support the bill, and I hope it goes a long way to removing unnecessary weaponry from the community. At the same time, I hope it respects the legitimate rights of people who participate in gun clubs, pistol clubs and the like. I also hope that the people in those three other groups that I have referred to do not become in any way the victims of some unintended consequences. bate, I would like to thank those honourable members who have spoken: the members for Banks, Cook, Cunningham, Dunkley, New England, Kennedy, Wannon, Dickson and Hinkler. I thank the member for Banks and the opposition for their support of the bill, and I thank those other members who have supported it. There were a few points made during the debate that I think it is appropriate to comment on. I will endeavour to do that briefly. The member for Cunningham said that he supports the bill but that it does not go far enough because it does not take enough guns out of the community. This buyback is but one step towards reducing the number of firearms in our community. The COAG reforms do not prevent Australian sporting shooters from participating in their sport. I recognise there will be sporting shooters replacing their 0.5-inch calibre pistols with 0.38-inch calibre weapons. But the reforms will achieve the goal of removing small, concealable or high-powered hand guns MAIN COMMITTEE",254,Peter Reuter And Jenny Mouzos
410,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General) (7.01 p.m.)-in reply-In closing this denot used in sports shooting from the community and will tighten access to ensure only genuinely committed sporting shooters continue their sport. The member for Wannon picked up a theme which was a feature of the 1996 debate. He said that very few licensed shooters commit criminal acts with firearms, yet they are being targeted by these reforms. I do not think that is really a fair representation of the objectives of the legislation. The government agrees that the sports shooting community is typically law abiding, and we made that point many times during the 1996 debate. But it must be remembered that the Monash incident was carried out by a person who was a licensed shooter and legally owned seven hand guns, a number of which were of a concealable nature-something the member for Hinkler just mentioned. This horrible act necessitated a review of the manner in which shooters are allowed to access hand guns. The buyback reduces the pool of hand guns that could ultimately end up in the illegal market and be used for criminal acts. The member for Wannon pointed out that only a proportion of firearms related crime is committed by licensed shooters. However, the statistics indicate that large numbers of firearms move from the legal to the illegal markets every year, primarily through theft. Statistics from the Australian Institute of Criminology show that between 1994 and 2000 an average of 4,195 firearms were stolen each year, and 81 per cent of these were taken from residential properties. The member for Wannon was concerned about illegal hand guns, as I am sure are all members of the House. He was concerned to ensure that there is a balance between what is being removed from those lawfully holding hand guns and those unlawfully holding hand guns. This is an important issue. The government recognises that no single measure can prevent firearms crime or improve community safety overnight. This is why the government is committed to pursuing a multifaceted and balanced approach to firearms reforms, working with state and territory governments to achieve a safer and more secure Australia. This multifaceted approach has a number of projects involved in it. There will be an urgent review of the storage and security arrangements in the states and territories under the auspices of the Australasian Police Ministers Council. State-of-the-art X-ray facilities will be introduced. There will be a cross-border trafficking offence and restrictions on the stock of handguns that can be imported and held by dealers, thereby diminishing the risk of large-scale theft from dealers, and there will be increased penalties for the illegal importation of firearms. The implementation of interstate, cross-border firearm trafficking offences will see penalties of substantial dimensions: 10 years imprisonment or a fine of $275,000. The Australian Crime Commission is establishing, as a matter of priority, a multijurisdictional task force to investigate firearms trafficking. The member for Kennedy implied that a restriction on guns does not prevent deaths with guns. This buyback targets those firearms that are readily concealable and, therefore, are more appealing for use in crime. Restricting such dangerous weapons will reduce deaths and injuries from firearms. Figures recently released from the Australian Institute of Criminology do not match those from the member for Kennedy. As outlined by the member for Wannon, firearms murder has actually decreased from 99 incidents in 1996 to 49 incidents in 2001. As the member for Dickson has already informed us, the 1996 buyback did have a positive impact on firearms crime. The member for Kennedy also made reference to the situation in the United Kingdom and queried the availability of information from the Australian Institute of Criminology. I do not MAIN COMMITTEE propose to respond in detail to that. The situation in the United Kingdom, which is located very closely to a large number of countries, is entirely different to that of Australia. During the 1990s, there were significant conflicts in Europe that resulted in a flow of illegally imported firearms into Western Europe. The member for Kennedy raised the subject of the restriction on gun ownership and the unfair impeding of the right to bear arms and the right to self-defence. This is a nonsensical claim that was made repeatedly by opponents of the 1996 buyback. It is something that is utterly rejected by the government. In Australia there is no constitutional right to bear arms and there is no unqualified right to self-defence. Equally ridiculous, I think, is the suggestion that firearms are needed in domestic establishments to enable Australians to resist invasion from abroad. I do not think readers of the defence white paper would be concerned about that as an issue. In Australia gun ownership and use is predicated on a genuine need or a genuine reason for holding a firearm. Sporting shooters, primary producers, members of the defence forces and the police are examples of the existence of a genuine reason. The member for Dunkley suggested that measures need to be taken to ensure states and territories do the right thing in the buyback of 2003. While the 1996 buyback was a success in reducing crime-it removed about 640,000 firearms from the community-the Commonwealth learnt from the experience and wants to ensure that there are appropriate accountability mechanisms in place for this buyback. The Commonwealth wants to ensure taxpayers’ money is spent in a responsible way. To this end intergovernmental agreements will be entered into and the Commonwealth will ensure that there are nationally consistent policies and strong accountability procedures. The member for Dunkley asserted that in the state of Victoria after the 1996 firearms buyback dealers who were compensated for loss of business actually used this money to reopen such businesses within days of being compensated. The government will not tolerate dealers attempting to profiteer or cash in on the 2003 hand gun buyback. This is why dealer compensation will only be available for commercially viable stock levels and for items ordered by dealers prior to 20 December 2003. Unlike the 1996 buyback, the 2003 hand gun buyback will not provide compensation to dealers for loss of business. In any event, under the COAG hand gun reforms dealers are not compelled to surrender hand guns or parts in stock and may continue to sell to other sectors of the firearms market where they remain lawful. The 2003 hand gun buyback is not about buying back all guns; instead it is about removing excess and unnecessary hand guns or those held by persons without a genuine reason for holding them. The member for Hinkler had some reservations about possible unintended consequences of the program. I can assure him that these reforms will not prevent sporting shooters from participating in any local, national or international event. They will just have to participate within the new restrictions. Muzzle-loading hand guns are exempt from the calibre restrictions and they can continue to be used in sporting events. The proposed reforms do not affect the fishing industry or primary producers at all. The bill achieves the Commonwealth’s goal of instituting its financial commitment to the hand gun buyback by the 1 July 2003 start date. Complemented by the intergovernmental agreement on accountability and administrative procedures for the hand gun buyback, this bill meets the Commonwealth’s obligations under the COAG hand gun reforms. If they have not already done so, states and territories will be instituting relevant legislative and administrative MAIN COMMITTEE changes to further ensure the success of the national hand gun buyback. Victoria and Tasmania have recently completed such measures. Overall, the passing of this bill is a key step in the introduction of the new hand gun reforms and thereby the bringing about of a safer Australia. I commend the bill to the House.

(5) The Family Court advises me that its Case Management Directions lay down a procedure for complaints to be passed on by the Chair of the relevant Law Society or Bar Association to the appropriate Administrative Judge. If a self-represented party desires to complain about delay in the delivery of a judgment, the person may make a complaint by letter to the relevant registry manager, who will refer it to the appropriate person. Central Coast Community Legal Centre (Question No. 1794) Ms Hall asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 27 March 2003: (1) Will the Central Coast Community Legal Centre continue to receive Federal Government funding after 30 June 2003. (2) Is there a proposal to reduce that level of funding; if so, by how much will the funding be reduced and for what reason. (1) The Commonwealth implemented new funding agreements with the community legal centres it funds, including the Central Coast Community Legal Centre, on 1 January 2003. These agreements operate from 1 January 2003 to 30 June 2005. (2) The Commonwealth does not propose to reduce the level of funding to the Central Coast Community Legal Centre during the course of this agreement. However, funding for the legal centre is subject to the appropriation of funds through the normal budgetary process.",260,Questions On Notice
