Both sides make. In the case of nursing homes, however, of this parliament, when in government, are quite often there is not a choice. going to provide that care.

Does it mean, how different countries were coping with the alternatively, keeping it above 25 per cent of problem of an ageing population.

Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2985 Tuesday, 25 March 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 March, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time. Transfer of Prisoners Bill is the facilitation of the transfer of prisoners between Australia and certain designated countries with which Australia has entered into agreements for the transfer of prisoners so that they may serve their sentences of imprisonment in their country of nationality or in countries with which they have community ties. The bill also facilitates the transport of prisoners to Australia from countries in which prisoners are serving sentences of imprisonment imposed by certain war crimes tribunals. The criminal law is a very peculiar creature. Unless it touches you, you know that it exists but you rarely understand its workings. But once you get caught up in its vortex, as many of my clients for whom I acted over a number of years have been, there is an inevitable drawing further into that vortex. The tube, if you like, into which all defendants are taken on their journey through the criminal justice system has a number of sharp points along the way, and frequently the journey is punctuated by ups and downs. It is rarely, if ever, an occasion of much pleasure to be in that system. Indeed, I am reminded of one of the greatest writers of the 19th century, Charles Dickens, in his book The Old Curiosity Shop, when he was talking about a rather amusing situation that used to occur outside the solicitor Sampson Brass's chambers. Sampson Brass used to have a tenant who was rather eccentric and who used to summon diverse people to come and perform Punch and Judy shows outside the chambers. As Dickens so beautifully put it, Brass could ill afford to lose so profitable a tenant so he deemed it prudent to pocket the affront along with the cash that the tenant provided. But he used other ways of trying to disperse the throng below which disrupted his business, such as the pouring down of foul waters from above, or bribing the drivers of coaches to come tearing around the comer and break up the assembled throng. Dickens so beautifully put it when he said: You may well ask why he, being the legal gentleman, would not have indicted the party or parties responsible for the nuisance ... But he then proceeded with the warning, saying: As doctors seldom take their own medicines and divines rarely practice what they preach, so lawyers are shy of meddling with the law on their own account knowing it to be an edged tool of uncertain application, very expensive in the working and known for its properties for close shaving if for not always shaving the right person. So therein lies a very salutary lesson in the whole of the criminal justice system-as well as the civil system, I might say, which also has its attendant perils. Many times one sees people who are not guilty of crimes-indeed, there is barely a shred of evidence against them-but they are drawn into the system. And once the system starts, and once the engine is cranked, it rarely stops until the process is completed.",118,Total 249 7 60 9
259,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl) Took The Chair At 4 P.m.,,121,Representatives Main Committee
260,Mr Tony Smith (Dickson) (4.00 P.m.),"One of the objectives of the International2986 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 Despite the numerous submissions that can go out between charge and committal and between committal and trial, rarely, if ever, in my experience, is one of those submissions successful. So that preamble in essence is a warning to all those who think the system can work, that we have checks and balances, and that there is a way of making a protest about a wrongful conviction or sentence, or an inappropriate piece of evidence that has been adduced, and so forth. Believe you me, once the situation starts, and particularly once a person is convicted, the road becomes even rougher in trying to set aside an inappropriate conviction. I say all that not with a view to casting any aspersion upon the integrity of the legislation but with a view to giving a warning to all those who think that it is a nice piece of legislation. I am not saying it is not a nice piece of legislation, but I am giving a warning to those who feel that there is nothing wrong with it and that it has great objects. Yes, it does have great objects. As a member of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee I participated in some hearings on this legislation. I did not get to the Parklea Correctional Centre at Blacktown in Sydney, but I understand the honourable member for Barton( Mr McClelland) was there and he may make some observations about that. I understand some evidence was taken at that venue from persons who have been personally affected with respect to a prisoner who has been sentenced in another country and is enduring a sentence of imprisonment there. I do not think anybody on the committee argues with the proposition that the punishment must fit the crime and that people who commit criminal offences ought to be punished, if they have committed the offences and if the process leading to their conviction is untainted. Despite perhaps being almost myopic, some might say, in my views about this, my concern remains about the chances of unsafe convictions and miscarriages of justice which are always present. They are not common, but they are always present-and that is a concern I have in relation to the legislation. Lawyers, certainly in Queensland, do remember the terrible case of Kelvin Condren, an Aboriginal chap who was convicted of murder in Mount Isa some years ago, and another prisoner confessed in the Northern Territory to that particular crime. One would think, in our jurisprudence, that that would result in an immediate release or, at the very least, an immediate and speedy hearing, a review of the case by the court of appeal, and swift action by the Attorney-General. In fact, there were two hearings over a period of something like seven years before Kelvin Condren was finally released and paid a substantial amount of compensation. It took seven years for that process to be corrected in our jurisprudence. A fortiori, when it comes to convictions in relation to another country; while I appreciate strongly the force of the legislation and how, for it to work, it must give due recognition to convictions that have been recorded in the other country and that there is the reciprocal situation, I do have concerns about the operation of the act in so far as tainted convictions are concerned in another country-or, for that matter, in this country. But I am focusing particularly on the situation where a prisoner is convicted in another country. The pressure on him to acknowledge his guilt in order for the operation of this legislation to come into full flow, as it were, is obvious on the face of it. He obviously would prefer to spend his time in Wacol Correctional Centre or Parklea than in the 'Bangkok Hilton'. The fact is that if we have had miscarriages of justice in our jurisdiction there may be more examples of such miscarriages in a foreign jurisdiction. I do not necessarily say that there is, Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2987 but I do say that we have the best criminal justice system in the world in Australia. I believe it far outstrips the English and the US systems, but there are still miscarriages of justice that do occur. We have to be very careful to see that this legislation will work properly and, in particular, that we do not in certain circumstances deny justice to a prisoner who has come here and who then finds himself in a situation where the conviction in the other country has been found to be tainted by fraud or bias by a tribunal in that country. Perhaps a piece of evidence which was absolutely critical has been wrongly admitted, or perhaps a confession has been made allegedly by him to another person and that other person then renounces it, having taken the benefit of a remission in his sentence in that other country. Obviously, the inducement to bear false witness about the defendant's confession would have been very strong in those circumstances. We have to be very careful that we do not exclude the possibility of that imprisoned person being able to make an application to the Attorney and perhaps the Attorney then being able to encourage the attorney or the corresponding legal figure of the other country to take action in respect of the original conviction. That is my concern. I understand that other members of the committee did not have that concern, and I respect their views-it may be that I have taken an overly cautious approach. I do not believe, with the experience that I have, that I have missed anything in that process. I hope I have not, but I do have concern that we may have a situation where a key witness has renounced testimony, or there has been some taint in the conviction and no action is taken. One thing that is common to both our justice system and to other justice systems is that it hates to be wrong. It hates to admit that it has made a mistake. It hates to concede that there may have been an error in the process. Examples of mistakes are legion in the United Kingdom. One of the worse cases of all was the Hanratty case. James Hanratty was the last person to be hung in England. He was committed for trial in October of a particular year and by April of the next year he had gone to the gallows. Afterwards, as a result of reading a very fine book by Paul Foot, a journalist who did a comprehensive analysis of that case, you could not possibly conclude that Hanratty was guilty of the offence. At the very least you would be left with a reasonable doubt about it, yet it was too late for Hanratty. The whole process was tainted by a system that was desperately trying to protect itself from any suggestion that it had made a mistake. We can go on to more recent times with the Birmingham Six and cases like that where the system has been corrupted but where nobody will do anything about it, year in, year out, and at the end of the day some poor devil has to languish in prison for a long time. I sound that note of warning in relation to this legislation. I think there should be a discretion that is very carefully exercised in relation to matters of that nature. If there is a situation where someone has been found to have been wrongly convicted in the other country, where maybe someone else has confessed to the crime, or where there has been a taint in the procedure, then there must be swift procedures available if the other country fails to act to correct that situation. That situation, I am told, is perhaps protected by the wording of the legislation in clause 15. I am not totally satisfied with that. However, as a matter of prudence, it has to be very 2988 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 carefully scrutinised and very carefully looked at before we can say that this legislation is totally free from any concern. I support the legislation. I think that, in general terms, it is good legislation. I do have, of course, some doubts. I know that they were expressed by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Randall) in relation to the fact that, as far as costs are concerned, it looks as if we may well be bearing most of the costs because of the natural tendency for prisoners to want to stay here rather than go home and for prisoners who are overseas to want to come back here rather than stay over there. So it would seem, on its face, an arguable situation. But I will not steal my honourable friend's thunder in relation to that. I think he could do it better than I could anyway. But, overall, I do support the human rights aspect of this particular procedure. But I warn the Main Committee that there are situations that can arise that are never foreseen and can never be foreseen. When they happen, unfortunately everybody wants to disappear and not look at the real problems. So, generally speaking, with those reservations, I support the bill. also support, as I am frequently found to do, the comments of the member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith). I also share his caution and concerns with aspects of the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill and the operation of clause 15(1)(a) specifically, which requires that, before a prisoner can access the transfer mechanism, the prisoner has had to either have terminated his other appeal rights under the law of that country where he was convicted or make an election to forfeit any remaining appeal rights that he or she has. I also share the concerns of the member for Dickson that the pressure on a prisoner to get back to their home country may be such that it forces them to abandon such appeal rights. The pressure, for instance, if there are domestic problems with their family, or an illness in the family, or whatever it may be, may be such that desperation compels that prisoner to abandon their appeal rights. There are circumstances where things can come to light. The member for Dickson, because of his legal background, was able to refer us to the Kelvin Condron case, the Hanratty case in the United Kingdom and, more recently in the United Kingdom, the Birmingham Six case. These sorts of facts are, unfortunately, even in our very sophisticated system of justice, real possibilities and, without wanting to belittle any other nation's system of justice, even more possible where the court procedures of cross-examination and testing of evidence are not as sophisticated as ours. That is a real caution. I note in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, of which I am a member, that we recommended in recommendation 4, I think it was, that the Attorney-General, when he reports to parliament after 12 months of operation of the legislation, looks in particular at the operation of clause 15 of the bill. I urge those involved to pay particular attention to the issues raised by the member for Dickson. Despite that reservation and note of caution, like other members, I will be supporting the bill. There are significant humanitarian reasons to support the legislation. One is from the point of view of the prisoner, who obviously has additional hardship as a prisoner i,n a gaol with a foreign culture which affects simple things like diet and religious customs. We received a letter from a prisoner in a Thai gaol who said that the beds were too small for him because Asian prisoners are usually smaller than Westerners. He was well over six feet tall. His feet went over the end of the bed. Every time someone walked past, he was",121,Representatives Main Committee
261,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (4.16 P.m.),"I support the motion before the committee. ITuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2989 woken up. Those sorts of things add an additional element of hardship that is not contemplated in the initial sentence. Perhaps even more relevant is the hardship that confronts the family of a prisoner gaoled overseas. We heard first-hand evidence from the mother of that prisoner in Thailand about the effect that her son's imprisonment had had on her two children in Australia. Regrettably, one had attempted suicide and the other required counselling. The woman herself had obviously been deeply affected by her son's imprisonment overseas. The humanitarian reasons are not there simply for the sake of feeling warm and having a feeling of satisfaction at doing the right thing. The reality is that that family has to function in Australia and, clearly, any dislocation to family members here can have a flow-on effect in terms of the sorts of citizens that they have the opportunity of becoming in subsequent years. The other issue of concern-not with the legislation but with the procedures-is that it requires the cooperation of all Attorneys-General in Australia for the system to work properly. Some states may have to incur additional costs as a result of prisoners returning home and being imprisoned in that particular state. It would be regrettable if a particularly short-sighted approach were taken by any state, such that it refused to accept the return of a prisoner. It has a much broader application than a simple exercise based on the cost of housing one particular prisoner. It would be regrettable if any state Attorney-General did not play ball, as it were. It is arguable that this parliament has the constitutional authority to override any state which does not accept the system, but it would be regrettable if legislation overriding state rights were necessary. It would be much more acceptable and successful if there were an element of cooperation. Another recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs( Mr Ruddock) examine migration in respect of the rights of people who are taken out of Australia as children-whether they be Aborigines or children taken, in some cases against their will, by a parent. There is a well-known recent example of that situation where children have been taken out of Australia. In a purely theoretical sense, it is possible that one or other of those children may be convicted of a crime. The view of the committee was that, if that occurred, it would be desirable if some special consideration could be given to such people who were taken out of Australia against their will, so that they could return and serve a prison sentence in Australia. But that issue involves much broader considerations regarding the migration legislation, hence our recommendation that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs looks in particular at that aspect. I have already commented on the recommendation that in his report the Attorney-General( Mr Williams) looks closely at the operation of clause 15 and the effect of compelling people to abandon or terminate their appeal rights; and again I would flag that. The fifth recommendation of the legal and constitutional committee was that regulations be added to the legislation to compel a situation where prisoners, before electing to return to their home country, be given information regarding the state of prisons in that home country, and that was something that all members of the committee thought essential. 2990 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 I think it fair to say that the general consensus was that it is inappropriate for our Attorney General to be overly paternal if a prisoner, armed with information as to the state of gaols in their home country, with open eyes nonetheless elects to return to that country. The Attorney General should not step in and say, 'You cannot do it, because we do not regard prisons in your home country as being up to international standards or proper humane standards.' A good example of that was given to the committee where, for instance, in some states of the United States it is the practice to put prisoners in leg irons. There is an argument that that is contrary to international standards relating to the treatment of prisoners, but it may well be the case that an American prisoner in Australia may nonetheless elect or wish to return to their home state. It would be inappropriate for, as I say, the federal Attorney-General-or, for that matter, any state Attorney-General-to be overly paternalistic in restricting a prisoner from applying to return home if that prisoner, with eyes open about what they would face, genuinely wanted to return home. The next aspect, in recommendation 6 of the committee report, was the annual reporting mechanism, and I think that is appropriate-indeed, essential-because I suspect there will be some initial teething problems with perhaps some states and territories not complying to the best of their ability, if I can put it that way, with the system. It would be important to look at what steps can be taken to get everyone on board and get the system operating properly. It must be said that it is probably an area where there are no votes at all for either political party, but it is just one of those acts of parliament which are appropriate. I suppose it had its origins under the former government, but the current Attorney-General has well and truly taken up the issue with some expedition; and obviously both sides of the House regard the legislation as appropriate, even though there are probably no votes in it at the end of the day. Again, I would be very concerned if any state authority or state parliamentarian said, 'There are no votes in it for us, so why should we cooperate?' That would be, as I have stressed, regrettable indeed. There is a real potential for obstruction in the system, because there are effectively four tiers of consent. In the case of a prisoner overseas, firstly, the prisoner has to make an election. The overseas government has to approve, the federal Attorney-General here has to approve, then the state Attorney-General of the relevant state has to approve. So anywhere in that system there is the potential for the mechanism to be waylaid. Again, it is appropriate that that reporting mechanism be adopted. The final recommendation was that clause 24 be looked at, and I understand that the relevant drafting experts in the department are looking at that issue. There is currently a double discretion contained in the particular clause, where the Attorney-General virtually has an unreviewable discretion because of the way that it is presently drafted. That would be appropriate. I should say that the explanatory memorandum conveys the view that there is probably very little cost implication for the legislation, and that mayor may not be the case. On the basis of the number of foreign prisoners in our gaols as compared with the number of Australians in foreign gaols, on one view we have the potential to benefit more than other countries because, in theory, more would desire to return home-assuming of course that they regarded their home gaols as acceptable. But I argue that there is another significant potential for a cost benefit to Australia, and that is in the sense that there is presently quite a burden on foreign embassies and commissions to assist Australians in overseas gaols. We heard some evidence Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2991 as to whether the assistance being offered was satisfactory or not, and I understand that there is a Senate select committee looking at that issue. I can speak from first-hand experience, as last AugustI went to Thailand as a member of a delegation. I became quite friendly with one of the officers of the Australian embassy in Thailand, a Mr James Larsen. He described to me the efforts that the embassy officials over there went to to look after Australian prisoners. He struck me as a very genuine and diligent young man. I have no doubt whatsoever that he and other representatives of the embassy were very much looking after the interests of prisoners. Mr Larsen told us, by way of example, that the week before we had arrived a prisoner that he had visited on a number of occasions and whom he had assisted had escaped from the Thai gaol in quite exceptional and athletic circumstances. In terms of mere escape, it was really quite an achievement. He took the opportunity after his escape of dropping a note to the Australian embassy to thank them for all their tremendous work and said that he hoped he had not caused them any embarrassment by his escape. That was an indication of the appreciation and warmth that he had for their efforts. It is clear that our Australian missions devote quite considerable resources to looking after prisoners. Therefore, if the number of Australian prisoners in overseas gaols were reduced, the burden placed on our overseas embassies would also be reduced. That is a factor which can appropriately be regarded in considering the impact of this legislation. But, as I say, with the words of caution that my friend, the member for Dickson noted, which I support, I strongly endorse and support the motion to approve the legislation. International Transfer of Prisoners Bill because it provides a framework for Australia to participate in the international transfer of prisoners. While the primary purpose of the bill is to enable Australians imprisoned overseas to be returned to Australia to complete their sentences, it will also provide a system wherein foreign nationals imprisoned in Australia will be returned to their home countries to complete their sentences. Reduced numbers of Australian prisoners overseas will also reduce the pressure on Australia's consular costs. There presently is an undersupply of consular staff. Australian prisoners outnumber consular staff available to visit the prisons and assist Australians overseas. There is also a possible financial saving to the states if there is a net outflow of prisoners. There are approximately 272 international prisoners in Australian gaols compared with approximately 160 to 180 Australians presently imprisoned overseas. To keep one prisoner in an Australian prison for one year costs between $50,000 and $60,000. While people recoil in horror at this amount of money, it goes largely on wages to prison officers who must, for the safety of the general community, be at quite a high ratio per prisoner. It is, however, a lot of money that the government pays to the prison system, when you look at the thousands of prisoners across Australia. It is for this reason also that constant and stringent reporting of the transmigration of prisoners is to be undertaken. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, of which I am a member, has been receiving and hearing evidence on this issue. It does have some divergent opinions about this matter, due to the emotive responses which arise from issues on crimes and sentencing. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, at the moment throughout Australia there appears to be a great move towards stronger and more stringent sentences, and this is borne out in such initiatives as 'three strikes and you're in' type",124,Representatives Main Committee
262,Mr Randall (Swan) (4.34 P.m.),"I am pleased to speak to certain aspects of the2992 MAIN COMMITIEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 legislation. There is a greater push for longer nonparole periods, because the parole system in this country is seen to be soft and, in some cases, a bit of a joke. There is a strong feeling in Australia, as well as overseas, that a policy of international transfers of prisoners would undermine the integrity of the penal system. For example-and I will refer to this issue later-integrity must be maintained by making sure that no alterations are made to the sentences of transferring prisoners, and this has been mentioned by previous speakers. Further, there is a belief that international transfers would undermine efforts to fight serious crime, particularly drug related crime. It has been suggested that the significant increase in the number of known foreign prisoners has resulted from the rapid increase in international air travel since the 1970s, and from the rise in illegal drug use over the same period-and they do seem rather coincidental. Australian citizens do not carry Australian law with them when they travel. They must be very aware of this: that they become subject to the law of the state in the country they are visiting. This places on them the obligation of being required to observe the laws of the countries that they are visiting. However, the bill supports the notion of the international transfer of prisoners on humanitarian grounds as well, which is one of the reasons for my supporting it. Australian prisoners should be allowed to return home and serve out their sentences. I just bring to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, the concept which was exhibited in the movie Midnight Express of the sorts of horrific prison conditions which were faced by a foreign national. Also, many references have been made to the prison in Bangkok, quite often referred to as the 'Bangkok Hilton', and the conditions faced there by prisoners. A prisoner can be adversely affected psychologically and physically by deprivation of liberty, through experiences with language barriers, differences in diet, health, intolerance of religious practices, lack of contact with family and friends, lack of access to welfare or community goodwill organisations and to training and, simply, general prejudice against foreigners. These adverse effects will hinder their chances of successful rehabilitation. Mind you, there are some people who think the totally unacceptable conditions in a country outside Australia, and possibly in a Third World country, might deter people from ever reoffending. However, there are some celebrated cases of people in countries who deliberately did not want to transfer-and I draw to the attention of the Main Committee Charles Sobhraj, who recently left an Indian gaol because he did not want to return to a country where he was to be killed. He did some extraordinary things, which have been written about extensively, to stay in India, which he is currently fighting to do at the moment. A policy of international transfer of prisoners would give them access to facilities they would not have overseas, placing them in the more familiar environments of their country of origin. AgainI say, with their return home, it is believed that their chances of rehabilitation are somewhat higher. Around 1,000 Australians are arrested overseas each year. In September 1995 there were 164 Australians imprisoned overseas, about which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had information. Current figures show that just over 40 per cent of these persons were imprisoned for drug related offences. The country which holds the majority of our prisoners overseas is Thailand-and it is no coincidence at all that Thailand seems to be the hub for the so-called, and famous, Golden Triangle, from where a large part of the world's heroin emanates. Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2993 We also have a natural link with New Zealand where, on current figures, 23 Australians are imprisoned. In the United States there are 21 Australians. Also, in Greece we have, I believe, the high number of 18 Australians imprisoned. This can also be seen in light of the fact that it is often said that the second largest Greek-populated city in the world is Melbourne, and I am sure that we have a number of paternal links to Greece. We currently have approximately 10 prisoners in the United Kingdom-and, again, I would point to our historical links to the United Kingdom. The length of these prisoners' sentences varies from a few months to life imprisonment. Local sentencing is to be taken into consideration when an Australian prisoner is returned to Australia. Their sentence is not going to be in any way lighter than in the country where the crime was committed, and there is some misconception out in the public with the belief that, under the Australian system of imprisonment, there is the chance that their sentence could be altered. This fact needs to be forced home to those who have this misconception. It is important that prisoners do not think that returning to Australia is a way of getting lighter sentences. The rest of the community would be hostile, extremely hostile, if they thought criminals were reducing the severity of their sentences by coming home. After all, we are not talking about the nice care-giving people of the world; we are talking about people who have been convicted of crimes and, in many cases, very serious crimes. In that regard, we are not trying to featherbed their future time of incarceration. We are not here to apologise for Australian prisoners, but we are here to take into account humanitarian reasons for assistance during their sentences and their rehabilitation after prison and towards their families. One of our greatest considerations is those people they sadly leave behind here. I am very pleased to be able to say that there will be four checks to this system of international transfer of prisoners. First of all, the prisoner must agree to return to Australia or to their country of origin. Secondly, the Attorney-General in the country in which the offence was committed must agree to the prisoner's return. Thirdly, the Australian Attorney General must also agree. Fourthly, the Attorney-General in the state of Australia housing the prisoner must also agree. This makes me feel much more relaxed about the checks and balances that will be in place in this system in terms of international transfer. At this point in time, however, the current situation is that the Northern Territory does not want to participate in this system of transfer of prisoners. As the Australian city closest to South-East Asia where there is a steady flow of people committing offences, most commonly drug trafficking and illegal immigration, its people are, perhaps understandably, quite cynical about the value of this bill. party to this bill. While the Northern Territory's actions will not prevent the legislation being passed, it is of course preferable that, as part of Australia, they do contribute to the system of uniform sentencing arrangements. I understand that the Australian Attorney-General( Mr Williams) is currently involved in negotiations with the Northern Territory, and hopefully an outcome will be known soon. While the number of Australian prisoners held overseas is slightly lower than that of overseas prisoners held here, it is on balance quite even. It is important that the status be vigilantly monitored to ensure that there is no significant imbalance, so that Australia does",127,Representatives Main Committee

One of my concerns in the legal and constitutional committee has been that there might be an imbalance in the flow of international prisoners. I am sure that Australian prisons could quite often be seen as far better places to serve out some time, given electronic devices such as televisions and PCs, and the quality of food that we feed our prisoners. I am not sureable to fit themselves into a bed and being held in poor sanitary conditions. One of my great concerns is that we monitor the flow of prisoner traffic, both into and out of Australia, so that there is a balance. The allowance paid to prisoners in Australia is comparable with-or, in many cases, greater than-the actual average earnings of some people in Asian countries, and we must ensure our prisons are not seen as too attractive, as I have already said. This case has been highlighted in Broome on a number of occasions, where Indonesian prisoners who were caught and sentenced actually saved money in Australia and went back on their chartered jumbos much richer than when they arrived, despite having had their boats burnt. We need to be aware of anomalies like that, and we must also ensure that the balance is vigilantly monitored so that the overcrowding problem which already exists in Australian prisons does not see the presence here of international prisoners preventing the return of Australian prisoners. I support this bill, given certain reservations which I have alluded to and given its checks and balances and the fact that there should be accountability in terms of annual reporting. Currently it is very difficult, in some cases, to get accurate figures, both on overseas prisoners and on prisoners not of Australian nationality in Australia gaols, because of the nature of reporting between the states and the Commonwealth. I would urge strongly that we have an auditing type of response on an annual basis to check the flow of international prisoners, and that the Attorney-General be given charge of this. As I say, I commend the bill for all the positive reasons I have mentioned. generally is primarily a matter for the states, and that situation produces quite a degree of diversity in different parts of Australia. For example, in comparing the rates of imprisonment and the size of prison populations per capita in New South Wales and Victoria, one finds that the per capita rate of imprisonment in New South Wales is significantly higher than that in Victoria, and that has historically been the case, by and large, irrespective of the political orientation of the particular state government at the time. I guess that that reflects quite deep-seated differences in prisons philosophy and corrections philosophy. Victoria's approach has been to put very significant emphasis on community corrections, obviously, for less serious offences-in comparison with the approach that has been taken in New South Wales, for example. There have also been some differences in approaches for sentencing within the courts of different jurisdictions. There is a significant variation between Australian states in relation to publicly operated prison systems and privately operated prison systems. Queensland was probably the trailblazer in relation to private prisons in Australia-interestingly enough, under a Labor government, I think. And Victoria, under the current coalition government, has very much-",129,Representatives Main Committee

The United States of America has a huge variation in the quality of the prisons it operates. A few years ago, in my capacity as the Victorian shadow minister for corrections, I had the opportunity to visit a number of prisons in the US. The diversity in the prisons there is absolutely mind-boggling. In Minnesota, a state in the Union which has had a small '1' liberal tradition in a whole range of areas, including social policy, the prisons put great emphasis on rehabilitation. In contrast, in some of the southern states, and California, some of the prisons are electronic zoos where the ratio of prisoners to staff is very high. There are very few staff in those prisons because the prisoners are monitored electronically. Arguably, that has terribly negative impacts on rehabilitation, because people in that sort of environment who are denied human contact are unlikely to come out of gaol better citizens as the result of the experience. That point goes very much to the heart of what a lot of this bill is about. A number of years ago there was some debate in Australia about an Aborigine called James Savage who was convicted of murder in the United States. His possible repatriation to Australia generated a great deal of attention. At the time, the Catholic chaplain of prisons in Victoria was interviewed on the ABC program The World Today on the general question of bringing prisoners home. The comments of Father Peter Norden are apposite today. Norden said: I work as a prison chaplain here in Victoria and I see that those prisoners who are in contact with their family, who have the ability for their family to visit them in prison are, in fact, far more manageable within the prison environment than people who are completely isolated from their families. And then, you know, as the sentence proceeds and the person is preparing for release back in to the community-because they are still members of the community. As they are preparing for release back in to the community the prospects of some form of resettlement, effective resettlement, are heightened so much if the person is in contact with people who are close to them: their own family, their wife, their husband, their children. That seems like common sense. It clearly underpins the importance of this particular legislation. Australian citizens who return to Australia have a much greater capacity to rehabilitate into the community. If they are in close proximity to significant other people in their lives, they will have a more effective chance of becoming contributing members of the community. There are obviously cost advantages to the proposal as well. Other speakers have spoken about the effect on consular services. There is some debate in the report of the House of Representatives committee about the competing levels of prisoners going out of Australia as distinct from those coming in. The balance of views seems to be that it is likely to favour Australia, perhaps marginally. The other factor which I want to re-emphasise is the advantage to the Australian community in terms of getting people rehabilitated as effective members of the community and the costs that are involved in the community with recidivism-that is, repeat offending. It is well established internationally that, where prisoners are given effective opportunities to rehabilitate, to learn meaningful employment skills, where they can maintain their health-",130,Representatives Main Committee
269,Mr Slipper,"No, it was under the former conservative government and it was continued",131,Representatives Main Committee
270,Mr Sercombe,"Was it? Fine, I stand corrected by the member for Fisher. There is a2996 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 which they are going to be in a much better position to do in an Australian prison than overseas-the ultimate benefits to the Australian community in terms of avoiding the costs of repeat offences, in terms of health breakdowns, in terms of getting prisoners into employment and supporting their families, are going to be significantly greater if they are operating within an Australian environment. Other members have spoken about Thai prisons. I visited a prison in Bangkok a few years ago. I can assure you that that is not an environment that is likely to produce rehabilitation for Australian offenders incarcerated there. They are, by and large, almost exclusively, people' convicted of drug offences, but they are scarcely the Mr Bigs of the drug scene. I think it would probably be true to describe most of the Australians I had the opportunity to meet in Bangkok prisons as 'mules'-that is the colloquial expression. They are typically drug dependent people who have been caught trying to support their habit by carrying narcotics out of that jurisdiction. Their prospects of ever becoming effective citizens back in Australia are not going to be supported by their remaining for lengthy periods of time in the corrupt environment of Thai gaols. There are a number of features of the advisory report by the House of Representatives committee that I wanted to comment on. One is to note that it is good to see Australia, through this legislation, assuming some responsibilities arising from war crimes tribunal matters in both the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. This legislation gives effect in a number of ways to Australia's capacity to meet international obligations in those circumstances, and that is something that both sides of the House can applaud. Other speakers have spoken about the national application of this legislation and the desirability of it, and we have heard that the Northern Territory apparently is continuing to indicate that it does not wish to participate. There is some reference in the committee's report to the possibility that Western Australia may have some difficulties. It was certainly canvassed in submissions to the committee, particularly from the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Sidoti, who was quoted as saying: ... the bill should provide explicitly for extension to all Australian internal territories, either directly or by way of regulation, if the territories do not legislate. The recommendation of the committee is against that particular approach. But it would seem to me that the Commonwealth ought not to totally forgo some considerable leverage on territories or states that do not come into this on a voluntary basis, simply because I think the overall advantages generally in Australia are somewhat diminished if particular jurisdictions, for whatever reason, decide to stay out. I think that it really is an area which it is sufficiently important to attempt very vigorously to get a national approach on, even if that involves some fairly heavy negotiation with the states. I am not sure, but I would suspect that my side of the parliament would ultimately fairly vigorously support that approach, if it became necessary. Another important consideration that was dealt with in the standing committee's report was the question of eligibility of transfer under the legislation. I referred earlier to the James Savage matter in the United States. He was a young man of Aboriginal origin who was taken as a very young child from Australia and adopted by some people in the United States. which were also addressed by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its submission to the parliamentary committee. The Attomey-General's Department and the",131,Representatives Main Committee

272,Mr Sercombe,"Yes, I think he became a US citizen. That raised some particular issuesTuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2997 immigration department in their submissions to the committee came out very vigorously in opposition to making specific provisions for people of Aboriginal origin in the sorts of circumstances that Mr Savage found himself in. A Mr Meaney from the Attorney-General's Department said: What we [would] have is a right for a class of persons-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders-who have been convicted of offences overseas to return to Australia but no general right of getting back into Australia under the Migration Act for, if you like, law abiding persons of the same extraction who might have been in the same class. I think that point is reasonably well made. But I think the logical conclusion of it is not as the Attorney-General's Department seems to be suggesting-that is, not taking steps to facilitate the capacity of people of Aboriginal extraction to return to Australia in the sorts of circumstances that Savage found himself in-but, rather, to create opportunities for nonoffending people in the same sort of category to also have some rights of return, given what we are increasingly learning about the terrible consequences of so much of the assimilation policy that was adopted in earlier decades towards Aboriginal children. Clearly, a number of those children did leave the Australian jurisdiction. I would think the implication of this is not to put barriers in the way of the type of person that Savage is; but, rather, to look at the more general proposition of those who have not been convicted and look at some sort of restitution of rights. The committee does recommend that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs( Mr Ruddock) initiate some examination of the issues surrounding the eligibility of persons who have been removed from Australia as children to have a right of entry to Australia. That is welcome. I would join the committee in supporting that and would urge the minister to move on that particular matter very promptly. The final matter in the committee's report that I wanted to comment on was the question of the Attorney-General's discretion under a number of aspects of this legislation. The member to a particular area where it would seem desirable for the Attomey-General to keep a discretion under review to ensure that injustices were not being done. Elizabeth Evatt, in a submission to the parliamentary committee, said the following: I would like to think that all the discretions that will be exercised under the Act will be exercised in a manner compatible with our international human rights obligations ... I would like this committee to make a strong statement like that as a guiding principle to the way that the Act should be exercised. If it is in your report, it will be there for all time for whoever is exercising discretions and it will be there if any act of any government officer or Attorney-General comes up for judicial review as a question of exercise legally. They will be able to look at that to see that it was the intention that we should at all times be compatible with human rights standards and not risk a violation by a transfer. I wholeheartedly endorse those comments and believe that it would be very helpful, at the close of the second reading debate, if the Attorney-General was able to give the committee the pleasure of his company to get some assurances from him in relation to the basis on which he would propose under this legislation to exercise his discretion. It seems to me that one of the reasons, which the committee did not particularly address, that that discretion is important is that the circumstances in particular countries with which Australia might enter into treaty arrangements may change over time. One could look, for example, at Greece which was referred to as a place where there are a number of Australian citizens who are prisoners. Greece may well be a democracy now, but a few decades ago it",132,Representatives Main Committee
273,For Dickson ( Mr Tony Smith) And The Member For Barton ( Mr Mcclelland) Have Both Referred,"2998 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 was run by a military junta. Clearly, the sorts of circumstances that operate in particular countries change from time to time. We may well wish to look at the situation that exists in a country where the treaty obligations are incurred, by having the Attorney-General of the day make it quite clear that his discretions in that respect will be influenced very strongly by the human rights position in particular countries. I referred earlier to my visit to the prisons in the United States a number of years ago and to the very wide diversity of prison experiences there. They range from very progressive prisons, in the sense of prisons focused very much on getting high levels of rehabilitation so that rates of recidivism are reduced, right through to places which, as I described earlier, you would even hesitate to call electronic zoos-places that are quite brutalising and dehumanising for the prisoners in them. Over time, even within a single country, I would think circumstances are going to change. That simply reinforces the importance of the Attorney-General having a discretion in a range of areas here and reinforcing the basis of it. SoI will conclude my remarks by urging the Attorney-General to come to the Main Committee, if he is able to, and give some assurances. That would be extremely helpful in relation to laying the basis on which Australia will exercise its responsibilities under this legislation and the treaties that will arise as a result of this legislation. Bill, I was one of those concerned that perhaps there would not be the benefits in the legislation that its proponents have, in fact, advanced. But I have been convinced that this legislation will be of benefit both to this country and to those overseas. Of course, the legislation, as has been pointed out by my colleagues, will allow Australians serving prison sentences overseas to be returned to Australia and will permit foreign nationals imprisoned in this country to return to their own countries to complete their sentences. There are two aspects to this particular legislation. Firstly, it covers general prisoner transfers. With respect to those general prisoner transfers, the transfer scheme is able to apply to all offences without exception. It covers persons who have been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment or other deprivation of liberty and includes persons confined in connection with criminal conduct by reason of mental disorder and persons who have been released on parole. As has been previously pointed out, these transfers will be consensual, requiring the consent of the person to be transferred, the relevant Australian government-Commonwealth and state/territory-and the other country. Conditions for transfer include imprisonment under a final order and for there to be at least six months of the sentence remaining to be served, unless the Attorney-General determines that transfer for a shorter period is acceptable. Transfer conditions to Australia include the person being an Australian citizen or permitted to travel to, enter and remain in Australia indefinitely, pursuant to the Migration Act 1958, and having community ties with a state or territory. When I first read that non-citizens in certain circumstances would be able to return to Australia, I thought of citizens of countries like New Zealand whose non-citizens, though nonAustralians, are still able to reside here. If New Zealand, for instance, does not enter into a similar scheme to that being entered into by Australia, it could be that New Zealanders languishing in Thai or South-East Asian prisons might well want to come to Australia, which is closer to home. Our prisons are clearly very much more humane.",133,Representatives Main Committee
274,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (5.05 P.m.),"When I heard of the International Transfer of PrisonersTuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2999 I was pleased to see section 57, which points out that the Attorney-General must not make any decision under this act affecting a prisoner who is not an Australian citizen without the consent of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. So, the concern that I had, and I believe the concern that would be widespread in the community, ultimately turned out not to be something to worry about. I must say, though, that it is important to recognise that in 1997 Australia is a humanitarian country and that there will be humanitarian, economic and social advantages of an international transfer scheme for prisoners in which this country participates. Prior to my return to the federal parliament, I was for a period Chairman of the West Moreton Regional Community Corrections Board, which was the parole board covering prisons in Brisbane and, for a while, elsewhere. The two major prisons we covered were the Sir David Longland and Wacol correctional centres. At times we did have responsibility for the infamous Boggo Road Goal and the Borallon private prison, referred to by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Sercombe) opposite. With respect to correctional matters, it is always important to strike the appropriate balance between a penalty and rehabilitation. I think most people in the community would agree we need a balance. The difference that sometimes arises might be just on where that particular balance should be struck. But, when one looks at the prisons that the honourable member opposite has seen in some other parts of the world, the prisons that we know exist in certain parts of South-East Asia, I suppose as Australians with a Western culture we have to ask whether those prison conditions are suitable for Australian prisoners. This legislation, to an extent, moves very much along the road towards encouraging a humanitarian approach to those Australian prisoners who are incarcerated overseas. Some people could criticise this particular piece of legislation on the basis that we could be perceived to be going soft on crime. For instance, if people go to countries in South-East Asia where there are very severe penalties for drug trafficking, at the moment, of course, they know that if they are convicted they will have to serve out the penalty in that particular country. There is of course a lot of money in the drug trade. I believe that the tough conditions existing in prisons and the very severe penalties imposed for drug trafficking in South-East Asian countries might well be a powerful disincentive to many Australians to participate in that grotesque trade. On the other hand, a prisoner transfer scheme which will permit the repatriation of prisoners to Australia might encourage some people to say, 'The penalty at the end of the day is going to be treatment in a fairly soft Australian prison.' Certainly it is soft by comparison with some overseas prisons. Obviously, this government and its predecessor made judgments that, on balance, this legislation should proceed. This legislation has really had quite a long gestation period. It was first raised in 1992 by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and it has taken almost five years to reach a stage where it has almost become part of the law of Australia. This government has been in office for only the last 12 months and while I want to commend our predecessor government for initially bringing this legislation forward, I suppose citizens could well ask why it took from 1992 until the present for this legislation to be introduced. I suppose that the member who is going to speak after me might bring forward some reasons for that. Such delay seems to occur in many cases. An enormous period elapses 3000 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 between when we as a community decide that the law should be changed until the time that the particular law is actually altered. As I mentioned, there will be a number of safeguards. I referred to the situation of general prisoners. There has, of course, been another section added to the bill and it relates to prisoners of international war crimes tribunals. There will be slightly different procedures with respect to those prisoners. One of the key things to note is that there will be no need for a tribunal prisoner to actually consent to the repatriation to Australia and there will be no explicit citizenship or migration requirements. However, a couple of minutes ago I referred to section 57 of the bill which says that no noncitizen can be repatriated to Australia without the consent of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Other colleagues have also referred to how an overseas sentence will be enforced in Australia. In other words, what will happen to the sentence after transfer to Australia? What will happen if the sentence would be somewhat different in the other country? There are two situations that could occur. A sentence can either continue to be enforced or, alternatively, it can be converted to a different sentence in the receiving country. The Council of Europe convention allows either method and some countries may therefore use the continued enforcement method while others may use the conversion approach. There would be widespread concern in the Australian community if as a society we moved to the conversion approach because Australians expect that people who are sentenced to a certain term of imprisonment overseas will, in fact, serve the period of incarceration that they were sentenced to in that country rather than take advantage of softer rules in this country. However, I understand that although the bill enables both forms of sentence enforcement, subject to any agreement to the contrary it is proposed that Australia would generally use the continued enforcement method. I believe that that would be a great reassurance to Australians who believe that when people are sentenced to a period in gaol that they should serve that period in gaol. I am a great advocate of truth in sentencing, that when a court sentences a prisoner to a certain term of incarceration then the person should serve that period in gaol and not half or a third, as seems to occur so often in this country at the moment. Given the situation I have outlined in relation to incoming prisoners under the continued enforcement method, the prisoner would, in effect, bring with him or her the sentence from the sending country minus any time served or remissions earned in the sending country up to the date of transfer. From the date of transfer this sentence would be subject to Australia's laws concerning the enforcement of sentences. Australia's laws concerning conditional release or remission would apply to the sentence as if the sentence was a sentence of Australia at the date of transfer. The relevant laws would be those applying to federal offenders. It is interesting that one of the initiators of this proposal was the Northern Territory government. The Northern Territory government, having got this thing under way, has now withdrawn from the scheme and there have been some concerns that the scheme ought not to proceed in view of the non-participation of the Northern Territory government. In fact, originally it was proposed that the scheme would not be implemented unless all of the state and territory governments in Australia were going to be part of it. But the view has been taken that if the Northern Territory wants to stay out then that is a matter for the Northern Territory and, hopefully, the Northern Territory will participate subsequently. Clearly, the ideal position is to have full participation of all the states and territories. The reason for that is fairly clear. Commonwealth practice with regard to international conventions Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3001 and treaties has been that Australia will present a united face internationally and thus will not become a party unless all jurisdictions have agreed and undertaken the necessary steps to ensure that their laws are consistent with Australia's international obligations. If states and territories do not participate those who do may be disadvantaged, because Australians imprisoned overseas who wish to serve their time in Australia would attempt to do so in the participating states or territories, even though their community ties were stronger in the nonparticipating states and territories. In addition, it could be said to be discriminating against Australians in overseas prisons who are from the non-participating states and territories. So, clearly, while full participation is something to which everyone would aspire, it simply cannot be achieved at this time. Indeed, one hopes that the Northern Territory will fall into line in due course. It also has been said by some speakers that there could be a net revenue gain for Australia, because we will have an outflow of more prisoners abroad than we will have prisoners returning to Australia. Given the enlightened system of custodial treatment in Australia, and given the fact that many people feel that prisons are very soft in Australia compared with many of the countries with whom we will enter into treaties, my own gut feeling is that most Australians abroad would quite naturally want to return to Australia so that they are able to enjoy Australian prison conditions within our prisons, but very few prisoners from non-Western countries would seek to return home and to the standards which exist in their prison systems. I think what is highly likely is that we will get a large number of Australians returning to Australia but we will not get very many people at all going to overseas prisons. This will mean that there could in fact be an additional cost to the system. I understand that the Attorney-General( Mr Williams) will look at this matter some time down the track-I certainly hope he does-to try to make sure that the system is equitable not only to prisoners but also to states and territories in Australia and, indeed, to the Commonwealth as a whole. So my support for the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill is an 'on balance' support. I do have certain concerns about it. It is a bill that has been a long time in coming before the parliament. As a community we have decided that the humanitarian goals, the social advantages-and some would say the economic advantages-of this legislation outweigh any detriment. SoI urge that the bill be supported by the committee and the parliament and I urge the Attorney-General to review the operation of this bill in about 12 months to see whether it needs any finetuning. I thank the Committee. of Prisoners Bill is not 'on balance': this is a very worthwhile measure and it is overdue. The concern of the Attorney-General's Department, when it said that it would be pre-emptive to assume that all states will get through the process, is a worry. I join with the Attorney-General( Mr Williams) in hoping that all states and territories do participate in this scheme. We all come to these kinds of debates with our life experience and the baggage of what we have been through. On many occasions I had the experience, particularly as a state member of parliament but also as a federal member, of having families from my electorate approach me about the problems of access they had for their family members who were incarcerated. Those people had difficulties even within this country, such as the difficulty of actually travelling on weekends to country towns to meet young offenders who had been gaoled. I have had the experience of involvement with our high commission in the United Kingdom in regard",134,Representatives Main Committee
275,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (5.19 P.m.),"My support for the International Transfer3002 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 to a local citizen who was gaoled over there. He went there and it came as a massive surprise to his family when he was gaoled for drug related offences. Over the period of 13 years that I have been in the state or federal parliament, I have probably had about 15 of these very direct circumstances, of people living within 50 metres of me, coming from very good families, basically getting mixed up with the wrong groups and being gaoled, putting great stress on their families. That is one of the major emphases I want to make regarding this measure. It is not only a question of supposed featherbedding of Australians as prisoners overseas; it is also the reality of the emotional trauma for their families. This was well articulated in Trends and Issues, July 1992, by David Biles, who I gather from reading the committee report has also been involved at this stage. He said in that document: Family members also often feel that it is necessary for them to visit their sons, daughters or spouses in order to provide psychological or material comfort, and they often feel compelled to make repeated pleas for assistance and relief to government authorities and welfare organisations, both in Australia and overseas. Furthermore, the available evidence indicates that prisoners who have strong and supportive relationships with their families are less likely to become recidivists than are prisoners without such relationships. We have heard from other speakers on the question of cultural problems in overseas prisonsthe question, I guess, of the possibility and probability of their being one out in prison inmate cultures, of being victimised, and of whether those corrective services systems really have much consideration of people with our cultural background. The legislation is overdue. I am very supportiv.e of it. There was some side comment from the previous speaker as to the fact it took so long. I notice that the actual final agreement amongst the states and territories and Commonwealth did stretch from 1992 to 1993. I could proffer the possibility that there were a lot of difficulties in getting agreement from the states; we have heard now that some of them are doubtful and others are very reluctant. There is a variety of possibilities. If it has taken a while in this country, it has certainly been on the boil in Europe. There is a 27-country convention there, which includes a number of countries that are not European. I understand that there is also a Commonwealth agreement. Internationally this is happening on a very large scale. It is a reality of increasing international movement of people; of, perhaps, increasing interrelationship of criminal organisations as well-I guess that has got to be a factor in it all-and also of organised crime setting up in cultures, through population movement, where they have not previously been present. All those factors come into it. It is interesting to note, however, with reference to the advocacy of the need for the international transfer of prisoners that Biles documented in 1992, if you look at the numbers involved, which are to some degree guesswork, you see that there does not seem to have been a great increase in those gaoled either here or overseas in the various categories. I notice a bit of difficulty in the figures supplied to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs-there seems a bit of a conflict there-and I think it points to the uncertainty when they talk about people born overseas and those who actually would be eligible to be covered by this legislation. There do not seem to be clear figures in a number of jurisdictions as to whether they relate to people who could go back or those who were born overseas. If you look at the actual figures and add them up for the states that had people interested in the scheme, et cetera, you find more than were originally claimed Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3003 to be eligible. Equally, as people say, there is debate as to how many Australian citizens there are in overseas prisons. The degree of consular contact, the degree to which they know about people and the degree to which people actually bother to be in contact with our representatives all lead to uncertainty in the figures. Everyone around the place is proffering ideas about whether, on balance, we are going to save money. Of course it is highly probable that the number of Australians trying to re-enter here will be greater, but the actual figures seem to indicate that we hold far greater numbers of people who would be eligible for return to overseas nations. It really is a lot of guesswork and, at the end of the day, the humanitarian aspect concerning these people's families and the problems they have in overseas jurisdictions wins me in the debate. Concerns have been expressed about the possibility that people will give up their appeal rights. There have been references to the number of IRA cases in the United Kingdom and the possibility that people would give up rights and would essentially have possibilities of winning those appeals. It is not just politically related cases like the IRA. You could probably refer to people who went to the gallows in the United Kingdom, through failures in their system, to see that there is a danger that people do not exercise those full rights. When you see a legal system in the United States where 12 per cent of people are black yet 41 per cent of people facing the death sentence are black, you do question overseas jurisdictions. There is the question of whether people do sacrifice rights that they should exercise to the very limit and whether this might become an incentive for some to sacrifice those rights. There are a variety of protections here. As other speakers have indicated, there is a requirement that there be consent by the individual, by the countries involved et cetera. I note that in the migration area-and I am a person who has had a fair involvement in this field and takes a deep interest in it-the correct protections are there. There is the requirement of the minister to have an involvement with regard to those people who are not citizens. I notice reference to the question of those children born overseas, how they fit into the system, and the need for that to be looked at. There is the question of dual criminality-that offences are roughly commensurate in the two countries. I do not really have any doubts in a fundamental sense about this legislation. There are references to annual reporting. We are taking about a phenomenon that is increasing internationally. We have a situation where people who are separated from their families and are alone in jurisdictions are given this opportunity. I think the legislation is worthwhile. I do hope that all states and territories come on board and that we do not have an overconcentration on unnecessary fears about swarms of people somehow descending on the country when they have no right to be here, or on concerns that people will miss out on the great suffering that some people think they should have in Thailand or Burma. We should get a few of these things in perspective. Some people run around expressing concern that it might be better for some people to suffer in Thai gaols. To put this in perspective, there was an interesting article this week in the Guardian Weekly about the Burmese regime and its treatment of other people with a bit more than a passing interest in crime. It was noted in the article that Khun Sa was given licences to operate transport companies, trade in real estate and run a $24 million mineral concession under his new name. The article said: 3004 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 The men who mediated for him in the lead-up to his televised surrender, including his former accountant and two Mong Tai officers, say a $20 million contract was drawn up. The situation is that the main architect of drug peddling in the Burma Thailand border area was accepted by Burmese authorities and basically allowed to go legitimate within the legal system of that country. So to quibble over the fact that a few people-who, to my mind, are basically desperates in general from what you see of them on television-might not be suffering from malaria and a series of other diseases in Thai gaols is really not the right emphasis to put on this measure. It is overdue, I support it strongly, and I congratulate the government for bringing it before the House. reply-I commence by thanking members who have spoken on this bill, the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill, and I note that, in effect, all have supported it. The honourable member for Banks( Mr Melham) represents the shadow Attorney-General and is a regular speaker on bills from my portfolio, but there were also other regular contributors to discussion of bills in my portfolio, including the members for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith), Barton( Mr McClelland), Maribyrnong ( Mr Sercombe) and Fisher( Mr Slipper). I am very pleased that this particular bill has also attracted the attention of the member for Swan( Mr Randall) and the member for Reid( Mr Laurie Ferguson). We hope to see more contributions from them on the Attorney-General's portfolio bills. The bill, as has been mentioned, was the subject of an advisory report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I welcome the committee's report and its strong support of the bill. The report itself recognises the considerable consultation and work that has gone into the development of it, particularly through the comprehensive and detailed consultation process with the states and territories. I am grateful for the thorough and detailed consideration which the committee devoted to the bill. The committee made seven recommendations and I am pleased to be able to say that I agree with all of them. I propose to just briefly mention each of them. The first is that the parliament pass the bill following due consideration of the recommendations of the committee's report. I naturally agree wholeheartedly with that recommendation. In light of the strong rehabilitative and humanitarian benefits and the possible financial advantages of international prisoner transfers, I would urge the Senate, as well as the House, to pass the bill as soon as possible. The committee's second recommendation is that I formally approach my state and territory counterparts about participating in the international transfer of prisoners scheme. Members would be aware that this matter has been on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General for some time. I have previously written to my colleagues from the states and territories on this issue on a number of occasions. I have again recently written and drawn their attention to the committee's report. In accordance with the committee's recommendation I have emphasised the value of the scheme and the need for all states and territories to enact complementary legislation as a matter of priority. The third recommendation is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock. It is that he initiate an examination of the issues surrounding the eligibility of persons who have been removed from Australia as children to have a right of entry to Australia. The question as to whether certain people should have a right of entry to Australia is clearly a wider issue relating to migration legislation, rather than simply an issue",137,Representatnes Main Committee
276,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General and Minister for Justice) (5.30 p.m.)-inTuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3005 specifically related to the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill. I therefore have written to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs drawing this recommendation to his attention and requesting him to undertake any necessary follow-up action. I note that any subsequent action on this issue should not impede the progress of the bill. The fourth recommendation is that my department note any difficulties which arise in the operation of the transfer scheme as a result of either the language used in paragraph 15(l)(a) or its substantive elements, and report on any such difficulties in an annual review of the scheme. That paragraph requires that for transfers to Australia neither the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the transfer country's court or tribunal nor the conviction on which it is based is subject to appeal under the law of the transfer country. This requires that the appeal process is exhausted. It does not, however, exclude the possibility of a later review based, for example, on fresh evidence. I have requested my department to pay particular attention to the practical operation of this paragraph when the scheme is in place and to report on any particular difficulties as part of the annual reporting process. The fifth recommendation is that when the regulations are drafted they should provide that prisoners be given information about either prison conditions in the country they want to transfer to, or relevant organisations that provide such information, prior to the making of the decision about being transferred to that country. I agree with this recommendation and will ensure that this matter is addressed in the drafting of the regulations. The sixth recommendation is that the operation of the act be reviewed by the Attorney General's Department annually and that a report of that review be tabled in the parliament. I agree that regular reporting on the operation of the legislation is important. I propose to implement this recommendation by having my department include specific information on the operation of the act in its annual report, which is tabled in parliament. Finally, it is recommended that clause 24 be redrafted for clarification purposes. I agree with this recommendation and have circulated a government amendment in response to it. I commend the bill to the Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

278,Mr Deputy Speaker,"The bill has been agreed to with an amendment. The question3006 MAIN COMMlITEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 March, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the bill be now read a second time. is not controversial legislation. We support it. There does not seem to be any disagreement coming from any quarter about the desirability of moving the University of Canberra from Commonwealth control to that of the ACT government. I think that makes a great deal of sense. It makes the arrangement more consistent with that applying to almost all the other universities in this country-the big exception of course being the Australian National University. That university does have a somewhat different function, given that it has within it the Institute of Advanced Studies, which receives a large part of total higher education research funding and which is very much a national asset. So there is some sense in continuing to maintain it as a national institution under the control of the Commonwealth government. Certainly we agree that moving the University of Canberra to the ACT government is a good move. The Vice-Chancellor, Professor Aitken, has been very keen to see this matter expedited. I indicated to him that, from the point of view of the opposition, we would do everything possible to speed the process up. So the bill is being treated as non-controversial, as indicated by the fact that it is being debated in this place. That is the major measure in the legislation. The other change relates to the Maritime College and confers on it a capacity to make statutes in relation to regulating parking and something or other else, which is hardly what you would call contentious. We are inclined to support both those measures. The University of Canberra has really come on very well over the last few years. I know well the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Aitken. I particularly knew him well when I was minister for higher education from 1990 to 1993. He is an outstanding institutional leader and has made a major contribution over the years to public debate about educational issues. He has made a major contribution to this country's education system in a variety of capacities over the years. I think the University of Canberra itself is showing the benefits of that very good institutional leadership. It is now in a number of areas of study an institution that produces graduates whose employability is among the highest in the country, certainly in particular fields. I think Professor Aitken has a vision for the future of the institution and has been instrumental in pushing it along. SoI would like to take the opportunity to congratulate all those associated with the university and wish it well for the future. I hope that the new relationship established with the ACT government, which certainly the university itself favours, will assist in promoting its further development as an institution servicing this region and the country as a whole. College Act being amended turned to disappointment. Having a maritime background, I thought there might be something that I could relate to in relation to that particular act, and at the same time indulge myself a little. I remember the setting up of that college with a great deal of fondness. However, I then noticed that the amendment related to the invariable discussion at universities about car parking. That is a bone of contention no matter what",141,Representatives Main Committee

The thrust of the Education Legislation Amendment Bill is the amendments to the University of Canberra Act. The clear thrust is to amend the act in order to transfer responsibility for the University of Canberra from the Commonwealth to the ACT. At the risk of being labelled a bit of an old fogey, I want to look a little at universities generally in a philosophical way and lament what has happened to them. While I welcome the particular development in one sense, it is timely to cast one's mind back a little to what has happened in relation to universities, particularly in recent times. Some of them have become businesses. I question whether that is a good thing. In some areas one would say, 'Yes, it is good that we can promote the development of research and development.' For example, the areas of research at the University of Queensland have been expanded, and great assistance has been forthcoming, particularly in the engineering and metallurgical areas, where great developments have been made that have spawned a number of significant developments, particularly in metallurgy. At the same time, from a philosophical point of view, the overall notion that a university is really a business tends to detract from what universities should engender. I am reminded of the notion of student protest. I find the widespread lack of student protest alarming in many respects. One of the greatest curses facing mankind is hunger, and yet student protests these days at universities seem to revolve around very selfish issues. They seem to be talking about whether they are getting enough, or more frequently not getting anything, out of the public purse. Great protests are made of that in sectional areas. Frequently, somewhat trendy middle-class pursuits and debates are followed-the sorts of things that permeate cafe society. Where is the leading? Where is the forefront of protest in universities? Where are the students who are standing up for the hungry in society? Why aren't they at the vanguard of those issues? Why aren't we seeing raised the thought-provoking placards of the sort we used to see in the 1960s, draped across the Victoria bridge? And what about the marches? When I was at university, I was never a person who would go around protesting. In fact, I was a conservative student, but I did admire the protest movement, because I admired the fact that there were people who were prepared to question the society and to question the Vietnam War and the various establishment norms. The fact that we had those things going on in the university culture in those days was, I think, healthy for society generally. I ask myself, with some regret, where that movement has gone, and whether the university system has in fact crushed dissent, somewhat subconsciously. Has the whole structure of university life become so centred on goals and outcomes that the free thought that universities ought to promote, nurture and respect and the time for those activities and the fun associated with them have really been crushed by the nature of university life? Has the learning been such a drag and such an impost that wisdom, dissent and initiative have been squeezed out of students these days?",142,Representatives Main Commiitee

282,Mr Tony Smith,"Right! In any event, those car parking matters often tum into nice3008 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 I regret to say that I feel that that has happened a lot. Largely we see in the protest movement, or what is left of it, somewhat of a Trotskyist rump. I am not saying necessarily that that is a bad thing, either. I do not think it is a bad thing, but the fact is that it is so marginalised that nobody bothers with it anyway, whereas the university protest movement of the old days was a much broader church. It is worthy of note that many of the people on both sides of politics were part of that protest movement, in one form or another, and have variously segregated to particular areas of politics; but frequently they joined for part of those protest movements, which was a good thing, and I think it spawned the sort of leadership potential that we see in the political sphere now. Are we going to lose that, if we do not remember that that is the way that university life is conducted? PerhapsI am lamenting the good old days. Are they gone for good-or bad, depending on one's point of view? In any event, the University of Canberra began life as the Canberra College of Advanced Education, and it was assisted through the transition to university by sponsorship from Monash University, and that process began in 1989. The sponsorship arrangements gave Monash University powers of approval over the development of the University of Canberra's graduate programs and over staff appointments at certain levels. In 1992 the vice-chancellors of both universities agreed that the continuation of sponsorship was unnecessary and it was time to bring the Big Brother type of relationship to an end. The bill makes appropriate and necessary amendments to the University of Canberra Act, to reflect the fact that the sponsorship arrangements no longer apply. Monash University is an institution of considerable significance for the government. The Treasurer ( Mr Costello) graduated from that university with a BA and a LLB (Hons). After completing his undergraduate studies, he went on to become a tutor in the faculties of law, economics and politics at Monash and was an academic of some renown who, in undergraduate life, was quite intensely involved in the campus scene. To return to my original point, for many years the university campus has been the breeding ground for leaders of the future, but the leaders were also found outside the university. It was a nice combination. We think of people like Ben Chifley in that regard, and you see on our side of politics a lot of people who have never been near a university but who have acquired the wisdom from the university of life. While it is still the case today that we are looking for potential leaders from the university culture, I wonder if the emphasis upon academic attainment is so ingrained in university life that it is at the expense of the joie de vivre exhibited by university students in the 1960s and 1970s. I wi111eave that with the Committee. The bill also introduces amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act to give effect to the policy that it is appropriate for higher education institutions in the states and territories to determine for themselves what role, if any, that tribunal should have in relation to determining salaries in those areas. It is worthy to observe also, in this fairly general debate, that one of the most often lamented or criticised matters when I was an undergraduate was the standard of performance of some of the academics. We now have a culture of the business orientated university, which highlights that in my time at university, in the 1970s, there was certainly a need to look at the standard of academics. They seemed frequently to be ungovernable by any standards of performance, output and ability to lecture. The students would complain constantly about performance, yet nothing was ever done. I hope that universities, particularly as a result of this measure, Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3009 recognise that there is a need to ensure standards of academic excellence and that the old catch cry of the independence of academics and their position in the debate is not used as a means of stifling justifiable criticism of some of the performance of academics. One lecturer that I had would not qualify to make tea in the office of a suburban solicitor, yet he was lecturing in a very significant area of law at the University of Queensland-having been passed on from a Melbourne university, with glowing references. It is those sorts of things I am talking about. I know I am going back some years, but I suspect that it is an area that universities should be looking at. Overall, I thank the Committee for this opportunity to participate in this debate and support the amendments. Amendment Bill and, as the member for Canberra, to speak principally about the transfer of the University of Canberra to the ACT government. I will talk in detail, in the brief time available, about some aspects to do with the university, but I want firstly to contrast the positive recognition in this bill of the self-government of the ACT, and the rights and capacity of the ACT to discharge this sort of obligation equally with the states, with the dreadful decision that parliament made last night with regard to the Andrews bill, the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. My principal concern about that bill was not its reflection on the rights of territories, as I made clear in my speech in the Main Committee. My concern was one of the substance of the matter. But we now have a situation where citizens of the three territories-if you include Norfolk Island, which is also part of my electorate-suffer a disease not known to any other Australian, called Andrews agony. They are the only people who have had this parliament impose upon them suffering which they desire to be freed from and from which the parliament which they had elected gave them an outlet. I deplore and regret that decision, and I choose very briefly to make that contrast with the very positive recognition for the ACT reflected in this legislation. I want only to speak about that part of the bill that relates to the University of Canberra. It is a transfer that was originally proposed by the university, and I think correctly. It was supported by the previous government and it was supported by this government, and reintroduced by it. It had been introduced by the previous government but not finished before the election. It is supported also by the Labor and Liberal parties in the ACT. It is, <;learly, not a politically controversial matter, nor institutionally, in terms of the views of the University of Canberra or any of the other principal education institutions of the ACT. The University of Canberra is a very important institution in ACT society and in the ACT economy. It sees itself as a significant part of the community. It participates actively within the community and makes a substantial contribution to it. I welcome, and was very interested in, some of the remarks made by the member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith)-and I do not pretend that I shared them all-and I thought he was raising some interesting questions about the nature of universities and their relationship to their staff and students in this time of greater focus on the commercial role of universities. I was interested in his perception of the changing role of students in our society, as evidenced by his comment upon the lack of demonstrations-which was an interesting comment to hear from a member of the government-and his concern that the universities were becoming too business oriented and were changing their focus from the more academic and research orientation to a more commercial orientation. I was very interested to hear those",143,Representatives Main Committee
283,Mr Mcmullan (Canberra) (5.54 P.m.),"I arise also to support the Education Legislation3010 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 remarks from a government member and I welcome the fact that he raised those issues. As I say, I do not share all the views he expressed, but I thought they were interesting. If we want to look at why the volume and nature of public policy involvement by students change, we need to look at more than what is going on in universities; we need to have a look at what is going on much more broadly in the economy and in society. That would be a debate worth having, but it would be a different debate. One of the things that the University of Canberra does significantly here in the ACT relates to that commercial role in terms of the influx of foreign fee-paying students. They are important to the university. In the last year for which I have figures, foreign fee-paying students were 9.7 per cent of the university's total student load and contributed $5.41 million in 1995 to the university. They also contribute substantially to the broader economy of the ACT in terms of that $5.41 million and in terms of the other activities of those students while they are here participating at the university, and in terms of people who come to visit the ACT as a result of those students being here. Like all universities, the University of Canberra is facing financial difficulties as a result of the government funding changes. It is putting the university under pressure. It is requiring decisions to be made that the administration, the students and the staff do not welcome. I hope that we can see some easing of that relentless pressure upon tertiary institutions in general and, for the purpose of this debate, the University of Canberra in particular, in the forthcoming budget. The University of Canberra makes a substantial broader regional contribution. It says in its mission statement and objectives that the university sets itself to be the principal knowledge resource for the ACT and its hinterland and to possess the strongest possible links between the university and the community. It is very significant in the ACT. It is important that it raises that broader question of its significance in the region. One of the causes of concern to me, when people assess the economy of the ACT, is the failure of people to understand the complex and important interrelationship between that economy and the economy of the whole of the south-east of New South Wales, most obviously with Queanbeyan but quite importantly with the much broader south-eastern New South Wales region of which Canberra operates as the major regional city. It is also a university of national significance. I cannot do justice to that in the time available, but I have been aware of, and in some ways rather involved in, the important work it does at the Australian Centre for Local Government Studies, with the CRCs, with the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling and with the Ngunnawal Centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education. So you can see broader national involvement and contribution by the University of Canberra, and that reinforces the extent to which I welcome its role here and this legislation transferring responsibility to the ACT government. The final point I want to make, because I did promise those seeking to organise the agenda that I would finish in 10 minutes, is about the underestimated contribution of universities in regional cities-not just Canberra, but also in most of Australia's major regional cities-in 'I e employment area. Directly, with academic staff and non-academic staff, plus measuring the full-time equivalents of the casual staff in the various categories, there are a thousand jobs at the University of Canberra. Very many other jobs are indirectly contributed to by its existence. The whole high technology park across the road from the university would not exist and thrive in the way it does without its interrelationship with the IT and engineering schools Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3011 of the university. Some of those functions would be there anyway, some would not, with the CRCs and the other relationships. I welcome this legislation and the fact that it is going to pass through the parliament in this session. I welcome the fact that it has had bipartisan support, as it had in the past. I look forward to the continuing successful development of the university under the jurisdiction of the ACT government. Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (6.02 p.m.)-in reply-My first political involvement was at a demonstration. It was an anti-Kerr demonstration on the campus of the University of New South Wales. that Sir John Kerr was being unjustly vilified. Anyway, I take the point made by the member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith) which is obviously right: there is more to life than just money, and there should be more to university life than simply passing exams. I welcome his contribution to this debate on the Education Legislation Amendment Bill 1997. It transfers responsibility for the University of Canberra from the Commonwealth to the ACT government and it also provides to the Australian Maritime College the ability to make by-laws to control its own parking. I should point out that this bill in no way diminishes the Commonwealth's funding obligations to the University of Canberra. The bill has had a rather long march through the legislative process to fruition this evening. It was in April 1993 when the University of Canberra first sought this transfer from Commonwealth to territory jurisdiction, because the university believed that it would be better integrated into the ACT government's education strategies if it came under the ACT's jurisdiction. It believed that, in this way, there would be a closer identification between the university and the ACT. It believed that it would serve the purposes of the university to have as its parliamentary champion, as it were, the ACT minister for education, rather than the federal minister who had many other things on his or her plate. I guess the university thought that it was perhaps better to be a big fish in a small pool, than a small fish in a big pool. Legislation was finally brought into the parliament in late 1995 by the former government, but it lapsed as a result of the election, so this legislation is now before the House. This legislation is a sign of the government's commitment to the ACT. It is a sign of successful lobbying on the part of Professor Aitken, Senator Margaret Reid and many other people. From the government's point of view, placing the University of Canberra under territory jurisdiction puts it in the same position as nearly all other universities, with the exception of the Australian National University. These universities are juridically responsible to state and territory governments, even though the Commonwealth provides the vast preponderance of funds. I am sure the ACT government is appropriately grateful for this chance to exercise stewardship over the University of Canberra while the Commonwealth continues to provide the money. Turning to the second aspect of this bill, in late 1993 the Australian Maritime College in Launceston was troubled by a very serious problem. It seems that the adjacent University of",145,Representatives Main Committee

The Australian Maritime College then sought legal advice on its ability to control parking on its own grounds. I am going to read, if I may, some of that advice, because it is important that everyone understands exactly why the government is taking up the parliament's time with this legislation. When the AMC asked the lawyers for advice, it posed this question: Does the College have power to make traffic regulations that are enforceable? The lawyers answered: We note the provisions of Section 24 of the Maritime College Act 1978 which allows the Council to make statutes ... with respect to the ... (a) management, good government and discipline of the College and of the institution conducted by the College. It further allows ... for the imposition, by or on behalf of the College, of penalties upon students of the College or persons employed by the College for contravention of, or failure to comply with, a statute with respect to a matter referred to in paragraph (a). However, the lawyers went on to say: It does not contemplate, by inference, penalties upon ""outsiders"" such as trespassing students from the University or any other people illegally parked upon College property. The lawyers then advised as follows: If one turns to Section 24(1)(j) which provides that statutes may be enacted for ""any other matter necessary or convenient for giving effect to this Act"" then one can see that it was obviously the intent of Parliament to provide general powers to the College to govern its own affairs. Its own affairs must, by definition, include the management of its grounds. Nevertheless we are concerned that some legal challenge could, conceivably, be mounted to any parking scheme by reason of the unfortunate wording of Section 24(1)(b) which refers to penalties being imposed only upon students or staff. As a matter of practicality it might be highly unlikely that the scheme would be challenged but nevertheless we feel obliged to point out the possibility. That is what the lawyers said, and that is why this act has come before the parliament. The Australian Maritime College can use an action in trespass against anyone parking improperly on the grounds, but it is always much easier to impose a fine-and hence this legislation. If, as the good Lord says, not a sparrow falls without the knowledge of the Father, I am sure the voters of Australia will be delighted to know that not a car is illicitly parked in the grounds of the AMC in Launceston without the benevolent intervention of the federal government.

288,Mr Miles (Braddon,"Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.10Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3013 The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1996 contains three changes which were announced by the previous government in the 1995-96 budget as a response to a small number of recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. The bill also includes consequential changes to child support legislation to reflect changes made in the Social Security Act 1991, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The package of measures included in the bill is aimed at increasing flexibility, reducing the level of intrusiveness and improving certainty and clarity in the law. Use of election where income has changed Where a child support liability has been created by an administrative assessment, a parent is able to apply to have the registrar vary the amount of their liability by lodging an income estimate election. An income estimate election often results in a paying parent being entitled to a refund of moneys already paid to the person receiving child support. This causes significant inconvenience for persons receiving child support where the amount of child support has already been spent for the benefit of the children. It also means that the parent paying child support often has to repay most, if not all, of the amount refunded over the remainder of the year at a time when they have less capacity to do so. The bill will amend the effect of an income estimate election to make it less likely that a person receiving child support will be asked to repay amounts in the future and to make the effect of an income estimate election a more accurate reflection of a paying parent's capacity to pay. The revised income estimate will be used to recalculate the amount of the child support properly payable for the year. However, amounts payable prior to the date of lodgement of an estimate will generally be left undisturbed and will be taken into account in arriving at the future liabilities for the remaining period. The only time that amounts payable prior to the lodgement of an estimate will be disturbed is where, after calculating the amount properly payable and the amounts charged to the date of the estimate, the parent has already been charged too much for the year. This will remove a significant and frequent cause for complaint from persons receiving child support. Electing for employer withholding not to apply The bill amends the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to allow a payer of child support to make payments directly to the Child Support Registrar where the registrar is satisfied that a person will make timely payments. This measure will : . reduce the level of intrusiveness of the child support scheme for payers who can be relied upon to make their child support payments directly to the registrar in a timely manner; provide greater flexibility to the registrar in the way he administers the collection of child support and reduce overall administration costs; and reduce the costs of compliance by employers in withholding child support by permitting more payers to pay directly where they can be relied on to make payments in a timely manner. If the registrar refuses to accept an election to pay directly, the payer has the right to object to, and appeal against, this decision. 3014 MAIN COMMITIEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 The government is conscious that the implications may be severe for children where a payer defaults. The registrar's primary responsibility will continue to be to ensure the collection of child support in a timely manner. In making the proposed change, the government will ensure that there are strict safeguards in the event of default. In the event of default, the registrar will be able to require that child support be withheld from a person's employer in the future and a payer will not be able to make another election until a period of 6 months has elapsed from the date the registrar was required to make arrangements with a person's employer. In most cases, payers who default after choosing to pay directly to the registrar will have strictly limited future access to this provision. Consideration of child support liabilities in property and spousal maintenance proceedings The bill will amend the Family Law Act to enable the court to take into account the child support liability of a person in property and spousal maintenance proceedings, even where a child support assessment has not been issued. Under the existing law, where a person is voluntarily paying child support without an assessment of his child support liability, the amounts paid or to be paid under such arrangements cannot be taken into account by the court in making orders in either property or spousal maintenance proceedings. This may result in courts making orders which do not adequately reflect the true circumstances of the party who is to pay child support. This also means that parties must apply for an assessment even where they wish to make private arrangements regarding child support for the court to take into account these commitments when making orders regarding property or spousal maintenance. This will ensure that separated parents with private arrangements for child support will be treated in the same way as parents who are paying child support under the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. Employer record keeping requirements The bill amends the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to reduce the period an employer is required to retain child support records from seven years to five years. This will bring the child support requirement into line with record keeping requirements under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This measure will make it easier for employers to voluntarily comply with their record keeping obligations by having one period for both taxation and child support purposes. It will also result in a slight reduction in the cost of compliance as the period of retention of records for child support purposes has been reduced. Family Law Act 1975 changes The bill brings the child support presumptions of parentage into line with the amended provisions of the Family Law Act 1975. Updating references to the Social Security Act The bill amends the provisions in the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 by substituting references to the Social Security Act 1947 with provisions and concepts in the Social Security Act 1991. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.

289,Mr Latham (Werriwa) (6.17 P.m.),"On behalf of the opposition, I move:Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3015 (1) expresses concern at the failure of the Howard Government, after 12 months in office, to respond to the recommendations of the report of the Joint Select Committee into Certain Family Law Issues entitled 'Child Support Scheme: An Examination of the Operation and Effectiveness of the Scheme'; (2) believes the Government should be concerned about the well-being and welfare of all families: whether they be intact families, separated families, single parent families or serial families; (3) notes with concern the failure to implement some of the report's recommendations has caused parents and their children to suffer needless hardship; (4) believes that there is important and urgent need to improve and strengthen the Child Support Scheme; and (5) considers that much time has been lost and therefore the Government should respond to the recommendations of the report concerned with changing the child support formula as soon as possible and introduce legislation within six months to this effect"". I expect that amendment moved by the opposition to be embraced by the government members, particularly their self-appointed experts on the back bench who have stood up on numerous occasions lamenting the shortcomings of the child support scheme. I anticipate the support of the member for Capricornia ( Mr Marek), the member for Bowman( Mrs West), the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), the member for Warringah ( Mr Abbott), the member for Longman( Mr Brough) and the member for Dawson( Mrs De-Anne Kelly)-just to name a few. This has been one of the interesting features of the new government backbench since the last election: their determination to talk big on the question of child support reform but to act very little when it comes to bringing to the parliament substantive amendments. It is, of course, unacceptable that the government after 12 months in office has failed to respond to the findings and recommendations of the parliamentary report of 1994. The measures now before the parliament represent an ALP response from the time of the 1995-96 budget. So, for a government that promised so much and for a government backbench which has spoken so frequently on this matter, one would expect the Howard government to do a lot more than to imitate the Labor proposals that were foreshadowed at the time of the 1995 budget. Once again the Labor Party is in a position where it is here to help the government honour its election commitments to improve the operation, effectiveness and equity of the Child Support Agency. The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to introduce certain recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, reflecting the changes announced by the former government in August 1995. A major impact of the package is that it streamlines a number of administrative elements of the child support scheme, foreshadowing three changes to existing arrangements: firstly, the use of election where income is changed; secondly, electing for employer withholding not to apply; and, finally, consideration of child support liabilities in family law proceedings. I will deal with the first of these reforms. Parents have the right to apply to the Child Support Registrar to vary the amount of their liability so that either the custodial parent is forced to repay moneys which have already been spent on the supported children in question, or, conversely, that a paying parent is forced to repay most or all of the amount refunded over the remainder of the year. Under the current system, variation to a paying parent's liability has been extremely inconvenient for both the custodial and non-custodial parent. The purpose of this aspect of the amendment is to allow for a more accurate reflection of the payer's future capacity to pay because the amount payable will only be charged for the months remaining after the estimate 3016 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 has been lodged. It will also reduce the likelihood of a custodial parent being compelled to make repayments. The second reform is electing for employer withholding not to apply. An amendment to the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 will give payers the opportunity to make payments direct to the Child Support Registrar. The only caveat to this is that the registrar be satisfied that the person will make timely payments. The benefits of this change include a saving in administrative costs which would have otherwise been spent in an attempt to make the employers aware of the scheme's operation and their subsequent responsibilities. It also provides a greater choice of method of payment for the non-custodial parent. Many payers opt to make payments directly to the registrar rather than through an employer link, which has the advantages of privacy and confidentiality. Essentially, this change reflects greater discretion in the way the collection of child support is administered. On the final reform, presently any voluntary child support arrangement is not taken into account by the Family Court in either property or spouse maintenance proceedings. The bill will have the effect of putting these arrangements in the same way as a child support assessment and will thus allow the court to more accurately assess the financial circumstances of the parties to the proceedings. As the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister( Mr Miles) mentioned, the bill also contains three areas of consequential amendments to related acts. In respect to the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, this is an administrative change to bring child support record keeping requirements by employers in line with the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The period for which employers must retain child support records will be reduced from seven to five years. The administrative burden on employers in relation to their child support responsibilities will be reduced, and a system of uniform record keeping established between these acts. The Family Law Act 1995 is amended so that the definition of parentage is streamlined by the amendment to bring it in line with the current family law provisions. These incidental amendments cover the definition of a prescribed court, the replacement of parentage in terms of months with a measure of weeks, and the presumptions which arise from cohabitation. The Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 is being amended to ensure that certain provisions in the act with reference to the Social Security Act 1947 are updated with the provisions of the Social Security Act 1991. One feature of the amendment is that it focuses on the paying parent and examines their rights, rather than solely those of the custodial parent. The rationale is to make it easier for the custodial parent to comply with his or her recognised responsibilities. In relation to the use of election where income has changed, the existing regime has proved to be a real burden for certain types of workers-for example, seasonal workers who are asked to estimate their income for a financial year. At least under this new provision, income estimates provided by such payers will provide a better reflection of their actual capacity to pay. This rationale also applies to consideration of child support liabilities and family law proceedings, allowing for more accurate initial assessment of the financial circumstances of the custodial and non-custodial parent. As members will appreciate, the joint select committee undertook a far-reaching inquiry which began as long ago as 1993 and received a quite impressive total of 6,200 submissions. Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3017 That was the largest number of submissions ever received by any committee of this parliament. In addition, a hotline organised by the committee-the first hotline to operate from Parliament House, Canberra-generated 150,000 calls in two days of operation. In tabling the committee's report, my colleague the member for Chifley, Mr Price, spoke of the need for the Child Support Agency to become a client focused and client sensitive organisation. The report contained over 160 recommendations, which were described as a fine blueprint for reform, designed to chart the way ahead for the child support scheme. Although this was a lengthy process, gradually many of the recommendations in some shape or form have been finding their way into the scheme. This legislation-the Labor response to the select committee-is the final instalment on the recommendations. I believe it is appropriate for the Main Committee and the parliament to acknowledge their appreciation for the work of the joint select committee, particularly the chairperson, Mr Price. It is not an easy area of public policy administration and consideration, but they produced a fine report that has deserved a lot better since the election than the passage of 12 months without any active response to the remaining recommendations by the new federal government. The submissions received by the committee raised several concerns about specific aspects of the child support formula. The areas of the formula which generated the most concern included the non-custodial parent's self-support component, the custodial parent's disregarded income level and the maximum income base against which the child support formula is applied. The joint committee report was an important analysis of a very complex government program. The opposition's call, through the amendment I moved earlier, for legislation to amend the child support assessment formula within the next six months follows considerable debate on this complex issue. No member could doubt the significance of the bill before us, but it is disappointing indeed, for the opposition and for tens of thousands of families subject to the child support scheme, that some of the recommendations in the report have still not been addressed at this stage. As the Department of Social Security pointed out in its submission to the child support inquiry: There are no absolutes in relation to child support. Rather the issue is the balance points between separated and intact families; between children of first and subsequent families; between custodial and non-custodial parents; and between parents and taxpayers generally. These balance points are complex and, in both social and economic terms, are affected by the interactions of the taxation, social security and child support systems. The Inquiry provides the opportunity to re-test the balance points and to clear the air on certain issues which have emerged. With many other members of parliament, I have encountered numerous cases of the. 'balance points' the department refers to, through the work that I have undertaken with constituents in my electorate office. I appreciate that any changes to the formula will change the balance between the interests of custodial and non-custodial parents and taxpayers. There are very few instances, particularly when it comes to consideration of the formula, where policy makers can examine win-win scenarios. This is an area of policy, in the absence of major injections of public funding, where most of the reforms throw up the prospect of win-lose scenarios. So the application of sound policy principles is all important. I can foreshadow that, as the opposition member now chartered with some shadow responsibilities for child support, I will be trying to apply some fresh principles to this complex area of public policy. 3018 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 As is so often the case with these win-lose scenarios, the child support area has been seen through the prism of gender equity issues. I am disappointed that so many of these debates seem to have fallen to the level of pitching male versus female interests. It is much healthier for the parliament and parliamentarians to consider child support through the prism of income equity concerns and to examine the fairness of the existing income transfers implicit in the formula. We should blindfold ourselves to whether the parent is male or female, and rather take an income equity focus on these questions. I look forward-although I know some members would not do so-to playing an active role in the child support area. It is complex. There are no easy answers. But I believe that by applying some fresh principles of social justice and income equity to these questions, and by blindfolding ourselves to the gender equity concerns, the parliament can have a far healthier and productive debate than we have had to this point in time. There is no doubt that changes to the formula are contentious. But my assessment is that the joint select committee report raised all the issues in a very fair fashion and came up with workable recommendations in that respect. In my own electorate of Werriwa there are approximately 6,000 registered non-custodial parents who are paying child support for their children. From my discussions and correspondence with many of these parents, I can assure the Main Committee that they are waiting anxiously for the promised reform of the Child Support Agency to become law and, indeed, administrative practice. It is now commonly accepted that change is needed to the child support scheme. The real issue is the degree of change. I say to honourable members that we cannot afford to be complacent about the recommendations of the joint committee in this regard. The package of some 160 recommendations aims to strengthen the scheme, not weaken it. At the last federal election, the coalition's policy was meant to outline their position in relation to child support matters. However, apart from identifying the joint committee's report, the six-page document released by the coalition had very little to offer. The reason I am moving the amendment standing in my name, and the reason the opposition is confident that government members, if they match their rhetoric, will h\lve no problem with it, is found in the coalition's Child Support Agency election platform. On the front page of the policy the coalition described the findings of the joint committee as: ... a solid basis for ongoing reform of the Agency. If that is the case, if the recommendations are such a solid basis for ongoing reform of the agency, why hasn't the government responded to them 12 months after the last election? Their policy document went on to say: The coalition will fully address the concerns of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. After the passage of one year, any reasonable person would have to conclude that that could not have been a core promise. It must have been a non-core promise because the government has not addressed any of the concems of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law issues. It has ducked for cover. It has failed to fulfil the high expectations it set in so many electorates-particularly those along the coastal strip of Queensland and especially in the mining towns-that it would act on the findings of the joint committee. It is regrettable that the government has been so tardy in this particular process. Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3019 I also take up the words of the member for Berowra( Mr Ruddock), who was then the shadow minister for social security. Before the last election, in a media release issued on 22 February 1996, he stated: A Coalition Government will reform the Child Support Agency and the Child Support Scheme. He stated that the priorities for the coalition in office would be to ensure that the child support formula was made equitable to, as he said: ... offer a better deal for custodial and non-custodial parents alike. I make the point again: after the passage of 12 months in office, the new government has not made any change, or proposed any changes, to the child support formula. That statement was made some 13 months ago and not a single change has yet been introduced by this government. So there has been not only a failure to match the high expectations before the election, but also a failure to match up to the rhetoric since the election. You only had to tum on the radio through the New Year-January period to know that the member for Herbert( Mr Lindsay) in particular was boasting on the airwaves about the sort of support and momentum he was supposedly generating within the government for major changes to the child support formula. Whatever happened to that big talk? Whatever happened to that momentum? He produced a survey and was quoted in the West Australian newspaper on 2 January this year as saying that he had assessed the views of 60 coalition backbenchers and that 95 per cent of them wanted the Child Support Agency laws and formula changed. The opposition's second reading amendment calls for change. After more than 12 months, it is time to transform the necessary changes and the high rhetoric of people such as the member for Herbert into the law of the Commonwealth. I look forward to the support of the 60 coalition backbenchers who say they want change and to them actually voting for change by supporting the opposition amendment. In these matters I suppose the government might be reaching for excuses. One of them might be that its chosen minister, initially, for looking after the child support area was Senator Short. He hit the wall on other matters-not child support but financial support for himself, and his declaration of it to the parliament. I sent him many pieces of correspondence from my electorate, from people concerned about the administration of child support, but among the scores of letters that I had sent on to his office by the time of his fall I received only one back. It is worth quoting. It is the Jim Short memorial letter on child support matters, which he might care to take with him on his way to an overseas job for the boy. It says: Since becoming responsible for child support administration, many of you have told me of the need to improve the Child Support Agency's operations. Many electorate offices deal regularly with client complaints on issues which we expect could have been resolved by a simple phone call to the CSA. I am keen to address the problems that many clients are facing with the CSA and, through this, to reducing the number of CSA complaints which are being handled by staff in electorate offices and by Members and Senators themselves. The Coalition Government's policy on child support commits us to administrative reform of the CSA and to addressing the concerns of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. Senator Short did not deliver. All he could promise, effectively, was the resolution of these matters by a phone call-as he put it, a simple phone call. It takes more than that. It takes a bill, draft legislation, consideration by the parliament and acting on the findings of the joint committee report. 3020 MAIN COMMITTEE Tuesday, 25 March 1997 Unfortunately, Jim Short's fascination with shares and pecuniary interests meant that he was not around long enough to put his rhetoric into action. The belief of the previous minister that the child support complaints brought to the attention of electorate offices can be resolved by 'one simple phone call' illustrates the severe short-sightedness of this government. I do not know of any aggrieved client of the Child Support Agency who believes their problems can be resolved by a phone call alone. Indeed, the joint committee's report highlighted the inadequacies of the communication channels that exist between staff and clients. After more than 12 months in office this government has failed to take any steps to honour its election commitment to implement the recommendations of the joint select committee's report. This is the opportunity for those government backbenchers who have been vocal in bringing to the attention of the House specific cases of the system's failings to do more than just talk about it. Let me quote from some of the rhetoric that we have heard in recent times. I know I am supported in the amendment that I have moved by the member for Capricornia, or at least supported in his media release of 12 September 1996, which reads: After the meetingwith the Lone Fathers Association, in the town of RockhamptonMr Marek said he is keen to see the issues raised by the Lone Fathers' Association addressed by the Government as quickly as possible and will continue to make representations in the matter until they are properly resolved. That was some six to seven months ago and still there is no action. Item (5) of the opposition's amendment today is very kind to the member for Capricornia and his colleagues. We are giving him and the government six more months in which to legislate on changes to the child support formula. It is in their hands and, indeed, the hands of the entire coalition backbench to vote for our amendment and bind the government to change the law. Having discussed some specific areas of reform, I want to mention the need to strengthen the CSA's administration, to allow it to better serve its clients through effective communication. These communication problems spark the need for a child support clients charter to improve service delivery. This was an initiative of the previous Labor government. In January 1996 George Gear, as Assistant Treasurer, introduced the charter designed to improve the working relationship between clients and the CSA by setting out in plain English what parents can expect and their responsibilities in ensuring a future for the children. Specifically, the charter identifies the responsibility of those CSA clients and staff on issues such as codes of conduct, service standards, compensation, and a dispute resolution and review mechanism. The charter complemented an earlier $50 million boost to CSA resources, targeted at all agency offices in an attempt to allocate more staff to phones and upgraded communications technology within the agency. Better communications require complementary resources, especially staff. Documents obtained by the federal opposition showed, in October last year, that the government is actually closing suburban Sydney CSA offices, abandoning thousands of clients outside the Sydney CBD. The hardest hit areas will be west and south-west Sydney, where the Penrith, Bankstown and Hurstville offices will in the next few years be closed, losing somewhere in the vicinity of 250 jobs. The Bankstown office caters for my electorate, as it would, I expect, for the electorate of the member of Fowler( Mr Ted Grace), and I shudder to think that in a few years time constituents from Campbelltown and Liverpool will be forced to travel to the city if they need to see a CSA review officer. This will be over an hour of travel by public transport each way. Tuesday, 25 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 3021 Following its extensive inquiry, the joint committee came to the conclusion that the current self-support component which applies to the non-custodial parent with no subsequent family, equivalent to the single pension rate, is set at too Iowa level. By quoting the self-support components of the single pension rate, the child support formula fails to truly reflect the additional costs of employment which are carried out by employed non-custodial parents and the additional fringe benefits available to pensioners. Accordingly, recommendation 123 of the joint committee report suggests that the self-support component, referred to as the excluded income amount in the amendments, be increased. It argued that such a change would go a long way to achieving the best resolution of the balance points referred to earlier. The parents I speak to commonly cite the frustration which is felt with regard to the self-support component of the formula. The sooner we act on this frustration the better. I receive scores of letters from frustrated parents from all over the country who are disillusioned with the government's and, in particular, with the Assistant Treasurer's unwillingness to act on their concern after all the election promises for reform. The only public comments that have been attributed to ministers was a matter that appeared in the Courier-Mail on 13 February this year. It said: Social Security Minister Jocelyn Newman and Assistant Treasurer Rod Kemp are understood to be examining initial proposals but are concerned at possible budgetary effects. This confirms again that the government is treating child support as a non-core promise. We all know that if the government is shying away because of possible budgetary effects, because of their slash and bum approach to fiscal policy, those citizens right around Australia concerned about the workings of the Child Support Agency should not hold their breath expecting this government to produce positive legislative changes to the formula. Labor's second reading amendment has the potential to make a difference to the lives of almost a million Australians who are affected by the child support scheme. The agency's caseload has grown from just 58 cases in 1988 to cover 360,000 cases today, the equivalent of 720,000 clients. It is projected that this caseload will increase by an average of 5,000 cases a month. In addition to this workload, the CSA receives an estimated 11,000 telephone calls and in excess of 4,000 letters a day. These are staggering figures by any account and the problems that have arisen largely because of the CSA's rate of growth have exceeded all expectations. That confirms beyond all doubt that this is, if I can use the term, a mainstream issue and concern to the Australian people. It is not something that should necessarily be sent away to the Main Committee alone. I look forward to the House voting on my second reading amendment. With that level of caseload, with 720,000 clients and growing by 5,000 cases a month, this is an issue that every single member of this parliament must address. Every single member must be urging the minister responsible, Senator Kemp, to act on the findings of the joint committee and to bring a much fairer system of child support to all those citizens around Australia who rely on this parliament for a much fairer deal.
