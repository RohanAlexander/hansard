They were compelled to leave the country with their parents at the age of 18. Mr and Mrs Schembri were both forced to renounce Australian citizenship at the age of 18 in order to retain Maltese citizenship after they moved to Malta with their parents. This was a requirement of Maltese law at the time. This law was changed in 2000. They have maintained close and enduring ties with Australia through their numerous relatives in this country. They see their future and the future of their children in Australia, yet the government denies them the ability to reacquire Australian citizenship because they are over the age of 25. Several of Mr Schembri’s relatives, all citizens of Australia, are known to me and my staff through their involvement in community activities and service. Mr Schembri is a qualified solid plasterer and has been offered employment in Australia. His trade qualification is relatively rare and highly desirable in this country. Maltese law, prior to 2000, required young people of Maltese descent to renounce their Australian citizenship between their 18th and 19th birthdays in order to retain their Maltese citizenship. Those failing to do so became ineligible for free tertiary education in Malta and were unable to hold certain jobs, access social security benefits or purchase property without approval. While the Australian government says it is unable to provide a proper estimate of numbers, it is understood that there are, at most, a couple of thousand Maltese Australians who have renounced their Australian citizenship because of this provision. It is highly unlikely that every single eligible person will apply in this regard. Minister Hardgrave has indicated that the Maltese community has raised the issue with him and that it is under consideration. I consider the minister’s position to be a cop-out, given the history and given the unfair application to Maltese Australians. It is not immediately clear why this needs to be in line with age requirements on citizenship by descent, other than from a sense of bureaucratic tidiness. Meanwhile, many people are suffering needlessly from this law, and Australia has very little to gain and much to lose by denying many former Australians the chance to contribute meaningfully to the Australian community. In my electorate there are many Maltese Australians and many who suffer from this inequitable situation. I think it is about time that we changed the law, given the discriminatory nature of its application. Labor is looking to consider this matter and to change the law in order to ensure that people such as Steve and Lillian Schembri will be able to become full Australian citizens, as they were prior to going to Malta, where they were forced to renounce their Australian citizenship.

The 14 local governments in the Parkes area have fallen over with relief that the Commonwealth is doing that. On top of that, a further $1 billion for country roads was announced in the budget. It is to be announced soon how that money will be disbursed. But we also have well over $3 billion in the budget towards road and rail infrastructure. This is very necessary. The neglect of country roads and rail in my electorate is very damaging. The West Wyalong to Burcher line is being closed. We have more trucks on the roads and less maintenance being given to them. I felt so strongly about it that I recently mailed out a request for people to send in a response about what they felt about branch line closures and maintenance around my electorate. We have over 2,000 responses by people who did not just have to put a cross in a box and send it back; they had to put their own stamp on it and mail it. That is an enormous response from an electorate when we consider that most of those people live in towns. I hope that, on behalf of my constituents, Andrew Stoner, the leader of The Nationals in New South Wales, will present their responses to the state government-to Mr Costa and to the minister for roads. There will be road closures in my electorate if the state government continues to ignore the result of failing to repair country branch lines. Thankfully, the ARTC is taking over and getting $540 million to spend on the main lines in New South Wales in a month’s time-that is, before the end of this financial year-but it is still up to the state government to pay the cost of maintaining those branch lines, which they are not doing. Obviously, they are considering closing a number of them. It is vital that Carl Scully and Mr Costa think deeply before they do any more closures and stop spending money and that they back up what the Commonwealth is trying to do for transport and communications in the electorate of Parkes. Budget 2004-05 Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (9.47 a.m.)-This week’s budget has done little to advance the core concept of social sustainability: social systems such as health and education and the well-being of our community. When we take a look at our social systems we find a health system in excruciating pain and an education system starved of funding. The Howard government knows that Medicare needs fixing but it insists on bandaid solutions and cover-ups. The government had a perfect opportunity with this budget to inject much-needed funding into the health system, but fixing Medicare is not in the Treasurer’s leadership campaign strategy; he obviously bought that through an ‘Acme’ kit. If we turn to education we find a similar story: the very crucibles of advancement being starved of funding. In BassI have urged the government to support some simple environmental initiatives but so far there is no support there either. I refer to initiatives such as the extension of the wood heater program to combat the declining air quality, the need to develop the sewerage capacities of Launceston due to the current inadequacies of the Tea Tree Bend plant, and strategic planning for coastal town developments for towns such as Bridport. I recently wrote to the environment minister seeking support to examine the environmental and social impacts of increasing water flow through the Cataract Gorge in Launceston to address the health of the South Esk River. I am still hopeful that the minister will respond to this initiative and to the other measures that will restore the quality of the Esk River. A clear picture is emerging: the government is not sponsoring social sustainability, it does not protect the vulnerable and it does not even support equity in health and equity in education. MAIN COMMITTEE This budget is an election platform, not a foundation for social sustainability. The Costello push for leadership has begun by delivering tax cuts and family benefits for a very lucky few. This budget fails to deliver tax relief or assistance for three out of five Australian families, including thousands of Tasmanians. In Bass only 7.7 per cent of income earners receive in excess of $1,000 a week. As we see, there will be a tax cut for only some families. And what the Treasurer did not announce on Tuesday night was that the $600 payment to FTB recipients would be first used to offset any outstanding debts-and we know that they average $900. I also want to use this opportunity to explain how angry and disgusted I am that this government failed to fund the pneumococcal vaccine. In Tasmania in 2002, 61 people contracted pneumococcal meningitis and 11 died; in 2003, 86 people contracted the disease. That is a high proportion in relation to the number of people who contracted the disease and the number of fatalities in the rest of Australia. I call on this government to finally do something and fund that important, independently recommended vaccine. In the forthcoming election the people of Bass will have a very clear point of differentiation: a Latham Labor government-with its key platform of equity, fairness and opportunity for all-or more of the same Liberal arrogance. We have an option: opportunity for all or opportunity for the few. Parramatta Electorate: Ermington-Rydalmere Betty Cuthbert Festival a.m.)-The Melbourne Olympics saw a shy, but incredibly endearing, young Australian come splashing onto the world stage. She stunned the world at the age of 18 by winning three gold medals in athletics. From that moment, Betty Cuthbert became Australia’s golden girl. After injury forced her withdrawal from the Tokyo Games, she then came back with an extraordinary victory in the 400 metres in Rome, thus becoming, with four gold medals, the most successful Australian athlete in Olympic history. You may not be aware that Betty comes from Ermington in the heart of my electorate of Parramatta, where she and her twin sister and their family grew up. The family still has a nursery in Ermington. She is our most celebrated citizen, and the main street of Ermington is called Betty Cuthbert Avenue. There is another extraordinary group of people in Ermington and they are gathered around the Burnside Family Learning Centre. They are a group of families, particularly mothers, who are concerned for the future of their kids; they want the best for them. They came and saw me and said, ‘What can we do to improve the opportunities for our kids?’ There were about 20 mothers and we talked and met together quite a few times. Out of those meetings came this idea of a festival that would celebrate the best in Ermington. We would pick the young kids in Ermington who had most excelled in sport, academia and elsewhere, and bring them together. We would invite all of the other people-the churches, the community organisations, the Police Citizens Youth Club et cetera-and we would have a day celebrating the achievements of Ermington. So, with a bit of trepidation, I rang Betty Cuthbert in Perth, where she now lives in the Margaret River area, and said, ‘Would you be the patron of this festival and come back to Ermington and open it for us?’ I was delighted and we were all very excited when she agreed. I just want to acknowledge the organisers of the Ermington-Rydalmere Betty Cuthbert Festival, which takes place this Saturday. It will be opened by Betty Cuthbert.

Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme: Petition Dr LAWRENCE (Fremantle) (9.53 a.m.)-I was asked by the student association from the Bunbury TAFE to present a petition, which I will do at the end of my address, opposing the abolition of the Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme. They travelled for over two hours from Bunbury to my electorate to ask me to present this petition to the House. They did not give it to their own MP, the member for Forrest, because they were not confident that he was actually interested in making submissions on their behalf. Apparently, he did not even give them the courtesy of a response to their correspondence. I was very happy indeed to agree to their request but extremely unhappy that the petition needed to be made at all. The students hope that in presenting this petition during the May sittings they might be successful and prevail upon the government to maintain the scheme, which allows students an eight per cent discount on the cost of eligible textbooks. Of course, this week’s budget has dashed those hopes and condemns these students and others like them to further unreasonable hardship. The Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme was introduced initially, as we know, to offset the impact of the GST. As we also know, the GST is still with us, and growing. The Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme should still be with us as well. The failure to extend the scheme indefinitely highlights the government’s bad faith on this issue-and, as an aside, I trust that the Democrats have learnt their lesson. This petition argues that the abolition of the subsidy is, in effect, an extra tax of some $40 or more per year on some of the most disadvantaged members of our society. That figure is borne out by a survey undertaken by the vicechancellors called Paying their way: a survey of Australian undergraduate university student finances, 2000. It confirms that the average annual expenditure by students on textbooksand this would apply to TAFE as well-was around $368, with the average for full-time students being $396. These are 2000 figures and, even with those now out-of-date figures, the removal of the eight per cent subsidy will mean an immediate annual increase of around $32. That might not seem like a lot of money to some of us, but having to find that additional money means that students have to make a choice between working, attending classes or even eating. A March article in the University of Canberra’s journal Monitor reported that the Salvation Army were overrun with students at the start of the academic year seeking money to help them pay their fees. A spokesperson for the Salvation Army said: They [the students] were worried if they paid their fees, they wouldn’t be able to eat. It was a choice of eat or do the course. That is what this government is imposing on the students of Australia. Although a lot of people find it mildly amusing that the Treasurer is urging young people to produce a baby for the country, he is making it impossible for that baby to be educated. He has given big tax cuts to MAIN COMMITTEE the wealthy in this community while leaning hard on the next generation-our students-who are having to make a choice between eating and studying. It is not a choice that anyone in this society should be required to make. I hereby table the petition. The petition read as followsThe honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House, the planned abolition of the Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme (ETSS) by the Federal Government on the 1st July 2004. The abolition of the 8% Subsidy will cause considerable financial hardship for many students and their families. With the cost of full years textbooks in the Tertiary and Post Secondary education sectors frequently being over $500, the abolition of this subsidy is in effect an extra tax of $40 or more per annum on some of the most disadvantaged members of society. It will also affect the many millions of Australian parents buying textbooks for school aged children It is a tax on education and knowledge. It is certainly a disincentive to study at a time when fees for training and education are constantly climbing. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to stop the abolition of the Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme (ETSS). from 1,039 citizens. Fisher Electorate: Daniel Morcombe stration) (9.56 a.m.)-There is nothing like a tragedy to draw a community together. On the Sunshine Coast in December a 13-year-old boy, Daniel Morcombe, was abducted from a bus stop. As a community, the Sunshine Coast has been drawn very close together as a result of this particular tragedy. The police have been doing a wonderful job, endeavouring to find information about Daniel’s whereabouts. The whole community has come together to support his family and the other students at Siena Catholic College, which he attended. I have been incredibly moved by the stoic fortitude of Daniel’s parents and the way in which they have carried themselves during this very difficult time. Posters have been put up around the community. A television campaign has been mounted. Printers like Mike Brooks of LEP Colour Printers have produced posters at no charge, and other printers have also supported the cause. Red ribbons are being worn throughout the Sunshine Coast to indicate support for the campaign to find Daniel Morcombe and to indicate support for Daniel’s siblings and his parents. Australian Story highlighted the tragedy which has befallen the Morcombe family and the Sunshine Coast more generally. The fact that a child can disappear from a public place must strike fear in the hearts of all parents, regardless of where they live. Australia claims to be a civilised society-and I suppose compared with certain other parts of the world we have a lot to be proud of-but I have to say that, as an elected representative in the national parliament, I am very disturbed to find that in 2003 a child was able to be abducted and disappear without trace-and, despite the best efforts of his family, the police and the entire community, no trace has as yet been found of him. MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Statements By Members
237,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and AdminiI say to the Morcombe family that my best wishes and prayers are with them at this time. This has been an entirely bipartisan issue in our community. There was a rodeo held recently, and the mayor rode a bull and unfortunately was tossed and had his back broken. I wish Joe Natoli, Mayor of Maroochy Shire, a good recovery. Daniel’s disappearance is a tragedy. I hope that we are able to find out what has happened to Daniel Morcombe. It would be wonderful if he could be found alive and well. der 275A the time for members’ statements has concluded. Debate resumed from 1 April, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the House take note of the paper. upon which Mr Snowdon moved by way of amendment: That the following words be added at the end of the motion: “and the Prime Minister’s and Leader of the Opposition’s speeches of 30 March 2004 to the Prime Minister’s motion relating to ADF personnel in or around Iraq” things to support or discredit our leaders and, when they do not quite get the answer they want, twist our words ever so slightly to imply what they want. This debate on Iraq has been dubious from the beginning. I was never in favour of sending troops there, for exactly the reasons that are coming out now. We do not know for how long they will be committed if it is left to the Americans. We are, after all, part of an invading force that has removed a country’s leader and is now putting in place a government that by its very nature of appointment is supposed to be a puppet of the USA. This is not a recipe for success in the Middle East. The Iraqi affair has really had nothing to do with terrorism. The weapons of mass destruction are not there-and no-one really knows whether they ever were-and the world is being deflected from putting its energies into stopping terrorism. Australians should not be a part of the Iraq conflict. They should never have gone. This was a political war, one the Bush family wanted to have to make up for not finishing the first Gulf War. But Australia has very professional and successful troops. They have shown that they can keep out of trouble and still do a good job under very difficult conditions and leaders. Australians have always been well respected and able to carry out military and peacekeeping duties in an unequalled fashion. I am very proud of our troops, but they cannot be used as pawns in a political war. Mark Latham is right in wanting to withdraw the troops from Iraq before next Christmas. I think they should come home as soon as possible. They do have other duties that they could and should have been doing closer to home. But that is not to say that our troops will never be used to assist countries that require help with peacekeeping. We have a number of small forces in our region at present, doing a fantastic job. I visited some of them myself recently in East Timor; I have the greatest admiration for the work they do in sometimes very basic situations. As far as Iraq is concerned, there needs to be a lot more development work done there. It has been stripped of its economy and its ability to act independently. There will be a role for some time to come in helping to put this country back together. But any assistance should be MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Statements By Members

239,Mr Adams (Lyons) (10.00 A.m.),"We live in a time when journalists will use us to saythrough the United Nations on a much more practical basis-not a political one. When the UN can again take up its role as mediator and peacekeeper, it is likely to ask all the countries under its umbrella to help sort this mess out, and that I am sure would include Australia. Labor believes that Australia has a moral obligation to deliver the strongest level of economic and humanitarian aid to Iraq possible, given our involvement in the original invasion and the most recent World Bank-UN needs assessment, which indicates a large shortfall in the aid funding for the Iraqi people. Mark Latham rightly pointed out that the troops currently in place in Iraq should come home. I believe that too. The picture is tainted over there. When there is a situation where peacekeeping is required and the invading forces have gone home, then there will be an opportunity to reassess any UN resolutions that could request assistance from us and other peacekeeping forces around the world. That is a choice for the new government. If a new, Labor government believes that we should concentrate our efforts closer to home and on Australian soil then I believe that is the direction that should be taken. It should be a measured and practical response, not a political one to use as a tool at election time. By the way, what is the point of having intelligence briefings that are deficient in vital information? And isn’t it interesting that the Prime Minister seems to know word for word what those briefings apparently contained? Not only that, but isn’t it conceivable that some of those briefings might actually contain the truth that the Prime Minister does not want to hear? We live in peculiar times when these secret briefings are spread over the front pages of morning newspapers. Now we have this added dilemma of the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. This is not helping anyone’s cause in trying to take the moral high ground in this debate. These prisoners may have been fighting against coalition forces but one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter. Only the courts should judge whether they are guilty of some crime. They should be treated as human beings. That is part of the Geneva Convention. It is a question of ensuring that abuses of human rights are not condoned. The Western nations have responsibility in ensuring that justice is done and is seen to be done, without treating prisoners like animals. If one reads resolution 58/187 of the United Nations General Assembly, dated March 2004 and entitled Protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, it reaffirms: ... the fundamental importance, including in the response to terrorism and the fear of terrorism, of respecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. This resolution reaffirms the basic tenets of the stance of the United Nations in the light of current events. The United Nations must be allowed to set the international rights of the world. There is no good to come of denying responsibility, either. If we are in coalition, we are in coalition. It is the whole which has the responsibility. No-one should pass the buck. We ought to have known what was going on and we ought to be able to speak up if it is inappropriate. As our shadow spokesman for foreign affairs, Kevin Rudd, said at a doorstop recently: Unfortunately John Howard needs to read the III Geneva Convention and work out that it is a Howard Government legal obligation to provide for the proper treatment of Iraqi POWs...why do we have these things called the III Geneva Convention and the IV Geneva Convention? They were agreed in 1949 because the international community looked at the horror of World War II and decided there had to be a better way to govern the treatment of POWs and civilians in times of war. Australia signed that in 1949 MAIN COMMITTEE and under the Menzies Government ratified it in 1954. So when John Howard says at a political level ‘hey this is a George Bush problem, this is a Tony Blair problem, but it’s not a Howard Government problem’, he should read the text of the III Geneva Convention which says that it’s an Australian legal responsibility. No country is squeaky clean on human rights but it is important that we go for the highest common denominator, not the lowest, and ensure that our processes for dealing with prisoners of war and detainees for one reason or another are fair and just. I still do not believe that we should have been part of the coalition that invaded Iraq. The country has had a long history of invasion and it is natural that many of the tribes that make up the Iraqi people will object to outside interference, even if they had a loathed leader. There have been many loathed leaders in the world who have been removed without the help of the US. Iraq has been a terrible mistake and now we have to disengage with the minimum hurt to either Iraq or our own forces. Then we need to look at doing the right thing by providing practical assistance when we are asked to do so. put by the Prime Minister on 30 March this year. The original motion, which I have a copy of here, has two parts to it. We are asked today to ‘take note of the paper’ moved and that the following words be added to the motion ‘and to the Prime Minister’s and the Leader of the Opposition’s speeches of 30 March 2004 to the Prime Minister’s motion relating to ADF personnel in and around Iraq.’ When the Prime Minister spoke on 30 March, he let off what was really the first major shot of the election campaign which is almost upon us. What he sought to do was to drag into political debate the situation of our forces in Iraq. He sought to do that through the two parts of the motion that he originally put to this House. That motion we are debating here. That was changed because the Prime Minister did something that was quite extraordinary. There was an intended division on a motionput forward by the member for Cowan, Mr Edwards, and seconded by the member for Lalor-that these two parts be split into two. The Prime Minister came into the House and in fact forestalled the division and agreed to these two parts being split. As far as I know, that is almost unprecedented in the history of the House. If there had been goodwill in the first place, if this notice of motion had not been designed as a political tool to attempt to split the Australian Labor Party from its support base in the community on the question of ADF personnel in Iraq, then the Prime Minister would not have had two parts to this motion; two parts that were conjoined in the first place and not meant to be split. I think it was his intention to absolutely portray the Labor Party as not being in support of our troops in Iraq and to use that politically against the Labor Party, to use it as a mechanism to try to win favour and support in the community, and to use our military personnel as weapons in that way. Eventually this motion was split, but it should have been two separate motions in the first place. I will read the first part of the motion. The Prime Minister gave notice that at the next day of sitting he would move that this House: (1) expresses its continued support for and confidence in the 850 Australian Defence Force personnel currently deployed in or around Iraq and records its deep appreciation for the outstanding professionalism they have displayed in carrying out their duties; MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Australian Defence Force Deployment
240,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (10.09 A.m.),"This is the end of debate on the motion originallyThat is a pretty simple, direct and straightforward contention. As Mr Edwards, the member for Cowan, later argued, there is nobody on the Labor side who would contend with any of what was said in part 1 of the motion. That is why he called for the Prime Minister to split it, because everybody on the Labor side could stand up and support that part. He argued, quite rightly, that the Prime Minister’s intent to fold that into part 2, which we could not support, was in fact diabolical. He called on the Prime Minister to do a couple of things. He talked about campaign medals. Secondly, he said that the second part of the motion should be split from the first. I will read the second part so that we can see the context. It reads that this House: (2) is of the opinion that no elements of this contingent of Australian Defence Force personnel should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary times should be set for such withdrawal. We know the context for the Prime Minister putting this second part forward. We know that he sought in his time-honoured fashion to identify and then exercise a wedge between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian people. He saw an opportunity to seek political advantage by utilising our military personnel, whom he had placed, on his order and the order of his government, in a situation of great and pressing danger by committing them to the war in Iraq in the first place and then continuing to have those personnel based in Iraq after the formal cessation of hostilities more than a year ago. The member for Cowan quite rightly called on the Prime Minister to split the motion. He said: Our troops are entitled to have motions put before this House which are designed to truly reflect the support that members of parliament on this side have for them and their families. This motion does not do that. Indeed, this motion of the Prime Minister’s lets our troops down. It thrusts them into areas of policy and political division which are not of the troops’ making. The Prime Minister can fix that. I call on him, in the interests of keeping our troops out of the political firing line, to do this. He then moved a motion to split these two parts of the Prime Minister’s original notice of motion. The Prime Minister, extraordinarily, came into the House and said that he agreed to it. He then went on to say: I have just come into the House and I understand that there has unexpectedly been a motion from the opposition to suspend standing orders in order to split the motion. I do not in any way want to force the opposition to vote against a generic expression of support for Australian forces. I do not. Why did he put it in in the first place? It was purely to seek political advantage. He was forced, under the impress of the parliamentary debate, to step back from that naked use of his motion to try to seek pure partisan political advantage. The member for Cowan is a former member of Australia’s defence forces. He was badly injured in Vietnam. He lost both legs as a result of a landmine incident there. He is someone who can speak for Australian Defence Force personnel who have been properly committed by an Australian government to serve overseas, whether or not one agrees with the context that they are committed in, no matter whether the particular war is the current war in Iraq, the previous war in the Gulf or the war in Vietnam. No matter what the context or the debate is about the rights or wrongs with regard to committing troops, the fundamental reality is that Australian troops, once committed, should be supported by the Australian people and the Australian parliament-and they have been. And the member for Cowan’s point was absolutely crystal MAIN COMMITTEE clear-this was the Prime Minister’s attempt to use these troops politically. I am glad that, for once in the House, the Prime Minister could be forced into a position where he had to retreat from what was a grubby exercise in political manoeuvring. Australia’s defence forces, the Australian people and the parliament deserve better than this dreadful exercise to put our troops at the very point where they become the issue, rather than the larger area of debate. It was right to split that motion. Let me go to the broader questions of the context. The current war against Iraq has had different approaches. Labor and the coalition have taken entirely different stances with regard to whether we should be there and whether it should be prosecuted. Labor said that we should not be there, because it was not UN sanctioned, because this was a small coterie of nations joined together in a small coalition that did not have the broad support of the West-including most of the countries in Europe and, we argued, the Australian people-or of the general community of the United Nations. We also said that military adventurism in Iraq would take away our necessary concentration on the war against terror, which was real, which was pressing and which needed to be prosecuted with the greatest vigour possible, as it had been in Afghanistan. It needed to be prosecuted worldwide in defence of civilians from all of the countries of the West who are imperilled by the continuation of that very war operated by al-Qaeda and its associated organisations. We argued, quite properly and correctly, that the adventurism of another war in Iraq would not add one jot or tittle to the solution or prosecution of the war on terror. We argued that this was, in fact, something that the Bushes-both former President Bush and the current President Bush-had taken on as a particular area of the concern for themselves and for the Republican Party. There was a determination on the part of the current President Bush to prosecute this war in Iraq come what may. He made the decision right at the start of his term, not laternot after September 11 but right at the beginning-to deal with unfinished business from the previous Gulf War. I think that was wrong. We know that there was a major debate within his administration, which was split over whether or not they should go into Iraq. I think that Colin Powell and the others who argued against it did the right thing; they put the argument that the war on terror was the chief thing that should be pursued and that defence personnel should not have their lives put at risk not only in the initial phases of a war but in what might happen afterwards. What we are seeing now is what was predicted by some people at the time; that is, that winning the war in Iraq was the easy part. Afterwards, we have the occupation by those powers which have a responsibility for what happens there-Australia being one of those, Britain another and the United States another. The occupying powers have a specific set of things that they have to do. They have to look after the local civilians, and they have to ensure that all of the normal provisions of food, education and health are seen to. We have a situation now where there is no-one but the occupying powers with that impress on them-the United Nations did not stay-and we have had another war develop after the full conclusion of hostilities. We have got a significant problem because we have a small number of Australian personnel currently there-not the SAS, who were pulled out almost immediately after the war was signalled to have finished over a year ago-who are there to guard our people in the embassies, to train people in the Iraqi police and defence forces, and to protect those Australians who are teaching others how to do air traffic control and so on. I MAIN COMMITTEE know how effective those Australian troops have been. One of my neighbours was one of the people from Foreign Affairs stationed in Baghdad from the beginning; he is now home. I have heard from him just how effective those forces have been. We also know that there is a great morass in Iraq. What stood in front of Colin Powell and George Bush Snr at the end of the Gulf War-the prospect that if they went through to Baghdad and took out the existing regime there could be a civil war in Iraq-is clearer and more apparent than it was a year ago, but the prospect was there strongly a year ago. That is what stopped them more than 12 years before. Our Australian troops are in an unenviable situation in Iraq. They are there and they continue to need our support, and they have that support from the Labor Party and the Australian people. They should not be put in a position, as the Prime Minister sought to put them in on 30 March, where the level of danger that they face increased, making them a more pointed target for those people who might seek to destroy them in order to make a political point the other way. Our troops should be above and beyond being taken up in the maelstrom of Australian politics. The Prime Minister should not have attempted to use them for political purposes on 30 March. The splitting of the motion was right. They should continue to have our support without political edge. (Time expired) very important job, a very good job, as some of the best trained and best disciplined troops anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, though, they should not have been called upon to undertake this task. The battle in Iraq today is no longer a battle simply of guns, missiles and tanks; the battle in Iraq today is a fight for the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people-and, in that, America and its allies have lost the battle. In view of the recent photographs of mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners, I suspect that that is irrevocably lost and that it would not be possible to establish the confidence of the people necessary to win what is now a battle for the hearts and minds of the people in the streets and in the villages. Worse, there is now evidence that al-Qaeda has a foothold in Iraq and is cultivating some of the uprisings, a fact that did not exist before the invasion. Let there be no mistake: as bad and abhorrent a dictator as Saddam Hussein was, he was not a religious fundamentalist with links to al-Qaeda or any similar group. I have no doubt that, had members of al-Qaeda put their heads inside Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, he would have very quickly put them up against a wall. There was no love lost at all between Saddam Hussein and those involved in al-Qaeda, including Osama bin Laden. Indeed, there is evidence of animosity between them. Instead of being seen as liberators, the United States and its allies are now seen as occupiers by the Iraqi people. That is not a position from which we can build a nation. It is not a position from which we can obtain the trust of peoples in order to establish any coherent society. It is now even more important that America take a step backwards, moving back from its position of control and confrontation in Iraq, and ensure that the United Nations is given a much greater role not just in the conduct on the ground but in the broader management of affairs in Iraq. The justification for the invasion of Iraq was not based on some lasting high principle but on varying political exigencies. We were told originally that there were weapons of mass destruction and that this presented a clear and present danger to the Western world-12 months after the war has ended, there is not a shred of evidence to support that. As that became clearer throughout the conflict, the United States and its allies changed their rhetoricMAIN COMMITTEE",148,Australian Defence Force Deployment
241,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (10.24 A.m.),"Our troops in and around Iraq are, as always, doing aincluding our own Prime Minister and foreign affairs minister-from one of removing weapons of mass destruction to one of regime change and, then, as the political mood shifted again, to one of providing freedom to an oppressed population. The justification for this invasion has been false from the beginning. As a party to this invasion, Australia has made one of the worse strategic mistakes that I think has been made since the end of the Second World War. It is high time that we refocused our efforts directly on the war on terror and removed ourselves from this terrible conflict in Iraq that has caused instability in the region and worsened global security. These are not views of hindsight. The first occasion this parliament had to discuss this matter was in February 2003. I, along with a number of people, sounded the warning of these problems at that time-as similar warnings were being sounded in the United States and the United Kingdom. I want to refer to some of the comments I made in February of last yearwell before the conflict had started-identifying these very problems. I quoted at the time the views of General Zinni, a very senior ranking officer of the United States forces. He said: You could inherit the country of Iraq, if you’re willing to do it-if our economy is so great that you’re willing to put billions of dollars into reforming Iraq. If you want to fight with other countries in the region to try to keep Iraq together as Kurds and Shiites try and split off, you’re going to have to make a good case for that. Unfortunately, General Zinni’s views, with which I strongly agreed, have proven to be the case. America and, by implication, those who joined in the invasion have now inherited a country of some 20 million people who do not want our patronage. Any doubt about that should be dispelled by a cursory look at the evening news. In my speech I also referred to the views of another highly decorated US general, General Clark, who told the US Senate Armed Services Committee that war with Iraq would ‘supercharge’ recruiting for al-Qaeda. General Clark was right in his predictions about that-predictions he made well before the war commenced, predictions I referred to in a speech to this parliament in February of last year. Now we see, sadly, those predictions coming true as al-Qaeda feed upon the discontent to recruit more to their cause of extremism. I made this comment in this parliament more than a year ago: ... were this war on Iraq to occur in the current circumstances, it would undermine rather than support the war on terror. Security would almost certainly be worse in many nations, including Australia. Any hope of resolving the underlying causes of terrorism and overcoming the factors that extremists feed upon as they seek to recruit future terrorists would be dashed. Sadly, those words I mentioned some 14 months ago are now coming back to haunt us as the global security environment degrades week after week and as terrorist threats increase week after week. We now find ourselves in the situation of being advised against travelling to Greece for the Olympics, because even in Greece there are concerns about terrorist activity. The world is a much less secure place because of the invasion of Iraq than it was before the invasion of Iraq. This has been one of the great strategic errors of the last 50 years. I commented on 5 February last year in this parliament: It is far too simplistic to equate the war on terror with war against Iraq. Worse, it is wrong ... The world should not be sidetracked into a debate about the virtues of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq at the expense of the war on terror. Nor should we focus diplomatic and military efforts on Iraq at the expense of the war on terror. MAIN COMMITTEE That is even more the case today than it was when I said those words in February last year. It is a sad case that many Liberals whom I discuss this with in forums where this issue comes up regularly say, ‘We can’t change the past. Let’s not talk about the past. Let’s move on and see what we can do to fix the problem.’ I agree that we have to look at what we can do to fix the problem. But let us be clear about this: the reason Liberals do not want to talk about what happened last year is that they now know they were absolutely wrong. Whether they were wrong by conviction or wrong by stupidity is irrelevant; they were wrong and they committed our country to a war of invasion that we should not have participated in. Today we have Australian troops in an area of high threat who should not be there. Worse, as a result of the government’s folly-as a result of their willingness to follow unquestioningly the views of the American administration-we are now in a situation where our national security has been disadvantaged and where global security is much worse than it was before-and, indeed, than it should be. It is past the time when we need to be fair dinkum about two things. We need to be clear about honestly approaching the problems in the Middle East, which go well beyond the borders of Iraq and involve a long-term and viable solution to agreed boundaries for the states of Israel and Palestine. We also have to be clear that the problems in Iraq are not going to be solved by guns, tanks and missiles. There has to be an economic and a political solution to the problems in Iraq and, sadly, America is ill equipped to provide that. In real dollars-that is, adjusted after inflation-America has already committed more money to Iraq than was spent on the entire Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe. That is a frightening statistic. Europe after World War II was rebuilt at a lower cost than the cost of the war in, and reconstruction of, Iraq so far. The cost in Iraq to date is just the tip of the iceberg, and, while that is a cost to America primarily, other countries are being asked to share it. And for what? In Afghanistan we still have, by all reports, al-Qaeda cells operating at will in the provinces, with war lords still linked to those terrorist groups. Even within the capital, Kabul, there are regular terrorist attacks and there have been a number of assassination attempts on the president. Even in the capital city security is threatened. People have forgotten the problems in Afghanistan. We were right to go to Afghanistan; I supported the Australian deployment in Afghanistan. There was within the borders of that state another terrorist state that had no regard for the life of people around the world. I had no difficulty whatsoever in wholeheartedly supporting our deployment there. I regret that America and many of its allies have now turned their backs on the problems in Afghanistan, thrown the ball to Europe and said to the European members of NATO, ‘You can now try to fix up the problems in Afghanistan and get order there.’ How much better would it be if America had 100,000 troops in Afghanistan today instead of having sent 200,000 troops to Iraq? I put it to you and to the people of Australia that both the region and the world would be much more secure if there were a secure and stable government in Afghanistan, free of the impact of the tribal leaders and the al-Qaeda operatives who still function within Afghanistan, largely as they please. How much better would it be if we had focused our diplomatic, economic, military and intelligence-gathering attention on the problems closer to home-the difficulties that we confront in our region with Jemaah Islamiah? I have already mentioned the issue of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan but we also need to remember that in a sense these organisations function like international crime: they need the MAIN COMMITTEE money to fund the things they are doing. How much better would it be if our attention had been focused on those who finance terror-on those who fund the extremists who preach violence in their schools and in other locations? We have dropped the ball as a country. America has dropped the ball as the leader of the world in dealing with this war on terror, to pick up a misguided whim of George Bush Jnr, slavishly followed by John Winston Howard, and we are all now paying a heavy price for that. Our troops in the Middle East are called upon to pay a heavier price than the rest of us because their daily lives are threatened by their deployment in those regions. Modern terrorism pays no regard to geography. The prospect of a traditional nation versus nation war is remote, and we are all pleased that that is the case. But when we look at the threat that we face today from non-state terrorism we realise that someone could be trained in Afghanistan today and undertake acts of terror in Spain, in our country or anywhere else in the world just as easily as someone could be trained in a terrorist camp in Asia and undertake deeds of violence in Europe, America or anywhere else. Geography is of no consequence in this. We need a global response to this threat, and that global response must include a military and strategic response. However, the war on terror will never be won by military means alone. The war on terror requires that there be economic and diplomatic measures to deal with the underlying causes-the reasons that people are recruited to do these violent acts. That has to be addressed, and precious little has been focused on that. What if some of the billions-I understand that the American Congress is approving $US1 billion a week for the war on terror-had gone to address the underlying economic and social concerns that allow these extremists to cultivate young people? Surely it is time that we took a rational approach to this. In Australia it is time that we analysed our national security interests according to Australia’s needs, not George W. Bush’s needs. Very often Australia’s and America’s needs will coincide, but when they do not we need a government that recognises that we are not the deputy sheriff of the United States. At the moment we have a Prime Minister who thinks that he is. I hope that at the next election that changes and that we get a Prime Minister who is a proud Australian. Debate (on motion by Mr Prosser) adjourned. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Environment: Private Forest Reserve Program end one of the most important environmental programs in Tasmania’s history. The program is the Private Forest Reserve Program, which was formed to protect 100,000 hectares of private forest reserve in Tasmania. When the agreement was signed in 1997 by the Howard and Rundle Liberal governments, it was agreed that the program would receive $30 million in federal funding. The $30 million was broken down into two components: $20 million was committed from Tasmania’s share of the National Heritage Trust and $10 million from other sources. The $10 million was transferred to the Tasmanian trust fund at the start of the program, and the money and interest earned were to be used for the program’s running costs. The major proportion of the PFRP funding was the $20 million from the NHT. This was to be held MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Australian Defence Force Deployment
242,Mr Prosser (Forrest) (10.39 A.m.),I move:,154,Adjournment
243,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (10.40 A.m.),"The Howard government is threatening toin Canberra and transferred at quarterly intervals to Tasmania to pay landowners for direct costs associated with their signing perpetual covenants. I fear the Howard government is threatening to take back the $9 million remaining of the original $20 million. This would brutally end this important environmental program. The initial time frame for the Private Forest Reserve Program to distribute the $20 million to landowners signing perpetual covenants was by July 2002. This was unrealistic, as many factors such as all statutory agreements, advisory bodies and approval processes needed to be developed. Teams of people including biologists, administrative clerks and negotiators had to be recruited and trained; and, on top of creating a whole new program, delays were also encountered by the necessary accountability requirements put in place by the federal government. As a result there was a significant delay in starting the PFRP. In addition, there was reluctance by property owners to take up the program offer, as the federal government had neglected to change the capital gains tax rules and Centrelink income rulings. Long-term lobbying saw these serious impediments overcome in 2001 for capital gains and in 2003 for Centrelink and the deeming of income. I am happy to say that I was able to play a part in securing these changes. The program is now proceeding as planned and on track with its 2001 business plan endorsed by the federal government. It has secured protection in perpetuity of 27,641 hectares of important native forest and private land. On 31 May 2002 the federal environment minister granted an extension of the time frame for the expenditure of the $20 million NHT component of the PFRP funding, to 30 June 2004. This extension was given on the proviso that specific improvements to the program were made. These improvements have been made, as indeed requested. In June 2003 the federal government advised that it was in their interests to transfer the remainder of the $20 million from the NHT-an amount of $9,914,052-to the Tasmanian trust fund. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth forced the inclusion of clause 6.2, which stipulated that if the funds were not expended by 30 June 2004, the money was to be returned to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth insisted on this clause and, as such, the state had to agree. In December 2003 and again in April 2004 the Tasmanian ministers for the environment wrote to the Hon. David Kemp, requesting an extension to this deadline. No response has yet been received to either of these urgent requests or to my letter of 27 April 2004. Why is this? As of 10 March 2004, the remaining NHT component of this funding was $8,892,562, a considerable amount. Ironically the Howard government have announced a further $350 million in funding in their 2004-05 budget, yet they appear set to revoke funds already allocated. This is truly giving with one hand and taking with the other. The Howard government need to extend the deadline for the Private Forest Reserve Program, preferably to 2010, to allow realistic time frames for the expenditure of the remaining NHT funding. This would allow this important environmental program to protect a further 40,000 hectares of under-reserve forest in Tasmania. Due to the fast-approaching deadline for the withdrawal of the previously allocated NHT funding, I hope the environment minister will respond to both my letter and the Tasmanian environment ministers’ letters with haste. Ryan Electorate: Centenary State High School eral Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson, at a terrific new local school in my electorate, Centenary State High School. It was a great opportunity for MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Adjournment
244,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (10.45 A.m.),"In AprilI had the opportunity to represent the fedme and a terrific day for the school as they opened a new general learning area block worth some $1.45 million. The federal government funding that contributed to this building is going to make a terrific difference and add to the school’s world-class facilities. The capital works project was entirely funded by the federal government, notwithstanding the suggestion by Labor members and the Labor government of Queensland, through the local member in the local press, that they made a contribution to this project. That certainly was not the case. These state of the art facilities are exceptional and will provide a wonderful environment for the local students and contribute to their learning and being able to realise their potential. I take the opportunity in the parliament to acknowledge the fantastic work of the principal, Mick Mickleburg-and his deputy and current acting principal, Dallas Miller. The administration and leadership of the school makes a difference. They provide wonderful leadership and an environment in which the students of Centenary State High School can reach their potential. Centenary State High School also has a great reputation in the local community. The school’s facilities are used by a large number of community organisations. I want to acknowledge that the school allows this very generously. The new learning block for the Centenary State High School is a facility that I am sure the local community will also be able to use. It will be for more than just students. I also had the opportunity of using the facilities of the school last month when I hosted the inaugural Ryan youth leadership and development forum. To be able to bring 150 students from throughout the Ryan electorate to Centenary State High School was a great pleasure for me. It also again highlighted the local school to the rest of the Ryan community. All schools are doing very well under the Howard government. In every budget of the Howard government since our election in 1996 grants to every state and territory have increased. Funding for schooling has increased substantially and in Queensland the Australian government funding for state schools in 2004-05 will total almost $530 million, a 4.5 per cent increase over the past year. In this year’s federal budget the government have allocated record funds of $7.6 billion to Australian schools for 2004-05. This is unprecedented funding for schools and continues the trend over the last seven or eight years of Howard government budgets giving tremendous recognition to education and opportunities to students throughout the country to realise their potential. I want to pay tribute to all those in the country whose lives are dedicated to our young people and who make a contribution by giving opportunities to our young Australians. Those people work to create an environment that will help young people to make a great contribution to our country in the future. Schools throughout the country, both public and private, are dedicated to doing this. It is important that all members of parliament represent all schools throughout the country, not just one sector of the schooling community. There seems to be a lot of emphasis on public schools. That is certainly not entirely appropriate. Schools, both private and public, should have the full support of this parliament. Labor’s rhetoric and attacks on the coalition’s record on schools are hollow politics. The people of Ryan should be aware that this is not acceptable. I will certainly be conveying to the Ryan community, and the many parents who send their children to the substantial number of MAIN COMMITTEE independent schools in the Ryan electorate, the policy differences between the government and the opposition. I am sure that come election time they will be asking very tough questions and wanting answers on these issues. Let me pay tribute to the Centenary State High School for the work that they are doing in the local community. Human Rights: Mr Mordechai Vanunu man rights of Mordechai Vanunu, the whistleblower who exposed Israel’s nuclear program in the 1980s and who was recently released from prison after serving 18 years. The Vanunu family migrated to Israel in 1963. Mordechai Vanunu was a good Israeli citizen who served his time in the Israeli army. He then went on to study philosophy and worked for 10 years as a mid-level technician at Machon 2, a top-secret underground bunker complex at Dimona in the Negev Desert, which built components for nuclear weapons. Vanunu expressed dissent as to what was occurring there. He was given a warning, and then in November 1986 he was made redundant. He took with him photographs of the inside of the factory. He became a backpacker and travelled through Asia down to Australia, where he became associated with Australians at the St John’s church in Darlinghurst and met Reverend David Smith-a friend of mine and former Marrickville citizen of the year who is known as ‘Fighting Father Dave’, who serves at Dulwich Hill. Vanunu then travelled to London and gave his story to the Sunday Times. In Leicester Square he met an American woman, ‘Cindy’, who befriended him and persuaded him to travel with her to Rome. It turned out that she was a Mossad agent, and whilst in Rome on 30 September 1986 Vanunu was overpowered, assaulted, drugged, kidnapped and smuggled back to Israel unconscious on a boat. He was brought to court for a secret trial. Israel had maintained a policy of nuclear ambiguity, neither confirming nor denying that it possessed nuclear weapons. It was protected from scrutiny by the United States and its allies. Vanunu’s evidence showed the world that Israel had developed between 100 and 200 atomic bombs and had gone on to develop neutron bombs and thermonuclear weapons. He was found guilty of treason and espionage and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment, served at a prison in the southern Israeli town of Ashkalon. He was held in solitary confinement for 11½ years. His cell was six feet by nine feet with no windows. His request for parole was denied at least six times, but he was finally released on 21 April this year. However, his punishment continues. Avraham Poraz, Israel’s minister of the interior, has issued an order forbidding Vanunu from leaving the country for one year after his release. Also, Major General Yair Naveh, head of the Home Front Command of the Israel Defense Forces, citing quite extraordinarily the Defence (Emergency) Regulations from the British mandate period of 1946 prior to the formation of Israel which were subsequently incorporated into Israeli law, has ordered Vanunu not to speak with anyone about his employment within the Dimona program. He is also prohibited from approaching foreign embassies or consulates or conversing with non-Israelis. These restrictions are in force for six months and are renewable. Vanunu’s lawyers are contesting these restrictions, which were provided for when Vanunu was originally tried and punished. This is a fundamental violation of due process. In support of these new restrictions, Israeli officials have cited national security concerns, but who could believe that information held by a junior technician 18 years ago continues to be relevant? MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Adjournment
245,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (10.50 A.m.),"I wish to use this opportunity to raise the huThe double standards in this are astonishing. At a time when the world has gone to war over weapons of mass destruction, this individual was jailed for 18 years and held in solitary confinement for 11 years for exposing the reality of weapons of mass destruction being held in Israel. It is believed today that Israel has the world’s sixth largest nuclear arsenal, with small tactical nuclear weapons, nuclear landmines and medium-range nuclear missiles launchable from air, land or sea. It is quite clear that Mr Vanunu is not safe where he is at the moment. This is not a sectarian issue. This should be of concern to all those who have an interest in nuclear non-proliferation. Israel is one of the three countries in the world that have refused to sign up to the non-proliferation treaty. It is important that all people of goodwill, apart from sectarian issues, defend Mr Vanunu’s human rights. I congratulate Reverend Dave Smith and will be working with him to ensure that those rights are upheld. Casey Electorate: ANZAC Day commitment from its citizens than to serve their country in a time of war and conflict. The recent ANZAC Day services across our country and in all of our electorates reminded us of the strong commitment to and the sacrifice for the ideals and the freedoms that we all hold so strongly. ANZAC Day keeps the memory of Gallipoli and the First World War alive so that younger generations know of the sacrifice and can keep that spirit alive. But of course ANZAC Day is also very much about the men and women who served Australia in some of the important conflicts that followed the First World War to protect those same values and freedoms. It is worth reminding ourselves constantly of the sheer number of Australians who served our nation in times of need. In the Second World War, 990,000 men and women served in various capacities in our services. In the Army, just over 26,000 lost their lives; just over 2,000 in the Navy; and 11,000 in the RAAF. More than 66,000 Australians were wounded in the Second World War. In Korea, 17,000 served, 339 lost their lives, more than 1,200 were wounded and 29 were taken as prisoners of war. In Vietnam, 42,000 served in the Army, almost 3,000 served in the Navy and 4½ thousand served in the RAAF. As we know, 520 were killed and 2½ thousand were wounded. Like all members in the chamber, I was once again privileged to attend ANZAC Day ceremonies. I attended ceremonies in Croydon, Lilydale and Monbulk. The dawn service in Lilydale had a huge crowd, as did the service later in the morning in Monbulk. On the day, many people, including many radio commentators and those in the media, expressed surprise that the crowds were still so large on what we all recall was a very wet and wintry day. But really this should be no surprise at all-just confirmation that Australians hold their beliefs strongly. They attend these services because of their enduring and unshakeable commitment, and nothing will keep them away. The work that goes on in preparing for ANZAC Day is often overlooked because of the focus on the day itself. In the brief time available to me, I would like to pay tribute to some of the many dedicated RSL members who work tirelessly each year selling ANZAC Day badges and selling poppies before Remembrance Day. All of the funds are used in the RSL’s welfare work. Many contribute right across the electorate and right across Australia, but I would particularly like to pay tribute to Mr Frank Voutier of the Croydon RSL. Each year he visits hundreds of Melbourne’s businesses in the outer east. He also visits schools and community groups and sets himself up in the local shopping malls to sell as many ANZAC Day badges and MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Adjournment
246,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (10.55 A.m.),"A nation can expect no higher individualpoppies as he possibly can. He has become a feature of the Croydon community and pretty much owns Main Street, Croydon, in the weeks leading up to ANZAC Day, with his self-made badge display, where he sells badges to all and sundry. The magnitude and dedication of his work and the work of many others who assist him in that area saw the Croydon RSL receive the status of the top Victorian sub-branch for sales in the 2003 Poppy Appeal, where they raised nearly $30,000 single-handedly. The Australian community needs its Frank Voutiers, and we are fortunate that there are so many like him across the country in all of our electorates, doggedly building and preserving that ANZAC spirit. Their dedication to our nation in times of war and conflict is of course matched by an identical dedication to the welfare of the veterans and the communities in which they live. We must never forget their sacrifices. On behalf of the outer east and the Yarra Valley, I wish to publicly recognise Frank’s efforts and those of so many who assist him not just on ANZAC Day but throughout the entire year. Agriculture: Apple and Pear Industry tant issue relating to a key agricultural industry. As you and other Tasmanians would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, the federal government is revisiting the plan of allowing apples from New Zealand to come into Australia. This is something it has had a real agenda on for some time, causing an enormous amount of concern in the apple and pear industry in Australia, an industry which has been a great contributor to rural and regional Australia over many years. There is a long history to this issue. I am sure members of this House can remember that in the year 2000 Biosecurity Australia published a draft import risk assessment promoting and suggesting the importation of New Zealand apples. The draft proposed that New Zealand apples be allowed into Australia, which caused an enormous amount of concern. In 1998 AQIS first had a look at this issue. Before that, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and other people with an interest in this issue would know, the case for allowing New Zealand apples into Australia had been made in 1989 and was rejected by the Labor government. Previously, right back in 1921, the case had been made by New Zealand to allow their apples into Australia. Because of the risk of fire blight, the government then took the view that that should not be allowed. My real concern is that all of this sneaky behaviour on behalf of those people pushing for the importation of New Zealand apples into Australia has caused a great deal of uncertainty for apple and pear growers in Australia. The handling of this issue by the federal government is a textbook example of poor public policy and poor public administration by government. What we have seen over six or seven years is the federal government being incapable of making a decision in Australia’s national interest when it comes to this issue. We should have a government that stands up and defends Australia. We should have a government that is proud to protect the interests of apple and pear growers in Australia-not a government that uses its agencies in order to promote the interests of apple and pear growers from a foreign country. We need to see some action from the federal government to decisively indicate to ordinary people in Australia who run these apple and pear orchards that it will not sell out their interests to New Zealand. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the other Tasmanians in this parliament understand just how hard ordinary apple and pear growers work. In many cases they are the second and third genMAIN COMMITTEE",158,Adjournment
247,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (11.00 A.m.),"I want to raise today in the parliament an imporeration of people on those orchards. Why is it that the Howard government does not stand up for these people who have contributed so much to the rural and regional areas in which they operate for so many years, in some cases for a number of generations? Why is it that we do not have a government that is prepared to take a stance on this issue in Australia’s national interest? Why is it that we do not have Liberal and Nationals members opposite standing up in this parliament and advocating on behalf of these hard working small business owners who have made such an important contribution? They work hard all their lives and pay taxes all their lives and have contributed so much to our national economy. I say to the parliament today that enough is enough in relation to this issue. We have seen the hard working apple and pear growers of Australia have to put up with delays, changed processes, obfuscation and failure to make a decision from the Howard government for too long. Enough is enough. These people should be focusing on their businesses. That is what they do best. They do not want to have to spend a third to a half of their time every week in lobbying the Australian government to stand up for Australia’s national interest. That should be automatic. We should have a government in Australia that stands up for Australia’s national interests and that understands and recognises the fundamental truth that bringing fire blight apples into Australia would be an absolute disaster for the apple and pear industry in this country. I say to the Howard government: stop sitting on your hands in relation to this issue; stand up for Australia’s national interest and ban the importation of New Zealand apples into this country. Health: Cancer sponsible for nearly 20 per cent of deaths and disabilities in this country. Around 34,000 Australians die from cancer each year. According to figures from the Bureau of Statistics, cancer is the most common cause of death in Australia. From the government’s perspective, it takes up about six per cent of the national health budget. Australia is one of the few countries in the world where cancer mortality is actually falling for both men and women. In fact, the survival rate for many common cancers has increased by more than 30 per cent in the past two decades. The federal coalition government has played an important part in this statistic and has a strong record in developing and implementing effective cancer control measures. In our first year in office in 1996, we took the proactive step of making cancer control a national health priority, and we created a framework for a national cancer control plan. The following year, we established a national cancer control initiative to provide expert advice on all issues relating to cancer control. One of the strengths of this initiative is a partnership with the Cancer Council Australia, which has taken a strong lead in the fight against cancer at the community level since the 1960s. Representatives of the Cancer Council recently approached me with a practical plan for the government which would potentially save thousands of lives and millions of health dollars. The Cancer Council Australia and the Clinical Oncological Society of Australia have put forward a very strong case for a $5 million investment in infrastructure funding for cancer clinical trial groups. Based on the success of previous clinical trials, a $5 million investment could generate returns of tens of millions of health dollars each year. This type of investment stands to save thousands of Australian lives and reduce the suffering and premature disability associated with some cancers. MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Adjournment
248,Mr Farmer (Macarthur) (11.05 A.m.),"Cancer is a huge burden on our society. It is reClinical trials are the only reliable scientific method of testing whether treatments such as drugs, surgical procedures and radiotherapy work; whether one treatment is better than another; how to integrate treatments better; whether new treatments are better than older treatments; and, for treatments of equivalent effectiveness, determining which treatments cause fewer side effects and provide better value for money. Clinical trial groups have generated a number of remarkable successes, both in Australia and abroad. For example, studies in advanced breast cancer found that a high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation was no better than a standard dose of chemotherapy. The estimated cost saving is $50,000 per patient-a total saving of around $50 million each year-and up to 1,000 patients a year will no longer have to endure an arduous, high-dose treatment. An Australian trial in testicular cancer, the most common cancer in young men, found that one type of chemotherapy cured more patients and saved more lives than another; yet before the trial the two treatments were considered equally effective. Clinical trials also help to ensure that expensive new treatments are introduced in a careful, informed way, based on sound evidence and quality control. The Cancer Council puts a strong case in arguing the government’s need to fund infrastructure for clinical trials through a respected community partner such as the Cancer Council Australia. While the pharmaceutical industry conducts its own product related trials, I believe the government has a clear role in ensuring that trials are conducted which consider cancer treatments without a commercial motive. The Cancer Council Australia has a proud history of working cooperatively with government to help put the needs of the community first. I believe that the Cancer Council Australia would help to guarantee that clinical trials focus exclusively on the broader health gains of this important part of the fight against cancer. I would like to place on the public record my support for the Cancer Council’s clinical trials and my endorsement of Cancer Council Australia’s case for a $5 million investment in clinical trial infrastructure funding. On the advice I have received from the Cancer Council Australia. I believe that additional support for Cancer Council clinical trials infrastructure funding would have significant short-term and long-term economic and health benefits for all of Australia. Communications: Community Broadcasting sion to give favourable consideration to a recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure ensured a sixth high power national television channel was made available for community access. Eleven years later, I bring to the attention of the parliament the current crisis in community television and the shameful way Community Television Sydney, the current operators of Channel 31, have been treated by the Australian Broadcasting Authority and their masters-the Howard government. For 11 years CTS has provided local and international news, information and entertainment programs to Australians of non-English-speaking backgrounds, including the Italian, Greek, Lebanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Tamil, Indian and Croatian communities in my electorate of Lowe and across Sydney on Australia’s sixth free-to-air channel, Channel 31. After 11 years of successful operation, reaching over 1.3 million people every month in Sydney alone, the ABA has decided not to renew the temporary licence of CTS but instead to award a permanent licence to another, less experienced, provider, Television Sydney-TVS. MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Adjournment
249,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (11.10 A.m.),"In 1993 the then federal Labor government’s deciThere are at least two important issues concerning the way in which CTS was treated which can only be described as grossly unfair. The first is the absurd length of time the ABA took to finally make its decision to grant a permanent licence. The second is that, having made the decision to disregard the application from CTS and grant the permanent licence to TVS-a consortium that I understand will not be ready to broadcast until 2005 at the earliest-neither the ABA nor the Howard government have indicated whether or not CTS will be allowed to at least continue broadcasting until TVS is ready. This would obviously be in the public interest and in the interests of the CTS staff, program providers, volunteer networks and other stakeholders. When my constituent Mr Salvatore Scevola, an important program provider of the Italian Television Network which broadcasts on Channel 31, approached me earlier this year informing me that the ABA had been investigating the granting of a permanent licence to CTS for over two years and that Channel 31’s temporary licence was about to expire in just over two weeks, I was furious and determined to take the fight to the government on behalf of Mr Scevola. I immediately asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts question No. 3270 appearing on the Notice Paper on 4 March this year to expedite the granting of a permanent licence to CTS. I also made representations to the ABA chair, Professor David Flint, to have CTS granted the permanent licence-to no avail. We now know the permanent licence has gone to Television Sydney, but I want the minister for communications to explain why the ABA abandoned CTS after 11 years and overlooked their submission for a permanent licence, ignoring more than 200 letters of support, including letters from numerous members of the government’s own backbench. I have also asked the minister for communications another question, No. 3443, calling on him to explain why the ABA awarded the permanent licence to TVS when their proposed programming schedule reveals that they only intend to provide 3½ hours of ethnic community broadcasting per weeknowhere near the 18 hours per week currently being provided by CTS. Even worse, it appears that the new licensee, TVS, will not be able to broadcast before 2005, which breaches the ABA’s guidelines under subsection (2) of section 84 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The minister for communications needs to explain what the programmers at CTS, the sponsors who support community television and the 1.3 million viewers of Channel 31 in Sydney are supposed to do for the next eight months. It is clear that the Howard government is not interested in these viewers or anyone who supports community television. This may surprise some people, but it does not surprise me and it does not surprise the people in my electorate of Lowe, who understand and are outraged by the appalling way the Howard government is prepared to reward Australia’s most powerful media owners at the expense of our democracy by ripping up Australia’s cross-media laws through the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002, which is in the Senate at the moment. The Howard government’s proposed media laws will allow the largest media owners to own television stations and newspapers in the same city. This will mean fewer journalists and fewer opinions, and it will damage Australia’s democracy. In conclusion, given the Howard government’s media policies and its failure to promote media diversity in Australia, its contempt for CTS and Channel 31 is tragically predictable. However, I know Mr Salvatore Scevola will not give up; I know CTS will not give up; and I know the people who support community television in my electorate of Lowe and across MAIN COMMITTEE Sydney will not give up. AndI am sure they look forward to the opportunity to sack the Howard government when the federal election is held later this year. Local Government: Mayoral Elections Law Enforcement Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (11.14 a.m.)-I would like to congratulate Brisbane’s new Lord Mayor, Campbell Newman, whose outstanding victory recently in the local government elections was an overwhelming victory for the people of Brisbane and for accountability in local government. That accountability, sadly, was missing under the previous Labor civic administration. Campbell Newman stands for what the people of Brisbane overwhelmingly voted for: a city hall that listens to them, consults them, treats them with honesty and respect and puts their quality of life before Labor Party factional or financial interests. Anyone who doubts how Labor ran things in Brisbane should look at the example of a neighbourhood group in my electorate who fought the previous Labor city hall administration and the state government that ran it. Last year, the Remick Bushland Preservation Group were fighting to save six hectares of native vegetation that was used and cared for by locals as a community open green space. The land is owned by the state government, which lodged a development application to council against the wishes of the local community. The community fought back, forcing the state government to withdraw its development application from council. The state government then played a game of payback by threatening to sell to a private developer instead. The group wrote to me, quoting the state government’s ominous ‘inference that as a consequence we would suffer a development “far less favourable” than the development by the state government’. Is it any wonder that that ward recently went to a Liberal candidate? Before the election, the candidate took up this issue with the community and with the sitting state Labor member, Terry Sullivan. His only response was to ask how the community, through council, would fund a buyback from the state government. On its web site the Beattie government claims to recognise: That public spaces and natural landscapes make an enormous contribution to the social, cultural, spiritual and environmental health of our community. That having access to natural environments adds significantly to the quality of life of all Queenslanders who live in an increasingly urbanised society ... Empower communities and secure solid partnerships with local government and regional communities ... I call on the Queensland government to live up to those fine words-and they are fine words on that web site-and to hand over the Remick Street bushland preserve to the Brisbane City Council to be held in trust for the local community. I would also like to place on the record my appreciation of the Prime Minister’s recent announcement of the $20 million community crime prevention initiatives in our local communities around Australia. This is an investment not only in the security and safety of ordinary Australians but also in the peace of mind of those who are most vulnerable in society. Community organisations are the logical place to tackle the increasing problems of vandalism and petty crime on our quality of life. No-one is better placed to fund long-term solutions than those grassroots organisations. MAIN COMMITTEE In my electorate of PetrieI am no stranger to the problem. I know from first-hand experience the frustration, inconvenience and expense caused by petty crime like vandalism. A more unlikely setting for it is very hard to find than the wonderful environment of my electorate office on the Redcliffe waterfront, where the blue waters of Moreton Bay lap against a palmfringed lagoon straight out of a holiday brochure. But over the past two months, like all businesses fronting this wonderful panoramic view of the bay, my office has been the subject of repeated vandal attacks which have shattered every plate glass window in every pub, cafe and small business. And no sooner is the glass replaced than it is smashed again. The inconvenience and the economic impact are pretty self-evident. Less visible, though, but even more damaging is the way in which fear spreads among the most vulnerable members of our community: the elderly who live alone in their homes, whose last shred of security is stripped away, who have become too scared even to indulge in the innocent pleasure of visiting shops and who fear that they will be the next victim. It is some time since I proposed a scheme to set up a community telephone network coordinating the local Neighbourhood Watch, Red Cross, Rotary and other organisations to make daily phone calls to local elderly residents living alone and to check on their security and safety. The recognition by the Australian government of the role that such a community organisation can play in protecting the vulnerable is very welcome. I look forward to helping organisations in my electorate avail themselves of this funding to ensure that the most frail members of our community, the elderly, are called each day to see whether they are okay and to ensure that they have dignity, safety and respect in their own homes. Roads: Funding important transport infrastructure issues. In passing, I will make some comments on the Brisbane metropolitan area. I noticed that the member for Petrie referred to the recent election of a new mayor of the City of Brisbane. I simply say that infrastructure is about honesty and integrity and actually putting your plans out for proper public consideration. In the lead-up to his election the mayor promised a range of major infrastructure tunnels in Brisbane. I suggest to the House this morning that only one of those tunnels-the east-west tunnel-actually stacks up in financial terms. I therefore call upon the Mayor of Brisbane to release for public scrutiny all the costings which he claims to have that do not require a call on the public purse in terms of the range of tunnels he proposes be constructed in the Brisbane metropolitan area. It is about time people were forced to come clean about promises they make before the election and their capacity to actually deliver them after the election. In that context I want to call for Australia to have a national land transport plan. I notice that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in this week’s budget finally put a date to the release of the AusLink plan: Monday, 7 June. That is interesting, especially when we were told with the release of the green paper in November 2002 that the final paper was not far down the track. I want to raise some important questions in terms of what might be released on 7 June. I suggest to the House that the government’s approach to a national land transport plan, titled AusLink, is not a constructive approach to infrastructure planning and delivery in Australia but more importantly an exercise to shift cost and responsibility onto state and local governMAIN COMMITTEE",161,Adjournment
250,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (11.19 A.m.),"I rise this morning to raise some veryments. This is a very serious issue because in Australia in the 21st century we are falling further and further behind on the infrastructure front-and not just in roads and bridges and access to ports and railways but also, for example, in access to the communication system. We, first and foremost, therefore need an independent infrastructure advisory council to actually assist all levels of government in making decisions on independent objective criteria so we can take the politics out of decision making and make sure that the projects that we select are selected for the right reasons. That goes to one of my primary criticisms of the proposed AusLink plan. On numerous occasions since November 2002, and this is a national issue, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and, in more recent times, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads have said, fairly and squarely, that the government does not regard the national highway as any longer a full Commonwealth government responsibility. I want to make it clear that I believe that the Commonwealth, in terms of land transport in Australia, has a national responsibility. Our freight task is going to double. It is not going to happen overnight. It is happening every week of the year. What we require is a system of rail and freight national opportunities for us to move that freight on in the future. That means we have to take the politics out of decision making and move away from the cherry picking of projects-as will occur under AusLink on the national highway system-and provide a guarantee that one level of government, the Commonwealth government, accepts the ongoing responsibility for maintaining and improving our national highway system. I say today on behalf of a range of communities around Australia that an AusLink plan which does not provide for the Commonwealth to maintain a full commitment to the construction and maintenance of the national highway system is unacceptable. It is unacceptable, for example, for the people who have to use the Hume Highway. It is unacceptable to the people of Melbourne awaiting the construction of the Deer Park bypass. It is unacceptable to the people who depend on the Ipswich Motorway. It is unacceptable to the people who depend on the Bruce Highway; for example, those who saw the Bruce Highway recently cut because of flooding at Tully. cause his own community depends on the Commonwealth accepting responsibility for the Bruce Highway. It is also unacceptable to those in Tasmania who depend on the Bass Highway. I simply say in conclusion that infrastructure planning is about the future of Australia. Accept your responsibilities. Do not cherry pick for political reasons. Fisher Electorate: ANZAC Day stration) (11.25 a.m.)-As the member for Fisher for more than 10 years, commemorating ANZAC Day has been one of the most enjoyable activities that I, like other elected representatives, have each year. This year was no different. On ANZAC Day 2004 I attended seven different commemoration services, all over the electorate. It is heartening to see the increasing crowds each year. You would have seen the increasing crowds in your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, particularly the numbers of young people who come out to dawn services and to the various main services.

To go to ANZAC ceremonies is to recognise the sacrifice made by so many, and the lives of so many others which were risked, in the cause of making sure that we have the free society that we do. The services I went to included the dawn services at both Maroochydore and Kawana. Through a strange quirk of climate, the dawn breaks a whole hour later at Kawana than Maroochydore, which meant I was able to go to both services. I went to the Buderim main service, the Caloundra main service and a lunch with the veterans at Maleny-an area which has been returned to the Fisher electorate from Longman in the recent federal redistributionfollowing the ceremony there. I also went to the service put on at the Centaur Memorial Nursing Home at Caloundra. It is always humbling to talk with veterans, who have given so much to ensure that we have the way of life we do, about their wartime experiences. Perhaps the increase in attendance year by year is a recognition that the world is not a safe place and that there are new and different threats confronting our nation, particularly with the war against terror. I think that all of us recognise the wonderful role carried out by ex-servicemen and women in making our country a safer place. When we look at the fact that today we have some 2,000 personnel deployed on more than 10 operations around the world, we see that the role being carried out by our personnel today is every bit as important as the role carried out by those who participated in world conflicts. Our personnel are involved in the rehabilitation of Iraq, the war on terror and peacekeeping missions in East Timor, the Solomon Islands and other places. They are carrying on the wonderful tradition of the Australian armed forces, protecting our way of life. On behalf of my constituents in the electorate of Fisher, I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our serving and past personnel for their contribution to our nation. I think the continuing interest in ANZAC Day commemorations is also a result of the wonderful programs being run in schools, both government and non-government, which ensure our young people learn about our heritage and the conflicts that have helped shape the Australian society that we enjoy today. A number of schools in my electorate held ANZAC Day ceremonies, and I was able to attend Mountain Creek State High School, Talara Primary College and Conondale State School. I was particularly pleased to be able to distribute the ANZAC Day Saluting Their Service information packs, posters and badges for students to schools throughout my electorate so that they could all use them to prepare for, and as part of, their ANZAC Day commemorations. I have been pleased to talk with many students and teachers to encourage students to take further part in ANZAC Day commemorations by entering the ANZAC Day Saluting Their Service awards. These awards are an initiative of the Howard government, designed to support schools in developing innovative ways to commemorate the ANZAC tradition and learn about the importance of Australia’s maritime heritage.

I was surprised to receive representations in my office from two young Australians who have been treated shabbily by immigration authorities at Heathrow and Manchester airports in England. Many of us have unfortunately experienced the intolerable, inflexible and authoritarian attitude of immigration officials in our travels around the world. Australia has had a long and strong bond with what was once called our mother country, the United Kingdom. Prior to the formation of the EU, countries once part of the British Empire, and subsequently the British Commonwealth, were given some priority when it came to entering Britain. Now, as one enters either Heathrow or Manchester, one is shuffled to the periphery, sidelined almost as an alien. One has to justify why he or she should be allowed to enter a country our forefathers fought and died for in two world wars. As members of the coalition of the willing in the war against terrorism, and with our involvement in the war in Iraq, one would have thought that we should have some reasonable entry at any time into the United Kingdom as Australian citizens. Unfortunately, the terror paranoia that is being fostered by the US administration and implemented by the US immigration authorities is now being adopted by the UK immigration authorities. Vijesh Nandan, a 22-year-old Tasmanian, suspects that he was interrogated and refused entry to Britain because of his colour. VJ, as he is known to his friends, had twice been to the UK on a working visa, the last time working at a Leeds court. VJ suspects that because he looked like a potential threat to the UK he was taken aside, questioned repeatedly and bodysearched, despite having sufficient money and a return air fare to Australia. VJ says: I kept asking why they were doing this. I thought it must be the way I look. All the people in therethat is, those being questionedwere of Asian or African or Afro-Caribbean appearance. VJ was detained for 15 hours, put on the next British Airways flight and had a black cross placed on his Heathrow stamp. VJ has also lost $3,000, the cost of his ticket. A couple of days later, a 30-year-old former student of mine, Tyrone Gregs, was similarly humiliated when he reached the UK. Tyrone had worked and saved $4,000 to have a threemonth visit to the United Kingdom, which was going to include attending a wedding in Scotland at which his girlfriend was to be the matron of honour. British immigration officials implied that he planned to stay and work illegally in the country. Tyrone said: It was just the way they treated me, like I was scum trying to slip through the system. Our diggers stood side by side with this country during the war; the Queen’s head is on our money. Tyrone similarly was questioned. He was handcuffed and made to wait in a glass booth while passengers passed at Manchester Airport. He was deported, using his own return air fare, and, MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Adjournment

I told both of these constituents that I would raise their cases with the British High Commissioner and his office. I have done that. I am waiting to see what the bloody hell has being going on. I am still waiting, as I say, for their response. I would urge all young Australians who are thinking of visiting the UK to please get a visa, or else you might never set foot outside Heathrow Airport. It is interesting to note that I heard, as an aside, in the House yesterday that an honourable senator in the other place who had just attended the IPU conference in Mexico was similarly humiliated by American immigration authorities, despite carrying an official passport, which we members and senators are all allowed to have. She was absolutely humiliated in one of the American airports. If you would like to know what Senator Ferris thought of the whole operation of the authorities, I would urge you to go and talk to her. This paranoia of the American immigration authorities and the British immigration authorities needs to be questioned. All young Australians who are thinking of visiting the UK, for goodness sake, go and pester the British High Commissioner, Sir Alastair Goodlad, and say to him: ‘What is going on? I thought we were friends and partners. Do we need a visa, or can we just rock up there, with our return air fare, and expect to be humiliated, handcuffed, body-searched and then deported on the next Qantas or British Airways flight?’ It is not good enough, and it has to stop. Parkes Electorate: Roads and Rail there has been very good news for country regions and industries, especially for the electorate of Parkes, where export industries certainly underpin the whole economy-whether that be in agriculture, mining or tourism. The one in four people directly involved in those industries are totally dependent upon export industries, yes, but also on the transport system. Transport affects whatever the inputs might be to those industries-whether it be superphosphate, grain or whatever-and also the products going out, which by and large go to ports around Australia, whether they be in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane, or south in the coal region. I am very proud to be part of a government that has recognised that we cannot be a potential Brazil or a potential Argentina whose infrastructures have crumbled. Certainly, in the case of Brazil, this has probably prevented the potential to far exceed and surpass what Australia does in agriculture and exports generally. The reason they have crumbled and are in the economic mess that they are in-certainly in respect of the industries to which I refer-is because their infrastructure, their transport, their road and their rail systems are totally decimated in comparison with what we are proposing to do with ours. Under John Anderson, we are virtually looking at about $11.4 billion now committed towards a road and rail infrastructure program. On Tuesday night, well over $3 billion was committed straight into Auslink to join the Roads to Recovery. Also announced on Tuesday night was $1 billion, which will largely go to regional councils for roads as well. They are mostly, and very sensibly, bypassing state governments, not allowing them to take off their 15 per cent or whatever it is they choose to take out by way of administration. Going directly to local governments, or to whatever particular scheme it might be, is certainly money saving for the Australian taxpayer. In the case of the New South Wales government, I can guarantee it is. The industries in my electorate that are going to gain so much from this renewal of the ongoing support that is going into our roads and rail is enormous. Certainly, in New South Wales, and particularly in western New South Wales, it is more important than ever. We are MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Adjournment
257,Mr John Cobb (Parkes) (11.35 A.m.),"In recent months, and in Tuesday night’s budget,expanding and extending our road funding, getting into rail and taking over the ARTC under the guise of the Commonwealth, which is taking over pretty much all national rail systems. It is taking over the New South Wales rail system in the very near future and that will get, I think, $540 million in the coming month of June to invest into New South Wales main lines because of the absolute neglect that they have had from the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government has cut back its funding on roads and rail at the same time as we are expanding and taking over those things. What we find is that the minute we fund something New South Wales cuts back on it. But the point I make this morning is that the industries we have in western New South Wales which are expanding and developing are absolutely reliant on us maintaining and expanding our road and rail system. Because branch lines are being neglected and not being kept up, it is putting far greater pressure on the roads-mostly state, local and regional roads-and they cannot carry the traffic. So, at the same time as funding is being cut back on roads and rail, the call on them is greater than it ever was. In recent times, for example, in West Wyalong in the south of our electorate, Frank Pace and his family have opened up Pace Farms, which will be the largest egg producing centre in the Southern Hemisphere. They will call upon 200,000 tonnes of grain a year. That has got to be carried and it has got to be carried on good roads. At the moment that is not happening, not out of the state system. However, through Auslink and what we are doing at the federal level, the $11.4 billion that we are committing is certainly going to make that easier. (Time expired) Environment: Perth Airport Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (11.40 a.m.)-Sadly, I stand here today to report to the House how this government, in particular the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, have sat idly by and allowed at least two serious cases of environmental vandalism to take place at Perth airportwith a third pending. The Perth airport site contains areas of high conservation value, including significant areas of banksia woodland that are habitat to several rare flora and significant fauna species. The site also contains areas of wetland which are recognised nationally, predominantly mapped by the state as conservation category and recognised as requiring retention. A substantial part of these bushland areas has recently been cleared or drained for commercial operations not related to core activities. The master plan at Perth airport recognises the environmental significance of much of the areas or precincts within the airport site. There is in addition to the master plan a memorandum of understanding which was signed between the Westralia Airports Corporation, the private lessee of Perth airport, and the Western Australian state government-indeed, it was signed by Richard Court, the former Liberal Premier of Western Australia. That memorandum of understanding determines that the Westralia Airports Corporation will consult with the state department of environment on issues that would require referral or consideration by a state agency if the land was under state rather than Commonwealth control and planning laws. In the first case I want to refer to, Commonwealth approval was given for a large area of bushland to be cleared to accommodate a warehouse development. However, this approval was given contrary to a state department of environment submission advising that the development plan would need to be modified to minimise impacts on areas of the greatest conservation values. Indeed, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services’ own environmental MAIN COMMITTEE assessment report revealed some interesting information about the proposed development. For example, it says: The Forestfield Bushland listing also includes most of the southern section of Precinct 2C (44 hectares in extent). In terms of the proposed development, the vast majority of this precinct will be cleared. Approximately 38 % of the precinct is covered by vegetation rated as part of the top 5% of remnant vegetation remaining within the Perth Metropolitan Region. This vegetation is found over much of Precinct 2C in both the north and east and it is difficult to see how such a large structure could be sited without significantly impacting on these values. Alternative sitings of the structure within the precinct would have similar impacts. It goes on to talk about the potential damage to the area and touch upon the significant Aboriginal heritage associated with much of the site. Despite this internal environmental assessment advice to Commonwealth ministers, they apparently chose not to follow the advice, to give no consideration to the opinion of the state government agencies involved, and they allowed the clearing of the whole area proposed for development. No consideration was given to recognising, let alone properly managing, this significant biodiversity area. Tragically, this has resulted in the clearing of Bush Forever and National Estate listed bushland. The second case involved drainage maintenance work that took place at Perth airport. Drainage earthworks were carried out to enlarge and deepen an old drain to divert the waters of Poison Gully Creek. Poison Gully Creek was one of the main streams feeding the Munday Swamp, which is part of the National Estate listed area at the airport site and a designated Aboriginal heritage area. Diverting the waters of Poison Gully has the potential to seriously impact on the environmentally sensitive Munday Swamp. If the swamp dries out, it would threaten the only significant populations of two WA endemic fish species that are surviving in the Perth metropolitan area. This work was undertaken without any reference to the relevant state departments and Commonwealth agencies. Indeed, it would appear that the Westralia Airports Corporation received retrospective approval from the federal government. This is an extraordinary situation, and one has to seriously question this government’s commitment to protecting areas that are set aside for retention under Commonwealth and state regulation and legislation. The failure of Westralia Airports Corporation to honour the memorandum of understanding with the Western Australian government is high handed at best and is deliberately irresponsible. The Deputy Prime Minister should have taken action against Westralia Airports Corporation. What have the Commonwealth ministers done to address this situation? Apparently nothing. I urge them to act before the proposed take of groundwater by Westralia Airports Corporation. (Time expired) Cape York Alcohol Management Plan and Resources) (11.45 a.m.)-Last year, the Queensland state Labor government in its wisdom decided to introduce an alcohol management plan into Cape York-a plan which was clearly designed to win votes in Brisbane and areas outside the Cape York area but which had little consideration for the impact it was going to have on Cape York communities. I will make it very clear in the first instance that alcohol is a major problem in these communities. There is no doubt about it, and the communities themselves recognise it as a major problem. The domestic violence, the dysfunctionality of families et cetera that are caused by this addiction need to be seriously addressed, but in trying to impose something like prohibition onto a MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Adjournment
258,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourismcommunity without the support of the community you are guaranteeing to have a project that is going to fail. There is no doubt about it. We have a situation where they imposed this prohibition without any consideration for those people up there who are already afflicted with alcohol addiction. As a consequence, one day they are alcoholics and the next day they have no access at all to alcohol-no treatment, no detoxification and no way of dealing with their problem. As a consequence, we now see in many of these communities where they cannot get grog that they are into petrol sniffing, glue sniffing and other alternatives. If they cannot access this, they are moving out of these communities and into mainstream towns like Weipa, Cooktown and even Cairns and transporting the problem with them. Of course, their actions then reflect badly on the communities they come from. In spite of continued pleas by the various community leaders asking that they deal with the detoxification in a different way, the state government has ignored them. The stupidity of this law was seen recently when the state minister for Aboriginal affairs, the local state member and a newly elected state member travelled into an Aboriginal community with alcohol on board their aircraft. There was outrage over it but eventually, with a bit of political spin, they managed to be exonerated of any misdemeanour. However, Aboriginal community people who have gone in with one empty can have been prosecuted and fined in their own communities. It has to raise the question of whether there is one law for one group and another law for the other. I was recently in Mapoon talking to one of the community leaders up there, Ricky Guivarra. He said that in Mapoon they are looking at putting out signs in their community saying ‘Please don’t feed the natives’, because it is okay up there for non-Aboriginal people to have a drink but Aboriginal people are not allowed to. They have situations in Mapoon and other communities where they are trying to establish tourism operations to get away from the dependence on welfare, but they are having major problems now because they cannot even serve their guests a glass of wine with their meal at night. We have another situation up there where the canteens have been the primary source of income for many of these communities for many years. What has happened now? They have shut them down. The resources from those canteens were being used for a whole lot of community type projects. Now they are out of pocket. The state government has given no consideration to adjusting the losses from, in some cases, the only private enterprise income that came into those communities. Those incomes have gone. The councils have lost those, and now the people there are becoming more and more dependent on welfare. It is a crazy situation that really needs to be addressed. The communities have to be compensated for those losses. Detoxification and alcohol treatment programs and medical treatment programs have to be brought into those communities today to deal with those people who already have those problems-and they have to engage the local communities. The Labor state government has to engage local community leaders with this. It has to offer them support and accept their advice on how to deal with this very serious problem, otherwise we are going to continue to see this farcical situation that we have up there at the moment where they are patting their backs in Brisbane and saying, ‘We’ve fixed the problem in Cape York,’ and in Cape York the problem continues to grow. I am calling on Peter Beattie and his minister, Liddy Clark, who had a recent brush with the law herself in the ‘winegate’ affair in LockMAIN COMMITTEE hart, to sit back and take note-and to take note of the recently elected state member for Cook, who was also caught up in that and, as a consequence, has come out himself and said that this system is not working. They should take advice from this newly elected state member, if not from me, and sit down and talk to local communities. (Time expired) Local Communities look the fact that we all come from local communities, that we all represent local communities and that our nation comprises a vast array of different local communities. So it was a great pleasure for me just a few minutes ago to meet with a very large number of children from the Belmont Primary School-from a local community in New South Wales in the electorate of the member for Shortland. It was especially pleasing to meet up with Mitchell Sanderson, who is the son of the people who run and own the Pelican Palms Motor Inn, which I happen to have had the pleasure of staying at when I visited the electorate a couple of months ago. Mitchell has a great interest in the parliament and the political system. It was tremendous to be able to foster and encourage that interest and also to talk to the kids from the school. I make this comment by way of introduction because I want to talk about the local community I came from, Orbost in East Gippsland, which I had the pleasure of visiting with the Leader of the Opposition very recently. A few weeks ago, the Today Tonight program featured two local communities as representative of the richest and poorest communities in our nation. They chose Mosman as representing the richest communities and, for reasons that I find hard to understand, they chose Orbost as representing the poorest parts of Australia. Some members of parliament may be pleased to say they come from the poorest part of Australia; I am not. I do not think the characterisation of the program was accurate. Indeed, I think it was an unfair representation of a town that has suffered significant economic change and some degree of economic decline but is nonetheless battling hard to grow and improve and is fighting back against the adverse economic pressures that have been affecting it over the last decade or two. On 29 April, with the Leader of the Opposition, I had the pleasure of visiting a very important economic success story just outside Orbost, Snowy River Seeds, which grew from some predecessors that were cooperatives. I would like to express my very sincere thanks to the acting general manager, Leo Schoots, and his staff, who I met when the Leader of the Opposition and I visited there. Snowy River Seeds is involved mostly in processing sweet corn that is grown on the Snowy River flats, and it is exporting its product all around the world. It is engaging in significant R&D. It has a qualified genetics expert on staff, who is engaged in hybridisation design to get better quality seeds for export. It employs a dozen or so permanent full-time people and seasonally employs 20 or so casuals to process, sort and arrange the seeds. It is a real success story for the region. It processes the product that is grown in farms on the Snowy River flats, which have amongst the most fertile soil in Australia. It really does offer a beacon of hope for the East Gippsland economy, which has suffered significantly from economic change. Until a couple of years ago, my father had a farm on the Snowy River flats. He grew beans until he ceased to be able to run the farm, which subsequently was share-farmed and involved sweet corn and various other things. Unfortunately, as a result of this trip, I have discovered that beans are no longer grown in the region because disease has affected the capacity to grow MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Adjournment
259,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (11.50 A.m.),"In national politics it is sometimes easy to overbeans. It is great to see a beacon of economic recovery in East Gippsland. It was a tremendous experience for the Leader of the Opposition and me to visit Snowy River Seeds and see that a local, export oriented business that is adding value to the local economy and community is so successful in the region and is having such a marked positive impact on the economy of that local area. I am proud of where I come from and I am proud of the effort, thought and commitment that is going into Snowy River Seeds. I am sure that it will play a major role in an economic resurgence for East Gippsland and help a struggling community gradually recover from the impact of economic change. As opportunities open up, as distance narrows, as broadband access eventually spreads throughout Australia, some of the barriers to economic success that currently afflict remote country towns like Orbost will start to melt away and we will see more and more economic resurgence from these communities. (Time expired) Herbert Electorate: Townsville Port Facilities Budget 2004-05 been discussing what is called the Townsville port access road. After the Douglas arterial road, it is probably the most significant road project that our city should consider. It came out of the vision of David Carmichael, formerly chairman of the Townsville Port Authority, who saw that if you built a new road and a cross-river bridge and connected the port to the Stuart industrial area you would avoid the chicken and egg situation of no development occurring unless there is a road and no road occurring unless there is development. His view was simply that the community should get in and be visionary, build a new connection, and the development will follow. Unfortunately, the process through the Queensland government has seen this process stalled. I do not think there is any other word for it. It took four years to do the environmental impact assessments on the project when really you could have done them in six months. That has caused a problem for the federal government in relation to how we might assist by helping to fund that particular project. With the delay of so many years, the cost has blown out and there has probably been a $25 million increase in the cost, which is also unfortunate. Of course, the community has not had the benefit of being able to use that road because it is nowhere near in sight of being built. We really need to assess where the project is at this time. The Queensland government wrote to the federal government on 22 December 2003 asking that the Commonwealth government consider the connection between the Flinders Highway and the Bruce Highway to be declared part of stage 1 of the new port access road, seeking Roads of National Importance funding. It further made a request in the same letter that an amount of $9.5 million was required, matching RONI funding, for planning corridor requisitions and detailed design. Unfortunately, based on the Queensland Department of Main Roads current timing for the proposals, development of stage 2 appears to be several years away, beyond the 2006-07 horizon. With design planning at an early stage, it may well yet cost significantly more than the current preliminary estimate of $75 million. It is a terrific shame for the community and for the development of our city that we are seeing these costs grow out of all proportion when we really could have had this whole thing built by now for about $50 million. I am hopeful that we MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Adjournment
260,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (11.55 A.m.),"For some years now the Townsville community hasmight get higher priority on this and get the state government moving along. At this stage it certainly does not seem likely. I turn quickly to the federal budget that was brought down on Tuesday night. I am pleased to see that this is a budget for families. Some will say it is a budget for everyone else as well-for older Australians, younger Australians, businesses and people who pay high marginal rates of tax-but primarily it has been a budget for families. I am really pleased to see that in my particular electorate defence has also been well and truly looked after by the federal government. We have almost $90 million going into looking after the men and women of the Australian Defence Force in Townsville alone. That is money that will be spent in the local community and will circulate in the local community. As well we have got $50 million of capital works going on in this next financial year. Again, that is money that will support the building and construction industry and keep jobs secure. It will also help to make sure that families can plan ahead with confidence. It is particularly good to see Professor Ian Wronski from James Cook University with us this morning. JCU benefited by $128 million in the federal budget on Tuesday night, and I know that that money will be spent wisely and well. Thank you, Professor, for being with us today. We are about to go and do some more good work for James Cook University, and I hope we are successful in that. Australian Defence Force: Parliamentary Program discussion this morning and inform you about a recent trip I had with NORFORCE. You will know, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, that the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program provides members of parliament and senators with the opportunity to spend time with elements of the Australian Defence Force to gain a deeper understanding of the work being done by them in maintaining our security. I know you know this well, Madam Deputy Speaker, or Corky, as you are called-you will forgive me. As part of the program, I spent three days with NORFORCE, which operates across Northern Australia, principally in the Northern Territory and across the Kimberley. Australia, through the establishment of patrols in the particular squadron areas of responsibility, and grew out of the heroic deeds of the Nackeroos in the Second World War. NORFORCE makes sure it employs the special skills and knowledge of the local population, which is principally made up of Indigenous people in that part of Australia, and they form the majority of digenous personnel. I was heartened to see-as I am sure you were, Madam Deputy Speaker, when you undertook this brilliant experience last year-how hard NORFORCE has worked to provide real opportunities for these people and the positive effect it is having on local communities across the Top End and through the Centre. There are four operational surveillance squadrons within NORFORCE: the Arnhem Squadron, headquartered at Nhulunbuy; the Centre Squadron, based in Alice Springs and responsible for the central and lower portion of the Northern Territory-its eastern border is shared with 51 Far North Queensland Regiment-the Kimberley Squadron, based in Broome in Western Australia; and the Darwin Squadron, based at Larrakeyah Barracks, which is the squadron I spent time with. The Darwin Squadron has a complement of 130 people, 60 per MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Adjournment
261,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (12.01 P.m.),"I am privileged to be able to participate in thiscent of whom are Indigenous. The squadron operates from the Tiwi Islands, where my time was spent-as was yours, Madam Deputy Speaker-and east to Manangrida and south to Wadeye. I was able to experience how NORFORCE patrols conduct their surveillance and how these exercises are planned, commanded, and conducted-as I know you were, Madam Deputy Speaker. I want to mention the Commander of NORCOM, Air Commodore Steve Walker, who was kind enough to give me a briefing; and Lieutenant Colonel Clay Sutton, who is the commanding officer of NORFORCE. I also want to mention the members of the Darwin Squadron who participated in the exercise that I was involved in: Major Lloyd Scholes, Darwin, supervising officer; Captain Jacek Olchowik, Darwin, who is the officer in charge of all activities; Lieutenant James Morrison, Darwin, squadron headquarters liaison; Sergeant Chris Brannelly-a mate of mine for 20-odd years-Darwin, supervisor water operations; Corporal Cecil Black, Milikapiti, Melville Island, coxswain water operations 2IC; Corporal Phil Maker, Darwin, driver vehicle operations and tracker; Corporal Darren Rashleigh-who knows you fondly as Corky, Madam Deputy Speaker-Nauiyu-Daly River, vehicle operations 2IC; Lance Corporal Rob Korljan, Darwin, coxswain water operations; Private Clinton Barker, Darwin, advanced combat patrol first-aider, medic, and driver vehicle operations; Private Robbie Austral, Nauiyu-Daly River, scout vehicle operations; Private John Harris, Darwin, squadron headquarters signaller; Private Scott McKeon, Darwin, signaller water operations; Private Russell Yunupingu, Nguiu, Bathurst Island, signaller vehicle operations; Private Edward Tipungwuti, Nguiu, Bathurst Island, bowman water operations; and Private Andrew Portamini, Nguiu, Bathurst Island, coxswain water operations. Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, I read those names into the Hansard because I know they were the same group of people who accompanied you. I was most impressed by their professionalism, energy, drive, knowledge and aptitude for the tasks they were given. I think they are a very good exemplar of how NORFORCE operates throughout its area of operations. NORFORCE plays a very important part in the defence of Northern Australia, particularly in terms of the surveillance of our coastline. It is a very integral part of our Defence Force and is an operational unit, unlike many other reservist units across Australia, and I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to spend time with them, as I know you did last year. Forde Electorate: National Volunteer Week Volunteer WeekI take the time to thank and recognise the many volunteer workers in my electorate who do a marvellous job day in and day out. As someone who devoted a great deal of time to voluntary work before I entered this House, I know at first-hand how valuable, rewarding and important voluntary work is to our community and to our nation. It is definitely part of the Australian way of life-that is, giving a mate a hand, putting something back into our community and helping others. We are fortunate indeed that as a community we value and encourage voluntary work, and I firmly believe this work is what gives our local community its heart and soul. I have been delighted for the past seven years to host the annual Forde community contribution awards. I established these awards as a way of saying thank you to our local communities and to the many local residents who give their time so selflessly, never seeking recognition but always deserving it. Over the years we have had some remarkable recipients-many MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Norforce Personnel Indeed Between 60 And 65 Per Cent Of Norforce Comprises In

I am also pleased to say that we have had a number of younger winners. It is great to see the next generation also contributing in this way and it certainly is a great sign of the future success of voluntary organisations in our community. I am pleased to report to the House that we have again had some very outstanding recipients of the 2004 community awards. I will be formally presenting these awards next week, but I would like to take the time in this House today to inform members of the extraordinary people who have given a great deal of their time to our local communities: Mary Krueger of Fassifern Valley, Evan and Florence Roberts of Roadvale, Herbert Haupt of Cannon Creek, Elaine Gilmore of Boonah, Donald Lynch of Tamborine, Josephine Ferguson of Beaudesert, Lesley Rohan of Beaudesert, Karen Barney of Tamborine, Jane Bell of Coochin, Dawn Markwell of Beaudesert, Janet Dennis of Beaudesert, Murray Willmann of Beenleigh, Jacqueline McSwan of Beenleigh, Ian Bray of Eagleby, Kenneth Baker of North Tamborine, Frank Barnes of Mount Warren Park, and Marrianne Uhlmann of Cedar Grove. Our special community spirit award goes to Dean Sammut and Kathy Stone of Logan Village, and the group which has won the best contribution for 2004 is the Jimboomba Veteran Support and Advocacy Service. On behalf of our community and our nation, I thank these wonderful people for their hard work and dedication. All of our award recipients have been nominated by grateful local residents who have been touched by their kindness and generosity. I believe that one of the best aspects of my job is that I can recognise and thank our voluntary workers in this small way, and I look forward to continuing to host these awards well into the future. I also want to take a little time to congratulate the 15 local community organisations which recently received funding from our Volunteer Small Equipment Grants. These grants were established by the government to help make the valuable work of our volunteers safer and more enjoyable. In the latest round, 15 community organisations in Forde got to share just over $32,700. This comes on top of several other previous rounds of funding. These grants will be of very real practical help to our local community organisations-for example, $4,108 will help Cedar Creek and Wolffdene Rural Fire Brigade to purchase CB radios, global positioning systems and weather meters. Some of the other community groups to benefit are the Beenleigh Soccer Club, Beaudesert Landcare, Community Care and Food Link, Tamborine Mountain Historical Society, Jimboomba Community Care and Boonah RSL. This is just a small example of the practical support these grants offer to our community organisations to help the volunteers and to support their work. I am very pleased to be part of a government that recognises the value of our voluntary work and is offering real, practical assistance where it is most needed. In National Volunteer WeekI want to thank most sincerely the recipients of the 2004 community contribution awards and all of the many residents in my electorate who do great voluntary work in schools, sporting clubs, charities, community groups, churches, hospitals, service clubs and other organisations. They do a marvellous job, and we are grateful as a community and as a nation for all their efforts.

Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board (Question No. 2388) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 11 September 2003: (1) Is he aware that the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board (CALDB) has reprimanded Mr Gregory Lourey in respect of his conduct the audit on the financial report of National Textiles Limited for the year ended 30 June 1999. (2) Can he confirm that National Textiles is the same company to which the Government provided significant funding to facilitate its liquidation and, at the time, the Prime Minister’s brother was board chairman. (3) Can he confirm the reprimand came after the matter was referred to the CALDB by ASIC. (4) Can he confirm that this is the same auditing firm that audited Nardell Colliery and gave an unqualified audit opinion for the 2002 financial year despite the fact company had recorded a loss of 14.457 million; if so, will he act to refer the Nardell closure to ASIC for further investigation. (1) Yes. (2) Assistance, jointly funded by the Federal and NSW Governments, was made available to help pay outstanding entitlements of employees of National Textiles and details are on the public record. (3) Yes. (4) Yes. As the administrator, and subsequently the liquidators, of Nardell Colliery have found no evidence of any offences for referral to ASIC at this time, I do not consider such a referral to be warranted. Communications: Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Legislation (Question No. 2958) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 10 February 2004: When does the Government propose to put the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 to another vote in the Senate.

The specific circumstances of his arrest are unclear, but it appears that he is being held in Dhaka Central Jail. I understand that Mr Choudhury has not yet been convicted of any crime and that Police investigations are continuing. Since his arrest the Bangladesh press has reported allegations that he had been engaged in seditious activities. I am unable to comment on the substance of these allegations.

(2) Is he aware that the principal reason for the Federation’s campaign to ensure Australia’s police are entitled to access superannuation from the age of 55 years is the concern that a police officer over the age of 55 years would be less effective and a risk to fellow colleagues when participating in duties which involve violent confrontation with offenders? (3) Can he confirm that members of Australia’s Defence Force can access superannuation benefits before the age of 55 years? (4) Will he review the Government’s superannuation policy so that Australia’s police officers would be able to retire at the age of 55 years with access to superannuation entitlements; if not why not? (1) Yes, I am aware of the campaign. (2) Yes, I am aware that is the principal reason given. (3) Yes, I am aware that members that joined the Defence Force prior to October 1991 can access their benefits prior to 55. New members after that date must wait until preservation age to access their benefits. (4) Under the current law, superannuation benefits can be accessed at any age if the following conditions are met: there has been termination of gainful employment; and the benefits are taken in the form of a non-commutable life pension or annuity; and the fund’s governing rules cater for this type of payment.",179,Questions On Notice
268,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Education: Workers Education Association (Question No. 3221) Ms George asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on 2 March 2004: (1) Is the Minister aware that when Workers Education Association Illawarra (WA) was awarded the contract to provide English courses in January 2002 it was permitted to offer students 2 x 400 hours instruction over a two year period. (2) Can the Minister confirm that WA has been instructed to offer only 1 x 200 hours instruction to each student; if so, (a) why, (b) on what basis was the instruction to reduce student learning time made, and (c) is this consistent with the original contract; if not, why not. (3) Is the Minister aware that as a result of this variation WA anticipates that its enrolments will fall from 40 students per month to only 18 students between now and the end of the financial year. (4) Will the Government now allocate further funding to English language programs in the 2004 Budget; if not, why not. (5) Can the Minister give a commitment that more money will be allocated to English language programs when contracts are renewed following their expiry in December 2004; if not, why not. (6) Will the Minister reinstate WA’s funding so that it can continue to improve the English language skills of constituents in the electoral division of Throsby; if not, why not. (1) Yes. (2) WA Illawarra has not been instructed to offer only 1 x 200 hours instruction to each student. (a) The programme guidelines allow providers to offer clients between 120 and 400 hours of training in a placement depending on each individual clients training needs and a maximum of two rounds of training within a two year period from the date of the first training commencement. (b) In 2003, in order to help providers manage within the budget allocated to the programme DEST introduced a new requirement that restricted the initial allocation of training hours to clients to 200 hours. This decision was taken following analysis of Language, Literacy and Numeracy Programme (LLNP) data which showed that more than 71% of job seekers were being allocated 400 hours of training. Given that over 69% of clients who withdraw from training did so before undertaking 100 hours of training, this was considered to be an inefficient use of resources which could be better directed to new clients. (c) This arrangement is consistent with the original contract as it still allows providers to review client performance after delivery of between 190 and 200 hours (as a mid point review) and increase the number of hours to the maximum in the client’s training plan and if the client is attending well, shows motivation and needs further training, then allocate increased hours to bring their total allocation up to a maximum of 400 hours. DEST also negotiated with a number of providers to allocate additional funding to assist with the increased demand for the LLNP. However, the offer of this additional funding was contingent on providers implementing strategies to manage the increased demand within their budgets while still maximising the flow of new clients through the programme. As part of this additional funding offer the Department offered WA Illawarra an increase of $84,000 on their base funding allocation of $275,000 for English language training in 200304. On accepting this funding offer WA Illawarra proposed, and the Department agreed to,",181,Questions On Notice
269,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:the following strategies to be implemented for all new clients assisted with the additional funding: Offering only 300 hours of training to those clients who are assessed as NRS level 1 or below; Offering only 200 hours of training to those clients who are assessed as NRS level 2 or above; and Offering second rounds of training to existing clients only in exceptional circumstances. The implementation of these strategies for the new funding has been necessary to ensure that WA Illawarra can maintain a flow of new clients and provide assistance to a greater number of jobseekers in the Illawarra region over the remaining LLNP contract period. The Department continues to work with all providers facing high demand for programme places to ensure that these providers place client interests at the forefront of the strategies they implement to ration access to programme resources. (3) According to DEST records WA Illawarra had a client intake of 40 or more in the current financial year only once in July 2003. Over the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 WA averaged an intake of just over 16 clients a month. Over the period 1 July 2003 to 30 December2003, WA averaged a client intake of 14 per month and in the first three months of 2004 this has risen to an average intake of 18 per month. Over the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2003 around 43% of WA clients achieved a successful outcome. (4) The 2003-04 Portfolio Budget Statements forward estimates provide for an increase of funding to the LLNP of $3.671 million in 2004-05 (for a total of $44.373 million), of $4.751 million in 200506 (for a total of $45.453 million) and $5.751 million in 2006-07 (for a total of $46.453 million) compared to the programme’s funding level in 2003-04 of $40.702 million. (5) As noted above, the 2003-04 Portfolio Budget Statements forward estimates provide for additional funding of $14.173 million for the LLNP over the period 2004-5 to 2006-07 as compared the base funding level in 2003-04. (6) In the 2002-03 financial year WA Illawarra received $300,494 in funding for English Language Training. In the 2003-04 financial year WA Illawarra has been allocated a budget of $359,000. Immigration: Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (Question No. 3234) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 2 March 2004: (1) Is it correct, as stated by officers of the Minister’s Department to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on 17 February 2004, that the Government has begun to trial the resettlement of unlinked offshore refugees in appropriate locations in regional Australia. (2) In which particular locations are these trials (a) currently under way, and (b) proposed. (3) How many refugees are proposed to be involved in the trials and what is the proposed timetable for their completion. (4) As part of the trials, what funding will the Commonwealth provide for (a) on-arrival settlement services, and (b) other assistance to those participating in the trials. (5) Are state and territory governments required to make a financial or other contribution to the trials: if so, what are the details.",182,Questions On Notice
270,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has been settling unlinked refugees in regional areas of Australia for some time. However, the Government is trialing a new approach to the selection of appropriate locations for future settlement in regional Australia with a view to more actively linking entrants to regional employment opportunities and necessary services. (2) (a) In 2002-03, the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS) assisted refugees to settle in Wagga Wagga and Wollongong in NSW, in Cairns, Townsville, Toowoomba, Gold Coast and the Logan/Beenleigh/ Woodridge region in Queensland, in Geelong and Shepparton in Victoria, in Launceston and the North West Coast region in Tasmania and in Alice Springs in the NT. In 200304 the IHSS also assisted refugees to settle in Coffs Harbour and Goulburn in NSW and in Mandurah in WA. (b) In 2004-05, refugees will be settled in up to four new regional locations. These locations will be determined after consultation with State and Territory governments. (3) The Government has set a notional target increase of 300-400 for 2004-05. Arrangements are intended to be ongoing, with the numbers settled in regional Australia being progressively increased taking into account the availability of employment opportunities and necessary settlement and other services. (4) (a) On arrival settlement services will continue to be provided under the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy. The existing contractual framework already provides for service delivery in regional locations. (b) Other Commonwealth funded assistance to new entrants settling in regional Australia will continue to be provided through the Adult Migrant English Program, the Community Settlement Services Scheme and mainstream service delivery programs. (5) Initiatives to expand humanitarian settlement in regional areas will be implemented in close consultation with State, Territory and local governments. State, Territory and local governments would be expected to continue to meet their responsibilities for provision of health, education, housing and other mainstream services to new entrants settling in regional locations. States and Territories will be consulted in relation to other potential avenues for support for regional settlement. Environment: Tasmanian Environment Centre (Question No. 3344) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 22 March 2004: (1) In respect of the grant to the Tasmanian Environment Centre under the Grants to Voluntary Environment and Heritage Organisations (GVEHO) program, is he aware of the massive decrease in funding that the Tasmanian Environment Centre incurred in the 2003-2004 funding year. (2) Is he aware that the Tasmanian Environment Centre provides assistance and support to other environmental organisations in Tasmania, such as Birds Tasmania. (3) How does the Government justify cutting the organisation’s funding so severely. (4) What alternatives will the Government make available to organisations like the Tasmanian Environment Centre to ensure that they can continue to operate and provide the much needed resources and information that other environmental groups have come to depend upon them for. (1) Yes (2) Yes",183,Questions On Notice
271,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) I decided to offer grants to regional environmental organisations at three amounts depending on the size of the organisation and geographic area covered. The Tasmanian Environment Centre was offered the maximum grant. (4) Since 1996, the Australian Government has dramatically increased the availability of funding to support environmental organisations like the Tasmanian Environment Centre through initiatives such as the Natural Heritage Trust and the Envirofund that annually provides $20 million for practical on-ground projects. Indirectly, the Government subsidises environmental organisations through taxation concession schemes such as Income Tax Exempt Charities and Deductible Gift Recipients. Environmental Deductible Gifts Recipients received over $55 million in donations in the 2002-2003 financial year and these donations, in turn, resulted in payments to taxpayers of over $22 million. Environmental organisations like the Tasmanian Environment Centre can take advantage of the very large amount of funding that the Government makes available to the environment sector through these funding programs and taxation concession schemes. Employment: Indigenous Employment Policy (Question No. 3358) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 23 March 2004: What is the net impact on the budget of each placement under the Indigenous Employment Policy’s Wage Assistance program (taking into account savings in unemployment benefits as well as the displacement and deadweight effects). to the honourable member’s question: In the Government’s recent evaluation of the Indigenous Employment Policy estimates were derived of the impact of Wage Assistance on the ongoing employment outcomes of participants and on the hiring decisions of employers. Using these estimates it is possible to estimate the number of extra jobs Wage Assistance is responsible for annually, taking into account displacement and deadweight effects. It is not possible, however, to estimate Wage Assistance’s net impact on the budget by taking account of savings in unemployment benefits. More information about the methodology used to derive these estimates is provided in the Indigenous Employment Policy Stage Two evaluation report which is available from http://www.workplace.gov.au/Workplace/WPDisplay/0,1280,a3%253D6408%2526a0%253D0%2526a1 %253D517%2526a2%253D533,00.html.

Where consideration is being given to Australia becoming a party to an international agreement, consideration is given to whether any Act, including the Migration Act, will require amendment to ensure consistency with any obligations arising from that agreement. When amendments to the Migration Act are proposed, international agreements are taken into account to ensure that the Migration Act will remain consistent with Australia’s international obligations. This was the case, for example, when the Migration Act was amended in 1999 to allow interception and boarding of vessels suspected of carrying persons without visas to Australia.",185,Questions On Notice

The commitment commenced in September 2001 and Relex II is continuing. The force elements committed to the operation have varied over time in response to changed intelligence assessments, platform availability and operational tempo. The commitment has included a frigate, two patrol boats, an amphibious transport ship, P3C maritime patrol and C130 Hercules aircraft.

(2) Have there been changes, or are changes contemplated, to the (a) Child Care Benefit, and (b) Maternity Immunisation Allowance payment. (1) The 18 month dose of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTPa) vaccine was removed from the National Immunisation Program on the recommendation of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI). This dose was considered to be unnecessary as a result of the high level of immunity from the primary course at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. This dose also had an increased risk of local adverse events following immunisation. Removing this unnecessary dose of DTPa, will result in a saving to the National Immunisation Program. As this was the only vaccine administered at 18 months, savings are also expected in relation to payments under the Medicare Benefits Scheme and notification payments to immunisation providers. The ATAGI recommended the introduction of a dose of adult formulation diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (dTpa) vaccine at 15-17 years, to replace the current dose of diphtheria and tetanus vaccine (ADT) vaccine provided at 15-19 years of age. The cost of replacing ADT with dTpa vaccine, taking into consideration the savings resulting from the removal of the 18 month dose of DTPa, is $5.36 million over four years.",186,Questions On Notice

(2) There is no specific agreement that covers the operation of the Sea Swap program. The presence of the United States (US) personnel in Australia, participating in the Sea Swap program, has been conducted under the auspices of the Agreement between Australia and the United States of America concerning the Status of US Forces in Australia, and Protocol to that Agreement dated 9 May 1963. (3) Australian Defence assistance, as requested by the US, is limited to the loading and unloading of military transport aircraft and accommodation of the crews. This assistance is provided under a ‘user pays basis’ with cost recovery under existing agreements. In the absence of a specific agreement on the Sea Swap initiative, the only obligations placed on the Australian and US Governments are those legal and administrative obligations pursuant to the Status of Forces Agreement. (4) The Sea Swap program is conducted under a fee-for-service arrangement. The US Navy has been charged for all costs associated with the two Sea Swap trials conducted to date. In addition, in order to meet ongoing Australian Defence Force needs, refurbishment work was conducted on accommodation blocks at Leeuwin Barracks at a cost of $250,825. As the US Navy has used these facilities during the two Sea Swap trials, they have contributed $25,000 towards the refurbishment costs.
