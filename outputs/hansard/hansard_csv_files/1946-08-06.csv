Tuesday, 6 August, 1946. took the chair' at 3 p.m., and prayers. MT. HOLLOWAY (Melbourne Ports-^ilinistev for Labour and National Service) -by leave-Recently the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis), and the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) asked questions in regard to the supply and price of penicillin. Penicillin is produced in Australia at i he Commonwealth Serum Laboratories at Royal Park. Sufficient supplies are in stock, and in course of production, to meet all .present human and veterinary, needs in Australia. Improvements in the method of production, effected from timo to time, and a close examination of done in various parts of the world on the costs, have enabled the serum laboratories use of penicillin for the treatment of to'effect'a' reduction in prices as from mastitis and other cattle diseases. The the 24thJuly last. The new prices are as follows:UoMtab, MrdlRll Wlmlr< > (IfelrfS. Itotnil ITIICArmy, Chcralstn UHwnoT* or Cmtamer*. l«> (*) Ml Net. Net. Not.

Hospitals and Defence Departments-Army, Navy and Air Force-a t Gs. not. These prices represent a very substantial reduction. They permit a modest profit ' to -be made and enable the product to compete with imported penicillin. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories are -proceeding with the establishment of new 1 plant that will enable penicillin to be produced on a large scale in accordance with the. latest methods adopted in the United States of America and GreatB r i tain. Until recently penicillin had not been imported into this country, but some supplies are now being imported from Great Britain. The arrival of 7. S. Boaeveai) these supplies raised the question as to read whether customs duty, which is imposed generally on all medicinal importations, should be imposed under tariff item 381 ( j ) as a chemical, not elsewhere included, OT vmder tariff item 285' ( A ) , as a medicine. Tariff decision number 4.6/133 of the ISth July, 1946 did no more than decide that imported penicillin when imported in powder form in ampoules of a certain dosage should be deemed to be included, under tariff item 285 ( A ) . The duties' applicable to the article in question, under tariff item 285 ( A ) , when of United Kingdom origin are:30 per cent, plus 5 per cent, prim1 ago plus a special war duty at the rate of 10 per cent, of the total of the foregoing, that is a total duty of 38.5 per cent. Exchange adjustment operates in favour of the importer.' . Considerable research work has been",7,Aliens Deportation Act No 29 Of 1946
1,Mr Spxaxxb. (Hon.,"results have 'been promising. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, in conjunction with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, have also carried out investigations in a limited way with satisfying results. In the manufacture of penicillin there is produced a quantity of second-grade product, which has an extremely limited use for human treatment hut which is particularly valuable for veterinary use. The Commonwealth Government approved of the free issue from the laboratories of 300,000,000 units of this second-grade product for veterinary research. An Advisory Committee of Commonwealth and State veterinary officers was called together by the Commonwealth Department of Health to consider the best use of penicillin for veterinary work. The committee recommended lines of investigation that should be carried out into forms of mastitis research and inade recommendations for the issue of penicillin, free of charge, to a number of research institutions in Australia where proper and full investigations can be carried out. These institutions have submitted their programme of research and have been -granted free penicillin. undertaken to keep the department fully advised of their results. This research, which will be extremely useful to animal health and food production, is being continued. Laboratories have on hand a very large -quantity of second-grade penicillin which will be available for release for veterinary use. The Australian Veterinary Association hits recommended that this penicillin should be made immediately available to veterinary officers of the Departments of Agriculture for use in those dairying -districts which would benefit most by its use for the treatment of mastitis in cows. The laboratories are at present preparing a pamphlet concerning the use of penicillin for veterinary use, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is working on plans for a suitable apparatus for the administration of the drug to cows. At the present time the Australian Veterinary Association does not recommend the issue of .penicillin to stock owners except for injection by a veterinary surgeon. In discriminate use of penicillin may at this stage do more harm than good. Moreover, steps need to be taken to ensure that a black market shall not be created in second-grade penicillin' for use hy humans. Plans for controlled distribution are being developed; It is expected that the use of penicillin for veterinary purposes' will have been completely demonstrated in the near future. There are at present sufficient supplies of penicillin on hand for all legitimate purposes for many months. With the developments now in contemplation penicillin will in the reasonably near future be produced at lower cost, and it is hoped, in quantities that will permit Australia to engage extensively in the export trade. The Government would, if it were possible, provide all medicines including penicillin, to the people of Australia free of charge. The Government in fact passed legislation through this Parliament to enable this to be done, and but for an adverse decision of the High Court as to the Commonwealth's powers in the matter, penicillin, which was included in the formulary set out in a schedule to that act, would be supplied to-day to the people entirely free of cost. However, it They have is hoped that if the social services question is answered in the affirmative at the' referendum"" to be held on the 28th September, the Federal Government may be in a position to proceed with its The Commonwealth Serum original scheme.

I made immediate inquiries into this case and found that the ex-soldier was admitted to the Repatriation General Hospital, Brisbane, on the 11th June, 1946. He subsequently became unmanageable, and on the 14th June, 1946, was transferred to the Brisbane General Hospital for investigation of his case. This was diagnosed by two leading specialists encephalogy. He was subsequently transferred to Goodna Mental Hospital on the 17th June, 1946. He remained at that hospital until the 31st July, 1946, when he was discharged as cured and placed in the care of suitable people. The application for acceptance .of nerve -disability as due to war service was lodged on the ex-soldier's behalf by the Pensions Officer of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, on the 2nd July, 1946, and the application is now being considered. I shall be pleased to advise the honourable member of further -developments of this case in due course. senting the Minister for Trade and Cus-' 1946, the number of houses completed and toms see the report in the Sunday Teleunder construction exceeded the target by graph of the 4th August, that 30,000,000 about 6,000. -cigarette papers are held in customs bond in Sydney?

However, there was much lee-way to be made up. Even before the war, there was a shortage of 250,000 houses, and the deficiency has become more acute since then because, during the war, it was not possible to. devote materials and labour to home construction. As far as I can see, everything possible is now being done to provide homes, always having regard to the availability of materials and labour. for Commerce and Agriculture why sweet cream is excluded from subsidy paid to the dairying industry? I realize that anotherdepartment is concerned in the matter, but I ask the Minister the question because persistent efforts by the Milk Zone Dairymen's Council have failed to obtain a satisfactory answer to it. As it costs, 83 much to .produce milk for conversion into sweet cream as to produce whole milk, and as the farmers do not know how much sweet cream they will have each week, will the Minister rake action to have it included? tion on that matter and had the following reply prepared :The Dairying Industry Assistance Act, of 1943, which provides for assistance to the dairying industry, defines !i dairy produce "" as "" cows' milk, or any produce derived from cows' milk, which, is to be processed at a factory into butter, cheese, dried milk not being skimmed milk powder, condensed milk or concentrated milk"". The act was assented to on the 3rd July, 1943, and was designed to stimulate the production of those products, which were required in the prosecution of the war. By the Cream (Disposal and Use) Order, sales of sweet or table cream have been banned, except on medical grounds, since May, 1943. Nevertheless; in States where the price of sweet cream is related .to the price of butterfat, the price of sweet cream has increased in proportion-to the' increase of. the price of butter fat. I shall investigate further the points raised by the honourable member. WOOL. Labour and National Service aware of the delay in the port of Sydney in loading wool for export? If the cause is the refusal of members of the Storemen and Packers Union to work overtime, what action is he taking to overcome the delay? Is he aware that if the delay continues the wool auctions scheduled to commence in September will not be able to take place? attempts have been made for a considerable time to get the members of the Storemen and Packers Union to work overtime. I must admit, I suppose, although I am not able to say for certain, that the failure of the men to work overtime would delay considerably the loading of wool. Last week, a conferencewas held between the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture r departmental officers,, officials of the Storemen andPackers Union and myself to consider the matter. That conference is still proceeding. for Commerce and Agriculture whether any further payments on the 1945-46wheat crop will be made ? If so, will he inform me approximately what is the amount? Will the honourable gentleman also state whether further payments may be expected on other pools which have not yet been completed? announce at an early date a progress payment from No. 9 pool. AlthoughI am not able to state offhand what the amountwill be, it-will be substantial. The final payment on No. 1 pool will be made in the near future.

If the honourable gentleman has not seen the statement will he have inquiries made, through the appropriate sources and endeavour to enlighten the Australian farmers as to the Canadian position, at least before polling, day? statement to which the honourable member has referred. The Canadian Government previously fixed a guaranteed price for Canadian wheat at 1 dollar a bushel for a period of five years. ""When investigations were made by officers of my department it was -discovered that that price was not so liberal as the present guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. a bushel made by this Government under the wheat stabilization plan. I shall have inquiries made into the statement referred to hy the honourable member. for Commerce and .Agriculture state what progress has been made by the Government towards the stabilization of the barley industry in compliance with the request of a deputation which recently waited on him? . very thoroughly the matter of barley stabilization, and I am confident that for this season, at least, the position regarding advances and the like will be comparable with that of the previous season. A deputation, which the representatiyes in this Parliament of South Australian electorates introduced, submitted to me very satisfactory recommendations, and I believe that the only difficulty at present in the way of implementing this scheme is section 92 of the Constitution. If the electors will rectify that position at the forthcoming referendum, we shall he able to give to the barley-growers of South Australia and Victoria a very effective stabilization scheme. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY. senting the Minister for Supply and for Wakefield has taken in methods of Shipping inform me whether it is a fact that some industries in Victoria are .now entering the seventh week'in which they have not participated in any distribution of industrial coal?

I now ask the Minister whether he read in yesterday's Sydney Sun, the following news item:» Infra red lamps suspended above orchards, vines and vegetable gardens, can turn on automatically when the temperature approached frost point.

Taxation Department was . approached some months ago, but a reply from it has -only just been received. on the project, the committee should be clear as to whether contributions will be subject to the income tax' concession. Frequently, appeals are launched firsi and the complaint is subsequently made that the tax concession is not granted to. the contributors. The request is then made for an extension of the principle. I shall examine the matter raised by the honourable member, and let bim have an answer later. Commerce' and Agriculture) -by . leaveAdvice' has' been received from London that the British Ministry of Food has agreed to an increase of the prices of butter and cheese for the third year of the contract, the 1st July, 1946 to the 30th June, 1947. The contract will remain in operation until the 30th June, 19.48. . The return received for. butter exported tralian f.o.b. prices. on account of the United Kingdom for the first two years of the agreement, that is, up to June, 1946, was-161s. Id. sterling per cwt. This represented the total 147s. 9d. and value, or grant, of 13s. 4d. Our request to the United Kingdom for the third year was for payment to cover both price and value, at 164s. 4d. sterling per cwt. This represented the. cost of The production as determined after consultation with the industry by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner on the basis of the figures submitted to him by the industry. The figure for value has now been abandoned and the total return called price. The price now agreed upon is 173s. 6d. sterling per cwt., which is the equivalent of that paid to New Zealand after allowing for the extra freight involved in the movement of the products from Australia, as compared with New Zealand. Committees which The price of 164s. 4d. proposed to the United Kingdom Government, together with the home-consumption sales and the Commonwealth subsidy, brings the return to the farmer up to Is."" 7-Jd. per lb. commercial butter equivalent. Following upon the increased return from the United. Kingdom above this figure of 164s. 4d. the Government will consider adjustments, that-might be called for. Its examination of the subject will probably -involve further consideration of the subsidy and of the creation of a fund to assist in the stabilization of the industry over a period of years. Special consideration will be given to the question whether into this fund there shall be paid the sum received from' the United Kingdom in excess of that which was sought with the concurrence of the industry. The major factor in any stabilization fund would be the establishment of floor prices arrived at after consideration of cost of production data. Higher prices have been secured by some foreign countries, but whilst the Australian Government stipulated -the maintenance of relativity with New Zealand prices,it has not sought to secure prices in line with foreign countries in respect of either butter or meat. It is true that the Danish price f.o.b. will be higher than the AusI t is to be remembered, however, that .

We have obtained prices for approximate the Danish. It might be the third year of the .agreements in exeven less if relative freights were worked cess of those anticipated by representaout. Apart from these details, however, tives of the industry. In view of the cirthe Government takes the view that the cumstances the Government feels that it price paid by the United Kingdom to should consult the industries with the Australia is satisfactory and, if because idea of working out long-term plans of. of the United Kingdom's need, and the stabilization which will have as their conditions in Denmark, the United Kingbasic objective the creation of floor prices dom feels that it must pay a higher price below which returns to producers will not to Denmark, it is not considered that Ausfall irrespective of the fluctuations of tralia should question it. The Government has not sought an extension of the current contract beyond 1948. It has reserved the right, however, when considering in May next the prices to be paid for the fourth year of the contract, to discuss with the United Kingdom Government the question of the continuance of the contract beyond 1948 either in its present form or in an amended form The increased prices now obtained provide an excellent opportunity to stabilize the earnings of the dairying industry. For the most part over the period of the contract, returns paid to the industry have been greater than those received from Britain, the Australian Government making up the difference by means of subsidy. On the other hand New Zealand has placed considerable money received under its United Kingdom contract into a stabilization fund. This is evident because the price paid to farmers has been approximately 3d. per lb. of butter fat less than that being paid to Australian farmers. Although the negotiations on meat have not yet been completed, there is' reason for belief that the prices for beef, mutton and. lamb that will be agreed upon will be above current prices, particularly for lamb. Representatives of meat producers on the Meat Industry Advisory Committee have been kept advised, of the progress of the negotiations and as soon as agreement is reached with the British Government a conference with representatives of the industry will be convened.

Minister and Treasurer) move That the bill be now read a second time. Supply Bill No. 1 provided for a period of two months to the end of August. The purpose of this bill is to obtain supply for a further period of three months to cover essential requirements until the new Parliament assembles after the general elections. The amount to be appropriated is £45,030,000, and it may be summarized under the following heads:Departments and Services, other than Defence and War, Business Undertakings and Territories of the Commonwealth Defence and War (1930-45) Services liusiness Undertakings (Post OfBce iind Railways) .. 5,403,000 Ttivritories of the Commonwealth 201,000 38,030,000 Refunds of Revenue Treasurer's Advance 5,000,000 45,030,000 The provision for non-war services is based on-the Appropriation Act passed by Parliament-for the year 1945-46 and provides only for essential requirements. Including the amounts in Supply Act No. 1. the total provision represents approximately five-twelfths of the 1945-46 appropriations! It is estimated that after excluding special appropriations, total war expenditure for the three months covered by the bill will be £52,964,000, which is £59,543,000 less than expenditure in the corresponding period of 1945-46. Provision is included in this amount for deferred pay of men now being discharged and other non-recurring charges arising out of the war. The amount of £6,500,000 is included in the bill to meet estimated expenditure in connection with the lendlease and reciprocal lend-lease settlement with the United States of America, and £100,000 is provided for initial expenditure under the Coal Industry Bill. The provision of £30,000,000 for war services in this bill represents the amount which it is estimated will be available from and revenue'receipts for the period of three months after making allowance for other obligations. The balance of war expenditure will be met from loan appropriations. As I mentioned recently in my [4.5],I Financial Statement, it will be necessary when the budget is framed to arrange the grouping of items now shown under war services more in accord with peace-time conditions. For the present, however, they are being shown in the same manner as in the Estimates of 1945-46. The usual provision is made in the bill for "" Advance to the Treasurer "" ' the amount x being £5,000,000. This amount is required mainly to carry on uncompleted civil works in-progress at the 30th June, and also to cover unforeseen and miscel£ laneous expenditure. Except as already stated, no provision has been made for any new expenditure and there is no .. 2,426,000 departure from existing policy. adjourned. BILL 1946.

This clause sets out the powers of the Joint Coal Board. I desire to refer particularly to the difference between this bill and the Coal Production (War-time) Act 1944 in making provision for the payment of compensation to persons whose mines may be taken over by the board.

88,Mr Anthony (Richmond) [4.14],"the whole community are challenged. An injustice which is tolerated or perpetrated in respect' of one section of industry may later be extended to any individual. F o r ' this reason in particular, I object to the deletion of this safeguard. Paragraph j of sub-clause 3 of clause 13 provides that the board shall have authorityto terminate, suspend, vary or modify any coutraut or agreement relating to or affecting the production, supply or distribution of coal, sary. The inference to be drawn from including sale transportation by land or sea, loading, discharge, delivery, storage and use; In other words, the hoard w ill have power to assume control of and operate any coal-mine. In such circumstances, elementary justice demands that compensation shall be paid to 1 any individual who suffers loss as the result of the exercise of that control. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) recognized the merit of the claim for protecting the rights of the individual when he stated that the matter of compensation was covered by clause . 57. ' If the honourable gentleman w ill examine that clause in the light of statements made by the Opposition, he w ill have to admit that it does not meet the circumstances which I have mentioned. The very fact that clause 20, which w ill be deleted, provided specifically that the coal-owner should have the right to claim compensation, is evidence that further provision must he made to afford the necessary protection. Government always considered that clause the manner in which the Commonwealth 20 was unnecessary. It was only because of Coal Commissioner took control of and the representations of New South Wales operated Coalcliff. It is estimated that that we included the clause in the b ill .

The Minister mentioned, in particular, clause 57, which providesIf any person claims that he 'has sustained any loss or damage by reason of an exercise by the Board of the power referred to in paragraph ( j ) of sub-sestion (3.) of section thirteen of this Act, lie may, within three months after the exercise of .the power, lodge with the Board a claim in writing setting out full particulars of the loss or damage and the question whether any and, if any, what amount of compensation should in all the circumstances of the case be paid to that person shall be settled by agreement between him and the Board, or failing any such agreement, by. an action by the owner against the Board in any court of competent jurisdiction. Therefore, the only redress which an aggrieved person may have w ill be under paragraph j of sub-clause 3 of clause 13.

97,. Mr Ryan (Flinders) [4.24],"I also' i.t will be extractable only a,t very heavy cost.member, in statements that have very little foundation in fact, to deny to the"" owners the right of compensation. The honourable member for Hunter said that millions of tons of this coal has been lost forever. That is not. true. A large proportion of it in the older workings could be extracted by the system of hydraulic stowage. A good authority has conservatively estimated that the quantity that could be recovered by such means is 50 per cent. Probably an estimate of 70 per cent, or 75 per cent, would be nearer the mark. ' If proper step were taken, the coal could be recovered without great difficulty. It is true, as the honourable member for Hunter has said, that hydraulic stowage has not proved very successful in Great -Britain. The reason is that the floor of the collieries in Great Britain where the coal is being worked is composed of . soft clay, which does not provide a good foundation for hydraulic stowage. The conditions in the mines of New South Wales are far more suitable. Large quantities of the coal now regarded as lost, according to the honourable member for Hunter, could he recovered and put to the uses of the community. The powers conferred by this clause, are wider than those which, within my knowledge, have ever' been given to a board in either this or any other country. They are more extensive than one would appreciate at first glance. By means of the definition of "" coal"", they cover not only coke and gas,but also all the derivatives of coal. Those derivatives embrace from 350 to 200 different, products, including nylon stockings, plastics, fertilizers, explosives and drugs. The board will have the power to control those derivatives, not only where they may be produced in New South Wales, but also where they may be found in articles that are imported. The power may not be exercised in that respect; nevertheless, it will exist. Wliy should we confer powers in relation to the products of not only our own coal mines, hut also the coal mines of other parts of the world? The clause is outrageous, and I shall oppose it to the utmost of my ability. [4.34] -During the debate last week I was unable to deal with a couple of points. . I shall not discuss the legal aspect of the much-vexed matter of compensation. But it would, be interesting were the Minister to provide for the information of the next Parliament, should he be a member of it, a statement of the paid-up capital of the mining shares held in New South Wales, their present-day market value, and^the amount lost, by the coalminers during the last ten years in consequence of strikes. I strongly suspect that the amount lost in strikes exceeds the present' market value of the shares that are held, by the different companies. The point that I want to bring out is that, had the miners been prepared to work and make a levy on themselves, they could have owned and operated the mines with the money they would have had. A. very difficult position confronts my State in consequence of the refusal of the miners to produce coal. The loss in the Adelaide area alone is reputed to have been over £60,000 during last weekend. This may be quite all right from the standpoint of some people on the coalfields of New South Wales, but it is not so good for those who, in other States, have to depend upon supplies of coal to keep industries going. Men who are not prepared to mine coal ought to relinquish that occupation and make way for others who are willing to do so. I do not believe that a man needs to' be descended in a direct line from about seven generation's of coal-mihers before he can go down a coal-mine. At the rate at which matters are progressing, I shall soon be in competition with the honourable member for Hunter, because the Government of South Australia is considering the-development of coal resources in the Barker electorate. I give fair warning to the honourable member, who I am sure will still be a member of this Parliament after the forthcoming general elections, that in due course there may be a contest between him and myself on the subject of coal. No doubt we shall hav.e the assistance of Mr Gregory Forster, and one or-two other men who have been mentioned in the debate. We should have a rather interesting tussle. I do not wish to delay the committee, because I am perfectly sure that every member of it is anxious tp get out on to beautiful green fields,'",28,Second Reading
98,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"in order to estimate what the harvest is likely to be on the 28th September. Therefore, I merely record my protest against the manner in which the bill has heen brought down, everything it contains, and what it proposes to do. 1 do not believe that it w ill produce one additional ounce of coal. shall not lead the committee to believe that I am an expert in respect of the coal industry. Nevertheless, there, are some observations that I should like to make. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber have admitted, that the .industry presents not only a Commonwealth but also a world problem. I noticed with interest that the Australian press, a short while ago, had seen f it to send a special representative, E . W . Tipping, to the coal-fields, to make investigations and publish his impressions. that he published were most illuminating. Those who have read his first article w i ll have noticed in it the statement , that if he were offered £100 a week he would not work on a coal-field. In his final article, published in the Melbourne Herald, he said thisCursing the miner, will not get industry more firmly than has. Australia, beone stray ounce of coal, hut the public, the cause it has nationalized the industry. Government, the directors of the colliery companies and the miners themselves all agree Up to the present, control of the industhat the farce must end. Referring to Mr Justice Davidson's, report, he said thisMr Justice Davidson recommended a federal We should notallow so important an authority, with power to grant a bounty to owners willing to work under it. He insists industry to be controlled by either the on enforcement of the law and maintenance of miners or the mine-owners. In a civilized the sanctity of agreements. On the 2Sth July, the Sunday Telegraph published an interview which its representative had had w i th Mr Thomas E. employer of labour for many years, and O'Byrne, a member of the New ZealandI know that when difficultiesarise they Parliament, who' has had considerable can be overcome by discussing matters experience. I make this quotation from with the men. That is the only way in the interviewMr O'Byrne was diffident about advising different from any other industry in this, Australia how to solve its industrial problems. "" A country must work out its own troubles in respect. The Prime Minister said that its own way"", he said. "" What goes in one the bill represented a practical approach place mightn't go in another. "" I believe we're a jump ahead of you in failures in the past, we should not be New Zealand in most ways, and that's one discouraged from making another attempt reason we have less trouble. If you give the along the lines laid down in this bill. If people £ood conditions, there's not much left for them to itrike for."" Mr O'Byrne went on to sayI believe .there must be production with the greatest possible economy, and distribution with the greatest possible justice. If you've got that, you won't have much in the way of industrial trouble. Australia is a rich country. You need population and irrigation. You can get both if you're prepared to spend as much in peace as you did in war. And if you get those things, I together with decent working and living conditions, yoh won't need to worry much about strikes. I believe that this bill aims at those objectives. Honourable members of the Opposition,, both at the second-.reading stage and during the consideration of the bill in committee, have traced the progress of the industry over a number of years. They have painted very dull pictures of what has occurred in GreatB r it a in and otherparts of the world. The right The articles honourable member for North Sydney( Mr. Hughes) said that he could paint a worse picture than had been painted by either the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) or the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). What we have to face are the changing facets of the problem, which is identical in Australia and GreatB r it a in . ' The United Kingdom has grasped the nettle try has been exercised exclusively by private enterprise. Private enterprise has failed to produce enough coal in Australia and the other parts of the world. country employers and employees should be able to come together and reason their way out of difficulties.

The coal deposits at Leigh Creek were opened up by private enterprise, which made several attempts to work them, hut they were abandoned. over by the Government of South Australia under ' a bill which was introduced by the Premier of that State, and carried through Parliament against the votes of his own supporters, but with the support of the Labour Opposition. That is to the credit of the Premier of South Australia -The State did not have the resources for working the deposits, so the Premier( Mr One. of the sub-clauses of this clause Playfo.rd) approached the Commonwealth Government for financial assistance, and obtained a grant of £100,000. Later, he received a further grant of £50,000, and I understand that he was in Canberra recently with a proposition that the Commonwealth should advance another £5.0,000 to enable South Australia to become self-sufficient in the production of coal Anything .which I can do while a member of this House to assist in the successful working of the Leigh Creek mine, and to promote co-operation between the Governments of South Australia and the Commonwealth, I shall do Just before Japan entered the war it was proposed to establish a power plant at Port Augusta, at. a cost of £1,000,000, but the project was held up because of the war. I can seegreat possibilities in the way of power production by means of proper co-operation between the Commonwealth and the Government of South Australia. I believe that the. Premier of that State, if he sees that a proposi-. tion of this kind would be of benefit to his State, would be big enough to co-operate with the Commotiwealth Government in the establishment of a power plant at Port Augusta, or Port Germein, or, preferably, on the coal-field itself. However, I understand that there might be difficulty in obtaining enough water at the coal-field for this purpose. too, protest against this clause, which proposes to authorize a board to confiscate any mine it chooses without paying compensation to the owner. I cannot underWakefield ( Mr Smith), who says that he is an employer of labour, can favour a proposal for the compulsory acquisition of property without the payment of compensation. Would he, or any businessman, put money into an enterprise that The mine was taken might be confiscated on those terms ? I hope that he understands the full implications of the measure which he is supporting.

Mr Justice Davidson, whose excellent report should be a guide to the Government, statesA t present, tlie coal industry in New South Wales is d r if t in g directly towards disaster, and unless some greater degree of co-operation is reached there may be a repetition of the depression within ten years. That is a serious statement. This is a matter in regard to which we should endeavour to co-operate. We should not range ourselves behind capital and labour as if they were in two separate camps. The Kandos mine .in New South Wales is a striking example of how employers and employees can work together-. In Victoria, there is the Yallourn mine which is most efficiently worked, and housing conditions are ideal. It is better to work towards such a goal than to let the industry drift, with the men being badly led by Communists. Mr Justice Davidson gave as this reason for the lack of discipline in mines in New South Wales. . . . political antagonism between mine workers, who are Communists, and those who are opposed to the doctrines and activities of communism. Because of this antagonism there is a grave shortage of coal, and in Victoria",30,Second Reading

This is having the. affect of delay-stagnation would never occur. Officials ing the housing programme. The woollen mills in that district are affected because men in New South Wales will not hew coal. We are familiar with the difficulties under which miners work, but a good deal of the trouble in the industry is a psychological heritagea sort of ""Don't go down the mine, Daddy"" complex. As a matter of fact, the hazards of coal mining are no greater than those of other heavy industries, and improvements could be effected. If there is too much dust in the mine the difficulty can be overcome, by mechanization. If housing for miners is bad,, let us provide better houses. Above all, let there be co-operation. Wliy do not the unions themselves take over some of the mines? Let them buy out a few mines, and show by their example how they can be worked. The unionshave great funds. They are in fact, the greatest vested interests in the Commonwealth. the unions are practically bankrupt because of the machinations of those who, like the honourable member for Bourke, have led the workers intostrikes. At Geelong, there is the Returned Soldiers Woollen Mill which has set a fine example of co-operative effort. It is run by returned soldiers. Federal Woollen Mills which were sold by a government that the honourable member supported. co-operative effort which' can set an example to the coal-miners. would do as I suggest they would have the goodwill of the people of the Commonwealth, and certainly of the Opposition in this House. The trouble is that Communists are inciting the men to cause trouble. In Victoria to-day the whole of the foundries are shut down because of irdustrial trouble brought about by the machinations of the Communists. All of the industrial trouble besetting industry to-day would be avoidable if the. ter at the table cannot see some good in workers were prepared to take up shares that he should not bring down a bill in the industries in which they are employed. If the miners were led by reason. able men these disputes which, continually threaten to bring industry toof the miners federation would never dream of suggesting that coal-miners should acquire shares in the mines. There, appears to be some fear among some workmen that if they did sothey would be branded as "" little capitalists "". Has any one ever heard a union nabob advocate investment by a member of his organization in the industry in which he is employed ? Yet such investment would be the best guarantee of industrial peace. It would not only bring about harmony in industry but would also act as an incentive to thrift, and would probably result in the saving of many pounds by individual workers which they would otherwise lose in betting or other forms of gambling. While no one desires to paint the picture any blacker than it is, it cannot be denied that irritating strikes occur in rapid succession over the most frivolous matters, and in the final results tens of thousands of men are thrown out of work. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) made no reference whatever to the disastrous effects of the continual ' strikes fomented by the recalcitrants in the miners' federation; he claimed that the turmoil in the coal-mining industry was brought about solely by the actions of the coal-owners. The industry has reached its present pass because no one in the miners federation is' prepared to advise the coal-miners to remain at work, and as the result economically. Australia is sliding down the slope. In order to bring about peace in the.coal-mining inI am speaking of a 'dustry there must be co-operation between employers and employees; stupid class If they distinctions which havekept them apart for so many years must be broken down.

If the Government is so disposed it can achieve much by exercising the powers conferred by this clause. I am generally opposed to the bill, but I realize that it will be placed on the statute-hook because the Government has the necessary numbers to ensure its passage. Having opposed the second reading of the hill honourable members on this side of the chamber can now only endeavour to make the measure as workable as possible. I agree with the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) that this bill as drafted will not result in the production of more coal. I therefore urge the Government to' give further consideration to this clause: Let the Government so amend the clause as to ensure that, as far as is practicable within the limitations of this measure, the livelihood of tens of thousands of people,not only in New South Wales, but also in the other States may not be continually endangered. The restrictions on the use of gas and electricity in Victoria and other States have caused the greatest hardship to women and children particularly. The Government should do its utmost to induce the unions to acquire shares in the coal mines and to encourage their' members to do likewise. The miners' federation could purchase a coal mine, or half a dozen coal mines. The output of six or more coal mines would supply the 35,000 tons of coal which Victorian industry needs every week to ensure the full working of its industries. The working of a second shift in the mines is another means by which the production of coal could be, greatly increased. ' In recommending the working, of a second, shift j Mr Justice Davidson pointed out that one shift is ^adequate to produce the coal that Australia! needs. I believe that two shifts are being worked in the brown coal mine at Yallourn in Victoria. with the clause? Government to take any measures needed to improve the efficiency and competency of persons engaged in the coal-mining industry. Because of that the clause is the very crux of the bill. The Government should make every effort to ensure that coal production shall be once again as buoyant as it was years ago before the industry began to be disturbed by a series of calamitous strikes fomented by irresponsibles in the miners' federation. impelled to reply to the ridiculous, and stupid statements regarding the coal mining industry made by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White). The honourable gentleman displayed a complete lack of knowledge, not only of the conditions of coal-miners, but also of workers generally. He even suggested that miners should buy a few mines and run them themselves. If he had any knowledge of conditions under which miners have been living for many years he would realize that they could not jointly finance the purchase of even the smallest coal-mine in New South Wales. The honourable member doubtless finds that airy talk of that kind has. sdme appeal to the Australian Womens National League and other women's organizations with which he appears to enjoy some popularity. If he mixed more with the working classes of the community he would soon learn that the workers are more concerned with securing a reasonable standard of comfort than in purchasing a mine.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN.

If the honourable member had his way the capitalist sections of the community would dictate the terms and conditions under which the workers would labour. We. have long passed the stage in this country where the workers were merely beasts of burden or the slaves of their employers. Nowadays employees are treated as human beings and the courts of the land prescribe the conditions under which they shall be employed. The honourable member referred to the housing conditions of the miners; but he did not suggest that the return for their labour should be sufficient to enable them to purchase houses in which they could enjoy a reasonable standard of comfort. He advanced the foolish suggestion that they should invest their accumlated savings in the purchase of coal mines. Does he know any coal miner who has accumulated sufficient wealth to become an investor in a coal mine? I am well aware of the conditions of the working people; I have lived among them all my life; and I have yet to learn that out of their savings the coal-miners have been able to amass sufficient wealth to become shareholders in a mine. The honourable member spoke in glowing terms of what can be achieved I rise to a point of order. by co-operation. Co-operation means joint effort by two parties, and there cannot be co-operation in the coal-mining industry unless both employers and employees are willing to discuss their differences amicably.

It is because of the bad conditions in the mines that troubles recur in the industry. Without cooperation we shall not get very far. The honourable member revived the contention that a second shift ought to be worked in order to ensure the production of more coal. The honourable member forgot to tell us where he thinks the labour for the second shift can be obtained. Will he volunteer to work in a mine ? of his friends into the,mine with him? I very thought of a second shift is sacrilege. do not think the honourable gentleman A second shift can be worked.

As there is no prospect of obtaining the number of men necessary to work a second shift, I wish the honourable member -would stop harping on the subject The speech of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Bryson), if one could term it a speech, was largely made up of "" the honourable member for Balaclava"".

The honourable member for Bourke was perhaps not a member then '. or unfair employees they should be brought to book. Any difficulties connected with dust can be removed by an advance in mechanization. If houses are inadequate they can be improved. But the .Government .must not shut its eyes to the needs of the in-i dustry. It ought to appeal to the better instincts of both the employers and the employees. One would think from the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke that miners were sweated; but, by working only two or three days a week, they can earn £8. They have a 40-hour week. They can earn much more than £8 a week if they want to. The man who takes an interest in his own industry does good for himself and his family as well as for the country, but the gamblers who waste their money are a bad influence. The great need is for capital and labour to work in unison. I have often said that before. They should gettogether and say, "" What are the problems that have to be solved? Let us define them and let us deal with them and get on with the job "". Only then will this country prosper. We should produce sufficient coal to ensure that industries shall thrive in the various States, and by their prosperity to attract large numbers of people to make Australia a great nation. To-day on the waterfront we have communist control. The Governor General' of the Netherlands East Indies announced that country would not trade with Australia' until sailed with their cargoes for the Netherlpnds East Indies. Communism is threatpning the democracies of the world. Honourable gentlemen 'opposite shut their eyes to that. This is the crucial time in our history. If we do not get production, we shall, according to Mr Justice Davidson's report, have another depression MrH . Wells, president of the miners' federation, once s a i d Malicious and stupid suggestions that the federation proposes to abandon the strike weapon and embrace arbitration have no foundation. His business is strikes. Government supporters never have the courage to denounce him because they are afraid of was. losing the support of the Communists. If there are rapacious Mr Sharkey, president of the Communist party of Australia, saidFurther .good work will finally convert the miners' organization in to a really revolutionary union and a firm support for the struggle for socialism. That is what members of the Government stand for. They do not criticize Sharkey. If they support this alien evil of communism that has come to Australia, let them say so. If they do not denounce communism they are a menance to Australia.

The honourable member and others have sought to imply that. something sinister is' being done, that an injustice is to be done to the mine owners, that instead of compensation being paid for something that the joint board might do, confiscation would occur. Opposition members have urged that provision should be made in the hill for compensation to mine-owners for loss or damage, including loss of profits, suffered as a result of directions given' or control exercised by the board. Let us examine ' just what losses or damage may be incurred by the owners. There will be three different classes of mines in the future. There will be mines worked by the joint board itself. The argument of honourable gentlemen opposite has nothing to do with them. There may be compensation in relation to mines taken over by the board, and' there may be matters relating to losses or damage in mines controlled by the authorities, that is mines concerning which the joint board will have given directions that certain things be done. in this bill for compensation to be paid to the owners of mines -acquired by the authority, because that provision is to be made in the hill to be introduced soon in the Parliament of New South ""Wales. The Commonwealth Government has"" no constitutional authority to acquire mines, for it has no general powers over production, of coal. The-only government that has the power to acquire coal-mines for and on behalf of the Joint Coal Board is the Government of New South Wales. graph g inserted in clause 13? my argument. The honourable member can have his turn later. Provision for acquiring mines will be made in the complementary legislation when it is introduced in the Parliament of New South Wales. Therefore, the matter of compensation for acquired mines does not arise in this bill. The only point at issue is the matter of loss or damage resulting from directions issued by the Joint Coal Board to mines which are commonly called "" controlled mines"". Losses can occur only as the result of certain costs incurred by the owners of a. controlled mine. What may those costs be? They may be the result of the termination of some contract or the suspension or variation of some agreement, which the owner of the controlled ' mine had entered into. Compensation in regard to those matters is provided for in clause 57. That is perfectly clear and distinct. In what other circumstances may the owners of controlled mines suffer loss? As I said, the owner of a controlled mine, to suffer loss, has to incur costs of some kind. Those costs may be the result of a. direction issued to him to take adequate safety precautions .and make proper provision for the health and welfare of the workers in a particular pit. Is it suggested that the owner of a controlled mine, to. whom such a direction has been isstied, should be recouped for his costs incurred in regard to that matter? Certainly, that would be entirely wrong. It is not done in any other industry. In plain fact, of course, a cost No. provision is made such as this, and, indeed, any other costs which may be incurred by the owner of a controlled mine with the exception of those which are dealt with in clause 57, will be taken into account when the price of coal is fixed. The Joint Coal Board will fix the price for coal; it will also fix profits. When the board fixes the price for coal sold by a controlled mine, it will take into account all the costs incurred by that -mine. Therefore, a controlled mine is. not in afly different position from any other type of. mine; The Joint Coal is paraBoard will fix the price of coal at all mines, whether they are controlled mines or not, on the basis of costs.

The opinions of the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, and of Mr Justice Davidson leave no doubt as to where the responsibility for the difficulties of -the industry lies. My principal purpose in speaking on this clause is to direct the attention of the Minister to paragraph d of sub clause 1 and paragraph i of sub-clause 2. Paragraph d provides that the powers and functions of the board shall include the taking of such action, as in the opinion of the board, is necessary or desirablt to promote the welfare of workers engaged in the coal industry in the State. Paragraph i provides that the board shall have power to make provision for the establishment of sound industrial welfare practices including the provision of amenities them. for employees in the coal industry. The purpose of this bill is to provide means for securing and maintaining adequate supplies of coal throughout Australia and for providing for the regulation and improvement of the coal industry in the State of New South Wales. The bill does not make provision for the coal-miners of Queensland. On their behalf, I appeal to the Minister and the Government to ensure that they shall be granted the amenities which this legislation will grant to the miners of New South Wales. able member become a miners' leader? miners' leader. The coal-miners of New South Wales were described by the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, "" as saboteurs of the national war e f for t "" and as provisions of this bill to all States. The being "" contemptuous of the orders and directions "" of the Government "". Yet those men are to receive the benefit of the amenities which this bill w ill provide. According to my information, the initia l cost of those amenities will be £500,000, and the complete programme will cost an additional £1,000,000. the coal-miners of Queensland, who have been engaged in the industry for a long time, have been forgotten. For 25 years, no major stoppage occurred in the coal mines of that State. Only recently, when the president of the miners' federationMr Wells, and another of his kind, prevailed upon them to go on strike in sympathy with the meat workers, did they break their excellent record of production? According to the press, Mr Wells assured the miners of Queensland that tens of thousands of pounds would be made available as strike money if they stopped work. They heeded his remarks; and' that is the first major stoppage in the industry in Queensland for 25 years. Throughout the war, those miners -produced more coal than formerly. For comfort and amenities the coal mines of Queensland do not compare with those of New South Wales. Our coal seams are poor ' in comparison with those of New South Wales. In some places the Queensland miners worked under almost intolerable conditions in order to produce coal for the war effort. Now this Government has by-passed No t one penny has been made available to provide them with amenities or to improve their welfare. Why should not the miners of Queensland, who have served the nation so well for so many years, be entitled to the benefits which this bill w ill confer upon the miners of New South Wales? W h y has not the Government extended the provisions of the bill to the coal-mining industry in all States? Increased coal production in any or every State is a matter of national importance. W h y is the Government toying with the problem, giving amenities to the men whom the late Prime Minister described as "" saboteurs of the war effort,"" and disregarding the I have always been a welfare of those who "" pulled their w e i g h t"" during the war and did not lay down on the job?

Unfortunately, If I had more time, I should read the tribute which the late Prime Minister paid to the miners, of Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia .who rendered excellent service to the nation during the war.

To-day, thousands of men in various industries in New South ""Wales, Victoria and South Australia are out of work because coal is not available. According to some Labour leaders it w ill not be long before the number is increased to hundreds of thousands. All this unemployment is being caused through the action of the Communist leaders of the miners' federation. air "" to-day! about that. I ask for an assurance from the Government that provision w ill be made in this legislation for amenities to be made available to coal-miners in Queensland as well as those in New South ""Wales. Some honourable members may not be aware of the fact that I represent about 60 per cent, of the coalminers of Queensland. I have fought their battles and I have been straightforward with them all through the years. I have not been afraid to tell them where I have thought them wrong, just as I have not hesitated to tell honourable gentlemen opposite where I consider them to be wrong. I can see no. reason why the coalminers of New South Wales, who were described by the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, as saboteursof the war effort and men who were contemptuous of the orders of the Commonwealth Government during the war, should be provided with all kinds of amenities which are likely to cost the Commonwealth as much as £1,500,000 and be treated in a more favoured fashion than the coal-miners of other. States who, during the war, did their best to provide the nation with the coal that it so urgently needed. I see that the Ministerf o r Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway)'is now sitting on the treasury bench. I ask him whether he is aware that provision is being made in this bill for only the coal-miners of New South Wales?

150,Mr Francis,"I am happy thatmember'stime has expired. When my time expired earlier this afternoon, I was -dealing with the possibilities that could follow from co-operation between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia in regard to the development of the Leigh Creek coal deposits. I am pleased that at least one honourable member of the Opposition realizes the value of co-operation between Commonwealth and State governments in regard to coal production. . It would now appear that, at least one honourable member opposite will vote for the bill at its final stage. If the Leigh Creek coal deposits could, be developed effectively, South Australia could become largely self-contained in regard to coal supplies. The most practical method by which this could be done, in my opinion, would be by the establishment of power stations at the most suitable ports on Spencer's Gulf, and the transmission of electric current from them toparts of the State where it is -most needed. For a considerable time it was regarded as uneconomic to transmit electricity by wire over long distances, but that view is now known to be unsound. In this connection I direct the attention of honourable gentlemen to a paragraph in the Canada Year-Booh 1940, which readsThe Transmission of Electric Energy Until almost the .beginning of the present century it was believed that any attempt at long-distance transmission of electricity would prove uneconomic because of the amount of current absorbed or lost in transmission. The development of the high-tension transformer and of improved insulating materials resulted in the construction, in 1807, between St. Narcisse and Three Rivers, Quebec, of an 11,000,-volt line, 18 miles in length, the first high-tension transmission line in the British Empire. Since that' time continued technical advances have resulted in a steady grovyth in transmission distances and voltages in Canada, until at present power is being transmitted.'for instance, from the Gatineau River in Quebec to Toronto, a distance of 225 miles,, a t , 220,000 volts. Greatly improved technique has also been developed in switching control and protective equipment. Electric power is already being transmitted a. distance of 130 miles in South Australia, and if a power station, or even more than one, could beestablished in the locality that I have suggested, power honourable could betransmitted to the river settlements and throughout the western portions of the State. All through the river settlements at present power is being provided by the burning of thousands of tons of wood a year. This is denuding the country of timber, with consequent extensive and seriou3 soil erosion. The development of the Leigh Creek deposits as the result of co-operation between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia would be of immense significance to South Australia. Investigations could be made by experts to determine the most economical way to establish power stations. After they were established power should be available to electrify adjacent railways, and this would be extremely helpful to the development of the State. "" I trust that one result of the passage of the bill will be an improvement of the relations .between the mine-owners and the miners. Despite the remarks of honourable gentlemen opposite the Government is making an honest attempt to solve the problems of coal-mining and so bring about stability in industry. [5.56] I support the views expressed by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) regarding the need to extend the provisions of the bill to States other than New South Wales. Honourable members who represent Queensland constituencies are proud of the record of the Queensland coal-miners throughout the war. They did credit to themselves and to their State. The Minister for Postwar Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) said that everything possible should be done to provide amenities for coal-miners, but he has not indicated how that is to be done, nor have we been able to find in any of the remarks that have been made by honourable gentlemen opposite any concrete proposals to' ensure the continuous production of coal, although we all realize that -it is absolutely essential to industrial stability. The construction ofhouses, which is an urgent need to-day, is being delayed because coal is not available in sufficient quantities for manufacturing and tranport purposes.

At any rate, the inactivity of many miners is completely dislocating transport services. It seems that the coal-miners of New South-Wales intend to do as they please. They realize that the Government is so spineless that it will not.attempt to discipline them. We are facing the possibility of a complete break-down of industry.

The honourable gentleman suggested that compensation could be dealt, with under three headings. First, he mentioned clause 57, which deals with the termination, suspension or variation of contracts. That provision is fairly clear and reasonable. Secondly, he said that compensation would be available in the . event of the board acquiring coal-mines. That, of course, is provided for in the Constitution. It is obligatory upon the Government if it acquires properties to do so on just terms. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. pensation relates to the controlled mines; in other words, mines taken over and operated by the hoard'. In that connection, the Minister propounded what to me was an extraordinary theory, namely, that there could not be any losses on the working of such mines, and consequently there could not be any claim .for compensation in respect of them. not be any losses unless they-represented certain costs. costs. The Minister said that no compensation would be claimable because the losses would be met by what he described as the price fixed for the sale of coal. We have had some experience of government controlled mines in the last few years. The example that comes instantly to mind is the Coalcliff colliery, details of the operations of which are well-known to honourable members; but' I shall restate them, in order to refresh theminds of those who may have forgotten them, because what happened in the past under government control will be again experienced. During the last two years, the ' losses on the Coalcliff colliery have amounted to approximately £60,000, the loss being £28,350 in the first year, and £27,650 in the second year. The point that I impress on the mind of the Minister, if his mind is capable of being impressed, is that, in the first year of government control, from March, 1944, to February, 1945, the production costs amounted to 24s. lOd. a ton and the selling price to 21s. 3d. a ton. In the following year, the Coal Commissioner raised the sale price to 22s. l i d . a ton. But the production costs of the colliery also increased from 24s -lOd. to 27s. 3d. a ton. Does the Minister consider it possible so to raise the selling price that the costs of production in all mines will be covered ? Does the Government contemplate that if a selling price sufficient to cover production costs in one mine 3s., 4s. or 10s. a ton higher, than in other mines, were fixed, that mine would be able to sell its product? The Minister claims to have some knowledge of economics. I cannot believe that he would attempt to base the future economics of the coal industry on such a theory. What will happen? The Coalcliff colliery has been producing at a loss for two years, for what reasons I cannot say. Does the Minister expect that colliery, to sell its output if the price be fixed at a figure that will cover costs of production, should the output of -Aberdare, Cessnock and other collieries be purchasable at a lower price ? It cannot be gainsaid that buyers, will purchase from collieries that produce at a lower cost; and the Coalcliff colliery, or any other mine controlled by the Government, will have to continue",41,Second Reading

164,Mr Sheehy,"(Boothby) [8.25]The fundamental problem is the question of making the industry sufficiently attractive to induce miners and their sons to remain in it. The mining stock of this country is a great national asset . and it -would be little short of a national disaster if the miners were gradually allowed to drift, to other occupations. No doubt there are many difficulties to be overcome in our attempt to place the industry in a position of stability and to ensure continuity of employment in every mining district, in summer and winter, in good weather and bad and, as far as possible, in good and bad times. In order to achieve that we must provide proper amenities; we must establish pit head baths and canteens; we must provide good housing and opportunities for leisure and recreation for the miner and his family. ""Finally we must give encouragement to, and provide opportunities for, boys joining the industry to continue their education with a view to fitting themselves for higher positions without limitations of class or social distinction. In all the arrangements that we plan we must realize one and for all that unless we raise the status of the labour force of the industry to the level of one of the most dignified, well respected and stable.occupations in this country, almost anything else we may plan will rest on an insecure foundation. In South Australia the Leigh Creek coal-field has been developed by the State Government with the assistance of the Commonwealth. An amount of £150,000 has been expended on the development of that field, and now almost 5,000 tons of coal is railed weekly from that field to Adelaide. The Adelaide Tramways Trust uses about 75 per cent, of Leigh Creek -coal in its furnaces and other industries are using large quantities. I read recently that the Premier of South Australia has authority to compel industries to use Leigh Creek coal It would be interesting action he has taken to exercise that authority. supply undertaking has been nationalized and is now owned by the community. have been reached by a Liberal government with the support of the Labour Opposition. Thus, we may thank the Mr Sheehy. Labour members of the South Australian Parliament for having helped to achieve this measure of public control. Coalminers represent only one section in the industrial field. We should unite .as one people in an effort to raise the . status of workers generally. South-Australia has suffered greatly as the result of shortages of coal. Whilst we are apt to place the blame ' on people in New South Wales, we must take a broad national view of the problem and endeavour to devise a scheme for the betterment of the industry that will do justice to employers and. employees alike, wherever they may be located. The Government has shown its willingness to take steps, to ensure that sufficient coal shall be produced to meet the needs of industry. It has been said that the amenities proposed in this bill will result in increasing the cost of coal. In the national interest we have, as a matter of policy, subsidized our primary industries; is there not every justification for taking similar steps to preserve an industry that supplies the very life-blood of the .community? Every attempt should be made to induce the miners and owners to sit together at round-table conferences and ende'avour to iron out their difficulties. The task of finding the solution of their problems should not be left to legal, men. It "" should be possible to call both the miners and the owners together and to work out a. plan for the future which would be satisfactory to all concerned. I have faith in the bill because I have faith in the Government, and as time progresses, and as we settle down to normal peace-time conditions, I believe that many of the problems that have confronted industry generally, will disappear. This nation will progress to a stage at which it will become one of paramount importance in the Pacific. to ascertain what clause 13 is the key machinery provision. of the bill, I desire to make one or two The Adelaide electricity comments on particular aspects of it.

In my view the Government is making a piecemeal approach to, the whole problem of fuel and power supplies",45,Second Reading
165,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [8.37],"A sfor industrial and community purposes. As a member of the Parliament for a number of years and as Minister for Labour and National Servicei n an earlier government, I have seen something of this industry at first-hand, and I frankly confess that I despair of any short term answer to the problems that confront it. In concentrating on the problems of the coal industry by the methods proposed in this bill the Government is avoiding* the major problem that concerns the Australian peopleas a whole. Coal is unquestionably basic to our whole economy; but coal is not the only source of fuel and power available to us. It may be the most important source; it may be the most convenient for development; undoubtedly if we reach the potential productive capacity of the New South Wales coal-fields we shall be able to meet the needs of industry and of the community for the next few years. I doubt very much, however, whether we could meet long-term needs. The board proposed to be established under this clause is to confine its attention to the problems of the coal industry. The Government should have established an authority with a very much wider jurisdiction, which would have in its membership capacity for exploring the potentialities of the production of hydroelectric power and, more important than that, the maximum use of fuel oil in industry and the development of our brown coal resources. ' Such an authority might even be empowered to consider the emergency use of wood where wood was found to be a useful substitute. I have yet to be convinced that the Government has fully explored the possibilities of the importation of coal from countries which produce quantities surplus to their needs. We have the experience of other countries to indicate that coal can be produced in tremendously increased quantities if intelligent methods are applied to its production. In Holland after World WarI . the annual production of coal amounted to only 2,000,000 tons. As the result of rehabilitation of the industry and the raising of the status of coal-miners to that of respected and honoured workers of the community, the production of coal in that country was increased to 17.000,000 tons. Something along those lines is possible in Australia. The other possibilities I have mentioned are not merely a part of a long-term plan, but are also aspects of the general problem of fuel and power provision which might be investigated immediately. At present we are only dealing with a segment of the problem; and if we are to tackle the problem as a whole we shall have to consider fuel and oil production divorced from coal. power has the Commonwealth over those other matters? refuge in the Maginot line of the constitutional powers of 'this Pai""liament. Let me remind him again that Labour to-day controls the Senate and the Bouse of Representatives in this Parliament, and that there are Labour governments in office in five of the six States of the Commonwealth. I would be surprised if . the honourable gentleman would claim that he has been thwarted in his efforts to exploit the fuel and power resources, of South Australia by the Premier of the sole remaining State, South Australia. It is of no use for the Government to take shelter behind the constitutional limits of this Parliament in matters of this kind. Has the Government ever convened a conference to consider in what way all aspects of fuel and power distribution and production should he tackled? I realize that Australia has limited hydro-electric capacity, but I have yet to be convinced that we have developed it to its fullest potential.. I know that there is limited fuel other than coal for industrial purposes, but I have yet to be convinced that our resources of such fuel have been exploited to their fullest capacity. Because coal has been in the forefront of politics of this country for the last generation, coal has been predominant in the minds of the Government and its planners. But coal represents only one section of the general problem of providing power and fuel for industry. Surely no' one is so optimistic as to believe that by passing this bill we shall get a quick, short and complete answer to our fuel and power needs. That is the general criticism that-1 make of the clause. This clause deals with the problem of the distribution of the limited resources of coal that are at present available to us.

Paragraph c of sub-clause 1 gives the board power .to . determine how coal is to be distributed in the various States and the use to which it is to be put. As far as I can see that power merely perpetuates the general mechanism that has been operating in recent times in respect of the distribution of coal. During the second-reading stage we indicated that political interference -with the work of instrumentalities such as the proposed Joint Coal Board detracts from their successful functioning. believe that is happening to-day in the distribution of our coal. In Victoria, we have had no industrial coal for most of our important industries for seven weeks. The industries have been trying to carry on by make-shift methods. They have been using fire-wood, for instance, but that, as the Government well knows, cannot be continued indefinitely. belief, which. I have yet to be convinced is wrong, that political considerations have directed the use to which the limited supplies of coal reaching Victoria have been put. It is significant that with the general elections approaching, despite the fact that gas was rationed all last winter and early this year, and despite the unprecedentedly desperate position of Victorian industries, gas-rationing has not been re-introfavour because the consumer is directly duced on a continuous basis. I do not wish'to subject the citizens of Victoria to the inconvenience of gas-rationing-I would only hope for a sufficiency of coal to meet the needs ofindustry and domestic users of gas-but I do criticize the policy which, in order to avoid the odium that would, attach to restriction of the use of: gas by domestic users, deprives essential industries of the coal that they need to produce commodities"" and to provide employment. policy is reckless, short-sighted and irrewith the result that our sponsible, and it must have repercussions on the economy of not only Victoria, but also, as it is one of the principalindustrial States of the Commonwealth, on Australia. Either the Government is wilfully blind to this disproportionate distrielse can we do hut suppose that political bution of coal) or it is condoning and supporting that policy. At question time to-day, I put a question to the Minister man), and I remind the committee that he is the Minister vitally concerned in the development of post-war industries. I asked him whether he knew that these things were going on or whether the Government had taken any action in the matter. His answer was significant. He said that the matter was within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Supply and Shipping, a New South Wales Minister, and that he did not have first-hand knowledge of it, but that he would try to get the information for me. ' He went on I to say that responsibility for the distribution of coal was in the hands of the Commonwealth authority, which cooperated with the State authorities. I am quite certain that he is not unaware that the Government of Victoria has taken a direct interest in the manner in which coal has been distributed and in the situation that has resulted in no coal It is my being received by our industries for the last seven weeks. But the situation apparently has not been considered by him personally or placed before the Commonwealth Ministry. The Government cannot avoid responsibility. There should, not be political interference in these matters, because it makes .governments the subject of pressure, as is all too evident in this instance. Here we have a desire to avoid criticism and political disaffected: supposition in the honourable member's argument. have the facts, and most people in Victoria would be, too.

It may prescribe differential rates of price for various mines, fix different values, and so affect entirely the economic working of a colliery, and determinedifferential profits for various mines. I do not dispute the need to confer on the board very wide powers. If the Government controls an industry it must confer substantial powers upon the board. However, speaking in terms of power is one thing. Another aspect to be considered is in terms of obligation to people in the community. During this discussion, we have heard a great deal about the obligations owed to the coal-miner. So be it ! But there is also an obligation, as I see it, to people whose money is invested in the coal-mines. I know that the answer may well be, "" Who cares about them ?"". In reply, I point out that those people are spread over a vast section of the community, and have a right to be protected. If the need exists to protect employees by allowing them the right of appeal, why should there not be a right of appeal in respect of the exercise of the power contained in paragraph g of sub-clause 2. This is a major point for discussion. During the war, the power to fix prices and profits in industry was vested, without appeal, in the Prices Commissioner. criticisms may be of certain aspects of it, I would be the last person to dispute that the Prices Commissioner did a first class job. But in peace-time, the necessity does not exist to continue that arbitrary system. I know, as miany other honourable members know, that in the fixing of prices, many injustices were worked. Perhaps that was inevitable in the circumstances. Paragraph g of sub-clause 2 gives to the board such a comprehensive authority to control any particular company or mine as to have a most' serious repercussion upon the value of the investment of every shareholder. Under this particular clause, no right of appeal is given. pany. It may be said, ""Well, the board The authority vested in the' board is arbitrary. The Minister said of another power given under this bill that there wias no real danger in it because the acquisition of mines was a matter for the Government of New South Wales. 1 Mr Spender. remind the honourable gentleman that we must study the clause in terms of obligation as well as of power This clause is expressed solely in terms of power. Apart from clause 57, no term of obligation is imposed upon the board. It is true that the whole scheme must be implemented by legislation passed by the Parliament of New South Wales, but. I assume that the board to be appointed by the State will be the same body, with the same powers as . the board established by this bill. By Commonwealth and State legislation, a board will be created with complete power to control the industry and acquire mines. The Commonwealth will not be able to acquire a mine, except on just terms, but the State will be able to acquire it without any obligation to compensate the owners. This is a matter of not merely academic interest I desire to provide proper'protection for those who may suffer loss as the result of the exercise of the powers conferred by this clause. The Minister said, ""After all, .the board, which may fix prices, can adjust any losses "". That might not be so. Under the general powers of the bill, there is a general authority to do exactly what was provided specifically in the National Security (Coal Control) Regulations of 1941. Regulation No. 17 provided that Whatever the the Coal Commissioner mayDirect that the owner of that mine shall.. for a time to he specified or unti l further order cease to produce coal at that mine. Obviously, that position is not met by the contention that the power to fix prices will cover such an eventuality. Coal goes into the profit return for the year in which it is won, but at the same time, the capita] asset is. rapidly depreciating. Paragraph g of sub-clause 2, together with other sub-clauses, gives to the board a most extensive power to conduct a. mine, to close it wholly or temporarily and to fix the price of the coal which in certain eventualities, may result in great loss to the shareholders of the comwill probably do the right thing"". Generally, that is so. The authority which is set up attempts to do the right thing for the individual. But most hon-' orable members will agree that it does not always do the right thing, because no Opal Industry organization is infallible. Some limitation is placed upon the power of the board to suspend or exclude a person from employment in the coal industry, so causing him loss. The Government has seen fit to allow such an individual the right of appeal. ""Why? Very rightly, because the individual may suffer loss, and the Government is not prepared to trust to the omniscience of the board to mete out justice to the individual in this case. Why, then, should not an equal right be given to shareholders who can prove that they have suffered substantial loss as the result of the exercise by the board of the power conferred hy paragraph g of sub-clause 2? I am not seeking to give a general right of appeal in every particular case. When I use the words "" as prescribed"", I give to the Executive power to limit the right of appeal in order to prevent vexatious appeals. But -if there is real substance in an appeal, why should not the shareholders have the right to approach an impartial tribunal to determine their loss? After all, a board, no matter how competent its members may be and how desirous they may be of doing the right thing, will make mistakes. If the exercise ciate the effectiveness of our prices conof these, powers may result in' losses to shareholders, why should they be deprived of the right of appeal? An employee has the right of appeal against any loss that he sustains from a decision of the board. . The. Minister will not meet my contention by saying, "" This position will be dealt with by the board or by the State "". The entire bill, subject to clause the men received an increase, half of .them 57, is expressed in terms of power. Ho obligation is imposed upon the board, although I believe that it would in most instances endeavour to do justice, to give fair compensation. Against the decision of the board in this matter, no right of appeal is provided. During the war there were occasions when the fixation of prices -worked gross injustices to individuals. I recall one instance. organization was. "" declared "" as having engaged in black-marketing. As the. result of that declaration, its prices were fixed at rates much lower' than, those of its competitors. After twelve months,"" the Prices Commissioner admitted that a mistake had been made in declaring the firm. In the meantime, [134] [6 AUGUST, 1946.] BiU 1946. 3755 the firm had supplied, under compulsion, to the Munitions Department, articles at the fixed price. When the ban was removed and the mistake was admitted, the firm, asked the Munitions Department to make up the difference between the fixed price and the price that had been allowed to the trade generally. That request was rejected. Order !The honourable member has exhausted his time. the Minister( Mr Dedman) not to accept the amendment. Had the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) had the same experience as the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) and the country had of fixing the price of coal in World WarI . , he would agree that the Joint Coal Board should have the right to fix the . price without its decision being subject to appeal. Australia did a remarkable job during the war with its machinery for the control of prices. People who have travelled in other parts of the world, and have been able to form a judgment on personal experience, appretrol administration. Things were very different in this country during World War I,'when there was no proper control of prices. At that time the cost of all commodities became very high, and the workers in the coal-mining industry made a claim before the Hibble tribunal for an increase of wages. Fifty per cent, of being awarded an extra Is. 6d. a day.and the other half an extra Is. a day, but the price of coal was not controlled, and the mine-owners were permitted to increase their prices by Is. 6d. a ton. At that time the average output per man in the industry, including mine managers, trappers, -boys, agents and, in fact, everybody, was 3 tons a day. A simple calculation will A particular reveal that the mine-owners made a marvellous ""rake-off"" on that occasion. Only 50 per cent, of the workers had received an increase of wages, but every buyer of coal, had to pay an extra Is. 6d. a ton for it.

175,Mr James (Hunter) [9.14],"I askindustry was being ruined. If the Parliament bad made an honest attempt at that time to meet the position, «we should probably not have had to face the difficulties in coal production which now face us. The clause now before the committee is, in reality, the heart of the bill, and I do not believe that it should be amended in the way that honourable members opposite are suggesting. I said in my second reading speech that I hoped that the provision which clothed the Joint Coal Board with power to provide amenities for the miners would not be regarded as contentious. I also said that I hoped that the miners themselves would realize the need for some penalties in respect of their own colleagues who refused to observe the law, and that it would be' recognized that this measure was-an honest attempt on the part of the Government to ensure that reasonable concessions would be made to men who took their lives in their hands day after day to go down into the bowels of the earth to win coal for the whole community. This subject should be discussed on common-sense and not sentimental grounds. The coal-miners must be regarded as an important cog in the industrial machine. Coal is basic to success in all industries. Honourable gentlemen opposite may criticize the bill as imich as they like, knowing that they will "" hit the headlines"" in the newspapers by so doing, but they must admit, surely, that the miners should be treated sympathetically. These men, who have been subjected to such bitter criticism, provide the life-blood of industry. Without the product of their -work it would be impossible to maintain industrial activity, transport services or domestic amenities. Provision is being made in the bill for engaged in the industry. In fact it cover? a proper housing scheme for coal-miners. practically every aspect of coal-mining. This is long overdue. Honourable memI t is almost wide enough to justify bers opposite who are critical in this another second-reading speech. But I doconnexion cannot know anything from not desire to take f u ll advantage of the personal experience of the difficulties and broad scope of discussion that it opens. indignities of having to rear a family in AlthoughI am so conversant with all the a shanty with an iron roof and bag sides. details of the industry, and am apt to bedo it. not expected to do it forever. I know of coal-miners, who work hard and have how wretched such conditions can be, never been disloyal to their country. for I reared a family of three children, in a,bag shanty of this description, and I am not ashamed to say so. But I have been elected to this Parliament to-do something to improve the lot of the coal-miners, and I intend to do the best I can for them. If honourable gentlemen opposite can hold briefs for the mine-owners, I certainly intend to do the best I can to help the miners. It is a. pity that those who hold these briefs for the mine-owners do not know more about the daily life of the coal-miners. If' they had such a personal knowledgeof the industry as I . have, they would not have said many of .the things that we ' have been obliged to listen to in thisdtebate, and they would be more humane in their outlook. I have seen, recently, in Prance some of the housing schemes that have been provided for workers there and they are worthy of the highest praise. I have also seen housing schemes in Great Britain, which have reached a considerable stage of development. If any such schemes had been attempted by the coalmine owners in Australia our positionwould have been very different. This bill also seeks to protect the health of the miners.. The Joint Coal Board that is to be established is to be given power to deal with the dust nuisance. I know of a father and two sons under the age of 30 years whose lives have been utterly ruined by coaV dust.

That is the basis of the whole of my argument, and I hope that it commends itself to the committee Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Tndustrial Research) [9.39] -The Government cannot accept the amendment of the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser). To the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr established the Prices Commission. Spender) was left the submission of the case for the amendment. He sought to make a comparison between' this provision and that which relates to the exclusion of persons from the industry. an appeal tribunal was prescribed in respect of those latter persons, it followed that an appeal tribunal should also be prescribed in relation to the regulation of prices for the sale,, purchase or resale of coal, and the values at which coal is recorded in the accounts of any business. [ suggest that there is no comparison between the two cases. It is true that an appeal authority is to be set up in respect of persons who 'may be excluded from the industry by the Joint Coal Board. That authority will probably consist of a stipendiary magistrate, a representative of the employees, and a representative of the employers. An appeal authority of that nature will be able to adjudicate on a matter such-as the conduct of an individual in the industry just as well as, if not better than, the least, the public interest in the price the Joint Coal Board, because the individuals composing it will have had very much more experience of such matters than will .the Joint Coal Board. On the other hand, the board will have r.he advice of the Prices Commissioner, [n fact, it will be composed of experts in the matter of prices. The honourable member suggests that, over and above this authority dealing expertly with prices, and with a full knowledge,of the whole of the circumstances, .there should be an appeal authority which, in effect, would be' a super-authority on prices. missioner of Taxation are subject to appeal to the Taxation Board of Review. ber made a comparison between regulation of prices in the industry and the exclusion of any employee from the industry. I claim that a comparison cannot be made between the two. I conclude -by saying that the Government does not intend to' set up any appeal authority in relation to prices, for the 'same reason that, the Government of which the honorable gentleman was a member did not set up any appeal authority when it The sub-clause to which an amendment has been moved deals with the regulation of prices for the sale, purchase or He argued that, because resale of coal, the values at which coal is recorded in the accounts of any business-that is a very important and necessary function-and the profits in the coal industry. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) seems to be playing "" a lone hand "" on his side of the chamber. Another honourable member submitted the amendment, but did not speak to it. The honourable member for Warringah has spoken' to it twice. Apparently, no-other honourable member on his side is supporting him. What is the cause of the concern that he has shown? There are three matters which, I believe, ought to concern every member of this Parliament: first, the success of this legislation,, and of the hoard that is to be created by it, in the -production of coal; secondly, and not that will have to be paid for coal; and thirdly, the return which the shareholders should get on the capital they have invested in the industry. Not one word has fallen from the lips of the honourable member for Warringah in regard to the public interest in what it will have' to pay for coal. In pre-war days, when prices were not fixed, I did not hear him argue that there ought to be constituted a tribunal to hear appeals against the prices charged by the coal-owners.

If any new amenity were given to' the men, or if the cutting price of coal rose, the coal-owners recovered the extra cost and more, because they had the undisputed right to fix the price of coal. They"" socked"" the public in those days to whatever degree they chose. It is true that during the war there was a restraining influence through the Prices Commissioner. mission, may not continue to function, in which event we should re. vert to the old system, and the coal-owners would again fix prices which the public would have to pay. I am wondering whether, in that day, the honourable member would suggest setting up an appeal board in the public interest to decide whether or not the public was being exploited. The next point is this: The powers of the board are set out in the bill. They are very wide, but the limits imposed upon them are prescribed in the bill. The honourable member supports an amendment to provide that the prices fixed by the board shall be "" subject to appeal as prescribed "". In other words, there is to be an entirely visionary board of appeal, the powers of which are not prescribed, but it shall have power to review the decisions of a board whose powers are, in fact, definitely the many problems with which he hadprescribed. Before the war, and before the setting up of a price fixing authority, done a good, all-round job. However, I the coal-owners fixed their own price for coal. Not only that, but when the owner of a coal-mine also happened to be the owner of a shipping line or a steel company, he charged about one-half of the recognized price of cpal to his own subsidiary company, and made up for it by charging the public double that price. Alternatively, if such an owner charged a fair price for the coal supplied to a subsidiary firm, he must have charged an unfair price to the public. I believe it to be important that.the board set up under this bill should have full control of the industry, including the fixing of the price of coal. It should have power to fix the price to the public, and also power to investigate the price at which coal is recorded in the books of any Mr Rosevear. business. This power is important in What the case of owners of coal-mines who control subsidiary companies. Who, 1 ask, could be better qualified to fix the price of coal than a body which was in control of the whole industry? It is proposed to give the board power to discipline the coal-miners and the owners, and even to take control of a mine where necessary in the public interest. The functions of the board include the preservation of peace in the industry and the getting of coal, to ensure that the users But the Prices Comshall not be exploited, and that the shareholders shall receive a fair return on their capital. In view of those various functions, who could be better qualified than the board itself to determine a fair price for coal? Who could be better able to decide exactly what was the cost of producing coal, and to ensure that owners who control subsidiary companies do not charge half the fair price of coal to those companies, and ""sock"" the rest of the community in order to get their money back? The coal board should he in a better position than even the Prices Commissioner to fix a proper 'price for coal, and the Prices Commissioner has been the subject of many eulogies this evening, although he must sometimes have made mistakes. Indeed, no one ever did anything of any importance without sometimes making mistakes, but it will he generally agreed that, bearing in mind to deal, the Prices Commissioner has say that even if this visionary board of appealshould he the Prices Commissioner, he could not bo better qualified to decide the proper selling price of coal than the board set up specially to deal with the whole industry. Moreover, I believe it to be important that there should be this over-all control of the price of coal because it would be. possible,. in the absence of any control of prices, for the coal owners to-destroy the effect of this legislation by the simple process of raising prices to whatever level they liked, so that the public would lose confidence in the plan as a remedy for the difficulties confronting the industry. ""They could make the scheme unworkable. Therefore, it is important that the board-whic h possesses vast powers enabling it to bring workers and, employers together, to put out of the industry persons, whether employers or employees, who are disturbing influences, and to provide amenities in the interests of the workers-shoul d have .power in the first place, also to fix the price of coal, and, secondly, to scutinize closely the operar rions of mining companies which juggle their books to suit themselves, and in order to exploit the public. As I have --aid, without this power the far-reaching purposes of this legislation could be negatived. No argument put forward by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr propose to show how fallacious was the -Spender) to-night was in the public interest. He never mentioned the public interest from first to last. my speech I said that it was in the interests of the public that an appeal Hiithority should be constituted. he said which touched upon the interests of the public, and even then he was confusing the public interest with the interest of the shareholders in. the mining companies. He spoke of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) telling a "" sob story "", but it was he himself who treated the committee to a tragic sob story, the purpose of' which was to support the proposal that the mine owners should have an "" open go "" in the fixing of prices. He mentioned the poor widows whose probates he had dealt with, and for whom he had found a few shares in. a mining company hidden away somewhere.. His suggestion was, that if we refused the owners the right to fix coal prices, all-these poor widows would have to go to Lidcombe for the rest of their days. I have"" heard the honourable member speak to his brief before. To-night he appeared to be speaking to a brief which lacked the support even of the other members of his own party. There was certainly no enthusiasm among honourable members opposite for the amendment. Even the honourable member who' moved it did not speak to it, but the honourable member for Warringah spoke twice. I shall be interested to note how much enthusiasm the honourable member's colleagues will evince for the amendment. The honourable member's speech was nothing more than a specious plea for the coal-owners. It is evidentthat he does not care for the welfare of the industry, and not one word did he say in favour of protecting the general public against exploitation by the coal owners. -The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) apparently believes that no honourable members on this side of the House are prepared to support the amendment. Well, I support it, and I argument of the honourable member in opposing the amendment. The subclause provides that, the board shall have power to regulate the.'price for the purchase or sub-purchase of coal, and the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has asked that this power be subject to appeal as prescribed. The Minister in charge of the bill has'refused to accept an amendment to this effect. Evidently, the Government believes itself to be omnipotent, and to, be incapable of making a mistake. It will not listen to argument nor accept any amendment. I listened carefully to the 'speech of the honourable member for Dalley, who based his argument on the ground that the coal-owners could charge whatever price they chose for coal, andfrom that he went on to say that the board should have power to fix prices. He used a charmingexpression when he said that the coal-owners would "" sock "" the public in order to recoup themselves for the concessions which they made to their own subsidiary, companies. This was a fine example of parliamentary language from the Speaker of the House. Most Speakers are content to remain Mr Speaker, and do not take part in debates. The honourable member for Dalley also said that the board would be better qualified than the Prices Commissioner or any appeal body to fix the price of coal, and. that there should be an over-all price, as otherwisethe owners could smash this legislation. .Those' remarks show the honourable member's supreme ignorance of economics.

It is they who, ultimately, determine the price of coal. haired sage from Brisbane who, apparently, is well versed in all the principles of economics! Let us see what happened in regard to coal prices in New South Wales during a period of ten years. According to the report of the Board of inquiry appointed by the Government of New South Wales, consisting of Mr. Justice Davidson, Mr >S. McKensey and MrF . Lowden, the .price for coal at the pit's mouth in 1928 was 17s. 6d. a ton. In 1929, it had fallen to 16s. ""6d. a ton. In 1930 it was down to 15s. 5d. and in 1931 to 13s. 8d. I ask honourable members to mark what dreadful rises of price were perpetrated by these "" atrocious"" coal-owners, who were castigated by the honourable members for Dalley and Hunter. As a matter of fact they should have been raising the price of coal, smashing the coal industry and sucking the life-blood out of the public. But what happened? In 1932 the price of coal at the pit mouth was down to 12s. 2d., in 1933 to l is . 6d., in 1934 to 10s. l i d . , and The department is paying 2s. 6d. to 2s. 9d. per in 1935 to 10s. 6d. In 1936 there was a "" h e a v y "" rise of 2d. to 10s. 8d., and in 1937 these desperadoes increased the price to l is . Thus, over a ten-year period, except for two small rises totalling 6d. a ton, there was a consistent f a l l of the price of coal. Yet the honourable member for Dalley says that the coal-owners would endeavour to force the high that the public would be unable to pay, and that they would wreck the Government's scheme for the rehabilitation of the industry. The answer to these charges is contained in the figures in Mr Justice Davidson's The honourable member for Dalley spoke of the necessity for appointing the coal authority to fix the price of coal. It has been clearly shown that it would"" be against the interests of individuals and corporations to allow such an authority to be the final arbiter of its own decisions. I have no time for the doctrine expounded by honourable members opposite of one law for the coal-miner and another law for other sections of the community. This Parliament should hold the scales of justice evenly. There should not to be an appellate jurisdiction for one section of the community and not for another. What has been our experience of government-controlled mines? In the conclusion arrived at by Mr Justice Davidson, whose report on the coal industry has not yet been printed-w e have to .take it for granted that the extracts issued by the Government are not watered down or censored versions-w e learn that he had this to say about the New South Wales coal-mineI t cannot be. claimed that the State mine at Lithgow, Since its foundation, in 1916, has been a notable success. Originally it was not well laid out. The first working places are approached by a transport road more than 88 chains in length from the shaft. When, after being in operation for eleven years, control was transferred to a board, the sum of £271,941, forming portion of the total debt of £581,941, had to be written off as a loss. Later in the report Mr Justice Davidson saidIf the purpose of opening the mine was to avoid exploitation of the Government Railway Department in prices by private owners ol collieries, that purpose is not being achieved. ton more for coal from the State mine than the price at which coal of equal quality could be obtained, from private producers in the vicinity. The case of the Coalcliff colliery has been referred to frequently during the debate on this measure. The latest figures show that during the period in which the mine was operated by the Comprice so monwealth Coal Commissioner, the loss on that colliery amounted to approximately £70,000. However, I am willin g to use the earlier figures mentioned by Mr Justice DavidsonOperations at the Coalcliff colliery from the report. 9th March, 1944, to the 31st December, 1945, resulted in loss to the extent of about £37,000. Thus, through inefficient operation of the mine, the Commonwealth Coal Commissioner incurred colossal losses. How then could such an authority dispense evenhanded justice to owners and workers alike? As the result of the losses on the Lithgow mine, the price of coal to the New South Wales Railways Department was increased, not by the rapacious coal owners, but by the grasping State government raising the price by from 2s. 6d. to 2s. 9d. a ton more than the price auoted",57,Temporary Chairman Mr Clause 3 I T Provides That The Board Shall

197,Mr Abbott,"Listen to the whiteby private .producers in the Lithgow district.

He in respect of which we might apply the saying that justice may be blind but it has a good look over the top of the bandage across the.left eye. The honourable member castigated the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) for suggesting the establishment of a board of appeal. The honourable member for Warringah and I are unlike in that he is a lawyer and I am not, though I have heard it said not infrequently that I am something of a bush lawyer. for Warringah is a cold-blooded lawyer. a very hot-blooded exhibition to-night. The honourable member for Dalley said that such a board of appeal would be a purely visionary body wi th visionary powers. I find on analysis, however, that the very words which the honourable member for Warringah is attempting to incorporate in the amendment occur in paragraph Tc of sub-clause 3, which provides that the board shall have power to suspend or exclude from employment in the coal industry, subject to appeal as prescribed, any person employed in the industry who acts in a manner prejudicial to its effective working. I would like to know from the honourable member for Dalley, or from any Minister who may happen to be present-the only one I see -at the moment is the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost), who is apparently widening his knowledge of the geography of Moscow so that he may know his way about there in the near future-whethe r the board of appeal as prescribed for employees who lose their jobs is in the nature of a purely visionary body with visionary powers. The point has been well taken by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) that the function of the law should be to administer even-handed justice to all. We should which injustice may be done either to persons or .corporations. As the honourable member for Warringah pointed out, corporations, are only aggregations of individuals and should be as justly dealt with as, their individual members. Having delivered his bolt the honourable memreminds me of the hit-and-run motorist who does not wait to see whether the damage to his victim is greater than that sustained by his own car; He has endeavoured to put into the mouth of the honourable member for Warringah words which, he did not use. I listened carefully to the speech of the honourable member for Warringah and I cannot recall having heard any reference to widowsI would be delighted if Hansard could produce one to-morrow morning. In his minor capacity as a mere member of this chamber, the honourable member for Dalley has been guilty of a misstatement which he would view very seriously if he were occupying his more exalted position as Speaker of the House. When that misstatement was pointed out to him he did not have. the decency to admit his error. Obviously he has endeavoured to attribute certain words to the honourable member for Warringah without first taking the precaution of checking the accuracy of his recollection of them. He may, in due course, have something more to add to this debate. Perhaps .he will repeat his performance and, like' the hitand-run motorist, again deliver his blow and run away. matta) [10.12] I do not intend to follow the example of honourable members opposite, who ranged at will instead of confining their remarks to the precise amendment before the committee.

201,Sir Frederick Stewart (Parra,"from all honourable members. I rise principally to direct attention to several implications in the clause to which attention has not yet been drawn. Honourable members on the Government side have reiterated the intention of the Government to dispense with all war-time regulations, including the control of . prices Yet honourable members will observe that the clause seeks to enshrine for all time in the legislation of this country price control in respect of one particular commodity -coal . Of course, there is nothing new in that; it is but one more piece of evidence that the miners are to be treated in the matter of pensions, as a class apart, that they are to which are denied to other sections of the community, that they are to be allowed to select their Own chairman, and are to be -treated much more generously than other members of the community. This bill is further evidence of the Government's appeasement of the miners. If the price of coal-is to be fixed for all Labour rules in New South Wales. But time, it is only reasonable that those' affected shall have the right of appeal. [10.15] -The Minister in charge of the bill ( Mr Dedman) seems to think that I did not say sufficient about the amendment when I foreshadowed it before the sitting absent from the chamber as he is absent now. He built his objection to the proposal that there should be the right of appeal on the false premises that the members of the board will be experts. The bill contains no provisions setting out who shall be members of the board. Clause5 under which the board is to be set up merely statesThe Governor General may enter into an arrangement with the Governor of the State for the constitution, subject to this act, of an authority which shall be known as the Joint Coal Board. But the hill says nothing about the proposed membership of the board. Memshould not have risen again on this bers of -the board might be experts or clause but for the need to reply to the they might not be experts.

T cannot be accused of miners' federation, Mr Wells. munist ? course he is. That is probably why he is given so much consideration by the Ministry. Operating a coal mine is not such a lucrative business as honourable members opposite would have us believe. Many of the mines are losing money. Who would invest in a coal mine to-day? It is a lucky mine that earns 3 per cent. Coal mines are one of the worse investments. The amendment is perfectly reasonable. The Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill set out that seven members of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Board were to be representative of. the wheat-growers. If it ""was reasonable be given industrial tribunals for that legislation to specify the membership of the board set up under it, although its decisions -are to be subject to the Russian idea of veto by the chairman, it should be good enough for this legislation to set out the membership of the proposed Joint Coal Board. The Minister is relying on the fact that that Government might be changed. Many things change. The Minister himself changed, for he first stood as a Liberal candidate in a plebiscite. Then he stood against the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in Victoria as the endorsedCountry party candiwas suspended. He was date. He has "" ratted "" on three parties. His statements cannot, be relied on. He criticizes us because we want to ensure that a section of the community that is entitled to protection shall have it, whereas the Minister has made it possible for the board to consist of three Communists. I made only a few brief remarks before dinner, because I regarded the amendment as so reasonable that I expected it to be accepted without ado, but the Minister is not big enough to accept any amendment from this side.

205,Mr James (Hunter) [10.21],"!in the manner that he attacked me when he accused me of "" running round at the expense of the country as a liaison officer who has never improved coal production "". I deny the honourable member's statement. If he would attend the sittings of this House a little more frequently instead of accepting briefs to defend people hostile to this country he might be aware. of what is happening in the Parliament. The gentleman hostile to this country whom the honourable member defended fraternized in Germany with the late Hitler and on his return to Australia said what a good person Hitler was.

It is apparent that the amendment is designed to justify the right of the coal-owners to exploit this country. The amendment would free the owners to fix any price they like for coal. That is what happened during the first World War. Prices on other commodities soared when the price of coal was unchecked. The report by Mr £3,947,695 to £6,337,309. Therefore, Justice Davidson on the coal-mining industry recommended improved methods of mechanization of the coal mines and this bill is designed to give effect to that proposal. Mechanization increases production, but my experience is that miners who prior to mechanization were earning £2 a day were told that they had to operate the mechanical unit for 33s. a day or less. That meant an immediate reduction of their wages. They naturally ' resent losing money in operating a mechanical device which gives a greater output per man, about 30 tons of coal a day as against 10 tons. The increased output should -benefit the nation, but mechanical production does not result in cheaper coal. The coal-user still has to pay as much for mechanically filled coal. as he had to pay for coal won at a greater cost under the old method. The only firm who benefits' from mechanization. is the owner of the machinery. Why should not the country benefit from coal produced'more cheaply and in greater quantities because of mechanization? If the miners were assured that mechanical units would not put them out of work but would enable them to earn the same money as they earned before, they would welcome mechanization. I am pleased that the Minister has refused to accept the amendment. I am confident that the committee will reject it. --Had it not been for the figures given by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) I would not have spoken. The honourable gentleman spoke about the extraordinary amount of coal that can be mined by mechanical units. l i e said that coal production has increased to a remarkable degree, but 'that the same price was being paid by the purchaser. Either the honourable member does not know the economics of the coal mining industry, or he is seeking deliberately to mislead the House. Between 1940 and 1944 the coal output per man day decreased from 3.40 tons to 3.09 tons. Those figures entirely disprove the statements of the honourable member for Hunter. During the same period, salaries and wages rose from whilst production per man day declined, salaries and wages increased. Obviously, the honourable member for Hunter was sadly astray in his knowledge of the economics of the industry. Questionp u t That the words proposed to be inserted inserted.

216,Sir Frederick Stewart (Parra,"himself of the opportunity to blame the colliery proprietors for the present conditions of labour in the pits. If the honourable gentleman lived nearer to the centre of things in New South Wales, he would know that his statement was unjust. Eecently, the use of modern plant, which had been in operation in a south coast mine for some years, had to be discontinued because the miners refused to operate it . Either wittingl y or otherwise, the' honourable member for Fremantle acted unjustly in placing the blame for the non-modernization of the industry on the owners. He mentioned also that one of the functions of the board would be to recruit personnel for the industry, and establish sound industrial welfare practices, including the provision of amenities for miners. If those were the only purposes of clause 13, honourable' members would not have discussed them at such length. Unfortunately, the clause deals with other subjects. For example, paragraph g of sub-clause 3 provides that the board shall have authorityTo acquire any coal mine and to operate any mine acquired by or vested in it. This is not a new power, for it has been in the possession of the Goal Commissioner for a long time, but it has not brought harmony into the industry. Last week .31 mines were idle in New South Wales, and even to-day eight are idleI n spite of this, we are expected to believe that by vesting this power in the new Joint Coal Board we shall revolutionize the industry. The new board is to be given authority to control or acquire mines, and to do the many other things specified in the clause, but the authority already in has similar power, the exercise of which has not solved the problems of the industry.' Coalcliff colliery has been under control for a long time, but we know that for many months there has been a serious loss of production in the mine. The mine at Wonthaggi, in Victoria, also has been operated by the State Government at a loss of many thousands of pounds a year for a long while. The losses have cost the taxpayers of Victoria, in the aggregate, about £1,250,000. The State mine at Lithgow, in the electorate of the Prime Minister, has also been the subject of adverse comment. The Prime Minister himself has said that it tells a sad and sorry story of State control. Surely honourable members must recognize the f u t i l it y of this method of attempting -to solve the problems of the industry. I ask the Minister to explain what will happen if the coal-miners refuse to work under this legislation. I read in to-day's newspapers that the miners are holding a meeting to determine their attitude. What w ill happen if they decide that they will not abide by the law? We have to recognize that these men have defied the regulations issued by the Government in the past, they have summarily rejected instructions issued to them by the Prime Minister, and they have challenged every move that has been made to control the industry. If the miners of New South. Wales refuse to be guided by this legislation what new appeasement policy does the Commonwealth Government, acting in ""collaboration with the New South Wales Labour Government^ intend to adopt? BecauseI consider that nothing whatever w ill be gained by the passage of this measure, I oppose it . Clause agreed to. Clause 14(3.) If the Board after receipt of the report is of opinion tliat the safety of employees at the coal mine is, or is not, or is or is not likely to be, endangered by all or any of the matters referred to in sub-section (1.) of this section; it is to have, power, by order, to direct the owner of the coal mine and any other person to. do or refrain from doing all such matters or things in relation to the operation of coal-mines as are specified in the order: Provided that no such order shall derogate from any provisions of the law of the State prescribing requirements to be observed for securing the safety of persons engaged in or existence about coal-mines. I ask the Minister to explain the meaning of this clause. Sub-clause 1 provides that when any question arises at.a coal mine as to whether the safety of appliances is endangered or is likely to be endangered by any methods of working then in operation or proposed to be put in operation, the hoard is to have power to refer the question to an inspector of coal mines in New South Wales, and to an officer of the board w it h a request that the matter be at once considered and reported upon. Sub-clause 2",62,Chairman Mb W J F World War Ii The Coal Miners Of Queens
217,Mr Spender (Warringah) [10.50].,"provides that when any such question has been referred to an inspector or to an officer of the.board, an inspection is to be made at once and a report .prepared. Sub-clause 3 provides that if the board, after the receipt of a report, is of opinion that the safety of employees is, or is not likely to be, endangered it is to have power to direct the owner of the coal-mine and any other person to do, or refrain from doing, certain things; but there are two important provisoes. The first is that no such order shall derogate from the provisions of the law of the State, prescribing requirements to be observed for securing the safety of the persons engaged in the mine. The second is contained in clause 17 which provides that the board shall, as and when required by the Prime Minister or the Premier of the State, furnish reports with respect to the policy it is pursuing and the Prime Minister may, in agreement with the Premier of the State, issue directions to the board' on matters of policy, and it is to be the duty of the board to observe and carry out any direction so given. This is surely an sxtraordinary .situation. The clause is intended to insure safety in coal-mines, out orders or directions that are. made in this connection may not derogate from the law of the State, and, in any case, the Prime Minister is given ' power under another clause to issue directions irrespective of the nature of any reports that have been furnished. What thenis the real value of this clause? Minister for Mines in New South Wales, Mr Baddeley, has prevented the extraction of coal in pillars on the ground that it endangers the safety of the men, and this has considerably reduced the volume of coal extraction. In the opinion of Mi-. Justice Davidsons the extraction of coal in pillars does not endanger the safety of the men. This is shown by the following observations of His Honour:Owing to departmental policy and industrial pressure, pillars have been left standing too long in many of the mines in New South Wales, and much of the coal will in all probability be lost. If this coal be not lost, it will be extractable only at very heavy cost. Crown leases require extraction of as large a percentage of coal as is consistent safety, questions as to the quantities Mr Spender. unworked being determinable by the Minister, and mining engineers support with strong: evidence claims that under the policy enforced they have been compelled against their will by departmental directions and industrial pressure to adopt bad mining practices which have resulted in the total loss of large quantities of pillar and top coal. Miners are opposed to' early, extraction of pillars by mechanical means for the reason that .as they formed them by hand work in the solid workings, they should have thebunelits of the easier task of taking them down when crushed in process of time. For the same reason there is opposition to rapid extraction so that the lighter and more profitable task may last longer. These views have led to restrictions upon the number of pairs of men employed in manual work extraction of a pillar. As a result, the desired attainment of maximum speed of extraction is impossible; the speed more closely approximates to the minimum. Pillars containing millions of tons of coal have also been left standing for many years in the mines in Western Australia and Queensland. In the intersts of the Commonwealth a strong controlling authority should be appointed with powers, amongst others, to take some measures for the prevention of these practices in order to save irreparable losses of valuable fuel which must otherwise ensue. In spite of these observations by Mr Justice Davidson, the Minister for Mines in New South Wales is to continue to > have authority to enforce his prohibition against pillar extraction, which has militated against the maximum extraction of coal. It seems thai the Prime Minister is to have an over-riding authority. That appears to me to be altogether wrong. Certain For a long time the authority is to be given to the Joint Coal Board, but it is expressly limited by the proviso in sub-clause 3 and by the provisions of clause 17. I ask the . Minister whether these provisions'are not inconsistent with *he recommendations of Mr Justice Davidson. . If the honourable gentleman says that they are not inconsistent, will he explain the grounds on which he bases his opinion?

To that degree, the employer will be prevented from insuring with companieswith which he has insured in the past. Clause agreed to. Clauses 16 and 17 agreed to. Clause 18 (No industrial conscription). --The clause readsNothing in this act shall be deemed to authorize any form of industrial conscription. We have heard a great deal about the disciplinary powers which the hill will confer upon, the board, and of how the board will,in effect, implement the recommendations of Mr Justice Davidson so as to restore some semblance of order to this chaotic industry. The only power in relation to discipline is contained in paragraph k of sub-clause -3, of clause 13, which gives to the board the authorityXo suspend, or exclude from employment in scribed, any superintendent, manager or other person employed in tlie industry who acts in a manner prejudicial to the effective working of the industry. That is the only specific power. There establish workers' compensation may be general powers, but if they exist they are not discoverable. Since' the Government desires to impose the authority of law on the coal industry-so it is said-the Minister should explain the meaning of the clause. Political phrases are used, and at some time or other they niust be given legal signification. I understand conscription to be compulsory enrolment or directions to a body of people. It is usually spoken of when force is applied to compel a person as one of a anything; for example, if a person is",65,Chairman Mb W J F World War Ii The Coal Miners Of Queens

I should like to know from the Minister whether this provision will prohibit any authority under the act from being exercised so as to prevent persons from leaving work, or to compel them to return to work. I know that physically they cannot be compelled to do anything, t am speaking of an order directing them to return to work. If employees were directed to return to work, and having failed to comply with the order, were subject to the sanction of punishment, would that be industrial conscription? t f it would be,. what real disciplinary powers are being conferred? Iff may be that the interpretation would not go so far as that; but it is possible that it would. The matter is arguable. should like to know what the clause really means. In particular, if men leave work and refuse to return to it under an order of the court, can they be punished-for their refusal, having regard to the provisions of this clause?

The power to exert pressure on workers to continue to work regularly is provided in another clause. For instance, the board is to have power to exclude any person from working in the industry, and presumably one of the reasons for doing so would be that he had failed to work regularly, or had persistently absented himself for long periods from his work without proper cause.

239,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [11.26],"Thisproposed to 'apply in the settlement -of industrial disputes. The first was that there should be available an expert, competent and impartial body to deal with disputes as they arose; the second was that there should be no interference by the Government with decisions given; and the .third, was that the Government would back up with its full authority the decisions of tribunals once they were given. In accordance with those principles we created the central reference board and the local reference boards. There was some criticism at that time of our action in establishing separate tribunals for the coal industry, and I believe that there was substance in that criticism. We have tended to' over-emphasize the separateness of the coal industry, and to isolate it from the rest of the community. That is partly due to the prominence'which the industry has assumed in political discussion, and to the importance of maintaining the production of coal. ""Whatever the rights or wrongs may have been, we did respond to the request that there should be available in the various districts tribunals which could deal promptly and impartially with disputes that might arise on the spot, and which might not be conveniently brought before the Arbitration Court. At the same time, we were aware of the dangerof departing from the principle of control by the court. ""We. knew, also, that determinations in the coal industry might affect other industries where similar conditions prevailed. Therefore, we were careful to retain as chairman of the coal reference board a judge of the Arbitration Court. ""We then placed in control of the local reference boards men with some practical experience in the industry. Two were actually officers or former officers of the miners' federation, and another, Mr Connell, was at the time a foreman, or supervisor in one of the mines, and, accordingly, a man of practical experience. Mr Justice Davidson criticized the appointment of persons directly connected with the industry. I do not agree with that criticism. I incline to the view expressed by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) that direct knowledge of and participation in a particular industry should not automatically disqualify a man, or render him incapable of performing a quasi judicial function in the post to which he is appointed. The Prime Minister mentioned Judge Drake-Brockman, who carried out his functions successfully and inspired confidence in those .who came' under his official jurisdiction. That tribute to the work of Judge Drake-Brockman was confirmed by the coal-miners themselves when they stipulated that he should preside oveT .the Central Reference Board. ""We had v the machinery established-the link with the Arbitration Court through the chairmanship of the judge, the'direct experience of the men forming the district reference board, and the ready access of miner and owner to the local board. In the scheme which we laid down we were careful to ensure that the operations of the local boards should be confined to local and domestic matters. We provided that where a matter was deemed to extend beyond the particular area, a decision on which might have had repercussions in other areas or on other indus1 tries, the matter should be dealt with by the Central Reference Board. I mention those facts because the Labour Government which succeeded us departed from the principles that we established in a way which, I believe, caused many of the subsequent difficulties in the industry. The power of the Central Reference Board was restricted, and the scope of the local boards was extended. The regulations which we drafted were put into operation in February, 1941. In December, 1941, the Curtin Government, by an amendment of the regulations, introduced for the first time the practice of the Minister intervening in these industrial matters. We know what subsequent havoc was caused by that practice. Those who. were parties to a dispute, on finding they, could not get the decision that they wanted from the local tribunal or the Central Reference Board, went to the Minister in the hope of getting it from him. Later, in 1943., there was a more serious development which so weakened the authority of the Coal Tribunal that the Government has had to revert to the arrangement set out in this clause. The chairmanship of the Central Reference Board was taken out of the hands of the Arbitration Court judge and placed in the hands of an authority who had no professional training or experience. The subsequent history of the central coal authority made inevitable the reversion to the chairmanship' of a more qualified man, .as is proposed in this clause. 1 mention these facts because Mr Justice Davidson has been critical of the way in which these boards have operated. I believethey were never given a fair test On the principles which we laid down in the original regulation. The' first step in the' weakening of the boards by the introduction of the Minister into the scheme, and later the disastrous step of taking the chairmanship out of the hands of a qualified judicial authority, considerably weakened the operation of the boards. Mr Justice Davidson commented that a dangerous drift from the principles of compulsory industrial conciliation and arbitration which the Australian people have supported for many years, developed during the war towards a departure from the basic requirement of disinterested, independent and highly qualified referees, and limiting the right of appeal from minor tribunals In our regulations we gave the right of appeal from minor tribunals, but the Labour Government eliminated that right of appeal and a great deal of confusion developed as the result. Mr Justice Davidson then pointed out that the ministerial duties performed by tribunals in making and interpreting awards are more important and far-reaching than the purely judicial duties of imposing and enforcing penalties under the acts, in view of the heavy bur-' dens, financial and otherwise, such awards and interpretations may cast upon the industry and upon consumers. He advanced the case in favour of having a judicial authority able to supervise the conduct of these boards and to give the kind of determinations one would expect from a judicial officer on matters that came before him. He pin-pointed what we believe to be the most serious weakness of all when he saidThe principal defect in the Arbitration syswhich should have equal application to tem lies not within itself hut in the failure of both. That is why it becomes imperative the Governments to support the decisions of the Tribunals and to enforce the penalties that there should be liaison between against strikes and lock-outs. Later he elaborated that statement and I Court, so that in dealing with matters regard his words as of such importance that come before them individually they as to justify their inclusion in Hansard. may ensure that the greatest uniformity He saidReliance upon the sanctity of agreements dustry. I believe it is a mistake to disand upon the efficacy of the law can only exist sociate a judge who is to preside over the Mr Holt. when it is beyond doubt that the law will be allowed to take an unimpeded course to safeguard the rights of all parties. Reasons have been stated at length in earlier chapters of this Report to support the conclusion that a long-term agreement between associations of colliery proprietors and the unions would be a futility with the present industrial relationship on the coal-fields and it has been made equally clear tlie flouting of awards .and orders of-legal tribunals is an every day occurrence with strikes and stoppages of production as a concomitant. This state of affairs can never be rectified whilst unions can rush to Federal and State Ministers with every grievance of disappointed litigants. Confidence would be quickly restored if the Government would decisively affirm, without qualification, and support unreservedly the rulings of their Courts. I believe that sums up without any further argument on my part the principles which should be adopted in this matter. It concerns the policy which we as a Government applied. In no instance did we override the decisions of . the tribunals. ""We established them and backed them up with' all the authority we could, and supported their decisions. I believe that-if the present Government reverts to the practice of having a qualified judicial officer in control it will do much to eliminate the present defects. The honourable member's time has expired. gentleman has risen I shall take my second period now. ""WhilstI commend the return to the practice of haying a judge as chairman of the central authority I regret that the Government has not taken the logical further step of making the appointee a judge of the Arbitration Court. It is important to have uniformity in questions, of industrial principle. Those who have experience of industrial disputes know there is no more potent cause of friction than the feeling in' one industry that some other industry had been granted a concession different members of the Arbitration is maintained through all sections of in-",68,Paktiv Control Oj Coal Mines

If we establish a central tribunal over which a judge w ill preside, a limitation should not be placed upon the capacity of the tribunal to deal with any matter, even a local matter. In the main, it w ill permit local matters to be dealt with by the local board, but, occasionally, a matter might arise which, although ' it appears to be local, contains such an important question of principle that the central board decides to deal with it The amendment w ill remove the limitation on the capacity of the central authority, strengthen it , and avoid the danger of the determinations to which I have referred spreading to other industries.

It should perhaps be mads clear to tbe honourable member that the import quotas for(a) newsprint for the production of daily, Sunday arid weekly newspapers; and those for It) newsprint for books, periodicals, job and general printing and for the manufacturing of stationery, are kept separate, and importation is effected through different channels. Tlie use of newsprint for the production of newspapers is still subject to theprovisions of the National Security (Metal Foil and Paper) Regulations and those provisions are being enforced. They do not, however, go so far as to lay down a policy as to the matter which a newspaper proprietor shall or shall not publish with the newsprint available to him under hie quota allocation for the production of his newspaper. Because' of the world shortage of newsprint the supply position in the quota for the production of newspapers is difficult and it is necessary to conthe company to continue in iitll production tinue rationing' of its use for such purposes. As the honourable member has previously been advised, the control which, formerly applied under the regulations to the use of paper in the production of books, periodicals and stationery and for 'job and general printing, was removed as from 1st March, 1340, and the indications arc that the quota of newsprint for these purposes is sufficient for 'requirements.' Furthermore, following'the cessation or hostilities, printing paper of a quality better than newsprint is becoming available for the production of books and periodicals. Some merchants holding stocks of newsprint in the quota for tbe production of books and periodicals claim to bo. overstocked and have been pressing for permission to export some of their stocks. This development has been countered by the imposition of an export prohibition. honourable' member for Robertson ( Mr Williams) asked a question concerning the importation of tinned, plate from. the United States of America. The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following-information:No import lioences have been issued for the importation of tinned plate from the United. States of America. The only tinned plate being procured from this source isunder Government Cash Purchase and is being distributed in Australia under the control of the Tinned Plate Board. Furthermore, no import licences for tinned plute from any sources have been issued except those approved and sponsored by the board: for the adjournment of the House on the 30th July, the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) made representations concerning the use of tinned plate . by GartsideBrothers. The Minister for Supply and Shipping has supplied the following information:Because of the acute position in relation to tlie supply of tinned plate it has been necessary to reintroduce the control over its end nse with tbe object of ensuring that tinned plate is used in tlie most economical manner and not for the canning of any goods for which alternative containers, not using tinned plate,, could be secured; Tlie restrictions arc similar to those which operated during the war and they provide for the elimination of the smaller type of containers in certain instanceswhera 'these represent a wasteful use of tinned plate. In the case of Gaitside Brothers at Dingley. however, when it became apparent that this firm' would havo difficulty in changing over immediately, steps were taken to arrange for untilsuch time as the change-over could be effected, thus ensuring that no dislocation of tbe activities of tbe compauy would be caused: honourable member for Swan( Mr. Mountjoy) asked a question concerning statements by M i .'

The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following information:No information is available concerning New Zealand costs and prices, but it can be said that Mr Mortimer's detailed figures regarding the make-up of the Australian wholesale price are incorrect. The only payments to Consolidated Revenuefrom petrol are collection* resulting from duties imposed by Parliament. There is no truth in the suggestion that an amount of £2,000,000 OT any other sum is being collected on petrol by an irregular inflation of tbo wholesale price.
