19,Mr Deakin,"The answer to the honmade to the Premiers of the other States by the Premier of Tasmania, and not by this Government. The following memorandum summarises the correspondence in the possession of this Government, but I desire to add that, as the matter is regarded of much importance, this Government is about to correspond with the State Governments, with the view of seeing whether thejr will undertake the necessary examinations1. On the 22nd November, 1906, the Premier, of Tasmania informed the Prime Minister that an investigation undertaken by the Chief Health Officer of that State into the' physical condition of 1,220 children attending State schools in Hobart had recentlv occupied the attention of his Government, and had resulted in the institution of a system of medical inspection of State schools. 2. The Premier, in intimating that the State Premiers had been requested by him to cooperate in a scheme of comparative physical observations of children attending State schools, mentioned that valuable assistance could be afforded by the Statistical Department, of the Commonwealth in the collation and interpretation of comparative results from different States if obtained on a uniform basis in the manner suggested in the letter to the States. The Premier asked whether, in the event of two or more States being prepared to submit comparative observations on a proportion of their State school children, the necessary comparisons and interpretations of results could be undertaken by the Commonwealth Statistical Department. 3. The Prime Minister, in writing to the Premier of Tasmania on the subject on the 14th January, expressed the sympathy of the Government in the direction of the improvement of the physical condition of the school children of Australia, but before arriving at any decision it was desired to know the result of the communications to the State Premiers. On the 27th March the Premier replied, stating that :New South Wales and Queensland regarded the proposal unfavourably; South Australia was willing to f a l l into line; Victoria required further information; and that West Australia required a draft of the proposals (which had been prepared). 4. On the' 6th May the Prime Minister informed the Premier that the Commonwealth Statistician would be prepared to undertake the statistical analysis for any State or States that make the investigation. 5. The Premier of Tasmania communicated with the Prime Minister on the 15th May, suggesting that the Prime Minister of New Zealand be asked whether that colony would be willing to come into line with any of the Australian States deciding to take part in the investigation, and that in that event the Commonwealth Statistician should also deal with the New Zealand observations. Particulars of the system were enclosed. 6. On the 6th June, the Prime Minister, in penditure of officers in their districts, the inreplying, stated that it was considered that structions re as many of the States of the Commonwealth as possible should be brought into line in the matter before approaching the New Zealand authorities. General, upon noticeWill he obtain a copy of the cpntract recently entered into by the Imperial Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for the conveyance of mails from Great Britain to India.

No request was made in such wire for a return as lo offices undermanned, but in March last the then Acting Senior Inspector, in order to ascertain what additional staff should be provided on the draft Estimates then under preparation, asked Postmasters in the Metropolitan district whethertheir staffs were inadequate, and if so to state what additional staff would be required and the reasons there for, having due regard to economy 'Following upon a special report by the accountant as to the excessive rate of expenditure on the vote for temporary assistance, the postmasters were informed, on the 21st instant, that the expenditure on the item was far too large, and that special endeavours must at once be made to reduce it, and they were requested to take action to curtail such expenditure and informed that they would be held personally responsible for any unnecessary temporary assistance found to be or to have been engaged at their offices. District inspectors were informed on the 19th idem of the position of the Temporary Assistance Vote, and instructed that when visiting offices, or at any otlier opportunity, they are to inauire closelv into the question generally of "" Temporary Assistance"" employed at offices in their district^, and if any unnecessary use is found to be or to have been made of such assistance to report such with any recommendation in regard thereto. 2.

If , however, there .has been any delay, I think that the honourable member for Hunter, who is smiling at my remark, has contributed his share towards it. On 'the 8th August, the Tariff was laid on the Table, and the Budget delivered. The debate was postponed at the request of honourable members opposite until the 21st August, when it was resumed, and it ended on the 13th September. Honourable members can easily covered not only the Tariff, but also the Budget. I have not complained, nor do I complain now, of the fact that it extended to a period of three weeks.

Honourable members know that if the Works Estimates fact that a duty has been imposed on had not been introduced and passed before tinned kerosene only, it is an unfair charge. the completion of the Tariff, all the works The object of that duty is to insure that and buildings bf the Commonwealth would the oil shall be tinned in the Commonhave been suspended.

The bulk oil is allowed to come very good answer to those who seem to in free, and therefore the increased price think that there has been undue delav. on the tinned oil up to the present time is From the very first I said that there were unfair to the community. I "" think I may certain measures which the Government in say that all or nearly all the oil which has tended to take prior to the consideration been! sold since the introduction of the of the Tariff. the consideration of those measures which have passed through the Chamber did not so in Brisbane. occupy much time. Works Estimates commenced on the 14th the oil in tins, and naturally the retailers and terminated on the 25th September, charge the duty. so that it cannot be said that in that regard there has been undue delay. We have now the retailers have charged more for keroarrived at the stage when we can consider sene, but the increased charge has been the Tariff in detail. As I have said more unfair, because no duty has been paid reference to the amendment of anti-trust I do not think it legislation, such as the one to which the Prime Minister has referred to-day, it may . be necessary to ask honourable It is not my members to deal at once with that business. munity, and undue charges are made to all The honourable gentleman classes of purchasers.

I understand that in many cases an extra price has been charged for tea. There is a duty only on tea in packets of under 20 lbs., but no duty on chest tea. The object of the packet duty is simply to insure that the tea, instead of being packed in China, Ceylon, and other places, shall be packed in Australia, and that, if necessary, its quality shall be inspected. has been resorted to in the case of tobacco, too. Sir WILLIAM LYNE doubt of that. shortly reach the consideration of the item of tobacco, seeing that it is second on the list, after spirits; and I hope that we shall deal with it in such a way as to prevent the imposition of any' further extra charge on the community. While the public may have suffered in some directions, fhe time has now arrived when they are to receive consideration, and wljen any undue extra charge, which may have been made since the imposition of the Tariff, will be stopped. I do not desire to deal with individual itemsI do not think it wise to do so-thoug h there are some which stand out rather prominently, and will doubtless require amendment. Anomalies will occur in every Tariff. For instance, chairs have been mentioned as one item out of a large number, and then there is wire netting, together with a variety of other items. But the Government must conduct their business in regard to the Tariff in a certain way, which, I hope, will recommend itself to the Committee. We cannot afford to jump from one item to another, with a view of selecting any particular commodity for special treatment, because, if that were done, there would be great complaints from those interested in other items not so favourably considered. It is the desire of the Government, therefore, to, as far as possible, deal with the items in the order in which they are presented. The Tariff Commission sat a long time and did much arduous work. ledgment has not been made. Sir WILLIAM LYNE acknowledged the work done by the Tariff Commission, and I again acknowledge of the considerations which occurred to me it. The members of that Commission work; but I do not care how earnestly or faithfull y a Commission of this kind In some cases perform their duties, it is utterly impossible for them to formulate a Tariff which will absolutely meet the wishes of the Government or of Parliament. The Tariff Commission, who were appointed at the instance-of the leader of'the Opposition, was not given power to formulate a Tariff. Sir WILLIAM LYNE In the mind of the leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister, and in the minds of most The same sharppractice others concerned, the duty of the Commission was to investigate and ascertain anomalies in the Tariff-to find where the I have no Tariff was weak, in so far as it was not I hope we shall very high enough or low enough, and then report through the proper channel, leaving it to the .Government, as representing the Commonwealth and this Parliament, to submit to the House what they conceive to be a proper Tariff. That has been done. I repeat that it is quite a mistake to imagine that the Commission were asked to frame a Tariff though they did partially frame or attempted to partially frame one. framed a series of suggestions only. call them suggestions, though I have never heard that view put before byany member of the Tariff Commission. I take it that it was the duty of the Government to accept as many suggestions as they deemed advisable, and then, if they desired, to vary or alter the suggested duties, that was their responsibility. In one or two cases, the Commission recommended preference, but not to the extent the Government desired ; arid, therefore, the Government have extended the preference as shown in the Tariff submitted to honourable members. In recognising the time and thought devoted by the Tariff Commission to their duties, I am not referring particularly to one section or other of the Commission; T give both sections A and B every credit for doing what they thought to .be right. But the duty of the Government was to consider the recommendations of the Commission, and to submit such a Tariff as they thought the circumstances demanded. Of which sufficient acknowI have a document in my hand which shows that the recommendations of section A of I have alreadv the Tariff Commission have been followed by the Government in 329 cases. I regard that as a very large proportion, in view",18,Tariff

Sir WILLIAM LYNE to ruffle the tempers of the Opposition. We have commenced well, and I hope that the harmony of the proceedings will not be disturbed. Mr 'REID -The honourable gentleman is talking of the old protection. W ill he tell us of the new? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I intend to do so: but surelv I am entitled to make a few prefatory remarks. There are in the Tariff a number of anomalies with which we shall deal when we reach the items to which they relate. But as one who has been a protectionist throughout his political life I do not intend to speak of protection with bated breath. I am not going to talk of a so-called protection which means no protection at all. When we have such an opportunity as now presents itself to deal with the fiscal policy I think that we should speak our minds in regard to it, and that we should frame a Tariff which will represent not a half-and-half class of protection such as we have had, but genuine sturdy protection. That is the object I have in view, and I shall do all that I can to secure a Tariff that will afford protection to our industries. I do not intend to favour a mere revenue Tariff, and I trust that those who have been returned to this House as protectionists will not be satisfied with such a Tariff. Let them now declare themselves; let them say at once that they are either protectionists or free traders, and not be prepared as protectionists to drag clown the scale of duties to a point at which we should have a mere revenue Tariff which is only incidentally protective. young and true Australians to remain as in the past in the employ of importers and indent agents with their feet under the legs of the foreigner's table.

The woman who, having a family of boys and girls, is prepared to let them cling to the money of the importers rather than to make an effort I hope that the to increase the field of labour in Australia is not a true mother, and the man or woman who is prepared to rest content under the old order of things is not a true Australian. these mock heroics.

I desire honourable members to understand that I have given these figures to show what the total amount of taxation comes to, and to prove that this is a protective Tariff, whilst the other was not.

But in all instances in which the Tariff operated, with a limited number of subjects. That as an incentive to production, the prices of. those goods six months later were less than those charged a week prior to that Tariff being introduced. lower than the""Victorian Tariff had been for twenty years, so that the Treasurer's statement is an argument in favour of a lower Tariff. generally of the goods affected by the Tariff. which the Treasurer has enumerated are made in Victoria.

133,Mr Tudor,"I hope the Governmentmanufacturers, to give increased employment to our people, and to strengthen and build up the Australian sentiment, we must not forget the motive power of all our industries, viz., the working man. Chamber have always said that. Sir WILLIAM LYNE that. I must have been very deaf or very dull not to have heard from honourable members opposite such proposals as the Government are now going to submit. those who hold such principles as we do have said that the interests of the workers ought to be considered. Sir WILLIAM LYNE take to say that if it had not been for the appearance in this Parliament of men who are especially representative of the working classes, we should not have heard very much about it Sir WILLIAM LYNE side. The right honourable the leader of the Opposition wishes to make a little joke at my expense, but I think that the Acts which I have been' instrumental in passing, not only in the Commonwealth Parliament, but in the State from which I come, have always been in the direction of helping the labouring people. When the right honourable member had an opportunity he did not pass the Acts which I passed afterwards. So that he cannot cast upon, me any slur regarding my not having dealt with this question earlier. man never thought of it before. Sir WILLIAM LYNE Probably the honourable member has not heard of a great many Acts that I was instrumental in passing in New South Wales, but it is true that I was responsible for them all the same. years since the honourable gentleman said that he would not go in for direct taxation in New South Wales. Sir WILLIAM LYNE for it to-day if it were necessary. If we .are going to have protection for the manufacturers and protection for the producers, we must have a system of protection for the labouring classes. As I have pointed out, it has been very difficult to institute a system of that 'kind which shall not be too cumbersome. We have aimed, in the proposals I am about to submit, at devising a .system which will be effective; and which, at the same time is the least cumbersome system we have been able to discover. The method by which it is. proposed to secure that manufacturers whose manufactures are protected by the new Tariff, shall only enjoy that advantage on condition that they pay a fair rate of wages, is, in outline, as I do not know f o l l o w s : ( i ) An Excise duty at the rate of half the duty imposed by the Tariff on imported goods of the same class, to be imposed on all goods manufactured in Australia. (2) An exemption to be made as to all goods which are manufactured under conditions .as to .remuneration of labour which are fair alnd reasonable. As this scheme involves the imposition of taxaI will undertion, it can be more conveniently carried out by two Acts, one simply imposing the duties and giving, effect to .the exemptions, and the other providing the necessary machinery. This course is rendered necessary by section 5.5 of the Constitution, which provides thatF r o m the other Laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with anv other matter shall be of no effect. applv to the manufacturers only? ously the chief difficulty in this scheme is to determine what are fair conditions as to remuneration of labour. Some general. standard of fairness is ""required. It is proposed to adopt, with certain alterations, that standard which now enables a manufacturer to have the Commonwealth trade mark applied to his goods. Thus goods to which the Commonwealth trade mark is applied ' D id I not? will be exempt from the new Excise duties. thing about that Commonwealth trade mark before ! Sir WILLIAM LYNE If I can pick up suggestions anywhere which are useful COOK -It is not many for our purpose, I make use of them.

A t the present time the Commonwealth trade mark can be applied only with the authority of the Minister, to goods which have been manufactured under conditions as to remuneration of labour which either have been declared to be fair, and reasonable by resolutions of both Houses of the Parliament, or are in accordance with the award of a Commonwealth or State industrial tribunal or of a Wages Board, or are in accordance with an industrial agreement. So that at the present time, apart from the resolutions of both Houses, a manufacturer can obtain the right to use the Commonwealth trade mark only if he is working under an industrial award or agreement. It is proposed to bring into existence a new tribunal to be called the Board of Excise. will the Board consist? duty of the Board will be to inquire, on the application of manufacturers, into the conditions of remuneration in any protected industry, and to declare, if they so find, that these conditions are fair and reasonable.

The Board, to deThis authority will report to the Board, and the Board may act on its report. The reason for this provision is that cases for investigation may arise in small country towns, to reach which the Board might have to spend a great deal of time in travelling, and it is proposed that if there is a suitable person, such as a police magistrate, he may be given the work of gathering evidence, with the assistance of two experts.

Sir which will be originated in the Senate to-morrow, will do away with the trouble in connection with getting information.

BeforeI resume my seat, I desire to quote a few figures with reference to the Customs and Excise revenue collected in each State during September of .this year and the Tariff last year, and also during the quarter ending 30th September in those years.

There are no speculative imports now. are gorged with goods which would have come into the ordinary markets of commerce, but for fhe fact that merchants are hanging on to the bonded stocks until they know what the Tariff is to be. If reductions in the duties are made, importers do not get the benefit of those reductions, once the goods are out of bond. ordinary commerce is paralyzed except in so far as the absolute necessities of the people of Australia are concerned, the figures show the enormous burden not in theory-no t in argument of a fiscal character-bu t the enormous burden which is reand no practice! presented by 3,000,000 sovereigns a yeartaken out of the pockets of the people in have heard of such things in all political the four States of New South Wales, Vicparties; the policy of every political party toria, Queensland, and.

But there is the remarkable cirthis fiscal question. think, perfectly justified in taking this opit is one of the oldest, best discussed, and portunity to deliver the address to which we best fought issues of politics in countries have just listened; but, as I say, I shall not which have a high, state of civilization,' take up the time of the Committee at any this sort of new protection never seems, length, even on such vastly important subuntil now, to have been advocated, by any jects, because I feel the pressing necessity to get to the practicalwork which is before 000,000 on the twelve us. I hope that my friends will allow me, so far as they consistently can, to represent the general views held on this side, in the hope that we may, as soon as possible, get In New South to the vital, practical matter which concerns the business of the whole community. But I , naturally, must make one or two observations, not so much on the old protection as on the new protection. The Treasurer In Queensland the inis a living example of the old protection. He has lived politically on the old protection all his life, just as I might be fairly be said, in retort, to have lived on free. trade all my life. W ill the right honmember died on it ! expression in any offensive way. But the old protection has been the Treasurer's gospel, though he has not, perhaps, been able to understand it-ther e is no theory or inspiration in his case-as clearly as might some profound political economists. The honourable gentleman, However, has for many years been an earnest, whole-souled advocate of a protectionist policy. But, in the midst of all his enthusiasm and earnestness, this scheme of new protection never seems to have dawned on him. Has the honourable gentleman submitted this scheme to his friends in the Chamber of Manufacturers?

I feel sure that, whilst strenuously endeavouring to carry out our views, we shall, throughout, assist those who have more moderate views than Ministers in making the duties proposed less extravagant than we think them to be. Leaving that matter now to come to the scheme of the new protection, I wish to say again that, in my opinion, this policy is infinitely sounder 'than the old protection. have altogether disapproved of the policy of protection, and if the Opposition liad suggested any such theories as those now submitted to us, what would have been the position? We have pointed out over and over again where protection f a i l s ; that, labour its legitimate share of the benefits of its exactions from the great mass of the community, that share generally goes in other directions. credit for originating any scheme of this sort, but what I do say is that, if we, the free-traders, had at any time until the last year or two proposed such a scheme, we should have been branded as men who, under the guise of being interested in the welfare of the working classes, were endeavouring to destroy the policy of protection. This policy of the new protection, however, has come from a quarter which is not exposed to that suspicion. So far as I can see, the credit for the idea is one to which the Labour Party is legitimately entitled. person not associated with them who has that now? brought it prominently forward. object, I think, is a thoroughly sound one.

[140] member should allow himself the luxury of going on his own for a minute or two. the forbearance which my honourable friends of the Labour Party sometimes show towards one another. I give the Labour Parties of Australia the credit of this movement, if it be a good one. Its object is certainly a good one. What has evolved this new protectionist policy? What has led tens of thousands who have no expectation of direct benefit from this taxation to adopt such a policy at It would be ridiculous to the risk of losing by it? It has been, It would do us no credit, and first of all, a desire to encourage the growth of new industries as a means of employing labour. But the main 'argument which has enabled protection to prevail to the extent to which it has done is that if we are ever to have manufacturing industries .of our own. we must do something to equalize the conditions obtaining here and elsewhere, so that manufacturers in Australia can flourish under labour conI ditions which are congenial to Australia. The attempt to compete with labour in less fortunate conditions has been looked upon, and, I think, wisely, as hopeless, except in connection with the great natural industries of the country. So far as those industries are concerned, we can competeinstead of giving Australian night and day with all countries. The real strength of Australia has been derived,, not from the nourishment we obtain by living on one another, but from the glorious I cannot claim any strength which has come to this country from the development of the great natural riches and resources which we possess. That has been the true source of all the greatness of Australia, including even the greatness of our manufacturing industries. But since this new scheme is to be the basis of the protection to be granted, I think Parliament is absolutely justified in endeavouring to see that Australian manufacturers who ' reap the benefit. of Australian protection honestly give their employees Australian conditions and wages. It does not.

It is a matter which will be threshed out. will be declared. the majority are not. the object aimed at by this new protection has my thorough sympathy. There are two points in connection with it, however, which must be Carefully considered. The question as to fair and reasonable labour conditions is not a difficult one. It is not so difficult as is the question of prices, which involves many other conditions. Qualitv has a great deal to do with price. One manufacturer might ibe selling 30 per cent, below his neighbour, yet the higher-priced goods might represent more honest value to the consumer. These are troubles which I do not propose to dwell upon, since they are obvious. the outside standard. outside standard with which to make comparisons. through a distorted medium this proposal is that all those measures for the protection of industry which were passed with, desperate zeal, are within twelve months confessedly failures. The Australian Industries Preservation Bill was to destroy the enemies of fair dealing. Combines and trusts were to be crushed by that magnificent measure .; yet,-within twelve months of its passing, the Minister admits that it is defective in a most serious respect. I have never seen the Government make an honest attempt to bring it into operation. Then, again, let us glance at the operation of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. about twelve months ago, provided that from ist January, 1.907, certain Excise duties should be payable on all agricultural machinery specified in the schedule. From ist January last, under that Act, Excise has been due on every agricultural implement manufactured in Australia and included in the schedule, but has one penny of that Excise been collected? the manufacturers secured an exemption. in South Australia secured an exemption on the 4th June last. turers of Australia secured an exemption ? eral scope of the ..Act. We know what is the position when duties of Customs are imposed. From the very instant when a Customs duty is proposed, it has to be paid, and it is collected even before the Tariff itself has become law. Yet not t one penny has been collected in the way of Excise under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, although I dare say not one-twentieth of the manufacturers engaged in the industries to which it relates have been brought, or have had even a chance of being brought, within a determination of the Court. The whole thing is an abject failure. difficulty in the way of compelling them to paylook upon difficulty as an argument for stagnation. I am only pointing out that the result of the measure in question has been a little discouraging. Do honourable members remember the exact title of the Anti-Trust. Bill? The Australian Industries Preservation Bill! That is a beaur tiful rhetorical expression ; a sort of name which suggested that the moment the Act was passed fresh oxygen would be supplied to every industry in Australia. That supply has not yet come; so far we have had nothing but nitrogen. The policy enunciated by the Treasurer has only one delightful feature.

I merely wish to point out that, to my mind, the whole, of the basis upon which, these measures-includin g this project-rest , is a most insecure one from the constitutional point of view. cannot bring these questions before the High Court without a separate action. honourable friend knows, the question of our constitutional competency to' do things, whenever it does arise, is a very serious question. cannot bring a case before the High Court unless somebody has been injured by the particular Act complained of. a good deal of wisdom in that rule, because it is a very favorable condition for getting the best possible decision, that there should be people who have a personal and practical interest in fighting out the issue.. If Courts were required to give ex cathedra opinions, a Court might afterwards find, in the contest of a particular concrete case, that its previous opinion, given under less favorable conditions, was entirely wrong, and that previous decision might have been a source of misleading, to the prejudice of a very large number of people. On the whole, it is a wise provision that these questions should come up in the usual form. So long as no one objects to the Act, prima facie it is constitutional, and it may turn out to be constitutional in f a c t ; but I have in my mind the well established legal principle that "" What you have no power to do directly, you have no power to do indirectly."" That is a principle which would cut right into this question. We have no power directly to interfere with the wages conditions in any factory in Australia. On the contrary, the Constitution, in matters"" connected with industrial conditions the trade and commerce section. a final opinion, but I have a very strong suspicion that that power would not be held to authorize us to make, in the exercise of the taxing power, distinctions of the kind which will be made under this proposed legislation. are merely incidental to the taxing power, or, in any case, are insignificant? question. It would simply raise it in another form. legal maxim which the right honourable gentleman just stated. common-sense argument would be against the validity of such an Act. The proposal No doubt; but, as my is not intended for the purpose of carrying out a systemof Excise to the extent of one-half of the existing duties. That is not the object of the Act.

Sir PHILIPFYSH obviously based upon some principle which is not disclosed in the return. Sir granted that its statements were correct. Sir Treasurer pointed out, in effect,, that the return must be inaccurate because he has stated that our Tariff imposes an average duty of 17 per cent. duty levied upon importations from all over the world.

I rejoice with him that our States are not only showing so manifestly the benefit of good seasons, but are also showing that the Tariff is going to be a very large revenue producer. pied an important position as a member of the Opposition, I should be very much disposed to challenge the Government on the ground that the figures which have been placed before us in the financial statement do not disclose the true position of the Commonwealth under the new Tariff. Sir WILLIAM LYNE ment ? Sir PHILIPFYSH Sir member surely does not accuse the officials of cooking the figures? Because they are their figures, not mine.

I remember that when Sir George Turner delivered his Budget statement in connection with the introduction of whereas under the Tariff, as proposed, the course of a few yearsI think he said within five years-the normal revenue under it would be reduced to about ,£5,000/000. That statement was challenged at the time. Some of us thought that Sir George Turner's view of the Tariff, as preventing the importation of The Treasurer goods from abroad, and assisting in their manufacture in Australia, was unsound, and that it would not within five years operate to such an extenti as to build up factoriesas he expected.

In more than , one year since 1901 we have received an equivalent revenue return, though there was a falling-off in the year 1905-6. During the current yeai we may presume that there will be an increase of revenue due to the great prosperity of the country to which the Minister referred, of which all honourable members were glad to hear. But no allowance seems to have been made for that. Last year ad valorem duties were collected on imports valued at ,£18,900,000, and fixed duties on imports valued at £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , our dutiable imports amountinc in all to about ,£25,000,000, excluding stimulants and narcotics, and bullion and specie, while ,£15,000,000 of free goods were imported.

They w ill discover that this extra revenue is largely being collected from them. I have come to that conclusion as the result of experience, not only as an importer, but as Treasurer of Tasmania or* various occasions-in which position it was my duty to observe the incidence of taxation, to discover as nearly as possible what burdens were borne by the .working classes and what by the well-to-do. The proportion of the burdens of the masses to , those of the classes is very great. In his admirable book on the income tax, Leoni Levi published a diagram showing Teneriffe with its peak, 15,000 feet high, and its base submerged. That enormous base represented the masses in Great Britain whose incomes could not be taxed by reason of the fact that they f e l l below the exemption of £ 1 5 0 , while, as thc peak grew smaller and smaller, it indicated the numbers of those who paid the tax. I have followed out that idea on many occasions in Australia. I have found that in the case of anincome tax with an. exemption of ,£150, comparatively few of the masses could be taxed. It seems almost in credible that the number of persons in Australia who pay income tax with an exemption of .£150. do not represent z\ per cent, of the population.

Only one question of any real importance has been brought before Under the circumstances, I the Committee to-day. The Treasurer has told us nothing new in his references to the value of imports into Australia. The item "" straw,"" which he specially referred to, was very unimportant, as only some 3 cwt.

Sir JOHN FORREST that we should know at once Avhether the new Excise duties are to apply to the agricultural productions of the country. seems to me that the Treasurer is proposing to do only what was done seven or eight years -ago in Western Australia, and what has been already done in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, and that is, to provide that those engaged in manufacturing industries shall have an opportunity of having their wages regulated by an Arbitration Court. That has been the law in most parts of Australia for years. I did not gather that the proposals now made by the Treasurer will go any further than the law which now exists. I do not know that such provision has been made in Queensland or in Tasmania, but there is a law in South Australia! under which the wages in an industy can be regulated. Mr W. H . IRVINE -And other conditions of labour. mean wages, hours, and other conditions of labour -can at the present time be regulated in all the States, with the exception possibly of Queensland and Tasmania, and it therefore seems to me that there is no justification for all the noise that has been made about the new protection. I am not satisfied that it will confer any additional benefit on workers in the State from which I come, where the wages and conditions of labour are regulated by an Arbitration Court. strike over there. do not think that, but that was because the employees would not accept the decisions of the Arbitration Court.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE statement. member said, at all events, that I had done nothing. posal immediately before us, I think -that the scheme for regulating prices will be difficult to carry out. We all agree that some means should be devised to prevent the public from being victimized by combines or monopolies; but it seems to me that the regulation of prices is impossible. I could quite understand the appointment of a Board of Trade similar to that in operation in Great Britain which would control, to some extent, railways, and trade and. commerce generally, and report to Parliament in regard to any injustice suffered by the community in connection with those matters ; but an attempt by Parliament or a Board to fix the price of every item that is dutiable under the Tariff would be as impossible as it is unnecessary. cedure would destroy competition, and do away with the spirit of emulation and enterprise. to close quarters the Treasurer, who generally has a keen eye for the main chance, will .pursue this project to its ultimate conclusion. Tariff shall have a maximum price. I introduced that Sir WILLIAM LYNE I was careful to say that that was not so. Before Sir JOHN FORREST I rose for the purpose of obtaining your ruling, Mr Chairman, on the question I have stated, and I thought that it would be as well to avail myself of the opportunity to make a few general observations regarding the Government proposals, reserving mv right to deal more f u l l y with them when' I have had an opportunity to carefully study them. I was very glad to hear the honourable member say that it was not intended to apply If the Ministei the new protection to the agricultural and pastoral industries. If that stand be adopted, I am sure we shall view He thc Government proposals from a different stand-point from that which we should otherwise do. So long as these proposals are restricted to the manufacturers, who are controlled at present in New South Wales and Western Australia by Conciliation and that, until Arbitration Acts, and in Victoria and South Australia by Wages Boards, I do not think that they .will affect to any large extent either employers or employees. I have only I did not make that to say,, in conclusion, that I should like to know when the Minister proposes to proceed with ""the scheme of new protection outlined by him. member for Swan has inquired whether he would be in order in moving a certain amendment, of which he has given notice.

429,Mr Dugald Thomson,"The TreaProm my stand-point, I regard with some pleasure the proposed check on the too greedy requirements of some manufacturers to the injury of the community. I regard it also as undoubtedly just that, if manufacturers are going to get heavy protection because of the high prices they pay for labour, we ought to see that the reason they give for requiring that protection is substantiated by the payment of reasonable wages. I also agree that it is desirable in regard to trusts and combines, and the question of whether manufacturers are entitled to the benefit of duties if they are combining and charging excessive prices, that such matters should be dealt with, not by a Minister, and not in the first -place even by this Parliament, but by some independent Board. My only objection to a Board is on the ground of the increased expenditure, which we are piling up in connection with one thing and another in Commonwealth affairs. say that when a Minister has proposals ' bf this sort to make to Parliament, and when he asks Parliament to adopt certain provisions in a Tariff in view of them, he ought clearly to outline the proposals. The present slipshod method of doing business will not bring this Parliament into credit.' I have never known, in my experience, of any Parliament-and I have never read of any Parliament-passin g a -measure requiring some other measure to complete it , without knowing what were the provisions that were to appear in the -second measure. The Minister has said -that he cannot for the present say definitely whether agricultural or pastoral industries w ill be affected. He has said that the proconditions are observed. But that proposal posals of the Government will apply to all manufactures which are protected by the Tariff. Now, there are manufactures connected with agriculture and with pastoral pursuits. throughout Australia. There are heavy duties on imported wines. There is the butter industry, and there are many other rural industries. But we are quite in ignorance -as to whether they will be affected by the proposals of the Government. According to the Minister's statement, all manufactures that are protected by the Tariff will be affected. If so, will these rural industries -be affected ? Then he creates another difficulty. He says that the old Tariff was toot protective, but was a revenue Tariffthat it did not protect the industries of Australia. As he is proposing to interfere only with 'industries that are protected, does he mean that his proposals will interfere only with those industries that receive the benefit of raised duties under the new Tariff, or are the proposals to extend to all the industries of Australia producing articles dutiable as imports under the Tariff? We have had no explanation on that point. that or nothing. ister admits that many duties under the old Tariff were revenue duties. Some of « those duties are increased under the new Tariff, and some are not. Are only those which, in the Minister's opinion, are protective duties to be affected by the proposals of the Government, and is there to be some method of defining what is a protective duty? We have had no explanation on that point. Again, the Minister says that he proposes But I do' to impose an Excise duty wherever there is protection, and, if proper wages are paid, to remit the Excise. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did not' say that. ister said that the Excise proposals are to apply to all manufactures that are protected. which will be prepared and placed in ""the hands of the Board. to have that list. Surely when we are dealing with Customs duties we ought to know to what manufactures the Excise proposals are to apply. The proposal is that Excise duties will be remitted if certain satisf actory apparently does not apply to those very large and important items of manufacture in connection with which Excise duties are already imposed. What is to be done in The wine industry extends regard to the Excise duties which at present apply to beer, sugar, and a number of other commodities? Those questions show how imperfect is the information that we have. The Minister's proposal absolutely breaks down in connection with those large industries. Are they to be dealt with or . are they not? Are they to be a favoured exception, or are they to be brought under the scope of the new legislation ? We have no information on that point. The Minister has not explained a number of other matters.

That must be my I have opinion until the Treasurer gives us information showing it to be wrong. The benefits of the new protection are as illusive as many other Government promises have been, hut because it is promised, the Committee will agree to increased duties, and the cost of living will rise in Australia as it has risen in New Zealand. The Minister spoke of the New Zealand duties as being about 2 per cent, higher than ours, and it 1 is admitted that the cost of living has increased in New Zealand because of the Tariff. of living in New Zealand is due mainly to the increase in house rents, which has naturally followed an increase in general prosperitv.

It is not proposed to give the benefit to by far the larger proportion of the working classes, and where' it is -intended to give the benefit, it is merely nominala placard to induce the people to put up with these extraordinary duties. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [8.26] I am .in a most peculiar position, and one in which I think that very few honourable members are placed, in that during the electoral campaign I was not asked a single '-question on the fiscal issue. I would not have risen to-night, had it not been that very considerable misrepresentation has taken, place in New South Wales. As I did not refer to the subject during the electoral campaign, I think it only fair that I should now make a statement which will enable my constituents to understand the attitude I take up generally. First of all, it has been urged in that State that the Labour Party is responsible for the introduction of this Tariff. I believe that a greater measure of responsibility for thereopening of the fiscal question, might be laid at the door of the leader of the Opposition, than at the door of the Labour Party. Mr J. H . CATTS -During the last Parliament, the leader of the Opposition formed a Coalition Government, which included some gentlemen of high protectionist and Sir George Turner-and later on, 1 when the reconsideration of the Tariff was pressed upon h'im, he recommended the Governor General to appoint a Tariff Commission, which most effectively re-opened the fiscal question. with' a view to rectifying anomalies. Mr J. H . CATTS -In the Sydney Daily Telegraph, of 24th October, 1906,the right honourable gentleman was reported in these termsformed on the basis of a fiscal truce, the LyneTsaacs wing of the Opposition sought to embarrass us by a -clamour for relief for the artisans -of Melbourne, who were alleged to be starving, ' and the industries of Melbourne, which were alleged to be ruined. . . . Our Government appointed a' Tariff Commission to inquire into .the work of the Tariff and its effect upon Aus'traliaa} industries. I courted the fullest investigation. I knew there might well be anomalies that called for redress and hardships that ought to be removed. . . . Mr Deakin did not object to the appointment of the Commission; indeed, I conferred with him as to its composition. The leader of the Opposition, therefore, was responsible for the appointment of the Tariff Commission, and he must have known that when its reports were presented to Parliament, the fiscal question would be most effectually re-opened. reads the terms of the Commission, he will see why that appointment was made. has also forgotten that the matter was forced upon the right honourable member by the Opposition corner, which included the honourable member for Hume, and the late member for Indi. "" Mr J. H . CATTS I admit that the position was forced upon the leader of the Opposition, but he was very ready to have .forced upon him any situation which would enable him to retain the office of Prime Minister. He recommended the appointment of the Tariff Commission because he thought that by that means he could stave off the evil day for a little while, and retain his place on the Treasury bench. sumption. Mr J. H . CATTS -That, I admit, is an assumption. proved by the way in which the right honourable gentleman left office. other side charged him then with committing political suicide. Mr J. H . CATTS -It is an assumption which, I admit, we are entitled to make from our stand-point. Later on the leader of the Opposition, knowing that .on his recommendation the Tariff Commission appointed had been appointed, appealed to the country, and said that the one supreme, issue before the electors was that of anti-Socialism. He invited free-traders and protectionists to join with him in dishing the Labour Party, and in following out that Shortly after the Coalition Government was idea he supported many protectionists throughout the Commonwealth. tionists respected it. set out to do : he put a spoke in the socialistic wheel.

CATTS -To-da y the Acting Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Swan, and others have engaged in a general discussion on the Tariff, and I submit, sir, that 1 am entitled to show that the re-opening of the fiscal question, which incidentally has brought that item before the Committee, has been due to the attitude, taken up by the leader of the Opposition. The right honourable gentleman went \on to sayHe was deeply sensible of the great importance matta saidofthis centre. If was a pleasant reminder of his position that, after fighting very strenuously, he found himself in accordance with the mandate of the people and of this Parliament, in sinking his fiscal antagonism. It was a great pleasure in his case to sink that fiscal antagonism for ever. (Applause.) Having created the position which enabled the fiscal question to be re-opened, the right honourable gentleman, in the first speech he made'in the House after the elections, practically gave an invitation tofcheGovernment to introduce what he said he would call "" a whole hog"" protectionist Tariff. In the Address-in-Reply on 21st February this year, during the short session which we held, he saidIn the first Parliament we had a grievance which led us to fight-the Tariff, with the utmost bitterness. I admit that the result of the election, in the light of any appeal for fiscal peace, was a distinct adoption of the protectionist principle throughout Australia. If , when the right honourable gentleman made an appeal to the people, they returned his opponents, I hope he will keep on fighting the Labour Party, because it will mean that we shall come back to' the Legislature with increased strength. able member returned on a fiscal issue ?

CATTS I think that the recent State elections in New South Wales have shown that the Labour policy was not an incident only. However, the honourable member for East Sydney went on to sayWhilst each of us, in the performance of our duty to our own constituents, will faithfully represent the views which we profess, and whilst .we will do our best to give f u l l effect to them, there will be no attempt to thwart or delay a thorough settlement in the direction in which the electors have decided. The deputy leader of the Opposition, though a little more cute in his statements, spoke practically to the same effect. On 4th July, the honourable member for ParraSo far as this demand for further new protection is concerned, I , at any rate, will interpose no' obstacle to a free, f u l l , and fair discussion of the matter, nor to a speedy end of the controversy.

On the 20th August there appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, tion is as followsunder the heading of "" A Lost Leader,"" the following:MT. Reid joins the dreary ranks of the lost leaders-and at what a moment! All through, the State, through the larger part of the Commonwealth, there has been ringing for days a clamour of indignation, in which surprise has not been the least dominant note. It is not too much to say that a great deal has been forgiven Mr Reid as a leader by his party and by the country. If he has been absent from his place, it has been felt that the hour of need would find him there, a leader in the forefront of the battle. . . . And ' now, when the day of disaster threatens us, instead of a fiery protest, we hear a whimper about the large number of protectionists in the House, and a pitifu l cry to the more moderate of them to be as merciful as possible. A few days after this flogging had been administered to him, the right honourable gentleman assumed another attitude, and is thus reported in the same newspaperI can tell the Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Morning Herald that they judge me rather hastily if they think I have abated any of my zeal or devotion to the cause of liberty of all kinds, including commercial liberty.

Now that the Tariff is coming on, I am going to fight it as hard as I can. All this shows that the honourable member for East Sydney is, more than any one else, responsible for the re-opening of the Tariff question, and he and his supporters ought question ? to be the last to fix the responsibility on others. Some complaint has been made as few weeks the leader of the Opposition was to the height of the duties under the prochallenged by the honourable inember for posed Tariff. The extent of the duties is, South Sydney as to his present attitude in we all admit, due to the operation of the connection with the Braddon section. The Braddon section, which places upon the right honourable gentleman was quite indigTreasurer the obligation to raise four times nant, and in the Sydney Morning Herald -the revenue that is required for Federal of 3rd September, 1907, I find that he purposes. section to do with the rates of duty ? Mr J. H . CATTS -The Braddon secsimply .tion has to do with the amount of revenue people in the different States can get the rewhich is raised from protective duties. Mr J. H . CATTS -The Braddon secDuring a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise, not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. This, as I say, compels us, as a Federation, to raise four times the revenue we require^ or, in other words, it compels the Treasurer to so mould the Tariff that it will produce, say, £[10,000,000 when £'2,250,000 would suffice. On this question, however, the leader of the Opposition has no policy. ' Although the right honourable gentleman is aspiring to the leadership of the country, he has really no definite policy as to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and of the States. Some years ago, on 27th May, 1898, the right honourable gentleman, dealing with the Braddon section, was thus reported in the Sydney Daily TelegraphThis provision of Sir Edward Braddon is an abominable blot on the B ill .

CATTS -The honourable member for Parramatta thought he 'had prevented me, and boasted of it in the House. The right honourable member for East Sydney was quite indignant that the honourable member for South Sydney should have said that he was in favour of perpetuating the Braddon section, although, at the elections, he made it one of the planks of his platform that he would support the continued operation of the section. No matter what side of the controversy is raised, the right honourable gentleman can claim that he has spoken to the contrary. If he is taken to task for assuming one attitude, he is able to point out that he took up the other attitude. Honourable members opposite, who are so loud in their professions of free-trade, refuse to adopt a policy of direct taxation, yet they are in favour of raising, through the Customs House, four times the revenue necessary for Federal purposes, and that means protection. Mr the heading of the ""Lyne Tariff,"" the Carruthers, of New South Wales, who has had a good deal to say about the Federation, its alleged extravagance,, and the work of the Federal Parliament, has also had something to say on this question. I find that a little time ago, according to the Daily Telegraph"" He urged his hearers to read carefully clause 87-Braddon' s clause-whic h had been so distorted as to unfairly influence people into opposition. That clause was the clause which would give free-trade a chance in the Federal Parliament. popular, for by that means four times as much revenue was raised as was really required."" He supported the section, not because he believed in raising so much revenue through the Customs House, but because he believed that its operation would make the Federal Parliament so unpopular to the States that there would be a revolt against Federation. It is certainly a most vicious provision which compels the Commonwealth Parliament to raise revenue for the States whilst it relieves the States Parliaments of taxation responsibility. It enables the States Parliaments to take credit, for surpluses to which they is. terrible. have no just claims, whilst it places upon the Federal Parliament the onus of imposing taxation which may be regarded as severe. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Sydney Daily Telegraph have been making a great outcry against the Tariff, but the secret of their opposition to it is disclosed in the following statement, which appeared in the Daily Telegraph last weekAs the Tariff stands, its burden upon the newspapers of the Commonwealth points to something like ^50,000 a year. I may say that one of my reasons for supporting such items is that, while they will not fall heavily upon the working classes of the community, the wealthy newspaper proprietors of the Commonwealth will have to pay £[50,000 a year towards the revenue. not aware that it will fall heavily upon some small newspaper men in the country districts ? Mr J. H . CATTS -It will not affect them to the same extent, and I prefer taxation which will affect the wealthy proprietors of newspapers to taxation upon the necessaries of life of the working classes. According to the Sydney press, was there any necessity for the great outcry against the Tariff so far as the city of Sydney is concerned ? Under Sydney Morning Herald says thatThe city will pay for it in the increased cost of living, and will get back perhaps more than its loss in increased wages. Thus, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Lyne Tariff will operate to the advantage of the city of Sydney. I admit that this newspaper previously contended that the Tariff would -operate to the disadvantage of Sydney, but that was when it was appealing to the working classes in It would make Customs taxation unthat city. When it appealed to the country people, it tried to show that the Tariff would benefit the city of Sydney. orable member think about it? it will take annually ,£2,000,000 more out of the pockets of the people than did the old Tariff. Mr J. H . CATTS I do not think that we should raise any more revenue than was raised under the old Tariff.

502,Mr Bruce Smith,"We now know thatSydney was largely benefited by the operation of the old Tariff. I find that, from 1901 to 1906 the number of factories in New South Wales was increased by 916, and the number of hands employed by 22,212. During last year, 1905-6, the increase in the number of factories in that -State 'was 138, and in the number of employees 5,383. In Victoria during the same year the increase in the number of factories was 143, and in the number of employ6s 4,275. The increase in the number of factory employee's during last year was greater in New South Wales than in Victoria, and it would seem that under a protectionist Tariff New South Wales was benefited to a greater extent than Victoria. In Victoria the total number of factory hands employed is 67,544, and in New South Wales the number is 77,558, or over 10,000 in excess of the number in Victoria. Although at the recent elections I was not asked any questions, I issued a manifesto, in which I made a statement which, perhaps, was not very definite, but which was as followsA l l tariff proposals should be treated on their merits and as a business proposition, with a proviso that in the event of an article of manufacture being protected the workmen engaged in its production should be protected as well as the 'manufacturer. The fallacy that the manufacturer only reaped huge fortunes at the people's -expense, and that a system of importation provided against huge incomes being made before .goods reached the consumer, has been entirely -exploded by the Sydney, Morning Herald, which 'showed recently that iri Victoria, the home of manufacturers and protection, the importers enjoyed laiger incomes than manufacturers; the ,latest figures from the income tax returns showing the taxation paid being :-Importers , an average of £ \ $ n s . each; primary producers, £ \ $ 6s. 6d. each; manufacturers, £ g 14s. id. each. assist importing rings by free-trade, or manufacturers' rings by protection may be each detrimental to the people unless hedged about by such safeguards as will ensure an advantage to the community and workman as well as to the employer. The logic of the position is that if an industry has to be assisted or subsidized by the State, the .State should conduct it, so that the whole people 'who provide the assistance should reap the benefit and not a few favoured individuals. If , on the cither hand, an importing policy gives the undue advantage to the importer class, and importing rings stand between the consumer and his goods, the people through the State should <;o-operate to preserve to themselves the advantages of free importation. As a member qf the Labour Party, I was pledged at the last general election to a referendum on the Tariff question. Here again, there has been in New South Wales considerable misrepresentation, coming : Mr J. H. Catts. largely from Mr Carruthers. In the Daily Telegraph of the 10th ult., Mr Carruthers is reported to have saidI have on several occasions, in public adson and the Labour Party with an avoidance of their pledges in connection with the Tariff. . . First, the Federal fiehting platform of the Labour Party (copy of: which I have before me as I write) contains the following, viz -:Item 4, Tariff Referendum, which is explained in the general platform to mean as follows :4. Referendum of Commonwealth electors on the tariff auestion when the report of the Tariff Commission has been completed ; the party to give effect to the decision of the referendum vote. This, therefore, is what Mr Watson and the Labour Party were pledged to, and this is what the electors were deluded into believing would be given effect to, viz., a vote of the electors on the Tariff, and effect given to that vote. Mr Carruthers overlooked the manifesto issued on 5th October of last year, and printed in the Sydney Morning Herald, over the signature of the honourable member for South Sydney, chairman of the Federal Labour Partv, and the honourable member for Yarra, secretary to the party in connection with this very proposal for a Tariff referendum. It set forth thatThe Labour platform proposes that the fiscal policy of Australia shall be settled by a. direct vote of the people themselves. Our intention is that this settlement shall be made speedily and decisively, free from the confusion and distraction of other issues. A Royal Commission is at present inquiring into the effects of the' existing Tariff, and its report will doubtless be followed by a complete revision of duties by Parliament. This being accomplished, the question of confirming or rejecting the revised Tariff should be submitted to a referendum as soon as' practicable, and thus insure freedom from Tariff alteration for a reasonable period. It is obvious, therefore, that to That is the attitude taken up by the Labour Party in connection with the Tariff referendum, and which was clearly and distinctly placed before the people' in October last, prior to the Federal elections. I may say at once that. I am strong neither on free-trade nor protection. I do not think that the great problem which confronts Australia and .other, countries to-day is so much one as to increasing production or -wealth as it is of securing a more equitable distribution of the wealth that is already produced. orable member divide it?

Instead of trying to increase our wealth by free-trade or protection, we ought rather to turn our attention to a better distribution of the immense wealth which is already being produced. to consider this Tariff. . Mr J. H . CATTS I hope that in the Tariff we shall make provision that part of the benefits which are supposed to arise from it, will pass into the pockets of the workers and the consumers generally, instead of into the pockets of one particular class. For that purpose, the party to which I belong have submitted a scheme of new protection, which the leader of the Opposition to-day admitted to be the first of its kind introduced, so far as he knew, into any Parliament in the world. was going to be successful. Mr J. H . CATTS -The right honourable gentleman said he sympathized with its objects, that deficiencies were found in working out every reform, and that experiments had to be made before absolute success could be reached. was going to vote for these duties on the strength of it? Mr J. H . CATTS I do not know that he went that far. . If he did, he would say it in such a way that when he came to the items he could very conveniently wriggle out of the statement he had made. The Labour Party has introduced a new protection system, and propose to carry out the scheme as follows-That, with a view to insuring fair working conditions in protected industries, duty stamps (of a value to be determined) should be affixed to all protected' goods not bearing the Commontrade mark, which is referred to in the wealth trade mark. The Commonwealth trade mark may be applied to goods which are manufactured under conditions as to the remuneration of labour prescribed by an industrial award, decision, determination or agreement under any industrial law (Federal or State), or in respect union label-o r whatever honourable memof which a resolution has been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, or regulation issued by any competent authority, declaring that the conditions as to the remuneration of labour are fair and reasonable. Mr J. H . CATTS -It is not I , then, that detain honourable members. If I talked against timeas the honourable member for Lang does on hundreds of occasions, there might be some reason for him to interrupt me now. The scheme proceedsIn fixing the amount of stamp duty to be levied on specified goods, consideration to be given to the degree of protection afforded by the Tariff, the average cost of labour involved, and the value of the article affected. Then we propose to protect the consumer in the following manner1. That, with a view to protecting the consumer, a permanent commission be created to inquire into and report upon the prices charged for locally produced goods, having regard to the cost of raw materials, wages paid, hours worked by employees, rate of import duty and other essential factors. 2. That such commission be empowered to use the resources of the Statistician's"" office and the Customs department to facilitate its inquiries, and be also authorized to employ expert officers to prosecute special investigations. T,. That, in the event of such commission reporting that unfairly high prices are being charged in respect of goods the product of aprotected industry, and recommending the reduction of the import duty, the Governor General may, on resolution of both Houses, reduce the duty to the extent recommended. I was very pleased to hear from the Acting Prime Minister to-day that he had very largely followed the scheme outlined by the Labour Party. Mr J. H . CATTS I do not say that at all. It is the duty of the Opposition to say anything, and generally to mean nothing. The Acting Prime Minister, in setting out his scheme, followed that outlined by the Labour Party to a large extent by stating that the Excise duty was to be imposed along with the Tariff, and that half the amount of duty was to be chargeable by a stamp duty upon those goods which were not manufactured under fair and reasonable conditions of labour, the exemption to be made to those who pay fair and reasonable rates. It is to be applied by affixing the Commonwealth Labour Party's scheme, to goods which are manufactured under those conditions. It will be most advantageous to Australia as a whole to know from the trade mark or bers like to call it-affixe d to goods, that those goods have been made under fair and reasonable conditions, and are not the product of sweated factories. tection' can only be imposed after the duties have been voted.

527,Mr Joseph Cook,"He is as good a decontest the electorate which I represent, and that the result will be -equally satisfactory to me. The honourable member for Echuca has referred to the constitutional aspect of the new protection proposals, and it is significant that the employers, who have plenty of representatives in this House, have already taken up a very firm attitude in that connection. The Sydney Daily Telegrafh of 4th September, 1907, records that the Employers' Council recently agreed to the following motionThat this Council strongly protests against the stated intentions of the Federal Government to attempt to obtain what is called "" n e w "" protection by regulation of wages, conditions of labour and prices of goods on the ground that the .Commonwealth Parliament has no constitutional power to deal 'with these matters, such measures as the Excise Tariff Act being plainly in contravention of section 55 of the Constitution. passage of such illegal enactments is misleading io' the public, and' wishes to point out that it has already involved and must lead to further and almost endless litigation, thereby causing heavy law expenditure in order to prove their invalidity. Who attempts to prove their invalidity but the Employers' Federation? that the increased measure of protection granted to the agricultural implement industry should be disbursed amongst the employees in that industry, the party to which the honourable member belongs voted against it. Mr J. H . CATTS -Each member of the party to which I belong is at liberty to adopt an independent attitude upon the fiscal question. Consequently it is idle for the honourable member to endeavour to impose upon me with a wolf and lamb story of that sort. What was done bysomebody else upon this question is no concern of mine. The Employers' Federation have indicated that they intend to test the validity of the new protection. Evidently they desire increased duties for their own benefit, and are disinclined to allow their operatives to participate in that benefit. If I did not think that we can bring this new protection scheme into operation I should not be in favour of protecting industries at all. Sir Arbitration Act in force in New South Wales? Mr J. H .

CATTS -In connection with the Board which it is proposed to appoint to give effect to the new protection, I hope that provision will be made to obviate the weaknesses which have revealed themselves in other bodies of a similar character. For instance, appeals have been permitted from Wages Boards which are required to decide industrial disputes upon the evidence submitted, to a purely legal tribunal. honourable member refer ? ' Mr J.

But before doing' so, I wish to ask him what is to be done in regard to part VI . of the Tariff. I understood him to say that he had alternative proposals to make in regard to the production of iron, to encourage which he was determined to impose a duty or to grant a bounty Sir WILLIAM LYNE that the Prime Minister favours the granting of a 'bounty in preference to the imposition of a ""duty, inasmuch as iron enters into the composition of so many articles that it would be undesirable at the present time to increase the cost of so universal a raw product. He proposed first of all to deal with it by way of a bonus. He has in his Tariff a division which is to be conditioned by a report from the Executive to Parliament, and I presume the passing of a resolution concerning it by Parliament. Sir WILLIAM LYNE WhatI said was that I should try first to get an Iron Bounties Bill passed, and if I failed, I should f a l l back on divisions VI . A and VI .

Sir WILLIAM LYNE Yes ; but the Bill will be laid upon the table before we get to item 229. honourable gentleman mean by laying the Bil l upon ,the table? He has already told us that it will deal with most of the items in those two divisions, and therefore we practically know what it will contain.

There"" is nothing in the Act to prevent these people regulating the value of their machine to the price which the Government compel them to charge. Unless the Government by Statute guarantee to the consumer that the quality of the article will be maintained that must necessarily occur. All this talk about reducing prices is mere moonshine. The Government might compel manufacturers to sell at a cheaper price, but at the same time they would afford them an opportunity to make a cheaper machine, and give them a monopoly ot the market in which to sell that machine. I should like to see that point met by the Acting Prime Minister 'in connection with these new proposals, otherwise they will never be effective. to try to regulate all the prices and all the labour of the community they will Undertake a job the complexity of which would baffle a man much superior to any ever born upon this planet. three men who are wise enough and capacious enough to grasp, and control, and harmonize all the industrial occupations of the country, as well as to attend to all the ramifications of the distribution of the country. In dealing with the question of regulating prices one has only to look at a statement made by the Prime Minister himself when discussing this question at the Imperial Conference a few weeks ago. The honourable gentleman went on to sayand I quote these remarks because they are very appropriate to the matter now underconsiderationMarkets vary everywhereand in speaking of markets he referred, of course, to pricestuid under -circumstances, too many even to indicate, merchants are accustomed to sell sometimes in -good and sometimes in only indifferent markets.

[ i OCTOBER, 1907.] Tariff. 4031 ing of a combination. The Government set out to do more than inquire whether or not a combination exists. They set out to guarantee to the consumers that they will not be charged excessive prices. They cannot do that unless they have such machinery as will enable them to follow the goods into every town and every hamlet of Australia, so as to know precisely what the consumer pays at the point where he parts with his cash. The honourable member knows that the cost of goods at the end of a railway line, or on a railway line, may be 20 per cent, less than it is 20 mile's inland, whither the goods have to be conveyed by carriers. sidered. be if the Government are' going to fix the price to the consumer; but, inasmuch as they cannot by any machinery known to us, follow all these ramifications of trade in I know of no their details, they will never be able to guarantee that the consumers will have to pay only a fair price. The honourable member, and, indeed, the Government, admit that, under their fair price proposition, all they need do is to make inquiries in the cities. That, I believe, was the statement made the other day by the honourable mem1 ber for South Sydney, when discussing this matter. manufacturers. great deal of difference between manufacturing goods and' selling them in a wholesale way and retailing them to, the consumer. The Government give no guarantee to the consumer when they simply take care that the goods which leave the manufacturer's hands at a reasonable price shall be sold to the consumer at a reasonable price. One of the complaints most loudly uttered in connection with this very Tariff is that prices are unduly inflated and raised to the consumer, and that neither the manufacturer nor the Tariff has anvthing whatever to do with that increase. Clearly, if the Government are to give any relief to the consumer, as they set out to do by Prices differ in this machinery,' they will have to follow the goods to the point where he begins to take delivery in return for his cash. That is a task which cannot be compassed by any three men or 300 or 3,000 men throughout the length and breadth of Australia.
