The Prime Minister Been Drawn To The F O L","lowing passage in a leader in this morning's Argus ?A startling change in the outward appearance of our postmen may be expected shortly; it is as well that the public should be prepared for it. The first announcement of this momentous event was made, in an apparently casual manner, by Mr Fisher in his speech on Tuesday-the same speech in which he hurled at the Brisbane strikers the bitterest condemnation that has yet been uttered. He said that, knowing the men exceedingly well, he was very surprised that they had refrained from acts of incendiarism. I ask the honourable gentleman if he made use of those words, or any of similar import? strike in Queensland would have committed actions of that kind? f u l perversion of what I said, and the time .must soon come when writers for the press -will be compelled to disclose their identity. explanation regarding a statement made last night by the honourable member for Wentmatter and see what can be done. worth, that accomplished political pimp on the other side honourable member a pimp? engaged, 1 did hot hear the word; but if it was used, it must be withdrawn.

They are most insulting. member for Gwydir to withdraw what he said, and not to repeat the expression. words, and leave it to-the sense of the House as to whether they were justified. Last session I had a notice on the business paper for an inquiry into the operations of the Tobacco Trust, which I subsequently 27 June, igi2. withdrew, and the honourable member last night construed my motive as an unworthy one. A similar misrepresentation was made 2.30 during the Werriwa campaign, to which I had no chance to reply. I ' withdrew the motion simply because I found that in the report and evidence of a Commission which H as the attention of had dealt with the matter there was sufficient information to justify action, and I thought, therefore, that the cost of another inquiry was not warranted. The statement that I consulted members of my party on the subject is worthy of the honourable member. I did not consult any of them before placing the notice on the business paper, or before withdrawing it .

14,Mr Speaker,"I shall look into theDebate resumed from 26th June (vide That the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's Speech, as read by tbe Clerk, be agreed to by the House. That the following words be added to the Address :"" and to inform Your Excellency that the Government merits the censure of the House and the country for its failure to realize its national and constitutional obligations, for flagrant neglect of its duty to secure industrial peace and good order, and to uphold the law within the CommonweaUh; for its maladministration of public affairs and public departments; for its grossly partisan actions and appointments, and its feckless irresponsibility in the financial affairs of the Commonwealth."" -The Leader of the Opposition has challenged the administration of public affairs by the Government. Those charges have been put in distinct language, and cover many important points. The Government is charged with having failed to recognise its constitutional and national obligations, with having flagrantly neglected to secure industrial peace and good order, and to uphold the law within the Commonwealth; it is charged with the rhal administration of public affairs and public departments, and grossly partisan action in appointments, and reckless irresponsibility in the financial affairs of the Commonwealth. If any one of these charges be true, Ministers have ceased to deserve the confidence of the House and of the people. No previous Commonwealth Government took office with a stronger following. They have a majority in this House and in the Senate, and, therefore, within the limits of their constitutional .power they -have complete political authority to realize every practical national scheme that they put before the country. sions of the High Court. is within their constitutional powers. At the last election they went before the public at a time when there was a wave of enthusiasm for national sentiment running through the land. They played upon that national sentiment to the full. They proclaimed themselves the National party of Australia, and upon that ground they asked for support. They declared that they were a party who were going to realize the national ideals of the Commonwealth. How have they succeeded in that realization? Can they point to their record, and show that they have fulfilled all the promises of. every kind that they put before the people ? My contention is, Mr Speaker, that instead of realizing their national ideals, they have' proved themselves to be the only party that has taken control of the affairs of Australia which has been distinctly sectional in itsaims, and, on the whole, partisan in itsaction. I will presently endeavour to substantiate that statement. I will test them first of all on one important matter, and that is the fulfilment of the national obligation upon any Government to assist in the preservation of peace, law, and order' within the Commonwealth. Test them byone incident alone, that of the Brisbane strike, and they can be proved to have failed to realize their national obligations and responsibilities. Their action was such that it ought to receive the censure of this House. First of all, I want to reply to one or two statements made by'the Prime Minister in his speech during this debate. He led this House, and the public, to believe that Brisbane itself favoured the strike, because, he said, in Brisbane the Labour pai-ty swept the polls at the last State elections. That was a distinct statement. Let us examine it in the light of the actual facts. How many seats did the Labour party win at the last Queensland elections in the area in which they are supposed to have swept the polls? I take the constituencies within a radius of 15 miles of the General Post Office, Brisbane. Labour secured the following seats :-Brisbane, Buranda, Fortitude Valley, Ithaca, Maree and Paddington. But what are the seats that they did not win, but which went to the Liberal party? They are Bulimba, Enoggera, Kurilpa, Merthyr, Nundah, Oxley, South Brisbane, Toombul, Toowong and Windsor. In the metropolitan area, therefore, the Labour party was defeated by ten seats to six. Yet the Prime Minister claims that they swept the whole area around Brisbane. position before? the metropolitan area was represented under a different system. The Labour party held two seats. But is securing six seats, as against ten, evidence of sweeping the metropolitan area?",14,Papers Ministers Laid Upon The Table The

He referred ment of Brisbane was. But take the places to efforts of Mr Barnes, and remarked that at which the Prime Minister himself adthe honourable member for Brisbane and dressed meetings, and where the people had others had been in consultation with him, an opportunity of forming their opinion, although their endeavours had been fruit-' not upon what was told them in the form less; but he insisted that as far as conof local newspaper criticism, or by stateciliation was concerned, the Government had ments emanating from the Brisbane undoubtedly done their best.

What was the result? Starting from Brisbane and tiavelling north through ham's exact words as reported in the Gympie, Maryborough, and Bundaberg to pressthe furthest district where the Prime Minister went, I find that only one seat went what he had really said was that he left the to Labour. These people had the invaluable strike promoters, the strike committee, the opportunity of not being misled by the leaders, capitalistic press, but of hearing the one to authority who could speak for the Commonwealth Government. The right honourable gentleman's speeches were fully reis his explanation. ported in the metropolitan and Bundaberg newspapers.

In comparison with the last election, we more than held our own. At the last Federal election I secured a majority of over 7,000. That majority was sustained at the referenda, and a't the State election the result was very much the same in the same area. Let us take another statement, which I am sorry that the Prime Minister made, because I do think that he would not wilfully repeat a statement which he knew to When Mr Denham was asked at Rocklea,. the strike, what he had done to settle it , As to leaving men to stew in their own juice, who wanted Parliament called together, stew in their own juice.

My only desire is to bring out the truth; and I quote this denial in justice to a man who is not here to defend himself. The charge that we make against the Government is that they have failed in one of their obligations under the Constitution. What is that obligation? found in section .119 of the Constitution, which provides thatThe Commonwealth shall protect every State 'against invasion, and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against -domestic violence. There we have clearly defined the obligation in this regard placed upon the Government of the Commonwealth. section is really a reproduction of the fourth section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the United States of America, which provides that the United the Union a Republican form of Government, and shall protect each of them against He invasion; and. on the application of the Legislature or of the Executive-whe n the Legislature cannot be convened-agains t domestic violence. We haye in Rawle's Constitution of the United States of America an interesting passage showing the nature of the compact. On page 292, he writesThe power and duty of the United States to interfere with the particular concerns of a State are not, however, limited to the violent efforts of a party to alter its Constitution. If from any other motives, or under any other pretexts, the internal peace and order of the State are disturbed and its own powers are insufficient to suppress the commotion, it becomes the duty of its proper Government to apply to the union for protection. There we see that the duty is placed upon a State, when it cannot deal with its own internal affairs, to apply to the Union for assistanceThis is founded on the sound principle that those in whom the force of the union is vested, in diminution of the power formerly possessed by the State, arc bound to exercise it for the good of the whole, and upon the obvious and direct interest that the whole possesses in the peace and tranquillity of every part. At the same time it is properly provided, in order that such interference may not wantonly or arbitrarily take place, that it shall only be on the request of the State authorities; otherwise the self-government of the State might be encroached upon at the pleasure of the union, and a small State might fear or feel the effects of a combination of larger States against it under colour of Constitutional authority; but it is manifest that in e'very part of this excellent system there has been the utmost care to avoid encroachments on the internal powers of the different States, whenever the general good did. not imperiously require it. Rawle goes on to point out thatNo form of application for this assistance is pointed out, nor has been provided by any Act of Congress; but the natural course would be to apply to the President or officer for the time being, exercising his functions. No occasional It is to be Act of the .Legislature of the United States seems to be necessary where his duty is pointed out b' the ConstitutionThis is significant. He concludesand great injury might be sustained if the power was not promptly exercised.

I have shown incidentally what Senator Pearce's view of the duty of the Government was at that date. Let us now take another authority to see what the nature of this obligation is.

Then he makes this important statementThe United States, then, are not to determine what is domestic violence calling for their proiteclion, but that is to be determined by the Legislature or Executive of the State. That is his view. He quotes the observacourse, the Executive Officer.

In The American Comgency of this kind, and authorized the general monwealth, Bryce takes exactly the same view of the nature of the obligation which is placed upon the State. In his first volume, at page 329, he lays down the propositionThis case is that of the breaking out in a State of serious disturbances. The President is bound, on the application of the State Legislature .or Executive, to quell such disturbances by the armed forces of the Union, or by directing the militia of another State to enter. He enumerates the different cases in which, on the application of the States, this power has been enforced, and enforced successfully. I am only going incidentally to mention the last case, namely, the case of President :Hayes, who was obliged to use military force "" during the tumults in Pennsylvania caused by the great railway strikes of 1877."" I turned to the only account I could get of these strikes and the effect of Federal intervention in the matter. In a series of historical essays, published in 1909, Dr. Rhodes writesI n the case of domestic Where the regular soldiers appeared order was at once restored without bloodshed, and it was said that the rioters feared one Federal bayonet more than a whole company of militia.

62,Mr Groom,"I am dealing with the Government to interfere in the domestic concerns of a State, has treated the subject as political in its nature, and placed the power in the hands of that department. The power to interfere in a domestic disturbance is a political power, which, in Australia, is placed in the hands of the Government of the day, but, at the same time, there is a mandatory side to it. Our Constitution, as was pointed out by an eminent authority, is something in the nature of a treaty. rendered to the Commonwealth their power to look after military matters, and the Commonwealth has the control of the military power. It is the military power in the end which preserves to the nation its very existence. It is the instinct of self-preservation manifested in the military power in national life. What was the condition of the surrender of the power? The States gave up the power on condition that in case their domestic power was not adequate to the occasion, the Commonwealth would, in the hour of crisis, come in and assist them, and protect them against domestic violence. It s in the nature of a treaty obligation; it is a moral obligation, and it is just as binding as any other treaty is binding upon the people. When it comes to the exercise of a power, undoubtedly there must be with the Commonwealth some means of ascertaining whether the conditions exist which call for an exercise of the power. .There must be that right in the Commonwealth in order to ascertain whether this duty ought to be fulfilled. right on the pivot now. let the Government remember that it is their duty to ascertain whether the facts exist, so that they may fulfil their treaty obligation to those who are in the Union. That power is clearly set out in the first of these cases Luther v. Borden. Referring to an analogous case I find that at page 195 Thayer saysThe words "" it shall be the duty "" in ordinary protect State against domestic violence in terms, legislation imply the assertion of the power_ to of section 119 of the Commonwealth of Australia. command and to coerce obedience. But looking Constitution Act. to the subject-matter of this law, and the relations which the United States and the several urge immediate action. States bear to each other, the court is of opinion Here is the reply sent on the 2nd February the words "" it shall be the d u t y "" were not used as. mandatory and compulsory, but as declara-the next day. tory of the moral duty which this compact created when Congress had provided the mode tioned ? of carrying it into execution. That is the position in this particular case. tioned in the official paper. There is a duty which is mandatory in the sense of a moral obligation, and the Comomission. monwealth has no right when the conditions exist to fail to fulfil its constitutional obligation. There are two points at issue. The first is that when the demand^is made there is a duty to be performed in two ways. If the power is discretionary that discretion has to be exercised. There must be an honest, proper, and complete exercise of"" the power of discretion in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution. The next point is that if the facts are found to exist The States surwhich call for aid, no matter what one's political opinions may be, if there is domestic violence within a State with which the State authority cannot cope, there is no liberty on the part of the Commonwealth authority to refuse to fulfil its obligation. It is bound to interfere to protect the State against domestic violence. different. getting round to the same point. Let us see, first of all, whether the Prime Minister exercised any discretion in this matter.. Did the Commonwealth Cabinet consider the application as it was their duty to do according to the Constitution? Did they make a full and impartial inquiry to find whether domestic violence existed or not? All we have to go by in considering thisphase of the question are the statementsmade by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General and the papers laid on the table of this House. issued ?

The message from the State Government was considered immediately upon its receipt. probably sent the next morning. This is the replyThe Government recommend your Excellency that the following reply be sent to the Governor of Queensland. That whilst the Commonwealth Government is quite prepared to fulfil its obligations to the Stales, if ever the occasion should arise, they do not admit the right of any State to call for -their assistance in circumstances which are proper to be dealt with by the police forces of the States. That is a very pious expression of opinion, but no one had asked for it. This is the important part of the reply. The condition of affairs existing in Quernsland does not, in the opinion of my Ministers, -warrant the request of the Executive Government of Queensland contained in your Excellency's message being complied with.

That is the statement which Mr Coyne made at Toowoomba. member think that the public required to be 'protected against the special constables who were let loose in Brisbane with batons? the facts as to when this particular communication was received by the Commonwealth Government. Personally, I think that Mr Coyne's statement is correct. talk, it strikes me that some honourable members would like to see the streets of Brisbane running with blood. calmer moments the honourable member will regret having made that statement. He knows perfectly well that our desire is to prevent bloodshed and to preserve peace. Let us dispassionately discuss the facts. The application of the Queensland Government was the first of its kind which has ever been made to the Commonwealth, and for that reason, if for no other, it is worthy of temperate consideration. Mr Coyne's telegram readsStrike combined Committee have maintained absolute order up to this morning. Peaceable processions have taken place, also peaceable public meetings this morning. Permit to hold procession refused; foot and mounted police fully armedposted all corners preventing people proper inquiry was made by Ministers to> proceeding peaceably along streets. Many serious unprovoked assaults by police. We have Vigilance Committee keeping perfect order if not prevented by police. W ill you assist us with your naval and military to maintain peace and order. Reply urgent. is a lovely satire on the other communication. member suggest that it was intended as a satire? If so, did Mr Coyne know what was in the other communication ? Mr Coyne 'says that his wire was despatched twenty four hours before Mr Denham's, and in it .he speaks of "" peaceable processions"" having taken place that morning. Now we all -know that on the 2nd February no procession was allowed in Brisbane. The only peaceable procession to which"" the telegram could have referred was one which took place on ist February. Obviously it must have been despatched on ist February, and miist have referred to' the events of that day: I come now to the question of how the Government exercised their discretion. What was the material upon which they exercised the important' function which devolved upon them of preserving domestic peace in another State? It is perfectly clear that the material which they had before them was a telegram from Mr Coyne, containing information which upon its very face was incorrect, because there was no "" peaceable procession"" held in Brisbane Oil the 2nd February. The Prime Minister has given us no assurance that a complete and proper inquiry was made as to the conditions which obtained in Brisbane before the reply of the Executive was forwarded to the Government of Queensland. ister say that the Government were in close touch with the whole affair, and that they had information from independent sources? the Prime Minister's own statement. Inspeaking at Brisbane he saidHe made no apology for not having sent the troops. With unerring instinct and a thorough knowledge of the people, he had come to the conclusion that they were not needed, because the people were honest at heart and faithful tc the principle of good citizenship. He practically repeated that statement' at Bundaberg on 18th April when he saidThe Commonwealth Government unerringhdiagnosed the situation. In fulfilling its constitutional obligations, is the. Government to act upon "" unerring instinct "" ? Where is the evidence that any ascertain the conditions which obtained iin Brisbane at the time the Premier of Queensland urged ""that "" in consequence of a general strike, riot and bloodshed are imminent?"" Surely such a message sent to a Government intrusted with national responsibilities ought to have been sufficient tc* make them rise to the situation. They were not asked to send the military to Brisbane. They were merely requested to protect the State, in accordance with tfie provisions of ' the Constitution. Did the Government give any assurance to the State authorities that, they were taking action with a view to havingeverything in readiness should occasion arise for their intervention? Certainly not. On the contrary, there was an absolute negation of their responsibilitya bangingof the door, and a complete failure tc» realize their constitutional obligations.

120,. Mr Groom,"Strictly impartial!MS, "" We could not do it, because no proclamation was issued under the Defence Act."" The defence of the Attorney-General is like that of the young man who, when asked why he did not rescue a drowning young lady, said he really could not do so because he had never been introduced to her ! The Federal Government could not come to the aid of the State when requested by the Premier of the State on the ground that bloodshed was imminent, because, technically, no proclamation had been issued. According to the present Government, in view of their constitutional -obligations, the issue of a proclamation in --the hour of peril is more important than is -the preservation of life and property. However, the most interesting feature of this gallant defence is that we heard it for -.the first time when the Attorney-General -spoke in the House. If that was the reason that actuated the Government, why did they not say to the Queensland Government, "" Regret we cannot consider the matter until you issue a proclamation?"" That question, however, was never raised until the Government found that the public opinion of Australia was against them. Mr W. H . IRVINE -There was a proclamation issued. and merely to enable the State Government to take advantage of their own laws. cise their own powers, which they had not exhausted when they asked for the aid of tlie military. ought to be fair Government exercised no proper discretion; at any rate, I have shown that a letter from Mr Coyne seemed to be good evidence on which to come to a decision, unless the Government have other 'secret information which they do not care to disclose. We have to put ourselves in the position of the .citizens of Brisbane, at 7 o'clock on the 1 st February, when this application was -made. What happened afterwards does not concern us now except that the subsequent acts cast light on what went before. We must confine our attention to what took place before and on the ist February. The e8th January was a most important date, because it was on that Sunday that nhis resolution was arrived at by a meeting of trade unionistsThis meeting of delegates representing forty-three unions, recognising that the action of the member wanted over the streets was red Brisbane Tramway Company in prohibiting its employees from wearing badges, the symbol of their unionism, constitutes an attack on the principles of unionism recognised under the Statute law, Federal and State, resolves that a general cessation of work take place on Tuesday evening, 30th inst., unless in the meantime a satisfactory settlement is arrived at. It was on that basis that the general strike started. The cause of complaint, as alleged by the representatives of forty-three unions in conference, was the action of the Brisbane Tramway Company in prohibiting its employees from wearing their union badges. This prohibition they regarded as justifying them in throwing the business of Brisbane into confusion. On the following day, the secretary of the Strike Committee published the-following advertisement in the Brisbane Courier:To the members of the unions assembled at the TradesH a l l on Monday last, 28th inst. As no attempt has been made before 6 p.m. on 29th inst. by the Brisbane Tramway Company to endeavour to settle the dispute between themselves and their employees, now locked out, I do, on behalf of the above unions and committee, subsequently appointed by them, hereby instruct each and all members of the above unions to cease work at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, 30th January inst. Written applications for permits in regard to hospitals, &c., will be received by* me at my office, Trades Hall. J. A. Mors.

It was reported that women who had purchased goods were compelled to return them to the shops, and to go without the necessaries of life. member see that? of men went to different houses and compelled cooks and domestic servants to cease work.

Speeches were first delivered at the TradesH a l l . Then there were processions, and thousands of men were parading the streets. Those people who were enthusiastically with the men were gathering round them. After the meetings and the processions, these men scattered themselves through the streets of the city ; and it is that which constituted a great deal of the peril. There were three occasions reported on that one morning when the mob had possession of the streets. ing the unionists particularly for those cases, but 1 am pointing out what the domestic condition of Brisbane' was during the strike. There was the case of certain goods which were being taken from the wharf along Mary-street towards Edwardstreet. that a mob of perhaps a thousand people assembled' there ? Does he deny also that many men attacked the police with pieces of wood, and that one constable was ini-apacitated ? Does he deny that act of violence? Does he deny the incident when lorries laden with barrels of beer going down Market-square were attacked? The third occasion was the stoppage .of a lorry laden with potatoes by a mob who had control of the city of Brisbane on the 1st February. that the honourable member for Brisbane was in a "" blue funk.""

Is that statement of Mr Collings which I have quoted true, or is it false? He. was speaking with intimate knowledge. What was going on in Brisbane on the morning when Mr Coyne telegraphed »o the Fisher Government? This is what Mr Coyne himself saidThe second morning after the strike was proclaimed there was not a man in Brisbane who could buy a loaf of bread without a permit from the Strike Committee. Would it be a surprise for them to know that the Government of Queensland had come to the Strike Committee for permits? Would it surprise them. I ' am not blamto know that the Water Board and the biggest merchants in Brisbane had to get permits? The Strike Committee carried on the business of the country better than the Denham crowd.

He wrote as follows:It is quite impossible for any intelligent citizen of Brisbane to contemplate with any degree of equanimity the position of affairs in the city to-day.

The honourable member for Brisbane is reported to have said at a meeting in the eveningHe had gone home at dinner time after the scene in Market-streetThat was the occasion on which a pistol shot was firedfeeling that a supreme crisis had come. The honourable member was truthful in his statement, and I applaud him for having had the courage to declare the truth to these men. I am not going to utter one word against his honour or integrity, nor am I making any personal attack upon him.. I am simply quoting his own statement as evidence of what were the actual conditions in Brisbane on the day in question. He went on to sayNow he was satisfied that the next day the position would be of even greater gravity. Although a supreme crisis had arisen that day, he was confident that the position on the morrow would be of still greater gravity. Just before he made this speech, the Queensland Government had preferred their request for assistance, and their statement was practically on all fours with his own, that a crisis had been reached. The two statements were practically identical. The honourable member for Brisbane went on to sayHe urged all to take their instructions only from those at the Trades Hall, and to do nothing to break the peace. This statement stands to his credit. Throughout this great industrial strike, he did his utmost to restore peace. He went out of his way to do so, and might even have incurred hostility in his efforts. for Darling Downs, on the other hand, left Brisbane for Ipswich on the night in question. to at Ipswich. official position, and I was not a member of the Commonwealth Ministry refusing to discharge my duty. contrast Mr Finlayson's statement with the telegram sent by Mr Coyne, in which he said thatPeaceable processions have taken place; also peaceable public meetings. . . .

On the very day on which, according to Mr Coyne, perfect order was being maintained by a vigilance committee a serious disturbance had taken place in Marketstreet, and the honourable member for Brisbane declared that a serious crisis had arisen. Yet we have this telegram from Mr Coyne, assuring the Commonwealth Government that perfect'order was being maintained. Mr Coyne: had taken control of Brisbane; he said that he was managing the affairs of the city better than the Denham Government was doing, and it was apparently upon the evidence of-this man that the Commonwealth Government acted. I do not wish to labour this matter. I have already dealt with it at greater length than I had intended to do, but I think it necessary that we should ask ourselves what were the views of the Premier of Queensland in regard to the actual situation. On the 5th February he gave his reasons for applying to the Commonwealth for military assistance. He saidIn the first place, when the appeal was made it was clearly impossible, with the means at the command of the State Government, to restore order without the aid of the force prescribed by section 119 of the Commonwealth Constitution. The Premier of Queensland, with a full knowledge of the actual position, makes this serious statement, and I should like to know who could speak with better authority on the subject. Believing this to be the actual position, he preferred his request to the Commonwealth Government. And how has the Attorney-General spoken of it? He has said in this House that this application for aid without the issue of a proclamation was a trap on the part of the Queensland Government. Is that a fair and proper statement to be made by a Minister of State administering an important office of the Commonwealth ? Mr Denham went on to saySecondly, thousands of men held up the city and suburbs, and under directions from some illegal authority determined to starve the community, into subjugation. Do we need any further proof of the truth of this statement than the admissions made. I did not occupy any by the. strike committee themselves?

They chose their own Court, and, after it had been appealed to by them, the general strike took place in Brisbane. I say that that strike was absolutely without justification. If ""we consider the resolution of the Strike Committee itself, we shall see distinctly that it was because of the refusal to allow the wearing of the badge that the unionists in Brisbane went out on general strike. the resolution itself; and that is the only matter mentioned in it. I doubt very much whether the men who went out on general strike in Brisbane knew wEat was happening in this connection. I do not think they knew that the plaint of the tramway men covered the badge. about it. is probably quite right; they did not bother about it. They probably went cut in sympathy with their fellow unionists; and there is no doubt that a great many of them were misled. I can give the opinion of Senator Turley. is now referring to the Warwick speech, Senator Turley says that he never said what he is reported to have said there. that every time we confront these gentlemen with the statements attributed to them, they say that they never made them. If it has been denied I will not use it. Did the honourable member for Brisbane say that the whole difficulty revolved around the question as to the right of the men to wear the badge? Brisbane is present, and can answer for himself. He is twenty-one years of age. Brisbane was absolutely without justification; and when it took place, it should have been announced by those in authority that there was in existence a tribunal which could deal with the matters in dispute. not get to. and they did get to it. The men had filed a plaint which covered every possible question that could arise. Is that not so? question of wearing the badge.

The men had chosen thenown tribunal, and every possible question that could b raised, including preference to unionists, was included in their plaint. The law of Australia provided the men with a remedy, wen on the question of victimization.

The point I make is that this Parliament, with a view to securing industrial peace, provided at great expense the machinery for arbitration.. The men chose their own tribunal under 'the law, and the unions had then no right to go out on general strike, and attempt to starve a community into submission. I am referring to the general strike, and honourable members opposite may correct me if I am wrong as to the facts. The notice I have-, quoted was published-on 3rd May, 1911. and the men in the employ of the Tramway Company continued to work under it.

207,Mr Groom,"I am not going to discharged with having done so must prove that he did not do so. In October, 1911, a plaint was filed that included every possible term and condition in dispute between the parties. Beyond all doubt it included the question of the wearing of badges. The men had presumably been advised by their own lawyers to go to law and invoke the aid of the tribunal this Parliament has provided, and they had taken action under the law. man overlooks the fact that Mr Badger threatened that any man who dared to organize others for the purpose of taking advantage of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act should be "" sacked."" That is in his sworn evidence. kind of thing that we inserted a particular section in the Act providing that any one attempting victimization should be prosecuted. If Mr Badger committed a breach of the law, he can look for no sympathy from me. from the point of view of the general public of Australia. The people of Australia, becoming tired of these great industrial conflicts, and anxiously desiring to put an end to them, as they are themselves the persons most injured by them, provided proper machinery The tramway men selected their own machinery to deal with the dispute between them and the Tramway Company, and on the r 1 th October they filed their plaint, included in which, according to the resolution of the general committee, was the cause and act which constituted the ground for the general strike. unionists in the employ of the Tramway Company the Arbitration Court would have had 110 jurisdiction. may be right.

Instead of allowing a properly constituted legal tribunal to decide the question in dispute they took the law into their own hands, and forty-three unions in Brisbane endeavoured to force the community to compel the case to be decided before it went into Court. Did the people know the cause of that strike ? Here is Mr F-nlayson's own letter on the subjectI have consulted with Mr Brennan, M.P., of Brennan and Kundle, solicitors, Melbourne, who prepared the case for the Tramway Employees Association, and who is at present in Brisbane, and he assures me that this particular item is not so included. Further, I have to-day examined a certified copy of this claim, and assure the public that there is not a word of reference in it to the matter of wearinrr the badge.

217,Mr Groom,"A little later Mr FinlayFinlayson, as a man of honour, proceeded to correct it. But if he was misled as to the main issue in dispute, after consultation with Mr Brennan, and after examining a certified copy of the claim, what can be said of the hundreds of unfortunate men who went out on strike? has already stated that they knew nothing about it. He also knows, as a lawyer, that if the right of the men-to wear the badge was not included in the filed plaint, it could have been put in it at any time. have to consider is, "" Did the men go out nn strike after their right to wear the badge had been included in the plaint?"" has said that they were misled into the belief that that matter was not included in the plaint. correctly informed as to the situation. Then the honourable member for Batman, on the 2nd February, saidFirst, Mr Badger and his advisers are welcome to my acknowledgment that they are right on the unimportant matter of the detail raised since the commencement of the strike. The right to wear the badge is asserted in the plaint. For Mr Finlayson's misconception on that point I am willing to take the whole responsibility without going into explanations, the more so as that phase of the question has scarcely been adverted to anywhere except in Mr Finlayson's personal praiseworthy efforts to come nearer settlement. It is extraordinary that this cause-the denial of the right of the men to wear a badge-shoul d be the sole cause of their going out on strike. To give assurances without first making careful inquiry into -any matter is to accept a serious responsibility. Before proceeding further, I would like to ask the honourable member for Batman whether the report of a speech by him .which appears in the Tramway Journal is correct ? 'report.' The Brisbane cars were running, or some of them. They looked like river destroyers. The 'men of Melbourne complained of the inconvenience of car driving. They ought to be in Brisbane.

There was really no occasion for them. is at liberty to say what he likes. But I ask what was the general view of this particular strike? The honourable member for Herbert is * reported to have said that the general strike was "" unnecessary, cruel, and foolish."" Mr G. S. Beeby, a Labour member, Minister of Lands, New South Wales, declared at Orange that the general strike at Brisbane was "" ill-conceived, and a rash act of men blind to the fith. Minister of Works in New South Wales, said that a general strike was a "" nice blend of imbecility and barbarism."" The present Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, under the heading of "" The Case for Labour"" in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, saidThe general strike is not practicable, and, if it were, it would not be effective. It is but a nightmare, which, if by any chance translated into actualitv, would mean social suicide. It is the wildest and most extravagant travesty of trade unionism. The Transport Workers Council of New South Wales, embracing seamen, marine engineers, wharf labourers, and carters, passed resolutions in which it was declared that the principles of general strikes are illogical and injure indiscriminately and wantonly destroy amicable relations. . . . Therefore, the joint Executive of the Transport Workers Council, comprising the Sydney branches of the Australian Institute of Marine Engineers, the Federated Seamen's Union, the Merchants Service Guild, the Australian Wharf Labourers Union, and the Trolley, Draymen, and Carters Union, informs the members of the above organization that it will be considered and treated as an offence to tlie organization concerned if any member of any of the foregoing societies ceases work on or boycotts any vessel in New South Wales waters from sympathy with the Brisbane strike. The Waterside Workers Federation of Australia say in their official organ, speaking of the general strikeIts leaders and spokesmen, by their errors, excesses, recklessness, and ambition, are bringing dishonour to the party and compromising the cause, by causing, as they did a few weeks ago, a disaster to unionism in Brisbane.

Is it denied that the Minister of Defence made such a statement? is out of town. agree with preference to unionists? being equal. be preference, at any rate. able member penalize non-unionists? the non-unionists, as you have in the past. ception of politics opposite-that we "" fellows "" shall look after the non-unionists, while they look after the unionists. Honourable members opposite, who, when elected, ought to represent the whole of the citizens, admit that they are partisan in action and sectional in aim. I wish to say one thing more in reply to the Attorney General, whose utterances it is interesting to contrast with those of the Prime Minister. We are to have submitted referenda proposals dealing with trusts and combines, monopolies, and industrial legislation. So far as trusts and combines of an injurious nature are concerned, had the Government accepted the offer of honourable members on this side, they would have had the power. We were willing that power should be taken to deal with combines and monopolies in restraint of trade, commerce, and manufacture in any part of the Commonwealth, but Ministers would not accept our offer. The Attorney-General tells us that the present law is not effective, but that it can be made so. He has done nothing to make it effective. He has also told us that he does not believe in harassing trusts and combines. His method is to nationalize. Why does he not say so? The Prime Minister says that he believes' in industrial legislationI believe that our civilization, advancement, jections to which I ""felt bound to reply to and security can be better promoted in that way than by any other method I know of. It is for that reason I regret the attempt to make this an issue now, or at the next election. The Attorney-General, on the other hand, says that no legislation will put an end to industrial unrest, which he says will exist so long as the present conditions continue. He thinks that the time will arrive when the people will come into its own-h e does not believe in profit-sharing. To him companies and co-operative societies, presumably, are in nature the same as trusts and combines. The industrial co-operative village settlements, which the honourable member for New England says will populate the Northern Territory, would come under the condemnation of the Attorney General. The one thing the honourable gentleman has in view is nationalization, the community owning all sources of production, distribution, and exchange. That is the real reason for the constitutional alterations which he desires. Why do not the Government declare this publicly, and say that their policy is one of nationalization ; that they desire only to alter the Constitution to obtain power to nationalize the' means of production and exchange? needed to deal with trusts. America has found that out to her sorrow. member believe in tackling the problem ? trusts the right to nationalize.

The aims and objects of the Labour party are what I have stated. Yesterday the Attorney-General made point of the speeches of the honourable members for ,Ballarat and Flinders as reported in the press. Why did he not point out that, an incomplete report of the Liberal programme appeared in the press; that the honourable member for Flinders criticised this incomplete report, and that it was subsequently that the honourable member for Ballarat spoke, and then referred to the complete programme? I have spoken at greater length than I intended, partly because of interavoid the suggestion that I was not prepared to answer them. I submit with the greatest confidence-that, although the Ministry started with high ideals, it has dragged them down, and the party no longer voices",33,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

261,Mr Groom,"D o what the honorablethe national sentiment. Its members are partisan in action and sectional in aim, and incapable of realizing the great national obligations imposed by the Constitution. have listened to the debate with more than usual interest, because of the prominence given to the Brisbane strike, and I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Darling Downs on the way in which they have presented their view of that industrial dispute. In replying to their speeches, I am faced with a serious difficulty. It is impossible to refute all of their very many misstatements, although several were obviously self-contra.dictory, and I am forced, therefore, to be content with a plain, free statement of what T know and saw. I was in Brisbane at the inception of the trouble and during the general strike, in which I took an active part, and I therefore speak now from actual knowledge, and not from hearsay. The statements of the Leader of the Opposition show that his sources of information were one-sided and partial. Although there are other matters in the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General to which T should like to refer, I shall confine my remarks now to the Brisbane strike, knowing that subsequently there will be other opportunities to deal with questions which, to my mind, are at the moment of less imporance. In 1904 the employees of the Brisbane Tramway Company attempted to form a union. Let me read the following extracts from evidence on oath given in the Arbitration Court by the secretary of their union. Mr Champ joined the company's service in 1902, and in 1904 he was the official secretary. He said in his evidenceWhen was the first attempt made lo your knowledge ? In 1904. There was a meeting called, and a number of employees, about 260, expressed their desire to form a union and to try and get better conditions. The result was on the following day a number of men were called to head office and dismissed. Mr Champ was asked whether any other attempt was made to form a union, and he saidYes, there was another attempt made, but that also was frustrated by the management. What year?-1908 . A number of employees tried to form a union and a couple of the most prominent men were dismissed at that time, and the men thought it was because these men had taken a prominent part in the union. Throughout Mr Champ's evidence he stated again and again that the men who took any active part whatever in the formation of a union of Brisbane tramway employees were promptly dealt with and dismissed from their employment. Of course, various trivial excuses for their dismissal were given. The Tramway Company never professedly dismissed any man because he was a unionist, and its books do not show any such record. Certainly not. The weakness of the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act lies at that point. Just where the honourable member for Darling Downs said that it was so strong it is weakest. The Act requires that employees must not be dismissed merely because they are unionists. But it is always impossible to prove that a man has been dismissed merely because he was a unionist. In 1908 the Queensland Government proposed to bring the tramway employees under a Wages Board. The Tramway Company opposed the formation of a Wages Board, and offered their men an agreement to sign. Each man was asked when he came to the office to sign an agreement which offered him an increase of wages to the extent of 3s. a week. The men refused to sign, and the Minister declined to ratify any such agreement, insisting that a Wages Board should be appointed to deal with tlie claims of the tramway men. That Board gave them an increase in wages of 4s. 6d. a week, as against the 3s. offered by the company. In 1908 also a very peculiar circumstance came to light in connection with the management of the affairs of the company, and its relations towards the union. At that time Mr Badger, the manager of the company, made it publicly understood amongst the employees that under no consideration would he allow anything in the shape of a union amongst them; and from that time we may date the continual irritation and disturbance that occurred as between the employees of the Brisbane Tramway Company and their manager. It is to the credit of Mr Badger that his attitude all through has been well known. He has made no secret of his hostility to the existence of a union under any circumstances. But we are living in an age when workmen demand that they shall have some say as ,to the conditions under which they are expected to make their living. The time has gone past when men are simply the tools of their masters; when employers can say to a man, "" Go, and he goeth,"" or "" Come, and he cometh,"" without any consideration of his will or as to whether what is commanded is in his interest or not.",34,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
262,Mr Finlayson (Brisbane) [4.56],"Ilike what occurred under the centurion of old. a long way since those days, and much water has flowed under the bridges in the interval. The men of to-day are demanding some say as to the conditions under which they live, f t is far too late in the day for any company to assume the right to refuse to men permission to combine for their mutual protection. Such an attitude is in fact an abrogation of the very conditions of society as they now exist, although it may be a continuation of ideas that at one time prevailed. Until IQIO there was continual discontent, and, at length, in that year, a union was formed. At this time the Tramway -Employes Association of Australia came into existence. Fifty of the employees of the Brisbane company were willing to become members of that body. As soon as that fact was known urgent efforts were made to block the association from being registered in the Courts of the Commonwealth. I invite honourable members to consider this position-that the Courts of the Commonwealth were deliberately, purposely, and specifically made open to associations'of working men in any industry. They were in fact invited to form themselves into associations, and to be registered under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. But the tramway companies, and especially the Brisbane company, did everything possible to hinder and resist the registration of their employees. singular exhibition of partisanship on the part of a State Government, which, I hope, will never be repeated in Australia. On December, 1910, in the Queensland Parliament, Mr Ryott Maughan moved the adjournment of the House in order that he might call attention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, the action of the Queensland Government in using the public funds for the purpose of defeating the aims and objects of the Australian Tramway Employes Association of Australia. In the course of his speech, Mr Ryott Maughan statedAs a matter of fact, some years ago six or eight men were discharged from the Brisbane Tramways Company for daring, not only to advocate unionism, but to become unionists; and they were only taken back into the employ of the company on condition that they would have nothing to do in future with unionism. . . In fact, I think it is quite unprecedented for any Premier, whether it be in the States or the Commonwealth, to have gone as far as the honourable gentleman did yesterday in supplying non-union labour with funds to practically fight the union movement. Mr Kidston was then Premier of Queensland, and in reply he saidI might just mention the fact that some two years ago, or something less, the timber merchants here were summoned to Melbourne in the same way, and, in the same way, they came to the Government asking for some form of assistance. The PREMIER -Fo r financial assistance. They wanted the Government to fight the matter for them in Melbourne, and I told them at the time that I considered they were quite competent to take their own part; that I did not think they needed financial assistance from the Government at a l l ; and they went, and they did fight their own case in Melbourne, and they won. But that had nothing at all to do with the Government. Tlie main argument used in the debate was that the Government was using the funds of the public to fight the unionists, and particularly to prevent the tramway employees from registering under the Commonwealth Act. It was one of those unfortunate instances in which a Stale Government, owing to their remarkable prejudice against the National Government, have sought to defeat and to reduce to impotence the acts of the National Parliament. Mr Blair during the debate saidI am sorry to hear such a statement as that which has just come from the Premier of this State. I do not think there is any one in this Chamber, or outside, who looks at this matter from a dispassionate point of view, who can come to any other conclusion than that a scandalous misuse of public funds has been perWhen that occurred we had a petrated by the man who, for the time being, has headed this State politically. . . . If assistance is to be given by the State to any individual or body of individuals to fight their case before any Court, where is it going to end? If the State were going to provide legal assistance both in civil and criminal matters indiscriminately, I would have no locus standi; but if exceptional treatment is going to be meted out with the funds of the taxpayer-to be handed out to help whatever. It is tantamount to nothing more than class assistance, and the Premier has given the whole case away when he states that he would use the funds of the State to resist any attack by the Commonwealth Government on our system of Wages Boards. of the Labour party? conjunction with the Labour party, but he has since gone over.

It is the most pernicious thing that I have ever heard of in Queensland, I am speaking strongly, because I feel strongly. If this House were conscious of what is being done they would rise in a body and protest against such a thing. One more quotation and I shall have completed my references to this debate in the Queensland Parliament. strike fame, during the debate saidThis articleAn article relating to an interview which the discontents had with the Premiergoes on :"" And different attempts have been made to get them to form a union secretly, but somehow or other the "" Boss"" always got to know who were trying to organize, and any one in the company's employ with ginger enough in his composition to talk of combining to get better conditions got the sack."" It says here"" A couple of months ago a motorman happened to suggest forming a union, and he was given his walking ticket a couple of days afterwards."" My purpose in quoting these statements is to show that the tramwaymen's union has been opposed, obstructed, and hindered in every possible way. We have reached an unfortunate position of affairs when we have the spectacle of the Premier of a State going out of his way to use public money to provide counsel to oppose the registration of a union when the National Parliament has invited that and other unions to register under the Commonwealth Act. the company? That attempt to block the tramwaymen's union failed. ' Despite every obstacle that was placed in the way of its registration, the union on 15th December, 1910, received a certificate of registration as a properlyestablished organization of men engaged in an industry in Australia. The men then took the very honourable course of advising the company without delay that they had received their certificate .of registration. The company was made officially aware of that fact on 18th January, 1911. I have looked through the correspondence that passed between the company and the union at the time, and I find that in the most courteous manner the members of the union iii Brisbane asked that the correspondence between the company and its employees concerning matters affecting the conditions of the employees should be conducted through Mr Blair went on to their association. The company was advised as to the names of the officers of the association, but every effort made to secure the recognition of the association by the company utterly and miserably failed. Then Mr Badger, who had been on a holiday to the Old Country, returned to Brisbane, and the request was repeated, only to be met by a distinct and absolute refusal to recognise that there was any union in existence. Throughout the strike, Mr Mr Coyne, of Badger refused to admit that there was any such union, and at times he distinctly stated that there was not. Although the union held its certificate of registration from the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, Mr Badger refused to admit that such a union existed. I come now to the plaint before the Court. The honourable member for DarlingDowns sought to make a good deal of capital out of the fact that the men had the Conciliation and Arbitration Court open to them, and he said that they ought to have used it. Honourable members ought to know that as early as July, 1911, a plaint was filed in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. For several reasons, however, it was not proceeded with. It was finally withdrawn, and a new plaint, which is now before the Court, was filed on n t h October, 1911. Immediately that plaint had been filed, notice was given that the Brisbane Tramway Company were going to ask for the cancellation of the registration of the union, and were going to deny the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine the plaint. Further than that, I wish to point out the action that was taken say. by the Brisbane Tramway Company to defeat the union in its effort to get this plaint heard by the Court. I have here the sworn evidence given by Mr Simmons before the Court in reference to the petition against the registration of the association. He was askedDid Mr Dalby say anything to you?

276,Mr Finlayson,"Mr Frew, on beWil l you give me your word of honour that you won't join the union? I can now take your word that you will have nothing to do with the Tramway Union? One of the first actions which Mr Badger took on his return from Europe was to give the men notice that their recreation clubs were to be vacated. Previously at each of the three depots the men had recreation clubs which were open to every tramway employee. To show how fond Mr Badger was of unionSj and to point out his consistency in regard to the actual formation of a union, he gave the recreation club unionists seven days to take their goods out of the rooms. After a short time he installed billiard tables and all sorts of games in the rooms, and formed what he now calls the Brisbane Tramway Employes Union, which is strictly limited to non-unionists, that is to non-members of the Tramway Employes Association. The recreation club rooms are now closed against members of that association, and only members of the Brisbane Tramway Employes Union are allowed to enter. That shows the kind of treatment which employees who believe in trade unionism have had to put up with. way with the wearing ot the badge. The Leader of the Opposition said that this is the matter on which the whole battle was fought, and that it was a very trivial one. All through the piece we have been told that the question of wearing the badge was so small and so mean as to be absolutely ridiculous as an argument for entering upon such a strike. matter a little fire kindleth."" Honourable members who know anything of history will easily remember that in all the affairs of the world a very small matter, which has been sometimes quite outside the real circumstances involved, has brought about a crisis. MightI , for instance, suggest an analogy? It has been said that because the Sepoys were asked to bite off the ends of the cartridges, which were greased with pigs' fat, the Indian Mutiny was brought about. Who believes that statement? That request was only the little spark which ignited the powder. Who believes that the Boer War was fought because President Kruger refused to give the franchise to foreigners in his country? I found a most interesting illustration of that in a Melbourne newspaper the other day. In contrast to these nameless thunderbolts were the two short, sharp, and decisive amendaffairs already in your paper, and I have said ments that unseated two Ministries in 1904. The Deakin Government went down on the omission of the three words in the Conciliation and those rules still hold good. and Arbitration Bill ""does' not include,"" in relation to Commonwealth and State public servants. Later on Colonel J. W. McCay successfully moved the omission of a clause in the same measure which gave preference in employmentto unionists, and the Watson Government resigned. Does any one imagine that the Deakin Government were put out because of the meaning of those three words "" does not include "" ? We know that they were not.m was because their administration and control of affairs was considered unsatisfactory by .the House. not on those lines, but On the merits of that particular question. The honourable member does not realize what a great question it was. of history have, in the same way, arisen from very small and, apparently, trifling causes. I wish now to give honourable members the facts in regard to the wearing of the badge. On 2nd May, 19.11, the Brisbane tramway men, for the first time, I want to deal now in a brief appeared in procession with the other unionists of Brisbane. They took part in the Eight Hours Day precession. They had previously asked permission to wear their uniforms in the procession, but that permission was denied them. They, however, wore the red badge of the Eight Hours Union as they walked in the procession, and men who belonged to the union, and "" Behold how great a were on that day employed on the cars, also wore the Eight Hours Union badge. Next morning there appeared the ukase at the office of the Tramway Company expressly forbidding any employ^ of the company to wear any badge other than the badge of the company. Immediately the employees identified themselves with the other unionists of Brisbane this ukase appeared. Then arose the question of the use of the badge, and dismissals and victimization immediately followed. Before passing from this point, I might refer to the fact that the right to apply the regulation prohibiting the use of the badge has always been challenged. The company has claimed that it was a rule of the company. Mr Badger, referring to the matter, saidI-Ie had informed the men that work was there for them, provided that they abided by the rules of the company, which they clearly understood. You have had a f u l l statement of that the rules and regulations of the company did not permit of the wearing of the badges,,",38,Witness Yes He Told Me That Would Be The

280,Mr Finlayson,"Many great eventsMr Hardacre, M.L.A., in the Brisbane Daily Mail called attention to this fact: That, according to the Brisbane Tramways Act, no by-law can be enforced until approved by the Governor in Council and published in the Government Gazette. He alleged, further, that this particular by-law of the company had not been submitted to the Government for approval, and, therefore, had n<jt the force of a regulation of the company. In support of that, I quote what Mr Justice Higgins said when the matter came before him. The order issued by Mr Badger on 3rd May, 1911, as it was not approved by the Governor in Council or published in Ihe Gazette, was, in He stated at one time that he would not my opinion, unauthorized and invalid. And yet, on the strength of that unauthorized and invalid regulation, Mr Badger denied the right of these men to wear that or any other badge of membership. After all, by what legal right can anybody give another the right to wear a badge, or take from him that right. Every man in every community claims, not the legal right, but the moral right, to wear the badge of any union or religious association he chooses to belong to. He claims the right to wear the badge of any craft, industry, or organization of which he is a member. Indeed, most of us are proud to be able to display our badges of membership in order to show that we are identified with a particular society, trade organization, or church. Yet Mr Badger, when, on the. 15th January, he was faced with the decision of the men to wear their badge, immediately declared that unless they conformed to the rules of the company, they would have to take the consequences. Now, why did the men decide to wear a badge? 1 sliall tell honourable members in a very few words. From the time the plaintwas lodged until the decision to wear the badge was arrived at, there had been a continuous secession of members and succession of resignations from the Tramway Employes Association. Between the time of the lodging of the plaint in October and the decision to wear the badge in January, over 100 resignations were received by the Tramway Employes Union. It is somewhat significant that all these resignations came from the one office, and were all merely typewritten forms, with a blank left for a signature to be filled in. They had all been signed at the same solicitor's office in Brisbane, and had all clearly emanated from one source. When the matter was investigated, it was easily proved that the men were being told on the trams ing them ever since. Mr Finlayson. to go up to Mr Dalby's office to see about something, and when they got there they were asked to sign the resignation form. evidence of vicious victimization ? And yet the men who refused to be victimized were to be shot down ! bers will see the difficulty in which the employees were placed. Their case was coming before the Court, and Mr Badger had stated definitely his intention to oppose its getting to the Court at every step, and to fight it through the Courti f it got there. only fight in that Court, but in every other possible Court to which he could take the matter. It must be remembered that, before the men could get a standing in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, they had to be able to show that they were a registered association. If Mr Badger could have come before the Court with a statement that the men did not represent the tramway employees; that, for instance, there were 500 employees, and the association comprised only 100 or 200 members, or a very small proportion of the total number of employees, the.Court would have had to take, cognisance of that objection, and it would have been a very strong objection to overcome. In such circumstances the Brisbane Tramway Employes Association would have no standing in the Court. Mr Badger's whole purpose and sole reason for his action was to reduce the membership of the Tramways Association in Brisbane, and so leave them without a standing in the Arbitration Court when the case came before it. Hence the victimization and threats of dismissal. Hence, also, the resignations from the association of a number of men who sent them in in order to save their positions. It was necessary, in the circumstances, for the employees. to do something to protect themselves, and what more reasonable, natural, or effective decision could they have come to than to say, "" Well, every man who belongs to the union must show his badge "" ? Honourable members will remember that not two years ago, when the Melbourne Tramway Company threatened to dismiss men because they decided to wear a badge, some of us very anxiously watched at a certain hour of the day to see whether the tramway employees would wear their badge.",39,Witness Yes He Told Me That Would Be The

283,Mr Fenton,"And they have been wearwearing them ever since. The Melbourne Tramway Company had more sense than to refuse its employees permission to wear a badge. The Brisbane tramway employees, in order to protect their own interests, and to secure a standing in the Arbitration Court, decided that they would pursue exactly the same course as the Melbourne employees had taken. Consequently, they resolved that on the 18th January they would wear the badge. before the Court then? is that the mills of the Arbitration Court grind exceedingly slowly, and the employees of the Brisbane Tramway Association had been so obstructed in their efforts that they began to doubt if they would ever get their case before that tribunal. It was some time in November when I became acquainted with the facts. I was asked by the employees if I would see what could be done to expedite the submission of their claim to the Court. I accepted a position upon the Federal Council of their association, with that one object in view. Whilst we were endeavouring to get the case before the Arbitration Court, Mr Badger was doing his utmost to prevent that. It has been said in this House that an agitator from Melbourne visited Brisbane, and that the men were misled by their leaders. The Leader of the Opposition particularly mentioned the honourable member for Batman and myself as having misled them upon the question of whether or not the right of the men to wear the badge was included in the plaint filed. I can assure honourable members that I took absolutely not the slightest part in inducing the tramway employees to wear the badge, or in advising them in the conduct of their negotiations. They held two meetings in Brisbane, at both of which it was unanimously decided that on the 18th Jaunary they would wear the badge for the purpose of closing up their ranks, and preventing further defections from their union, which defections would have shattered all their hopes in regard to the Arbitration Court. subject? has never been naturalized. He was kind enough upon one occasion to give me his reasons for declining to be naturalized, and I think that they are rather good ones. He was living in the hope that he would be able to return to America, and he consequently said, "" If I become naturalized here it will take me seven years to regain my American citizenship rights."" member sure that he is an American? adopts all the American methods. I can assure honourable members that the statement that the Brisbane tramway employees were influenced in their decision to wear the badge is absolutely without foundation. To my certain knowledge no member of the Queensland Parliament took any part whatever in the meetings that they held. The men acted entirely upon their own initiative. They decided that they would wear the badge on the 18th January, and on that day each man as he arrived at the dep6t, or at certain streets with his car, was accosted by an inspector and instructed to report himself at the office. When the men so reported themselves they were told off for the day. Every man presented himself for duty next morning in the usual way, and they were then asked, "" Are you going to take off that badge?"" Upon answering in the negative, they were told, "" Very well, there is no work for you today."" The employees received their badges some time in August. They wore them on their private clothes. One manMr .Reah-happene d to be called to the head office one day upon some matter of business. He went there after he had had lunch, in his private clothes, and wearing his badge. He had concluded his business, and was leaving the office when the secretary suddenly asked, "" What is thaf you are wearing?"" He replied, "" That is my medal."" Thereupon the secretary said, "" How dare you come into the tramway office wearing the badge of the Tramway Association."" Between 18th January, when the men decided to wear the badge, and the 30th January, when the general strike took place, continuous efforts were made by the men to discuss the matter with Mr Badger, with a view to arriving at an amicable settlement. I hold in my hand a report of an interview which they had with him on the day after they decided to wear the badge. It readsThe expected interview .between some of the more prominent of the union tramway men and Mr Badger, general manager or the company, took place at about 3 p.m. yesterday, when nine men were admitted to Mr Badger's office. About a quarter of an hour later the men emerged from the office, and informed their waiting comrades outside that Mr Badger had insisted on the discontinuance of the wearing of the badges, but to this they had not consented.

Mr Badger afterwards stated that he merely had informed the men that their positions were open to them in the morning provided they observed the rules laid down by the company, one of which was that no badges should be' worn. He had no desire, he added, to dismiss any of the men, particularly as some of them were old and trusted servants of the company, but the rules of the company must be complied with. Mr There was not even a suggestion or hint of Badger further stated that the number of men who had come out was greater than he had expected, but he understood that this was partly tiie result of intimidation. In the course of the interview Mr Badger was asked if he would receive a deputation from the union. He replied that he was willing to receive a deputation from the men as employees of the company, but not otherwise. I have no hesitation in saying that the sent representatives, some with absolute strike would never have taken place if Mr Badger had uttered five words during the discretion as to the decision, and some with progress of the negotiations-if he had authority merely to report to their unions. merely said, "" I recognise the men's On the Tuesday the unions received reports union."" From the 18th January to the from their delegates; and every union with23rd January the Tramway Union did its out exception unanimously decided to go best to enter into negotiations with the out on strike in favour of the tramway men.

Every effort was made, That these unions were called on or rehonestly and conscientiously, to prevent quested to strike is untrue; they themselves further trouble, but without result. No decided to come out-that is the truth of other course was therefore open to the emthe matter. The resolution they passed ployes but to appeal to the Australian was as follows :Labour Federation, with which their union was affiliated. Immediately the federation took the matter up, it forwarded the folunions, recognising that the action of the Brislowing letter to the Tramway Company :The matter in dispute between the Brisbane Tramway Company and the Australian Tramway Employees' Association, Queensland branch, having been referred to this council, a body with which the latter association is affiliated, I have' in the meantime a satisfactory settlement is been instructed to inform you that my executive desire to confer with you at your earliest convenience on matters relative to the present dispute, and hope you will acquiesce in their desire, when it is anticipated that a settlement satisfactory to all parties will be the result. That was surely a fair and honourable request for an understanding. Mr Badger's reply was as follows:Dear Sir, This is to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 21st inst., and to say, in reply, that I see -no justification or good reason for a conference such as your letter suggests. I am quite prepared, and have at all times been prepared, to discuss any matter on reasonable lines with any employee or employees of the company, and to consider any suggestions from them which might lead to the satisfactory adjustment of the position which has been created by the refusal (temporary, I trust) of some of the company's employees to observe the regulations under which they have hitherto served. Yours truly, J. S. BADGER, General Manager. Mr Finlayson. That locked the door once more, and left the men against a brick wall, Mr Badger taking the position, "" Do what we say, or else there is no business."" Honourable members opposite hold up arbitration and conciliation as a remedy; but their position becomes utterly impossible when it is pointed out that every effort in this direction was met with an absolute and direct refusal by the company and its officials. compromise or conciliation made that was not indignantly refused by the manager. Honourable members are already aware that trade unionists in Brisbane were consulted ; and here "" I must call attention to a flagrant misstatement. The unions were asked to send representatives to a meeting 011 the Sunday afternoon. Each union This meeting of delegates, representing 43 bane Tramway Company in prohibiting its employees wearing badges, the symbol of unionism, constitutes an attack on the principles of unionism recognised under Statute law, Federal and State, resolves that a general cessation of work takes place on Tuesday, 30th inst., unless arrived at. The strike committee met on Sunday evening and appointed officers. On the Monday morning they sent to Mr Badger, saying that they would meet him at any time or place to suit his convenience, in order to arrive at a settlement. Mr Badger announced through the press that he was not going to send a reply; and he never acknowledged the invitation sent by the forty-three trade unions to meet in conference. The honourable member for Darling Downs quoted a number of authorities, good in his opinion, as to the ""imbecility."" ""stupidity,"" and ""'foolishness"" of the strike. Let me now quote from that particular friend of the Opposition, the Melbourne Age, on the ist FebruarySeldom or never has a great crisis been balanced on a more puerile triviality than the",41,Witness Yes He Told Me That Would Be The

292,Mr Finlayson,"Perhaps he is.general strike now proceeding in Brisbane. If reports which have reached us describing the .genesis of the event are accurate, Australia has public who asked to see them; but, as a been acquainted with a man whose name will go down to industrial history as a monument of -stubbornness and stupidity. Mr Badger is the manager of the Brisbane Tramway Company. Those employees of the -company who are trade unionists claim the right elsewhere almost universally conceded to the workers of their genre, badges during their hours of service. People of common sense and independent spirit are generally agreed that the custom is ridiculous, bewhen he said that the public would discause all badges are in essence certificates of servitude, and there is nothing to be gained which any self-respecting person can covet by advertising himself the servant of a sectional order. . . . He read into the men's demand an intention to abuse the right they claimed as a means of oppressing their non-unionist associates, and subverting the discipline of the service. He assumed that they were determined to twist a lawful right lo a wrongful -purpose. In short, he prejudices the men's case, and arbitrarily convicted them of a deliberately -criminal determination. . . . out the men for wearing their union medals, Mr Badger has effectively dragged the dispute -out of the industrial sphere, and made it an issue of purely human rights The men -claimed to exercise a right which, however silly vid trumpery it may be, is a common right to all enfranchised humanity. The manager dis-dained lo wait and discover whether or not the men would collectively abuse their right and -convert it into a social wrong. He assumed that they Avould so abuse it, and he punished the men accordingly. He stands, therefore, in this position : Because the men in his employ presumed to enforce a right which the law of the land allows them, he deprived them of the right to work and live in his company's employ. The reason given by Mr Badger for not .approving of the badges was that those who -did not wear them were liable to be abused by the public; and that the wearing of badges would create strife and ill-feeling -amongst the employees, by making a distinction, which was not good or desirable. What wonderful consideration for the feelings of non-unionists. There was no suggestion that the wearing of the badge would cause any trouble with the public; there was no suggestion that the men who wore the badges would be discriminated or .objected to by the public; but there was a fine consideration shown for the feelings fof the non-unionists because some of the public, it was said, might object to the men who did not wear them. It is a good thing that some of the public take an interest in seeing whether unionists wear their -medals or not, and that, when buying goods, they wish to know whether they are union made. On that auspicious day, when sthe Melbourne tramway employees first wore their medals, there were members of the matter of fact, the public regard the trams merely as a public utility, and do not care whether the men are unionists or not, so long as travelling facilities are afforded. People do not travel on the trams because they are worked by union men or otherto wear union wise. Mr Badger made an unfair, unreasonable, and unwarranted statement criminate against the men who did not wear the union medal. I am glad that the honourable member for Darling Downs gave me some credit for trying to arrive at a settlement, though I do not claim any particular credit for myself. As the representative of Brisbane in this National Parliament, I did what I honestly thought was the right and proper thing to arrive at an honourable solution of the difficulty. By locking The honourable member for Darling Downs did not inform the House, when dealing with my position, that on the 27 th JanuaryI inserted a letter in the Courier in which I appealed for a settlement of the dispute. A private citizen of Brisbane had, at my instigation, submitted to Mr Badger on the Friday certain proposals, but he absolutely failed to get those proposals accepted. WhatI suggested in the letter which appeared in the Courier on the Saturday was that the men should temporarily abandon their claim to wear the badge, and that Mr Badger should not insist on the right to prohibit it-that the question should be suspended and referred to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Unfortunately, as I say, the suggestions I made were not taken up by the public; indeed, there was correspondence)' mostly anonymous, in the press, in which the idea v was described as somewhat ridiculous. Next day Mr Badger stated in a press'interview that it was useless to discuss my suggestion, because the matter of the badge was already in the plaint; and I made the reply read by the honourable member for Darling Downs. At that time. I did not know, and the members of the Tramway Employe's Union did not know, that the matter of the badge was in the plaint. The question did not arise then.

The Premier of Queensland, in his letter to the Prime Minister asking for the aid of the military, stated that a shot had been fired to prevent the arrest of a striker. That is absolutely untrue. I notice that the honourable member for Darling Downs very skilfully avoided all reference to that point. But he quoted a letter which I wrote to the Brisbane Courier after I got home on the Thursday night. I went home late and had some dinner. HereI may assure honourable members that I managed to get my breakfast, dinner, and tea each day during the strike without any trouble. I frequently lunched in town. I know of no man or woman in Brisbane who went without meals during that time. We had had processions on the Wednesday and the Thursday. On the Thursday night I was addressing a meeting in the market square when Mr Moir, the secretary to the strike committee, came down and interposed, saying that he wanted to make an announcement. He said to the people, "" I wish to tell you that, in reply to our request for permission to hoH a procession to-morrow, the same as yesterday and today, the Commissioner of Police has given an absolute refusal. Men and women, there will be no procession to-morrow."" [10]2 Honourable members can perhaps imagine my feelings when I commenced to address the meeting again.

The refusal is wrong, but to-morrow will be a critical time in the history of this strike. ToA few weeks later I received a morrow will prove what you men and women are made of. As you come into town to-morrow make up your minds that there is going to be no procession. We are going to show as men and women worthy of the name, and as unionists, that we can. stand up for our cause and show loyalty to our principles, no matter what may be done."" It was after I got home from that A gentlemeeting that I wrote 'the letter which has' been quoted by the honourable member for Darling Downs. It was after midnight, and after I had made another most serious effort-on e of the most earnest efforts of my life-to arrive at peace. I dreaded the next day, and, as I said in the letter, felt that we were on .the edge of a volcano. My reason for that was that there were 20,000 men loose about the streets with I will deal by-and-by with nothing to do. While we had them in processions we could control them; but there was danger from having 20,000 men idle under those circumstances. Some of them were not particularly choice, characters. They were true men and good unionists, but many of them were men accustomed in their ordinary avocations to a bit of rough and tumble. I was of opinion that to have them loose about the streets, uncontrolled by their leaders, was a serious position. May I say here that I make no claim to have been a leader during that strike. I was neither a member of the strike committee nor of the tramway men's executive. I was simply a private individual doing my very best to right a wrong, and to preserve"" the peace. Friday dawned, and such a scene as Brisbane showed on that day will, I hope, never be repeated in Australia. Lined up across the square were armed policemen, mounted and on foot, with cartridges and fixed bayonets. But there was no attempt to form a procession.

The whole purpose of these shopkeepers, warehousemen, and others in closing down their places of business was to starve the. strikers into submission. Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 7.45 p.m. journed for dinner I was showing that, so far from the unions of Brisbane being responsible in any way for the stoppage of the food supplies of the city, it was owing to the action of the employers themselves-the merchants, the bakers, and the tradespeople generally-if there was any difficulty in the people being able to secure supplies. if those letters were meant for publication or not? never meant to see the light of day; they were private letters. In his address the Leader of the Opposition said that honest citizens could not go about their business or obtain supplies in the absence of permits from the strike committee. Now. the very fact that the strike committee issued these permits was the first real guarantee which the people had that food supplies would be available. The bakers had decided that they would close, and that no more bread would be baked after ThursDoes the day. The tradespeople had decided to close on the FridayI find that on Friday, 2nd February, a notification was issued by the Home Secretary that in consequence of all operative bakers having been called out, the master bakers were unable to continue the supplying of bread and flour, and many families in the city and suburbs would be prevented from obtaining a supply of bread or flour. The Government would therefore deliver to any depot indicated, requiring just the bare cost thereof. There is another statement to show that a supply of food was available. The tradespeople said, "" We will not supply anr",45,Witness Yes He Told Me That Would Be The

Whatever may be the reasons, it is very certain that the tradespeople used some influence to prevent the Government letting the public know what the bare cost of flour was, because there was none issued. added this significant statement, which, in view of something I shall have to say regarding the call for military aid, is rather peculiar. "" Adequate police protection,"" he said, "" will be afforded to all concerned."" After the request for the military had been made, and before a reply had been received, it was stated that there was adequate police protection available for the protection of the food supplies of the city. A good deal was made as to the supply of ice to the general hospitals. I wish to give the actual facts. In its issue of the 16th February, the Courier saidI t is a source of gratification to know that and which I hope will never occur again Birt and Company's cold stores in Stanleystreet did not suspend operations during the strike. Inquiries elicited the information that the butchers' rooms were open, butter was stored, and ice was manufactured. In fact, during the industrial trouble, the routine work continued as if nothing out of the way had occurred -whic h we decided should not be held. Yet the most harrowing pictures were drawn,-and the most startling statements have been made, that children were allowed to die in the hospitals for the want of ice ; that sick people were simply being killed through the cruel, heartless action of the strike committee. Here is a statement made in regard to the supplies to the hospitals in the Courier of the ifith FebruaryAt a meeting of the committee of the General superintendent reported that the strike had affected the hospital only in respect of the stoppage of work on the new pavilion. . . . They had to do a little carting of ice, butter, coal, & c , but the contractor had seen that the hospital suffered little inconvenience. been very quiet. The closing of the hotels was to the advantage of the hospital. The refractory ward, which had been occupied for months past, was entirely out of commission until the hotels were re-opened. It had been reported that the hospital had been crowded with casualties, but admissions, both indoor and outdoor, had been few, there being only two cases of importance connected with the disturbance. It is also remarkable to notice that the Courier admits, in its report of the public meeting held on the ist February, that "" the speeches were again marked by a strenuous appeal for good conduct."" All Mr Finlayson. these things, I take it, go to show that, so They said, far from there being any danger or any undue excitement in the air which might lead to rioting or misconduct, the contrary was the case. Considering that there were 20,000 unionists about the streets doing nothing, the city was unusually quiet. During that week and the week following, the police The Home Secretary court cases were remarkably few in number. There were no serious crimes. There was more crime in Melbourne during the week of the strike than there was in Brisbane. When the appeal for military aid was made certain things had not happened. To my mind, the most serious thing which occurred during the whole progress of the strike was that the appeal for military aid for the protection of the affairs of Brisbane was made while matters were quiet. After that appeal had been sent to the Prime Minister, and before a reply was received, there occurred one of the most disgraceful exhibitions of force, and the use of force, which have ever occurred in the course of a strike, in Australia. On the Friday morning, as I informed honourable members, armed police, with fixed bayonets, were drawn across the streets to prevent a procession which it was never intended to hold Evidently annoyed that all their carefully laid plans should collapse, that every opportunity they had hoped to enjoy of batoning the citizens of Brisbane had been frustrated by some means or other, the police got loose when they were dispersed from the square. Who gave the order, or whether an order was given or not, is quite uncertain. No statement has yet been made by any person that anything hapHospital yesterday, the medical pened on the Friday morning to justify what was done.

The worse it could say was going to be said. Nothing that would in any way reflect credit upon the strikers was likely to appear in the Brisbane Courier. what singular that the honourable member should quote these newspapers as reliable authorities on this occasion, and repudiate them on all other occasions. see this himself ? servative organs are trying to develop a case in their own favour they generally manage to exaggerate the truth. The trouble is that when they are dealing with matters that are likely to reflect upon this party they are much more likely to distort the truth in order to mislead' the public. The honourable member will remember that Tennyson saysThat a lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies; That a lie which is all a lie may be met and fought with outright; But a lie which is part a truth is a harder matter to fight. If the honourable member likes this kind of thing I can give him some more from the Brisbane CourierThe ambulance brigade was on the spot attending to the injured promptly. Some of those who were struck were able to leave unassisted, but others had to be carried off by the bearers. The honourable member for South Sydney Statute, but under the higher enactment of the asked me whether these were things I had"" Constitution. Doubtless, no matter what course seen myself. I can tell him that my own father, who was sitting quietly on a doorstep in a street, had to run down a lane to save his life. Women and children were chased about the streets of Brisbane that morning, and for what? Nobody knows; but the police had evidently been so much irritated and annoyed by the failure of their plans, and of their hopes that they would have some work to do against the strikers, that they had to find an outlet for their feelings. It was rather a remarkable fact that on that morning all the police appeared on the streets with every mark of identification carefully removed from their uniforms; Their numbers were removed from their collars and helmets, and that in itself is a pretty sure indication of what was their intention. The honourable member for Ballarat said that the Premier of Queensland had wired to the Governor-GeneralIn consequence of general, strike riot and bloodshed are imminent in Brisbane. He must have been anticipating the action of his own minions. The State police are not able to preserve order. No; but they were able to incite disorder, as they did on tlie Friday morning after this message was sent. Firearms have been used to prevent arrest of a man guilty of riotous conduct. I have already proved that that was false as the only shot fired was fired by a police t constable, and not by a striker, in defence of another. The Executive Government of State request that you direct steps to be taken immediately to protect State against domestic violence in the terms of section 119 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. Honourable members are no doubt aware that section 119 of the Constitution provides thatThe Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of a State, against domestic violence. There is in the Argus of this morning a report of an interview in Brisbane with Mr Denham, the Premier of Queensland. In the course of that interview Mr Denham said that the Queensland Government were so considerate of the feelings of the Commonwealth Government that they did not ask' for the military under the Defence Act, but under the higher constitutional provision.

323,Mr Finlayson,"When these Conwe adopted, Mr Fisher would have exercised his discretion, but as it is lie has exercised it unwarrantably. It is very refreshing to have Fad a statement from tlie Leader of the Opposition to the effect that the Commonwealth Government have an absolute right to exercise their discretion in dealing with any such application for the military. I think that was somewhat interesting to honourable members who recollect a discussion which took place in the Senate during last session. It will be remembered that on the 2nd November, 1911, Senator Rae moved the following motion in the SenateThat in the opinion of the SenateThe Defence Act should be so amended as to clearly set forth that the object of creating a Citizen Defence Force based upon universal compulsory military training and service, is for the purpose of defending the Commonwealth against possible foreign aggression, and therefore, under no circumstances, should any person so enrolled be compelled to bear arms against any fellow Australian citizen, notwithstanding anything contained in the oath of allegiance or in any other conditions of compulsory service. It ' is remarkable that during the discussion of that motion, with the exception of three every honourable senator who spoke, including the Minister of Defence and Senators Millen and Clemons, emphasized the fact that in any circumstances the reply to an application for military to suppress domestic violence was a matter which, in the last resort, was left to the discretion of the Commonwealth authority. Even where a State is disposed to ask for military assistance in justifiable circumstances no one can compel the action of the Commonwealth Government. The result of the debate in the Senate on the motion referred to was that only four voted for it whilst fifteen voted against it. This shows that the feeling of the Senate was that the Commonwealth Government have a perfect right, and are justified, if they are not indeed authorized, to refuse military assistance on the application of a State, unless they are satisfied that it is needed. opposite may dispute our statements as they please, but if this motion of censure means anything at all, and the debate upon it is revolving entirely around the Brisbane strike-the matters of the finances, maladministration, and the policy of "" spoils to the victors "" have taken very secondary and subordinate places, and the burden of all the addresses from honourable members opposite has been the Brisbane Strike Mr Finlayson. tain, and that is that every vote given for this censure motion means a vote in favour of the calling, out of the military to suppress industrial disturbance. This party stands at least for this position: Thati f there is domestic violence, if there is reason for calling out the military to deal with an industrial disturbance, the decision as to whether the military shall be called out or not rests in the last resort with the Commonwealth Government, and they are under no compulsion by the provisions of the Constitution to call out the military. Honourable members will probably be interested if I read for them what the Right Honourable R. B. Haldane, KC., M.P.. Secretary of State for War in the Imperial Government, said before a Select Committee on the question of the employment of the military in a case of industrial disturbance. The honourable member for Darling Downs read for us some lengthy extracts referring to what had happened in America, evidently basing his remarks on the fact that our Constitution follows the American model. and, unfortunately, it follows the American model very closely. I want to point out that we as Britishers have somewhat different ideas in many respects from those held by Americans. Mr Haldane is an undoubted authority, and this is what he says in regard to the use of the military in industrial disturbancesNow, the soldier is a person who is different from the ordinary citizen in this, that he is armed with a deadly weapon. Moreover, he comes out in a military formation. The result is that if he appears unnecessarily he creates an impression in the minds of all those who are about of a hostile character. His veiy menacing aDpearance may lead to the very thing which it is his purpose to prevent-disturbance . For that reason, in the War Office, we are very averse to allowing the military to be employed. We are compelled to do Honourable members it ; we have no choice; we have to obey the law, but we always tend to insist-and while I am there we always shall insist very stronglyon this, that we are called out legally and not illegally. We are called out illegally if we are called out under any circumstances which' admit of being dealt with by a force less menacing than a military force necessarily is. There is a principle which must be borne in mind, and that is that people are taken to intend the consequences of their actions. It may be perfectly legal for the military to march up and along a certain-, street, but, if their doing so will unnecessarily and unjustifiably bring about a disturbance, the-",49,Witness Yes He Told Me That Would Be The

That is the statement It was really a picnic for them. No doubt, which I wanted to put before the Committee in too, the prospect of having a scrap with order to make the law perfectly clear, as I the townies was an inducement to them to think it is. That is rather a remarkable statement, coming from the source which it does, and it utterly disproves the allegation of the honourable member for Ballarat, that a force of citizen soldiers would be more likely to cause disorder than would a military force. There is no doubt in my mind that if, during the strike, troops had appeared in the streets of Brisbane in their regimentals, and with all their accoutrements, it would scarcely have been possible to restrain the excitement of the crowd. To be faced by police with fixed bayonets, and also by a large number of men and youths with batons, was bad enough. But still it had its ridiculous aspect. All told, there were, perhaps, a thousand foot and horse constables, regular and special, and there were 20,000 unionists. If the word had been given, the street would have been But the wisdom of the leaders preI admire the courage with If we charge the As a matter of fact, the apFor over a week the work of supplementing One is inclined to be amused I volunteer their services. I may add that an order was passed round the Government Departments in Queensland that the civil servants were to enroll as special constables. But the response was so meagre in two Departments at least that the employees in those Departments were summoned to the Minister's room, where they were addressed by him., and practically threatened with dismissal if they did not stand by the Government. The special constables were drawn from all ranks. The civil servants were distinctly given to understand that it was their duty to act as special constables whedier they liked it or not. Many of them who went on to the streets of Brisbane heartily wished themselves hundreds of miles from that city. Many of them were much more afraid of the strikers coming down the street on that memorable Friday morning than the strikers were afraid of the police. I wish also_ to re1 have already proved that this was not mind honourable members that section 51 the act of the strikers, or the strike comof the Defence Act readsWhere the Governor of a State has prothe military, it was to compel the shopclaimed that domestic violence exists therein, keepers to keep their shops open. If it the Governor General, upon the application of were not for deeds of violence that the the Executive Government of the State, may, military were needed, what was the meaning by proclamation, declare that domestic violence of the statement that, owing to imminent exists in that State, and may call out the Perbloodshed, troops were required? manent Forces, and, in the event of their numconsultation with the Home Secretary and bers being insufficient, may also call out such the Commissioner of Police, Mr Denham of the Militia and Volunteer Forces as may be necessary for the protection of that State, and the services of the forces so called out may be utilized accordingly for the protection of that State against domestic violence. Honourable members will see, therefore, that the very first condition precedent to the calling out of the military was not complied with by the Queensland Government. No proclamation was issued that a state of domestic violence existed. Further, although the police magistrate of Brisbane was up and down the streets of that cityall day long, he never once drew the Riot Act from his pocket to read it. There was no need for even such feeble action as that to be taken. Yet we have been told that the military were necessary to preserve order. Shortly after the Prime Minister's reply to the application for military assistance had been received in Queensland, Mr Denham was interviewed, and here is what he saidProbably Australia is the only civilized country in the world to-day where the military is not ready at a moment's notice to back up the civil power in such a state of things as has obtained, and still obtains to a lesser degree, in Brisbane. When I read that, I thanked God that 1 belonged to the first country in the world that had declared for such a splendid state of affairs. Let us be thankful to-day that we are Australians, and that this is the first civilized country in the world to-day in which the soldiers, who are trained for the purpose of repelling foreign aggression, are not available for quelling internal disturbances such as industrial conflicts. Mr tee took charge because the Government abDenham made a remarkable admission when he was refused the military. saidin such a state of things as has obtained, and still obtains to a lesser degree to-day, in Brisbane. That was an admission that the position of affairs in Brisbane then was less grave than cn the Thursday when he sent the telegram for the military. Mr Denham went on to make a much more remarkable statementTt is not so much deeds of violence as the holding up of food supplies that constitutes a serious menace. Mr Finlayson. mittee-that if it were necessary to employ After saidI can assure the citizens that ample protection is afforded by the enrolment of special constables, foot and horse. I see no reason why early in the week normal conditions of trade should not obtain in the metropolitan area. . He, apparently, asked for things he did not need, and, when he did not get them, he said, "" I did not want them; I had enough of my own."" An exactly similar statement was made in regard to adequate police protection to guarantee the food supplies; and yet we hear this talk about the strikers holding up the supplies. The honourable member for Darling Downs may laugh, criticise, and abuse the permits by the strike committee; but it was the use of the permits that guaranteed the food supplies to the people of Brisbane. From the very first day of the strike, the strike committee guaranteed that neither the hospitals nor the sanitary service would suffer, and that nobody need go hungry; from beginning to end no man, woman, or child need have gone without a meal. It did not matter whether a man were a unionist or a non-unionist, he had only to come to the Trades Hall and say he was out of work, and had no food in his home. I took such men in by dozens, and got tickets for them, so that they might get supplies at the stores. Who Opened the stores? It was the action of the strike committee in making arrangements with grocers, bakers, butchers, and carters, that enabled the people to get supplies. The strike commitsolutely failed to exercise proper control He of affairs. The strike committee said, "" We must preserve and secure the food of the people;"" and, to their honour be it said, they did it well. Honourable members may laugh at the 3 d. coupon, but L every coupon was the price of a loaf of bread. And no coupons were exchanged for drink; they could be exchanged only for food. To the credit of the unionists of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and every other part of Australia, they generously supported the strikers, and the committee were able to honour every permit at its face value when presented in the morning. Mr ties. . . . and further declares that civil Denham accused the Prime Minister of violating the Constitution, simply because the Prime Minister did not interpret the ham. stitution? stitution provides that no State, without the consent of the Commonwealth Parliament, shall raise or maintain a naval or military force; and 1 charge the Queensland Government with having raised a military force in Brisbane, armed them, and sent them out into the streets to shoot down the citizens. I am sorry I have not a photograph to show honourable members of the military camp in Brisbane organized by the order and authority of the State Government. I could have shown the headquarters camp in the gardens near the Executive buildings, with flagstaff, sentry-go, and every appliance and accessory of a military force. Yet section 114 of the Constitution contains the provision I have read ; and I am certain that the consent of the Federal Government was never asked for. Under the circumstances, we can only say that it was the Queensland Government, and not the Commonwealth Government, that violated the Constitution of Australia. The use of the military in strikes is a thing against which every honourable member on this side, at any rate, most emphatically protests. It is somewhat significant that during the railway strike in England, at the latter end of last year, the military filled the signal-boxes and the railway stations. But what a remarkable change came over the scene in the space of a few months. The great coal strike took place; but no military were called out. The Government of Great Britain had learned a lesson between the railway strike and the coal strike; and there must have been more than mere pretence in the following motion that was submitted in the House of Commons by the Leader of the Labour party, Mr Ramsay Macdonald, on the ist December. That gentleman movedTI1.1t this House is of opinion that the results should be found armed men on both sides, of the coroners' inquests at Liverpod and because the sons and brothers would not Llanelly, and the facts elicited in other parts shoot down their own relatives. of the country, show that responsibility for breaches of the peace in connection with .the recent industrial disputes does not rest upon the working classes, and that the use of the military was unnecessary and provocative; and this House regrets the action of His Majesty's Government in promising the use of the military, thereby encouraging the railway companies in their refusal to recognise the workmen's trade unions, and in sending troops into various localiorder depends upon just social relationships, and not upon a display of force. The facts must have burned deeply into the hearts of the British Prime Minister and But who was it violated the Conhis colleagues. I believe that, in all Section 1:14 of the Conhonesty, they made every possible effort to bring about conferences between the miners and the employers. They tried move after move; and, finally, as honourable members know, they introduced the Minimum Wage Bill, with all its defects and deficiencies, as a means of settlement. Indeed, that dispute has been settled to a certain extent, and there has never been a call on the military. If the Australian people once get it into their heads that the Citizen Forces are to be available for industrial disputes and in local difficulties,we shall be at the end. or at the beginning of the end, of the defence system of Australia. The men and women of Australia are to-day freely giving their sons to be trained for the defence of the country. We are proud of our land, believe in it, and would be ready, if necessary, to die in its defence. Buti f our sons are to be at the call of any Government for the quelling of industrial disputes, there will be a passive resistance to compulsory training that will bring about the destruction of our defence system. We hear a great deal about the taxation that is imposed to pay for defence, and honourable members have strong opinions about it. There are some who, with good reason, believe that the burden is already too heavy, and that something should be done to prevent what seems to be its inevitable increase. But were the amendment to be carried, the passive resistance to the payment of taxes for defence would become so strong that no Government would stand by the opinion that our forces should be available for the quelling of industrial disputes. If our soldiers are to be asked to take part in industrial disputes, it will be necessary to refuse to enroll, train, and arm the sons of unionists, or young men with Labour sympathies, lest, should the time unfortunately come for the calling out of the military to settle an industrial dispute, there playing with fire. asked to keep order, and to protect innocent people?",50,Witness Yes He Told Me That Would Be The

There was tramway material lying in every street in Brisbane, stretching away into the suburbs. rails lying unprotected; yet not a wire was cut, not a point was interfered with, not a rail was touched. I think that that is u remarkable thing. tramway strike occurred in Sydney, before it had been in existence many hours, cars were left all over the streets, and some were overturned. damaged in every direction.

The honourable member for Darling Downs may juggle with figures as much as he pleases; but Brisbane spoke clearly on the 27th April in regard to this strike.

The hope of a Labour man ever winning that seat seemed absolutely out of the question. But to-day a member of the strike committee, a victimized railway man, who was refused reinstatement by the Railway Commissioner, represents North Brisbane in the Legislative Assembly. That is the answer of the city. North Brisbane, Fortitude Valley, Ithaca, Maree, Buranda, There were wires, points, and and Paddington all returned Labour members.

In the Argus this morning, it is correct. under the heading of "" Intimidation Denied,"" the following cablegram from London is knows that the Premier of Queensland went publishedMr Will Crooks (Labour) referred in the the strike. House of Commons on Tuesday to the statement made last week by Mr Rowland Hunt| Unionist), that thousands of men were in that he left the leaders of the'strike to stew hiding at the docks, because they were afraid in their own juice. lo go to their homes, and face the gangs of men lying in wait to assault them.

Mr Denham arrived Dock, road, and instead of finding rows of vicfrom Sydney on ""the Tuesday night, andtims, he saw only seven. The house surgeon told him that assaults had been fewer during the period of the strike than at any other time in .London. This parade of stories as to explosives being laid to blow up the Brisbane trams is on a par with the statements regarding the poisoning of-water, the burning of woolsheds, and the hiding of frightened men in the docks. When the non-unionists were placed in charge of the Brisbane tram cars, Mr Badger having refused to reinstate the former employees, although he said they were capable and reliable officers, there was a succession of accidents during the first month exceeding by far the number that had happened for years previously. One wonders whether the explanation is tliat these non-unionists on the cars had to keep their eyes on the rails to see where these parcels had been placed for them. In one case, when a package was opened, the alleged dynamite was found to consist of a piece of tallow candle, which had been thrown on the line as a bit of bluff. In another'case,which I have documentary evidence to prove, a package picked up was found to contain a piece of hardened soft soap, such as is ordinarily used to grease the points on the tram rails. I desire now to refer to Mr Denham's own statements regarding his Statements actions during the strike. I say advisedly that one of the most lamentable features of that strike, which I still believe was easily capable of adjustment in its early stages, is the fact that the Premier of Queensland took no steps whatever to bring the parties together.

On the following day, I put a paragraph in the newspaper, and asked what Mr Denham had done to call the conference in his room, which he referred to. At the same time, I told the people of Brisbane that the conference was called, not by Mr Denham, but by my action in getting Archbishop Donaldson and the Rev. G. E. Rowe at work, as citizens and clergymen teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ, to try to bring about peace. I told the people that the conference was held in the Premier's room, not because we wanted Mr Denham there, but simply and solely because that room was neutral ground, and we could ask Mr Badger to meet us there. Archbishop Donaldson and Mr Rowe went to see Mr Badger one night at about io o'clock. them at about half-past eleven o'clock that night, and found, to my ufter surprise, that they had come from Mr Badger with the impression, at any rate, that he was prepared to meet representatives of the men to try to arrive at a settlement.

They got from the men a promise that they would be prepared to meet Mr Badger at any time or place which suited him. went to Mr Denham at half-past 9 o'clock on Friday morning-Black Friday-and made an arrangement for a conference that afternoon in his office, because it was neutral ground, and he was to invite these men to come and meet in his 100m, and discuss the .matter. That was the first time that he came into the business. It was the first thing he did to try to make things right, and to find out a basis for settling the discombination of men that could defeat the pute. hour appointed for the conference to be held, Mr Rowe got a telephone message from Mr Barlow that the conference was -off, and no reasons were given.

The strike dragged its weary way. spite of every effort which was made on behalf of the men to arrive at a settlement, no settlement was possible. We were met by a blank wall of absolute resistance. Not until a fortunate trouble arose in Adelaide were we able to take advantage of the compulsory conference provision of the Arbitration Act. It is a most unfortunate reflection on our boasted compulsory arbitration provisions that during the whole of that unhappy trouble in Brisbane not a single effort could be made by the Commonwealth to arrive at an amicable and peaceable solution. The State Government had no machinery. Government's machinery was not available. But for the fortunate circumstance of the Adelaide dispute, also in regard to the wearing of a badge, and the convening of the compulsory conference in Melbourne, one wonders what would have been the result even now. ference was held here, with a result which is well known. It ended as most compulsory conferences have ended in similar circumstances, the employers absolutely refusing to discuss the matter or to come to any decision. these matters that the compulsory conference had only this result, happily, that he was so satisfied as to the seriousness of the position that he stated a special case to himself as President of the Arbitration Court, and the award he gave in regard to the badge justified to the very hilt every action which has been taken by the unionists of Brisbane. strike? That award was granted without a reference to the strike. That hits you home. ment of the Leader of the Opposition was that the strike took place over the matter of wearing the badge. I shall read one or two short extracts from the Judge's award in regard to that matterMr Badger has a quaint theory that he has a common law right to tell an employ^ what he should wear. Apart from the power to make regulations, I know of no such common law right. . . . the badge is, in the case of Melbourne and Brisbane, merely part qf the policy of the company to suppress unionism, and especially federated unionism. . . . Mr Badger and Mr ever, come to the conclusion that this is an imWilcox frankly admit that they have tried to prevent unionism amdng their men. award is, therefore, distinctly against the attempt to forbid the union badge. It is monstrous to think that a union should be forbidden such [II] an inflifence as the badge in its favour, while In the companies, with their greater resources, their command of money, of employment, of place, pay, and privileges, use every effort against the union and in favour of a parasitic growth which they plant and foster.

I was interested to note that this came out prominently in connection with the recent railThe Judge is so impotent in way strike in Ireland. In this connection I quote the following :Tlie strike of railway men which began in Dublin on Friday developed to a serious extent during the week end, and on Monday morning three bip lines, the Great. Southern and Western, the Midland Great Western, and the .Great Northern of Ireland were affected. The crux of the dispute is the handling of timber consigned from firms involved in disputes with their workmen. The Dublin and Somh Eastern management have not insisted on their men handling "" blackleg"" consignments, and this H o w can that justify a line is immune from the strike. i The Executive Committee of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants at a meeting in Dublin on Tuesdav night resolved lhat unless the railway companies cease to dismiss and penalize men who refused to handle traffic from firms engaged in disputes with their employees, and reinstate without penalty all men now on strike, they will authorize all the railway workers to withdraw their labour.

409,Mr Finlayson,"It is a remarkabletramway strike occurred, the Brisbane branch of the Tramway Employes Union was something like 380 strong. the strike was a week old it was 480 strong; and, although every effort has been made by the offer of additional pay, and every inducement has been presented to the men to return to their employment, the gates of the Tramway Company's premises having been opened to receive them on any day, at any hour, not a single member of the Brisbane Tramway Employes Association has gone back to work. Honourable members opposite said that they were misled by their leaders. The honourable member for Ballarat said that with the honourable member for BatmanI misled them. Goodness knows they have had time enough now to find it out. They must know by this time whether the advice offered to them was right or not. I again remind honourable members that every action I took in trying to bring about a settlement, every letter I wrote, and every suggestion I made, was entirely on my private responsibility. I was not a member of the Strike Committee, nor was I in their confidence. I was not a member of the Tramway Executive, although I was somewhat in their confidence as their representative on the Federal Council. No action I took was submitted to them. I did not ask for their approval. I acted in my private capacity in the endeavour to bring about a settlement of the trouble. The men have had plenty of time in which to find out whether they were misled, and what are the facts? Although they could have gone back on a simple statement that they had resigned from the union and would not join it again, not one of them has taken service with the Brisbane Tramway Company. On the question whether I misled them or not, I merely say that a little over a month ago they were appointing a representative to the Federated Council of the Tramway Employes Associations of Australia, and they unanimously requested me to act as their representative on the Federated Council. Misled! Oh, dear no. The unionists of Brisbane have found out their true friends by now. They know that the men who were prepared to stand by them in their dark days can be depended upon to stand by them when the sun is shining. They will come into their own yet. Before their case gets through the Arbitration Court, with its long and weary process, there will be a change. Perhaps not the least change will be one which I believe will operate for Mr Finlayion. the good government of the tramway system in Brisbane so far as the relations of Before the company with their employees are concerned, and that is thatMr Badger is to he given two years' leave of absence. I have no more to say on that aspect of the matter. I am more concerned about the future than I am about the past. I am concerned as to the possibility of averting such another time as we had in Brisbane. I am most anxious, if it is at all possible by our legislation or administration, to prevent a similar state of affairs arising in any city of Australia. As men who are charged with the government of the country we should do all we can to prevent the recurrence of such a state of affairs. the Leader of the OppositioA cheer that statement. The suggestions which are usually received from politicians of his colour are not much on these lines. During the coal strike in Great Britain some suggestions .were made by Conservative organs. The London Standard made the following suggestions for the prevention of industrial disputes:1. The reversal of the Trades Disputes Act. 2. The declaring of the strike illegal and the establishment of compulsory arbitration. 3. The passing of an Act to seize all strike funds, and, if necessary, to close all union offices; to arrest and, if convicted, to send to prison, agitators as a menace to the public welfare. 4. All interference with the food and other necessaries of the people should be made a penal offence. 5. Disturbed areas should be proclaimed under a brief but drastic coercion Act. That should suit the honourable member for Ballarat, because, during his speech he said, "" Let us have compulsory conciliation and arbitration, and when an award is made let us then suppress disturbances."" It is this continual suppression, coercion, and choking down that will never settle industrial disturbances. then?

He said that the whole of the unfortunate after-circumstances would have been entirely obviated. However, the trouble has taught the people that they made a mistake in April of last year. The electors of Brisbane have now discovered that if they had voted ""Yes"" instead of "" No "" at the last referenda, the strike would never have taken place. There will be a different tale to tell next year. As one who came through the Brisbane strike, I look forward with perfect equanimity to the possibilities of the vote at the approaching referenda. If the people of that city have not entirely forgotten-and I do not think they will ever forget-the circumstances attending that memorable Friday when they were chased about their own streets by irresponsible constables, and when they were compelled to submit to a military dictator in the person of Commissioner Cahill, they will vote to vest this Parliament with power so to amend our Constitution as to insure that wherever an industrial dispute occurs, efforts will be at once made to settle it. I do not think that the people of Brisbane will soon forget the petty action of the Government in removing from the roll of justices of the peace the name of a member of the strike committee, or that they will condone the action of the Ministry in removing the secretary of the Marine Board from his position, simply because of petty spite. Upon the first page of our Conciliation and Arbitration Act it is stated that it is an Act"" for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes."" Yet here was an industrial dispute of an unusual character, and under the Act we were absolutely powerless to deal with it. The chief objects of that Act are clearly set out in its preamble. They are, "" to prevent locks-out and strikes in industrial matters."" Yet here was a lockout which culminated in a strike, and the whole of our legal machinery was powerless to cope with it. Nevertheless, I believe that the true heart of Australia beats soundly. whole world is seeking a solution of these industrial disturbances. It is quite true, as the Leader of the Opposition remarked, that there is a good deal of industrial unrest throughout the civilized world to-day. Everywhere the cry is, "" How cum we, by If reasonable prolegislation, arrange for a speedy settlement of these troubles ? "" I was interested in reading what Justin McCarthy had to say some years ago in The History of our own No body of employers, however wealthy or powerful, could regard with indifference the prospect of having their whole business brought to a temporary stop by the refusal of the operatives to work any longer on the old conditions. The capitalists might be able to win in the end and to enforce their own terms because of the ample resources which enabled them to hold out to the last, and by reason of the fact that it was with them a struggle for the maintenance of what they believed to be reasonable profits, and not a struggle for the maintenance of life. But a wide-speading strike was always an event likely to give pause to the energy of the most determined and uncompromising capitalist, and it compelled him at least to stop and think whether it would not be more for his interest to consider the question as impartially as might be, and to see whether the prosperity of both classes would not be better served by the capitalists making some concession towards the demands of the worker. . . . We may say that the disputes between capital and laboui are already coming to be universally regarded as questions capable of final and satisfactory settlement by the decision of impartial arbitration. It must be admitted that the remarkable progress made of recent years towards such a condition is in great measure due to the intelligence, the perseverance, and, on the whole, the moderation of the operatives themselves, and the intelligent men of their own order who lead them in their organized movements and represent them in the House of Commons. Honourable members must recognise that there is a remarkable change coming over the spirit of the times. One thing is certain, namely, that the people, as the result of education and experience, have decided that there must be a change in the existing condition of affairs. The rich are going to become poorer in order that the poor may become richer. No more significant statement has been made of late than that which is reported in the press this week, that the Imperial Parliament proposes to give every man in the United Kingdom a vote. The influence of such a movement towards industrial peace will be something amazing. Kipling, with a poet's vision, saw something of this coming when he wroteSo when the world is asleep and there seems no hope of her waking Not only Australia but the Out of the long bad dreams that make her mutter and moan, Suddenly, men are awaked by the sound of fetters breaking, And each man smiles to his neighbour and tells him his soul is his own.

That is what we are seeking. Let us pray by all means. But let us labour and legisand do no work until the war is stopped. late to make it come. It is because we are Then, indeed, there will be no war, and content to pray for it, and not to work for the Labour party may go on with full conit, that so little is being done. The world fidence in the gospel of peace and goodis moving towards the light; the masses of the people have been down in the valleys, amidst the fogs and the mists for many centuries. But here and there, as in Brisbane, they have forced their way up to the sunshine; a hill there and a hill here has been captured, and the masses all over the world are moving upward. Here and there they are repulsed by force; but the time is coming when the masses of the workers in every country in the world, including Australia, must force their way into the sunshine, and declare that the heavy burden shall be removed, and every man, woman, and child given an opportunity to live. The Leader of the Opposition has thrown out the taunt that we are seeking some ideal existence. member said that we were seeking some ideal existence. I am always glad to know that my ideals are mpre or less invisible. If we had reached the end of our efforts we should know exactly where we were; but there is something better further on. We believe there is a better state of things ahead-that we shall leave the world better for those who come after us; that each genepeace, truth, and honesty. ration will inherit improved conditionsand to that end we hold it to be worthwhile working and legislating. We are seekabout the Brisbane strike that, doubtless, ing a new heaven and a new earth. What we are doing now may be spade work-w e may be laying only drains or water-pipes-bu t we are widening the streets and letting in more sunshine; and, please God, we may be able to tackle, not only industrial problems, but international problems, and bring about a better state of affairs for the people of fair Australia. The Labour party, in my opinion, is doing more for peace than any other party or organized institution. The one guarantee for the peace of the world lies in the solidarity of the Labour party. The fact that there are n o Socialists sitting in the German Reichstag is the great guarantee for no war with England. There is one general strike which I hope to live to seea strike that is now being aring and working. If war should be declared by any of the rulers of the countries or the world, I hope to see the workers of the countries concerned throw down tools, will. Our friends opposite have nothing but the gospel of force-of guns and bullets. The Labour party stands for something better-for brotherliness, fraternity, and good feeling. Dilletante members of the Peace Society may think that the Labour party are disturbers of the peace, and let them think so. If it suits Carnegie to forget about Pinkerton's detectives, and, with his millions, to play with his new toy, the Palace of Peace, let him do so. Let those men who have a feeling that peace can be maintained by the reiteration of pious aspirations continue to nurse that feeling. But the party that stands to-day for a settlement of industrial troubles by the readiest possible means, and for the settlement of international troubles by prompt and decisive measures, is the Labour party and the Socialist party in every State and country in the world. members opposite never were Socialists. long to the Socialist party.

420,Sir John Quick (Bendigo) [9.32],"to. some other subject. But, after the eloquent peroration of the honourable member for Brisbane, I feel called upon to follow that subject even a little further. The honourable member, towards the conclusion of his speech, drew the inference that it is highly desirable to have more effective Federal legislation to deal with the settlement of calamitous industrial disputes such as that which occurred in Brisbane, and he wound up with a pathetic allusion to the necessity for promoting the brotherhood of man, and so forth. I think 1 can fairly appeal to honourable members to concur in the contention that in no country in the world is there more liberal democratic legislation for the settlement of industrial disputes than in Australia. Commonwealth legislation we have machinery and procedure of a scientific, judicial, most effective, and far-reaching character for dealing with even such industrial disturbances as ""that to which I have referred. In support of that view, let me remind honourable members of the provisions of our Conciliation and Arbitration Act for the settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of a State. Let me further remind honourable members of the recent improvements and amendments in that legislation, under which it is possible to deal with cases of industrial emergency like that in Brisbane. The admitted facts of the case go to show that Commonwealth legislation ait the present time is quite suffisettle it by conciliation, he may make a cient ; that there is no such . alarming necessity for further drastic amendments and enlargements in the directions suggested by the honourable member for Brisbane, and which he is of opinion would have stopped the Queensland trouble. On the occurrence of this strike or lock-out -whicheve r honourable members choose to call it-ther e was pending in the Arbitration Court of the Commonwealth a plaint which raised the whole of the questions in dispute between the tramway company and its employ6s, including the question of the badge. It was apparent on the face of the plaint, which was drawn up by experienced lawyers, that it came within the jurisdiction of the Court, because it set out that the matter submitted to the Court, as between the Australian Tramway Employes Association and the various tramway employers, included those of Hobart, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Fremantle, and other places. The legal advisers who acted on behalf of the tramway employees must have had evidence of an Inter-State dispute which came within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. To show that the point at issue was included in the plaint, let me read from a copy of it published in the newspapers at the time-rMatters in dispute -(a ) Wages; (4) Conditions of work. Under the latter heading, paragraph. 39R read as followsThe employees shall be permitted to wear and display the badges of members of the association. Paragraph 60 of the reply readThe respondent disputes the paragraph, relating to the badge of the plaint, and says that no distinction between members and non-members of the association shall be allowed. I ask honourable members to note the terms In of the plaint, and that the plaint was within the cognisance of the Arbitration Court at the time of this industrial dispute. The second thing to be remembered is that the hearing of the plaint had evidently been delayed by the congestion of business of the Court, or the employment by the President in other work of the High Court. Fortunately, however, our legislation provides that in cases of urgency or emergency, the President may convene compulsory conferences between the parties to an InterState industrial dispute. This gives him the opportunity to bring the parties together, and talk matters over; and if he finds that there is a prima facie case of an Inter-State dispute, and that he cannot special appointment for the speedy hearing of the matter. The complaint of the honourable member for iEJrisbane is that our legislation is imperfect, and that the Constitution should be amended to make more liberal and adequate provision for the settlement of Inter-State disputes is therefore unjustifiable, there being now abundant machinery for dealing, nat only with Inter-State disputes which are not urgent, but also with special and emergency disputes. The President, on a case being brought under his notice, and on being satisfied that the dispute was an Inter-State one, made a special appointment for its hearing and determination. Inter-State, he has no power to deal with it. sing a hypothetical case; I am dealing with the facts of the case under review.

422,Sir John Quick,"I am not discusthat there was an Inter-State dispute coming within his jurisdiction. Therefore, the statement that the Brisbane strike is a reason for the amendment of the Constitution is mere clap-trap. The facts proved that there is ample and abundant provision for dealing with these cases. An emergency sitting of the Court was held, and the applicants procured an award in their favour. What more did they want? What more could have been provided by the most perfect Constitution, or even by any of the amendments which honourable members opposite suggest? It is not said that this case broke down because of the inadequacy of the legislative and judicial machinery. Had the dispute been confined solely within the State of Queensland, the parties would have had to depend on the law of the State. law provides for Wages Boards as liberal as those of New South Wales or Victoria. not have been compelled to submit the matter to a Wages Board. Queensland is applicable to industrial disputes confined wholly to that State, and if it is not all that is desired, can be amended by the local Legislature. That, however, has nothing to do with the facts that we are reviewing. proved to be a dispute extending beyond the limits of Queensland, and the case cannot fairly be used to support the proposal for the amendment of the Constitution. The honourable member for Brisbane occupied nearly three-quarters of an hour, during a lengthy and exhaustive speech, in drawing attention to a large number of uninteresting and unimportant incidents in the history of the relations between the Brisbane Tramway Company and its employees. I do not know that we have anything to do with disputes that occurred in 1904, 1908, and 1910. Apparently, there have been a number of squabbles and unpleasantness. It may be that there have been indiscretions and mistakes on both sides. I am not here to apologize for the company or its manager. show the persistent rebellion of Mr Badger against the Act? to the issue involved in this motion, which has relation to the fulfilment of Commonwealth obligations The question is not whether Mr Badger was right or wrong in insisting that the employees of the company should not wear their badges whilst they were on duty. With reference to that question there is a reasonable difference of opinion. In the view of some people the wearing of the badge is an evidence of freedom and of the solidarity of labour. On the other hand there are those who think that it is an evidence of servitude, and is in the nature of a firebrand to incite to tumult and disturbance.' I shall not discuss that issue at the present time. an Opposition Government have sent the military to Brisbane? that point. . question. member for Brisbane, referring to Mr Badger, quoted a passage from the Melbourne Age severely criticising his action in forbidding the tramway employees from wearing these badges. But he did not quote the Age, either in the same leading article or in another one dealing with the badge question, and with another issue that has been discussed in this debate, namely, whether, when the Government of Queensland appealed to the CommonThe tramway dispute was wealth for assistance and protection against domestic violence, the Federal .Government was justified in refusing to carry out their constitutional obligation. I should like to quote the opinion of the same newspaper on the action of the Government. The Age wroteMr Fisher's great political crime is that when the anarchists of Brisbane set up their mob law, refusing to permit business in the streets of Brisbane without a permit from the strike committee, he had not the courage to uphold the fundamental law of the land against insurrection. What has the honourable member for Brisbane to say to that quotation? We are not concerned either to defend Mr Badger or to apologize for him or to represent his views. I decline to do so. But we have to deal with the situation which occurred upon the cessation of labour, and with the it not relevant to strike or lock-out, which involved great and serious industrial disturbance and riot almost bordering upon bloodshed within the city of Brisbane. member say "" almost bordering on bloodshed""?",63,Witness Yes He Told Me That Would Be The

The honourable member for Brisbane menti'oned this evening that at one stage he intervened with a suggested means of settling the dispute. On 28th January he appealed to Mr Badger, who states that his reply was as follows:My reply was that my company would not entertain any such proposition, because the claim of the men that they had the right to wear the union badge had already been included in the claim filed by them before the Arbitration Court. It is unnecessary to point out that they have assumed the right to wear the badge without waiting for a decision. However, as they have appealed to the law in the matter, the company propose to have it settled by the law. That was the attitude taken up by the manager of the company on 28th January, and I suppose that the company had a perfect right to rely upon the legal position-. The matter was pending in the Court, and the company had confidence in the ultimate decision Of that tribunal. They were not prepared to Withdraw the case from the Court in which the disputantsthe tramway men themselves-had sought a solution of the industrial difficulty. Practically the decision of the Tramway Company was that the men had appealed to Cffisar, and to Caesar let thern go. On 30th January a general strike took place, and the members of forty-two unions were calledout. This, I have heard it said, involved upwards of -20jOoo men being, thrown out of employment.

To return to rriy summary of the press report's I find that on 30th January a large number of special constables were sworn in, and that the city was in a state of terrorism owing to the industrial hold-up. Business men were intimidated, and were forced by the mob, under orders from the Trades Hall, to close up their shops.

On 31st January processions were held, and a hastily called meeting of the. Employers Federation decided that all should close down. On Friday the cafes were called upon by large mobs to close. All these business places, including the bakers', shops, were compelled to close owing to the terrorism exercised by these wandering mobs. On ist February business in Brisbane was at a complete standstill, and several cases of violence occurred. The Courier gives an account of an attack on a lorry loaded with potatoes, by about 600 persons, who were diverted from a procession, arid states that the carter was forced to return to the wharf with his load. A sulky with merchandise was also attacked, about a thousand persons being involved as participants or spectators. The police fourid it necessary to use their batons, arid a serious riot was narrowly averted. During a further riot a revolver was fifed at a police officer, and a great crowd rained missiles oh the police, several of whom were injured, and one permarieritly incapacitated. The report goes on to show that a second riot was„ caused over a lorry load of barrels of beer.

I propose to quote from a letter written and signed by Mr Harry Coyne, president of the Combined Unions Committee. T have a facsimile copy of the letter in his own handwriting, so that there can be no doubt about its authenticity6th February, 1912. Dear Sir, We have been informed that you are conveying supplies from your stores to various establishments in this city. This Committee wishes to intimate to you that the only conditions under which work can be sanctioned by this Committee, is by permit and according to the conditions as per enclosed slip. We remain, dear Sir, For the Combined Unions Committee, J. HARRY COYNE. President. Annexed to this precious letter there is weaker side having eventually to give in. the following enclosureTrades Hall, Brisbane, 30th January, 1912. Sir,-The provisions governing the enclosed permit are as follow :(1) All work to be carried out solely by unionists. (2) The said unionists not to receive any anarchical committee. All this went on at remuneration direct from you, but a time when the law of the Commonwealth such remuneration to be forwarded was quite sufficient to settle the industrial to the Strike Committee, who will pay strike allowance to such emdispute, and when, according to the law ployees on application, providing they of the Commonwealth, if a situation of produce fidelity voucher signed by civil stress arose through domestic violence, you. Any infringement of the above provisions will tral authority for protection against that ender the permit liable to forfeiture.

Negotiable for Foodstuffs Only. Feb 1912. ] . I-I. COYNE, President. J. A. MoiR, Secretary. Those documents, on their face, show first that this was riot merely an ordinary strike. It was a real case of local insurrection. The civil government was suspended; the police admit that they were not able to maintain order; the police appealed for Federal assistance and Federal protection; the Government of the State appealed for Federal assistance and Federal protection. At this time there was sitting in the city of Brisbane a committee called the Strike Committee or the Permit Committee, which seemed to exercise in Brisbane the same functions as were exercised by the Jacobin clubs in Paris during the French Revolution. It undoubtedly was a revolutionary committee. It is quite obvious that they had bailed up the State, that they had issued an order and a mandate that the shops were to close, that the ordinary traffic was not to go on, that there was to be no production or delivery, that ordinary was to be done except by their permit. There is Mr Coyne's intimationThis Committee wishes to intimate to you that the only conditions under which work can be sanctioned by this Committee is by permit, and according to the conditions as per enclosed slip. There is no getting away from that notification. It speaks for itself. It shows that this was not an ordinary strike which might have been allowed to work its way out in the ordinary course of nature, the It was more than that. It was an insurrectionary movement; it was a revolutionary movement of the nature of syndicalism about which we have heard so much, and which means the suppression of the law of a State and the introduction of the mandate of tiie strike committee or the the State had a right to appeal to the cenThe State has not the right to appeal for protection against an ordinary strike.

451,Sir John Quick,"The honorablemore than a mere strike or cessation of labour. There must undoubtedly be something in the nature of domestic force and violence amounting to a partial or complete suspension of civil government. In this case we had the confession of the police authorities and of the Premier of the State that civil government had ceased there, that life and property were in danger, and that assistance was necessary. It is impossible for an ordinary police force in any State, or troops ? in any great city, to deal with such a vast and far-reaching ramification of violence as evidently occurred in the development of events in Brisbane. It is certain that the police of Brisbane were quite unable to deal with those great, exciting, and dangerous events. What, then, was to be done? The Constitution provides that a State Government shall have the right to appeal to the Commonwealth authority for protection. If an appeal is made for protection, and the protection is granted, it does not necessarily follow that there will be an application of armed force to an unarmed people. mean a resort to the use of firearms. It is assumed that the presence of the representatives of law and order wearing the King's uniform will exercise a salutary and peaceful influence. It is more for the purpose of keeping the crowd back from trespassing upon a railway line or a tramway that the military forces are used in such cases. On many occasions soldiers are used, as they were in London during the Coronation celebrations, for the purpose of preserving order in the streets, and keeping the crowd back. It is not necessary that military assistance should be given for the purpose of applying force and violence, or of firing upon the crowd. It is too monstrous to assume that any application was made for a resort to violence or force, or that the military should be required to fire upon the crowd. man is afraid of his own motion. might as well be afraid of the Constitution itself, since it gives the .right to a State to apply for protection. The State in this case had a right to seek the remedies provided by the Constitution. gentleman admits that he would have sent the troops had he been in the Prime Minister's place. Prime Minister was bound to consider the. [12]2 evidence placed before him, and I say that if the facts as alleged in the statement by the Premier of Queensland were true, his appeal was justifiable, and the Prime Minister would have been justified in responding to the appeal. Is that enough for my honourable friends opposite? honourable member had been in the Prime Minister's place would he have sent the facts to be as alleged, 1 would have acquiesced in the proposal to send troops to protect life and property and preserve law and order. the honourable gentleman's duty to do so. I believed that the facts were as alleged. gentleman believe them? them. It does not necessarily gentleman would have sent the troops. as stated by the Premier of Queensland, I consider that troops should have been sent, not for the purpose of committing violence, but for the purpose of protecting life and property, and maintaining law and order. The provisions of the Constitution must be enforced, but in such a matter the responsibility rests first of all upon the State Government to make out a strong case. man should not modify his statement. He has said that he would have sent the troops. let it rest at that. soldiers to shoot the unionists. The honourable gentleman has no right to make use of such a bloodthirsty expression as that. It is unworthy of him. I ask that lhat expression be withdrawn. too many interjections being made across the chamber. I ask the honourable member for Adelaide, since the honourable member for Bendigo takes exception to what he if the honourable member for Bendigo takes exception to it. not have sent troops for any such purpose",68,Committee Business Was To Be Suspended That Nothing

470,Sir John Quick,"I certainly wouldas the honourable member has suggested. I would have sent them for the protection of life and property and the preservation of law. and order. That is all, and that is the limit beyond which no person in this House, or the country, would, in my opinion, have any right to go. I do not propose to refer to the Brisbane strike at greater length. I have covered the ground I intended to deal with. I propose now to refer to some other matters dealt with in the Governot-General's Speech. I have taken the trouble to analyze its contents very carefully, and I find that it refers to about thirty subjects of administration and legislation either actually adopted or proposed. This presents a very attractive field for discussion, but I do not intend to yield to the temptation by going into the details of the whole of these matters. I shall confine myself to a. limited number of them. Of the thirty subjects referred to in the Speech, I find that three may be described as non-party questions, such as the Imperial Trade Commission, the vote for Tasmania, and the question of the standard gauge for Australian railways. There are three matters of legislation and administration which may be described as exclusively of Labour origin. First, there is land value taxation, for which the Labour party are entitled to all the honour or criticism associated with it. Bank, about which the same thing may be said, and the party are also entitled to be considered the originators of the Australian Notes Act. The fourth is the maternity grant; the fifth, the proposed alteration of the Constitution ;the sixth, the clothing and harness factories; the seventh, the design for the Federal Capital; and the eighth, the State-owned Atlantic cable. So that out of the thirty subjects referred to in this glittering programme, only eight are real Labour questions. The remainder relate to matters of Liberal legislation and administration-matter s of common interest to all parties. Let us consider some of these matters. There is, for instance, the consolidation of the State debts. wrong with it ; but I say that it belongs to all parties. Then there is the Australian Industries Preservation Act. The Labour party cannot claim exclusive credit for that, because the Bill was supported by all political parties. Then the provision for the creation of an Inter-State Commission is included in the Constitution itself, and such a tribunal was actually proposed by a former Liberal Government. The site for Commonweath offices in London is also a matter which had been developed, and one which was well advanced before the present Ministry took office. The development of the Northern Territory was authorized by an Act which was passed at the instance of a Liberal Government. The export trade and the promotion of markets on the Continent of Europe were also provided for in the Commerce Act, which was passed on the initiative of a Liberal Government. The construction of the Naval College was authorized as the result of action by a Liberal Government. Universal military training was sanctioned at the instance of the Deakin Government. The Smalt Arms Factory at Lithgow was similarly authorized, and the contract was actually let by the honourable member for Parramatta when he held the office of Minister of Defence. A similar remark is applicable to the Cordite Factory. The Navigation Bill was drafted and prepared by one of the Deakin Ministries. The system of inspection and of granting certificates under the Commerce Act was suggested long ago by one of the Governments of which the honourable member for Ballarat was the head. not get further than that. most a part of the Commerce Act itself. The inspection of lighthouses is, of course, a natural development of the federalization of our lighthouses. In the same way the law relating to quarantine and the extension of quarantine works is the natural development of the federalization of quarantine. The Bounties Act, which is to be dealt with, was originally introduced by the Deakin Ministry, as was also the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. The Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act was passed at the instance of a Liberal Government, so that no party can claim exclusive credit for it. It was supported by honourable members generally, and notwithstanding any hostile criticism which may have been directed to it, I venture to say that it is quite safe, so far as the Opposition are concerned. We will not be a party to any adverse amendment of it. The proposal to deal with the transferred properties was well advanced under the administration of previous Liberal Governments. So, also, was the adoption of wireless telegraphy. So that these eighteen or nineteen subjects",69,Smith Th E Honourable Said To Withdraw His Remark

474,Sir John Quick,"The system is alwhich find so prominent a place in the Governor General's Speech are matters in regard to which all parties in this House arc equally entitled to credit. There is a great deal to be said both for and against the other eight proposals which I have enumerated. Dealing with the items in the order in which they occur in the Vice-Regal Speech, I would first direct attention to the suggestions in regard to the development of external trade. We are told that efforts are to be made to place the products of Australia more fully before the extended markets of Europe, and that steps will be taken to insure that Government inspection and certificates under the Commerce Act may be looked upon with confidence abroad. 1 thoroughly agree with that proposal, and I would like to support a suggestion which has already been made to the Minister of Trade and Customs by some of my colleagues in favour of an amendment of the present conditions under which the export of butter is permitted. At the present time. I understand that the reguAngliss sayslations require that butter for export shall not contain more than 15 per cent, of moisture. Minister the desirableness of allowing an increase of 1 per cent. aware that for five years under the Commerce Act the moisture allowed in superfine butter was 14 per cent. of that; but objection has always been taken to the great restriction which is involved in that low percentage on the ground that it hampers export, and prevents some of our producers from sending Home an article to compete with butter which may not be regarded as superfine. has been suggested that the moisture allowed should be increased to 16 per cent. WhatI ask the Minister of Trade and Customs to do is to make it 16 per cent. If he says an effort ought to be made to place the products of Australia more fully before the markets-of the world, we ought not to place in the way any technical difficulties or regulations. I should now like to call the attention of the Minister to tbe question Australian trade. I ask the Minister to of the export of beef. As to the regulations which have been passed recently prohibiting the export of beef in a certain shape or form, .such as beef containing briskets, I desire to call attention to some observations recently made by Mr Angliss, M.L.C., who is a large exporter of beef, mutton, and pork. Mr Angliss says that some of the regulations which have been passed will have the effect of killing the export trade. He points out that the prohibition of the exportation of briskets is detrimentally affecting the trade. There is, he says, no justification for removing the briskets from carcasses of Victorian-bred fat cattle for export. Angliss would say that to-day, although the interview from which the honourable member is quoting took place only a few days ago. another decision that the breasts should be cut off calves for export, and Mr Angliss points out that that detrimentally affects the industry-that the veal trade with South Africa has been wiped out. Mr Disease was almost unknown in calves. The trade had been lost through the authorities Deputations have urged upon the not allowing the small calves killed by the owners themselves in the country to be exported. Africa would take only small calves, but very few were marketed alive in Melbourne, owing to the fact that to send them to market in that condition would not pay. The Minister of Trade and Customs has probably also noticed the complaint of Mr Angliss to the effect that the pork trade has also been practically wiped out by drastic regulations, and that it ' will be totally lost unless the severity of the regulation is lessened. Mr Angliss goes on to say The Federal Government appeared to be seeking a perfection in carcasses which no country could attain. The present conditions under which the industry worked were intolerable. No doubt it is desirable to have perfection, but we ought to consider what is practically obtainable. Dr. Johnson, the chief supervising officer, has said that the embargo was placed on the portion of the carcasses referred to on account of suggestions'from the Home Government, and he contends that representations should be'made to tbe Home. Government to see whether there cannot be some relaxation in favour of the take the matter into consideration. At this hour, I think I may fairly ask leave to continue my speech to-morrow.
