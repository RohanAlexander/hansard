Tuesday, 2 December 2008 ----Petition: Disability Services Ms LEY (Farrer) (4.00 pm)-TodayI present a petition on behalf of the Woodstock Parent Action Group, handed to me on 17 November 2008 in Albury. I would very much like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to this group of parents whose persistence in rallying support for the Woodstock Early Childhood Intervention Service resulted in the collection of more than 7,000 signatures in a short space of time. Woodstock provides support to 33 children aged six and under with a disability, and their families, living in Albury and surrounding rural areas including Lockhart, Urana, Greater Hume and Corowa. Due to an ongoing lack of funding from the federal and New South Wales governments Woodstock has had to turn families away from their service. It is a disgrace, and there is nowhere else for these families to go. Each signature on this particular petition, which I present to the House today, is an indication of the community’s strength of feeling about this lack of funding for specialist early intervention services for young children in our community with a disability or additional needs. The dedicated staff who work at Woodstock estimate that 260 children in the Albury region do not receive assistance due to a funding shortfall. This is not good enough and I have questioned both here in the House and publicly how and why particularly the New South Wales government has allowed this to happen and how the federal government is standing by and watching but not taking the necessary action. The lack of government funding that would enable Woodstock to provide sufficient resources to early intervention is against best practice research, which identifies early childhood as the most critical and vulnerable period in a child’s development. Current research into early brain development has demonstrated that the first three years of a person’s life are critical in providing foundations for what will happen over a child’s lifespan. On many occasions before this petition was presented to me I met with Woodstock, and on 29 September I was pleased to attend a public forum in Albury where I was presented with a badge announcing that I am one of the A team. I now ask the Rudd government if they are prepared to be one of the A team. Given that tomorrow is International Day of People with Disability, there is no better time for governments to consider the needs of people with a disability and to consider the very real need that is represented by this petition. If we are going to promote understanding of people with disability and organisations that assist people with disability, then we need to do so proactively. It is not enough for the minister to stand up in question time, as she did today, without committing to any real action that would assist organisations like Woodstock. We need practical outcomes. I present this petition to the House today with the hope that the views of my local community, the Woodstock Parent Action Group and Woodstock Support Inc., will be properly heard and properly responded to.

Corio Electorate: Awards heaval across not only America but the world, the United States President JohnF Kennedy challenged his fellow countrymen and women to ask ‘not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country’. As the world faces another series of great challenges, very much the result of the current global financial crisis, it is appropriate for us as Australian citizens to ask ourselves what we can do to support not only our nation but also our neighbours, our friends, our families and our communities in these difficult times. It is for this reason that last month I initiated a citizenship prize amongst all of the primary and secondary schools throughout my electorate to be awarded to the student who best exemplifies the traits of citizenry defined as the duties and responsibilities that come with being a member of a community. It is anticipated that these awards will be handed out at each participating school’s graduation ceremony or end-of-year assembly, and I hope to be able to attend as many of these gatherings as possible to personally award these prizes to the winning students. I strongly believe that by encouraging the next generation of community leaders to think and act in a way that is to the benefit of those who share their environment we are establishing a basis upon which our society can continue to grow in a cohesive and supportive manner. In this vein I also congratulate all those who were elected councillors of the City of Greater Geelong in the weekend’s election and, in particular, those newly elected councillors. They are all great people and have chosen to sacrifice their own time in support of the Geelong community. There is much work to be done in our region as Geelong goes through a difficult economic period and a period of transition that will carry it into the future. For my part, I look forward to working with the council to meet the challenges ahead. I would like to take this opportunity to put before the new councillors for their consideration an initiative my office has been developing. There currently exists no award at a governmental level that acknowledges an individual citizen of the Geelong region for their efforts in support of our community. I propose that the Geelong community, through its government, the City of Greater Geelong, bestow on an annual basis the Geelong Citizen of the Year Award, in much the same vein as the Australian or Victorian of the year awards. The assignment of such an award could best be presided over by an independent panel of judges, could be open to any permanent resident within the borders of the City of Greater Geelong and MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Constituency Statements

The council is best positioned to administer such an award, and I will be taking this proposal to the new council at the earliest possible opportunity. Dunkley Electorate: Autism Centre grated, one-stop peninsula autism centre. It would be a nationally significant initiative, servicing the greater Frankston-Mornington Peninsula area and the south-east area of Melbourne and addressing a poorly understood condition and a profound challenge facing a growing number of Australian families. Autism in Australia is diagnosed at a rate of one for every 160 children today, compared with four or five children for every 10,000 just a decade ago. We do not know why this is, but it does emphasise the need and the compelling case for making autism research a national priority. This increasing prevalence rate highlights the desperate need for improved and more readily available detection; an enormous boost for affordable, intensive and effective early intervention services; more accessible family support and respite; improved clinical awareness and training amongst professionals who work with young children; and a better transition strategy for young people moving through key life stages. It is a credit to my friend and colleague Andrew Robb, the member for Goldstein, and his dedicated electorate staff, particularly Samantha Russell, that they and Andrew’s partner, Maureen, convened an autism spectrum disorder function quite recently. The guest speakers included Andrew; Val Spence from Autism Victoria; Patricia Duggan, the Larmenier school principal; Josephine Barbaro from La Trobe University’s Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre; Baptcare’s Kim O’Neill; and Kerry Lyons from MOIRA family services. All of them made wonderful contributions. Many insights emerged-too many to be detailed in the time available to me-but the need to end the farce that is the Brumby government’s persistence in refusing to recognise autism under the Victorian Disability Act was a key conclusion. The need for Australian research to support and develop practical and dependable early diagnostic tools and to identify the most effective forms of intervention to optimise potential and quality of life was also an important, recurring theme. A serious and urgent need for more funding for comprehensive and coordinated services and the re-education of clinicians, educators and support service providerswho may not be aware of autism spectrum disorder-to make them informed about this condition and what they can do about it in their professions were some of the main themes that arose. WhatI have put forward to the government is a practical response that would be a great leap forward for autism. It is a concept that involves the Frankston campus of Monash University, the incredible group of people at Abacus and the ABA clinic that they operate on a not-for-profit basis and also many committed people such as Professor Dennis Moore and these centres at Monash that give us a great chance to take a great leap forward. I welcome the response from the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services, Mr Shorten. I know there is a tender process underway. I am sure this proposition meets all those requirements, but it also offers much more. It is a national initiative that is well deserving of being embraced.

Jimmy King passed away on 3 November 2008, aged 91. As a child living through the Depression, Jimmy helped support his family. At the age of just 10, Jimmy held down the equivalent of a full-time job and still managed to go home and get his chores done. Growing up in the Depression years gave Jimmy a fair idea of what he wanted for his future and he was not afraid to work hard to achieve it. He met and married Mavis, his wife of 64 years, and they started a family-one of which any man could be proud. Jimmy saw and experienced a great many changes through his lifetime, changes that most of us learn about in history classes. His passion for fairness and equality was unsurpassed, and he always had time for a yarn and to reflect on the changes within the local community. Jimmy was a life member of the Australian Labor Party. He continued his work with the party into his late 80s. In fact, well into his late 80s Jimmy continued with every part of living, driving to Rockhampton to visit the family, mowing the lawn at home, handing out howto-vote cards on election day, visiting older people in their homes to assist them with their postal votes, holidaying with his wife, Mavis, and doing community work. Jimmy was a legend amongst Labor people in the Logan City area. He called a spade a spade and argued his point with passion. He was cheeky, and if you look in the Macquarie Dictionary under the word ‘larrikin’ do not be surprised if you see the name Jimmy King-a true Aussie larrikin who was never lost for an opinion. He had a sharp wit and a sense of justice that held him in good stead throughout his life. Jimmy never missed an ANZAC Day march in the entire time. I was privileged to know him. He would be up at Woodridge Cenotaph with a tear in his eye remembering his mates left behind and the ones he had outlived. He would say afterwards, ‘We fought, yeah, we fought for something and I hope these kids never have to go through what we went through.’ Jimmy always had a smile for people. I remember a time when the two amigos, Bill Burton and Jimmy King, were the godfathers of Woodridge. I was proud to call Jimmy King my friend and he will be missed by his family and by his Labor mates, one and all. Vale, Jimmy King. Ryan Electorate: Kenmore-Moggill RSL Sub-Branch Ryan Electorate: Jindalee Golf Club 2008, I want to extend my thanks to two local organisations in the Ryan electorate that very kindly invited me to their annual Christmas dinners last Friday and Saturday. I refer first of all to the Kenmore-Moggill RSL Sub-Branch, in the Ryan electorate. This is an organisation that has the widespread respect of the western suburbs of Brisbane. It has this respect, esteem and affection because of the dedication of all its members. It is a sub-branch which pays tribute to all those who have worn the uniform of Australia and who have fought under the flag of our country in so many ways. It does this by honouring the memory of those who have fallen in our country’s name but it also attracts the affection and respect of the community by all it MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Constituency Statements

ANZAC Day is a special part of our calendar and it is a day when the RSL comes to the fore, with all the logistics and the organisation of that special day in April. I want to thank the president of the Kenmore-Moggill RSL Sub-Branch, Stuart Cameron, and his committee for organising a very pleasant, very enjoyable evening. There were nearly 150 members and guests in attendance at the Jindalee Hotel that evening and I felt very honoured to be invited and to receive a vote of thanks for my support of their organisation. I acknowledge also the attendance of the Queensland RSL president, Doug Formby. His stature in Queensland is without peer for what he does to fight to represent the interests of the RSL sub-branches. I also want to thank Keith Anderson, the president of the Jindalee Golf Club, who invited me to present the annual awards of the club. Those who love the game of golf-and there are many across our country and in this parliament-contribute to the community in more ways than I think we perhaps appreciate. They not only play golf for the love of the game but also take the opportunity as a club to make a contribution to the local community, the seniors in the community and those less fortunate than themselves. I would like to take this opportunity to say merry Christmas to all of them. Mr Kevin Maher Services) (4.14 pm)-My friend Kevin Maher recently announced that after 25 years he had decided to pull up stumps in his role as Secretary of the Newcastle and Northern Branch of the Australian Workers Union, a role he has been elected to since 1998. He joined the Federated Iron workers Association, the FIA, at the Electricity Commission’s Eraring Power Station, where he was working as a trades assistant. In 1983 he was elected as a union delegate. He became an official of the union in 1984, becoming assistant secretary in 1989 and branch secretary in 1998, following the untimely death of another great Ironworker leader, Maurie Rudd OAM. Kevin has served on the FIA and now Australian Workers Union national executive since 1988 and was elected the AWU New South Wales president in 1998. He led in an era when rationalisation caused economic downturn in the manufacturing industries in Newcastle and the Hunter region. He was a senior player in the negotiations for redundancy provisions for AWU members at the BHP Newcastle Steelworks up to 30 September 1999, at OneSteel Pipe& Tube between October 2007 and May this year and at the OneSteel bar mill this year. He presided over one of the longest disputes the AWU has had since the shearers dispute-the Boeing dispute, which went from June 2005 to February 2006. I know first hand that AWU members were locked out and on strike for 265 days over unfair individual contracts and members wanting a collective agreement and the right to be represented by a union. The outcome at the end of the day was that Boeing accepted nine of the 11 original claims. Kevin has been a member of the Australian Labor Party for 26 years. He is Chairman of the Newcastle Branch of the Industrial Relations Society of New South Wales and a director of the Mechanical and Electrical Redundancy Trust Fund.

Kevin told the Newcastle Herald on 12 November this year that it was important to know when to move on in life. He said: If [John] Howard was still in power I probably wouldn’t be going … but with the Rudd Labor Government in power in Canberra, it seems like a good time for the Newcastle branch of the AWU to have some new leadership. I have previously told the House of the important role that modern unions play in our society. As a union organiser you see first hand the huge potential that individuals exhibit. You see examples of cooperation, compromise and pragmatism delivering dividends all round. In his time, Kevin displayed all of these traits. In conclusion, if I may paraphrase George Bernard Shaw: Kevin Maher knows his people, Kevin Maher knows his language, Kevin Maher knows his town, Kevin Maher knows that an honest bargain is a square deal for all, Kevin Maher knows industrial relations is about people and Kevin Maher knows to never overpromise and to never give up. I am proud to say I had the privilege of working with Kevin, and I always valued his commitment and wise counsel. He will be missed by the AWU, but he leaves the branch and, indeed, the union in strong hands, led by Mark Stoker locally and by Paul Howes and Bill Ludwig nationally. I wish Kevin and Kerrie well in the next phase of their lives. Calare Electorate: Multiple Sclerosis Society nate $100,000 to the MS Society. MS is a horrendous neurological disorder for which there is no cure. Later this month Tony and his wife, Selena, will be auctioning their farm, which is at Lucknow near Orange, and he says a percentage of the money from that sale will go to the MS Society. Tony, who is 49 years old, is a victim of MS. He is a farmer but because of heat intolerance, a symptom of MS, he is no longer able to farm. If he gets hot he starts to shake, and tremors set in which can last for days. Like other victims of this hideous disorder, Tony has been struck down in the prime of his life. His four children and his wife are very supportive. He is a very bright man with no history of drugs. He might have lost skin playing rugby but, aside from MS, is generally very healthy. It is staggering that three out of four people being diagnosed with MS are women, and most are diagnosed in their 30s. MS is more common in colder climates and also more prevalent in people who have a history of working outdoors. Tony has relapsing and remitting MS and was diagnosed about three years ago. Heat intolerance is causing great problems because tremors start instantly in the sunlight. He gets very hot, headaches start, and he has to lie down in a dark room until the shakes go away. Tony says he is fatigued most of the time and has gone from working up to 60 hours a week on the farm to maybe just three hours a day. He has also adjusted his work practices to work in the morning cool. His left eye has developed problems-eyesight trouble is just one of many symptoms of MS. Tony says that when he was first diagnosed he did not believe it and he adopted a ‘head in the sand’ approach. He says that with his health problems there is no way he could do a walk or something like that to raise funds for the MS Society, but since he has to sell his farm, although it will not be a fire sale, he would like to donate a percentage of the profits from that MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Constituency Statements

Tony is from the class of ’76 and, coincidentally, went to the same school as the Labor Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Tony Burke-St Patrick’s College in Strathfield. I am told that the Today Tonight current affairs program will be running a story about Tony. We do not know how many people have MS because not everyone is diagnosed, but it is a horrendous neurological disorder. The latest estimate is 18,000 people in Australia and 2½ million people worldwide, with the number rising by seven per cent each year. The average age of diagnosis is 30, and 80 per cent of sufferers are of working age. Anyone who is interested can look at this website: www.tottens.bigpondhosting.com. As I said, 75 per cent of people with MS are female-three-quarters of all sufferers. (Time expired) Petition: Political Asylum House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions. The petitions concern an issue on which a number of petitions have already been presented, and I note that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has previously responded to these and that his response was tabled in the House on 15 September 2008. I want to take this opportunity to thank the petitioners, who are from St Augustine’s Anglican Church and Bayside Deanery Meeting of the Mothers Union, in Mentone in my electorate, for their commitment to achieving justice for those who have sought political asylum in this country. I am pleased that, since the election, the Rudd government has been able to fulfil the hopes of so many people around Australia who understand that, as a matter of policy, it has never been a choice between secure borders and the just treatment of refugees. As the Rudd government and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in the Rudd government, Senator Evans, have shown, it is possible to achieve both those objectives-that is, secure borders and the just treatment of refugees. The government were elected last year on a commitment to reforming the treatment of those seeking the protection of our country. Acting on the commitment that we made at the last election, the government have ended the Pacific solution, have been able to close the so called offshore processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island and have resolved the ‘legacy’ cases, which were a headache left for the present government by the former government. Being fair and humane does not mean that we are undermining our national security. We have maintained and enhanced a strong border security regime while honouring international treaty obligations and our commitment to the rule of law. We have kept in place the system of mandatory detention while ensuring that no longer, as occurred under the former government, will children be kept behind barbed wire.

I offer all of them my sincere thanks for their support of this wonderful initiative. I was present in Parliament House with other members last Wednesday to witness these remarkable engineering displays, with many of us having the opportunity to test and race the cars on the track. Some of us were successful; others of us were not. I would again like to congratulate all teams of students-and, in particular, the Pine Rivers State High School Razorbacks-who took part in this program on their dedication and enthusiasm in achieving such remarkable results. Pine Rivers State High School is certainly a remarkable school, producing wonderful, talented students, and this was only reinforced by the example that these students set in undertaking this adventure. Eden-Monaro Electorate: Ms Ame Barnbrook Dr KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (4.26 pm)-In my electorate of Eden-Monaro there are many remarkable people, but none more so than Ame Barnbrook. She is a young lady who is a finalist for the National Disability Awards, which are taking place tomorrow night as part of the International Day of People with Disability. Young Ame, who is only 20 years of age, suffers from a disease called phocomelia, which affects only about one in five million people. She has overcome severe physical impairments as a result. She basically has no arms and only one leg, which has three toes on it, but with that she is able to do a whole range of activities that she has excelled in, including parasailing and other sports, music-she plays the trumpet with those three toes and one leg-and academia. Ame is a student at the University of Wollongong. Ame has been competing at club, state, national and international level sailing for 12 years and hopes to represent Australia in the Paralympics in London in 2012. She is a talented musician; she plays a specially modified electronic trumpet and has performed in major concerts in Melbourne and Sydney, with the Yamaha Youth Orchestra in Osaka and at the closing of the IFDS World Championship in Rochester. Scholastically, Ame has consistently produced above-average results throughout school, completing her HSC at Narooma High School. Ame has followed her obvious talent and passion for music to undertake a Bachelor of Creative Arts, majoring in sound, composition and music production at Wollongong university. Throughout her schooling, the New South Wales Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care has provided Ame with a full-time assistant and carer. However, since beginning university, this support has ceased. Wollongong university must be commended for the support it has MAIN COMMITTEE provided Ame, including modifying buildings and providing staff to assist with her learning program. The New South Wales Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care provide personal care services but cannot provide the extensive personal care to support Ame’s university education. Her family estimates that she needs an additional 40 hours per week assistance to enable her to participate in her studies to place her on an equal footing with fellow students. I am encouraged by the announcement, after the meeting of disability ministers in Sydney on 30 May this year, of a $1.9 billion boost to disability funding. I am hopeful that under the new agreement reached on that day there will be much needed additional help for Ame and for others like her. Earlier this year, Wollongong university’s coordinator of sound, composition and music production, Dr Houston Dunleavy, wrote a reference for Ame in support of a nomination for a personal achievement award as part of the National Disability Awards 2008. In Dr Dunleavy’s reference, he described Ame as ‘a fine trumpet player and an extremely talented and creative composer’. I wish Ame all the best for tomorrow night. But, whether or not she wins the award, she is already a champion in my eyes and in the eyes of the rest of the electorate, and I look forward to her success at the 2012 Paralympic Games. I would also like to salute the other activities that are taking place around the electorate for the International Day of People with Disability. der 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Lieutenant Michael Kenneth Housdan Fussell Debate resumed from 1 December, on motion by Mr Rudd: That the House record its deep regret at the death on 27 November 2008, of Lieutenant Michael Kenneth Housdan Fussell, killed while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and place on record its appreciation of his service to his country, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. ternoon in supporting the motion of condolence for Lieutenant Michael Fussell. Lieutenant Fussell lost his life in Afghanistan on 27 November and we offer our prayers and extend our deepest sympathies to his friends and his family: we know that words will do little to assuage your grief today; we seek only to acknowledge your immense loss and honour the memory of a brave young man whose contribution to this world belies his tender years. Serving with 4 Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Lieutenant Fussell-who had just celebrated his 25th birthday-was killed in the middle of the night by an improvised explosive device while leading a foot patrol in southern Oruzgan province. Lieutenant Fussell’s friends and colleagues share his family’s grief today as they attempt to comprehend the loss of a good man and an accomplished officer. It is clear that the death of this exemplary young man will be felt very deeply throughout every community of which he has been a part-from the battlefields of Afghanistan, where his troops carry on their difficult and dangerous work, to the New South Wales northern tablelands, where he spent his childhood, to here in Canberra, where friends gathered on the weekend to reflect on a life lived to the full, a life given in service and a life cut too short.

198,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (4.29 Pm),"The opposition joins with the government this afMichael matriculated from the Armidale school in the watershed year of 2001, enlisting in the army in 2002. He successfully completed his bachelor’s degree at the University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy. Michael went on to graduate from the Royal Military College, Duntroon in 2005, was commissioned into the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery and was posted to ‘A’ Field Battery, 4th Field Regiment. During his time at ‘A’ Field Battery, he qualified as a paratrooper and was deployed to East Timor in 2006 and 2007, leading troops in Operation Astute. In January this year, Lieutenant Fussell was posted to 4RAR (Commando) as a Joint Offensive Support Team Commander. A decorated officer, Lieutenant Fussell was awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp International Campaign Against Terrorism; the Afghan Campaign Medal; the Australian Service Medal with clasp, Timor-Leste, and the Australian Defence Medal. Staff, colleagues and fellow students were shocked and saddened to hear of his death. They have paid tribute to him, recalling his wry, laconic and very Australian sense of humour, his love and aptitude for the sporting field and his passion and knowledge as a horseman. Those fortunate enough to count him as a friend remember ‘Fuss’ with warmth and admiration. They remember his dedication and commitment, recalling the sacrifices he made in achieving his ambition of serving in this very distinguished unit. Lieutenant Fussell was the seventh member of the Special Operations Task Force, and the first Australian officer, to lose his life in Afghanistan. He died in the service of others. He died that the people of Afghanistan might have the opportunity to know peace and, above all, he died to ensure the safety and security of all Australians. We will, and must, ensure that he has not died in vain. On days of remembrance, all Australians recall that ‘age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn’. Michael will not be forgotten, just as those who have fallen before him are not forgotten. His bravery and his sacrifice will forever mark both his vital presence and his courageous passing. Although nothing can console a mother’s grief, we pray that in some small measure Mrs Fussell is comforted tonight in the knowledge that her son lost his life pursuing a vocation to which he dedicated himself without reserve. His name will be recorded, as he is counted now with those who have gone before him-young men who have fallen on the battlefield so very far from the towns and cities in which they grew up. He has taken his place in this country’s history, both in its past and its future. Herodotus observed that ‘In peace, sons bury their fathers. In war, fathers bury their sons.’ We in this chamber and in these corridors must never forget that in war, young soldiers die. In this simple, enduring truth we are bound in the shared and profound burden of responsibility. We must today mourn with a father as he prepares to bury a son. We mourn also that Michael did not live to enjoy a family of his own. To Michael’s parents, to his sisters, Nikki and Nyah, and to his brother, Daniel, who is also a lieutenant serving in the Australian Defence Force, nothing can replace what you have lost in a son and a brother. Nothing can lessen your grief. Know only that Michael’s loss is felt in some measure by all Australians. To his friends and colleagues still serving in Afghanistan and elsewhere, we thank you for your service, and we wish you safety and success in your work. We are all working to ensure that you return home soon, safely, to your loved ones. With great depth of sorrow and respect, I simply say: Vale, Fussell. MAIN COMMITTEE Lieutenant Michael Fussell became the seventh Australian soldier to lose his life in Afghanistan. He was also the first Australian officer to give his life in that country. Yesterday Lieutenant Fussell began his long journey home when Australian, Afghan and Dutch troops farewelled him at a solemn ramp ceremony in Tarin Kowt. Lieutenant Fussell enlisted in January 2002 and was appointed as an officer cadet at the Australian Defence Force Academy. His first officer posting was to ‘A’ Field Battery, 4th Field Regiment. In January 2008, he was posted to 4RAR (Commando) as a Joint Offensive Support Team commander. On 27 November, Lieutenant Fussell was serving with the Special Operations Task Group when he was killed by an improvised explosive device detonation. Lieutenant Fussell had dismounted to approach a target compound on foot and stood on what was undoubtedly a booby trap. He and his mates were only too aware of the risks they took in those situations. Two members of his team were also wounded in the incident. The tragic incident is a reminder that Afghanistan remains a dangerous place. It also reminds us of the courage and dedication our troops bring to the task of protecting us and promoting freedom and liberty. Lieutenant Fussell died serving his country and is owed a special debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid. He was an outstanding soldier, showing courage and professionalism in the most demanding of environments. Lieutenant Fussell’s military decorations include the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp, International Campaign Against Terrorism; the Afghanistan Campaign Medal; the Australian Service Medal with clasp, Timor-Leste; and the Australian Defence Medal. His fatal wounding follows the loss of six other brave and selfless Australian soldiers: Sergeant Andrew Russell, Trooper David Pearce, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Private Luke Worsley, Lance Corporal Jason Marks and Signaller Sean McCarthy. This huge loss of so many of our finest should make all of us in this place more determined than ever to prevail in our quest to deny terrorists a safe haven and training ground in Afghanistan. Over the course of the past two weeks, I have travelled to Canada, Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom for discussions on Afghanistan. I also met with our ambassador to the United Nations in New York to discuss what Australia might be able to do to secure more resources for the UN special representative in Afghanistan. In Canada, I attended a meeting of Regional Command South-that is, a meeting of the eight defence ministers representing countries that participate in that part of the world. We spent a whole day discussing how we can secure better progress in Afghanistan. By the time. I got to Leeds, I was meeting with Minister for Foreign Affairs Stephen Smith at the annual AUKMIN talks-that is, the meeting between Australia’s defence and foreign ministers and the defence and foreign ministers of the United Kingdom. Again, we spent much of our day talking about Afghanistan. In Spain and Portugal, I met with the defence and foreign ministers of both of those countries and again spent most of my time talking about how we might secure better progress in Afghanistan. I left Regional Command South somewhat encouraged by a number of things. The first was the reaffirmation by Secretary of Defense Gates that in the new year the United States will significantly enhance their troop contribution in the war-torn country. The enhancement is likely to be well beyond that which President-elect Obama had promised during the election campaign-up to five brigade combat teams, which is up to 30,000 additional troops. SecreMAIN COMMITTEE",154,Condolences
199,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter,"Minister for Defence) (4.35 pm)-Last week, 25-year-oldtary Gates also spoke of progress he was making on the establishment of a special trust fund, which will be used to fund a significant expansion of the capacity of the Afghan national army and the Afghan national police. The US will put a significant amount of money into that trust fund to kick it off. It is some billions of dollars-I will not name the exact figure, because I am not sure that has been made public. It will be expecting other partner nations and nations not participating in Afghanistan to make a contribution to that trust fund. The trust fund, again, is being used to expand the Afghan national army well beyond the aspirational 80,000 we spoke about at Bucharest in April of this year, up to 130,000. It will also expand and provide more training for the Afghan national police. Both of those organisations will be crucial to improving the security arrangements in Afghanistan in both the immediate and longer term. Those were both encouraging signs. We spent a long time talking about Pakistan in recognition of the fact that we will not secure better progress in Afghanistan until and unless we address the very significant challenges we face in Pakistan. It is well known that many of the insurgents are now finding safe haven in the tribal regions of Pakistan and are freely making their way in and out of Afghanistan. We need to work more closely with the Pakistan government to address those issues. Australia stands ready, by invitation, to do all we can to assist the Pakistan government. The eight ministers attending Regional Command South stand ready to do the same on behalf of their nation-states as well. There are some signs of hope for better progress in Afghanistan. We have elections there next year-probably in September 2009. It will be a watershed. The proper conduct of those elections will be absolutely critical, and I suspect that Secretary Gates and NATO more generally will be looking at partner nations to provide extra security to ensure that those elections are free and fair. Afghanistan obviously remains a very challenging place. The security environment is not good despite the very good work being done by the partner nations, including and in particular Australians in Oruzgan province. We have a long way to go before we have security at a level which we would think acceptable, a level which provides a pathway of ensuring that we do more in economic and institutional capacity terms. We will not do better in Afghanistan until we get a coherent strategy, one which properly marries the military, civil and political efforts in Afghanistan. It is going to take a big effort from the partner nations, working very closely with the Afghan government in securing those changes. I want to recognise that the ambassador of Afghanistan is with us this evening for this very solemn and important debate. I will continue, as I am sure all partner nations will continue, to do all I can to further progress success in Afghanistan. I have said publicly this week that the loss of Lieutenant Michael Fussell, and of course his six mates before him, only makes me more determined to secure our objectives in Afghanistan. I am determined that he and his six mates shall not have given their lives in vain. We owe it to them to press on and to secure those objectives we have been looking for in Pakistan and in Afghanistan. I close by extending my very sincere sympathies to Michael’s father, Ken, his mother, Madeline, and his brother, Daniel-who, as the member for Paterson pointed out, is also a lieutenant in the Australian Army. The Fussells have made a very significant contribution to their country, and I thank them for that. My sympathies also go to his foster sisters Nikki and Nyah, and I also remember today all of his mates, whether they be part of SOTG, the Special Operations Task Group, or part of the mentoring and reconstruction task force, who are still in Afghanistan mourning their mates. It is a very difficult time for them, and I thank them colMAIN COMMITTEE lectively for the very significant contribution they continue to make to the effort in Afghanistan and for what they are doing for their country. chamber recognises and welcomes the ambassador of Afghanistan, His Excellency Amanullah Jayhoon. Welcome. brate the life and to mourn the death of Michael Fussell. My colleagues here can speak of his military career far more eloquently than I, but I am today speaking on behalf of his friends. Michael Fussell was my nephew’s best friend at school and an acquaintance of my daughter, and his parents, Ken and Madeline, are good friends of my brother and sister-in-law. I have asked my nephew James to send me a few words so that I can speak on their behalf. James wrote that Michael was known to his mates as ‘Fuss’. He was a strong-willed and determined character who made the most of his opportunities. This was demonstrated by the career that he chose. He had a passion for sport, in particular rugby, squash and polocrosse, all of which he excelled at. He was the epitome of the ‘country bloke’ stereotype and never shied away from hard work. Fuss was a frequent visitor to my brother’s property and used to enjoy helping out on the farm. He also used to go out to Warialda and Gravesend to compete in polocrosse carnivals. He excelled academically, particularly in chemistry, history and English, and he loved to read. He was known to recommend many a good book to his friends. He was truly a loyal friend and he never let his rigorous Army schedule get in the way of keeping in touch with his mates and family. Fuss spent memorable weekends with mates in Newcastle, deep-sea fishing and attending a music festival. I think it was on 2 November, only a month ago, that he attended a festival in Newcastle with my daughter, Claire, and my nephew James just before he left for Afghanistan. Fuss died in the same way that he lived: serving his country and giving selflessly. He will be sorely missed by all who had the privilege of meeting him. James has added a few interesting anecdotes as to the sort of chap Fuss was. He and James paddled in the Hawkesbury River Classic and canoed 111 kilometres in 16 hours. When he was visiting my nephew on his property at Gravesend, his determination and athleticism led him to catch a wild pig completely unaided. Anyone who has had anything to do with that activity will know that it is no mean feat. There was also an occasion at home when he tried to re-create a science experiment that he had done during chemistry at school and filled the family kitchen with purple smoke. When we mourn the loss of our soldiers it is important to remember that they are someone’s friend, someone’s son, someone’s brother, someone’s mate. lence on the death in action in Afghanistan of Army Lieutenant Michael Fussell which was moved today by the Prime Minister, supported by the Leader of the Opposition and so eloquently spoken to just now and prior to that by the Minister for Defence. I join with all other members who have spoken on this motion in expressing my condolence to Lieutenant Fussell’s parents, brother and sisters on their loss. I note that his brother is also a serviceman, a lieutenant, as the defence minister pointed out. MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Condolences

202,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (4.48 Pm),"I rise today to support the motion of condoWe ask a lot of our service personnel and even more of their families. Lieutenant Fussell was the seventh Australian to die in action in Afghanistan, and we as a nation owe their families a great debt. I am sure that Lieutenant Fussell’s family and other families who have lost sons, husbands and brothers in Afghanistan would not want to think that these brave young men had died in vain. It is my strong belief that they did not. I could not support sending our soldiers into harm’s way if I did not believe very strongly that the mission of which they were a part was both just and attainable, and I am sure that this is the view of honourable members. Why do I think our cause in Afghanistan is a just one? In 1996, Afghanistan, which had already suffered 20 years of civil war, invasion and oppression, was taken over by the Talibanan army ruled by Islamic extremists of the most extreme type. This regime not only cruelly oppressed the Afghan people; it also harboured the headquarters of the al-Qaeda terrorist organisation. It was from Afghan soil that Osama bin Laden planned and launched the September 11 attacks in which 11 Australians, whom we should not forget, were killed in New York. When the Taliban regime refused to hand over Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders, the US and its allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom, designed to remove the Taliban from power and establish a democratic government in Afghanistan. We should be very proud of Australia’s armed forces, along with those of our allies and the Afghan people themselves, because of what they have achieved in the seven years since 2001. The Taliban regime has been removed, 30 million people have been delivered from tyranny and, for the first time in Afghanistan, we have a freely elected president and a multiparty parliament. The rule of law and civil rights have been established, although far from perfectly enforced. My apologies to the ambassador for saying that. Between friends, we can factually evaluate things. I think all the members of this parliament appreciate the respect the ambassador is showing Australia and Lieutenant Fussell by being here today. Millions of girls are attending school in Afghanistan. Those of us who have seen very moving films about Afghanistan like Kabul and The Kite Runner understand just how meaningful and important that particular aspect of a democratic pluralist country, which Afghanistan now is, is. That is surely a very important part of it. Fifty per cent of Afghans enjoy some rights under the government that now exists in Afghanistan with Australian support and the sacrifices of people like Lieutenant Fussell. The war in Afghanistan is by any reasonable definition a just war, and one that deserves the support of all Australians. That is why my party gave bipartisan support, when we were in opposition, to the previous government’s commitment to Afghanistan and why we have continued that commitment in office. But the sacrifice of the lives of our soldiers, even in a just cause, can only be justified if that cause has a reasonable expectation of success. It is true that over the last few years things have not been going well in Afghanistan. I thank the ambassador, General Molan, Professor William Maley and various other people who have testified before this parliament, including before my foreign affairs committee recently, for trying to outline solutions and make suggestions that we can all look at to improve the performance of the Afghan army, the Afghan government and the allied forces who are there supporting them. The first thing that I think we need to agree is that there has not been a strong, unified or coherent leadership of the coalition forces in Afghanistan, as the Minister for Defence has pointed out so many times and very strongly too, with a great deal of support from people in this parliament. Such leadership is necessary for success, and such leadership must come from MAIN COMMITTEE the United States. The sad fact is-and I say this with regret-that, under President Bush, the US has not exercised that leadership over the past four years to the extent that it should have. The Bush administration has obviously been bogged down in Iraq, militarily and politically. It has taken its eye off the main game where terror central is based, where Mullah Omar, the leader of the Taliban, is still free and where OBL probably wanders the hills of Waziristan. The second point flows from the first. In the absence of strong and respected leadership from the United States, the other countries which have forces in Afghanistan have not worked together. They have pursued their own strategies, some better than others, in different parts of the country. I think we are all very proud of the work of our fellows in Oruzgan province but I am not sure that this is being pursued as efficiently and effectively by other members of ISAF in the rest of Afghanistan. We saw in Bosnia-Herzegovina that this approach does not work, yet we have made the same mistake. Unless the coalition forces in Afghanistan work to a common objective, under strong and accepted leadership, they will not succeed. The third reason we are having difficulties is that the coalition forces in Afghanistan are simply not strong enough. I do not argue that the war in Afghanistan can be won by force alone, but without adequate forces it certainly will not be won. The rule of thumb is that successful counter-insurgency warfare requires a ratio of 20 combat reliable troops per 1,000 of population. In Iraq, with 27 million people, there were, at the height of the surge, 175,000 coalition forces. In Afghanistan, with 30 million people, there are 60,000 coalition forces. The Minister for Defence has pointed out that the United States and the new US administration of President-elect Obama have promised a further five brigade forces, and that should take the coalition forces to 90,000. However, the real problem in Afghanistan is that unlike in Iraq there are simply insufficient members of the Afghan army. Currently there are only 64,000. The ambassador has advised me and the foreign affairs committee that there is a proposal to take that to 134,000, which I think is very good. But, as General Molan suggested to the foreign affairs committee yesterday, we need to take the struggle further. So, with 90,000 coalition troops and 134,000 Afghan troops, I still think that with 30 million people there are simply not enough boots on the ground. The fourth reason is the role that Pakistan has played in the Afghan conflict from the beginning. actually a condolence motion.

Fortunately, all these problems can be solved. In January we will have a new administration in Washington. President-elect Obama has named a tough, experienced and, dare I say it, hawkish national defence team, with Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, Robert Gates at the Pentagon and Marine Corps General JamesL Jones as National Security Adviser. Anyone who feared that the Obama administration was going be soft on terrorism can be reassured by these appointments. President-elect Obama has committed the US to withdrawing its combat forces from Iraq over the year. This will free up troops and resources for Afghanistan and, just as importantly, will refocus national attention in the US on the war in Afghanistan, to which both President-elect Obama and Secretary-designate Clinton are strongly committed. President Obama will come to power with enormous international goodwill, and I hope and believe he will use that leverage to insist on a unified command in Afghanistan, to insist that the US allies commit more resources to Afghanistan, and to insist that Pakistan regain control over its border areas and stop them being used as sanctuaries for the Taliban, al-Qaeda and Lashkar-eTaiba. We can now use our influence in Washington to call for renewed focus on and commitment to Afghanistan, as the Minister for Defence has been doing, and for a united strategic approach backed by adequate force to achieve success there. Some argue this may require additional commitment to Afghanistan. That is something I think we should consider. Success in Afghanistan-by which I mean stable, democratic government in Kabul able to defend itself and provide security and freedom to the long-suffering Afghan people-will be the best way of honouring the memory of Lieutenant Michael Fussell and the other six brave Australians who have given their lives in Afghanistan. year-old commando serving with the 4th Battalion in the Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) who gave his life whilst serving the nation in Afghanistan, in the southern province of Oruzgan during a night-time offensive operation. He was born in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, on 17 November 1983 and enlisted in the Australian Army in January 2002, straight to the Australian Defence Force Academy-and having been there, I certainly know the shocks of arriving there at that time of year. He completed a Bachelor of Arts and was a keen sportsman. I believe he captained the rugby team. He graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon, having been in Gallipoli Company, in 2005 and was posted to the ‘A’ Field Battery, 4th Field Regiment as part of the Royal Australian Artillery. During his time at ‘A’ Field Battery he qualified as a paratrooper, subsequently deploying to East Timor on Operation Astute in 2006 and 2007. He was subsequently posted to the 4th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) in January 2008 as the JTAC, the joint terminal attack controller. Lieutenant Fussell’s military decorations include the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp, International Campaign against Terrorism; the Afghanistan Campaign Medal; the Australian Service Medal with clasp, Timor-Leste; and the Australian Defence Medal.

208,Mr Robert (Fadden) (4.58 Pm),"I rise to honour Lieutenant Michael Fussell, the 25parents and family should be very proud of their warrior son and brother. He died a soldier’s death. Lieutenant Fussell was the first officer since Vietnam and the first graduate of the Australian Defence Force Academy to be killed on active service. Michael fought and died with a great battalion from a great regiment. The decision to raise the 4th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment was actually made in 1963. It was officially raised on 1 February 1964 at Woodside in South Australia, which was the first time a regular infantry battalion had been raised on Australian soil. Of note, the then Governor General announced that the 4th Battalion assault pioneer platoon sergeant would be the only soldier in the Australian Army permitted to wear a beard. In October 1965 the 4th Battalion joined the 28th Commonwealth Independent Brigade Group at Terendak camp in Malaysia as part of confrontation. In 1968, on 13 May, an advance party from the battalion moved by air to South Vietnam and the rest of the battalion followed on board the HMAS Sydney, relieving the 2nd Battalion on 21 June. The battalion would commence its second tour of Vietnam from May to December 1971. On 18 August 1971 Prime Minister McMahon announced the withdrawal of troops by Christmas, and in December 1971 the Battalion less Delta Company and 1 TroopB Squadron3 Cav returned to Townsville, again on board the Sydney. Delta Company remained at Vung Tau until March 1972. In August 1973, due to the reorganisation of the Army and the cessation of national service, the 2nd and the 4th battalions were linked to form 2/4 RAR. The 2nd/4th returned from deployment on Operation Tamar to Rwanda in 1994 and they were delinked on 1 February 1995, with the 4th Battalion moving to Holsworthy. A decision was made in 1996 to convert 4RAR to a special forces unit within the Royal Australian Regiment and on 1 February 1997 the battalion was renamed the 4RAR (Commando). Today the 4th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, who Michael so proudly served with, is the commando battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment and one of the three combat capable groups within Australian Special Operations Command. Many descendants of the original members of the battalion are currently serving or have served in the battalion, and those who have served in the Royal Australian Regiment know that to serve is to serve proudly-as Michael Fussell certainly did. I am especially proud to relay to the House this afternoon that over 150 Helensvale State School year 7 students and one year 6 student in my electorate of Fadden have been sending and are continuing to send letters to the officers and soldiers of the 4th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment while they are serving overseas. The school liaison officer, Mrs Mary Anne White, states that many of the letters are heartfelt and emotional, indicative of a school that cares and reaches out to its community. Let me conclude this speech on the condolence motion for Lieutenant Fussell by reading a letter written by Jake Gould from class 7W, Mrs White’s class at Helensvale State High School in my electorate. This letter, like the other 150 letters, was sent to men of the fighting fourth, the 4th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment in Afghanistan. The letter says: Dear soldier, My name is Jake but my friends call me Big Red which is weird because I’m not big and my hair is brown with blond bits. I think it’s because of my big muscles, (narr I’m kidding my muscles aren’t that MAIN COMMITTEE big). This year I’m in year 7 and I’m actually enjoying it. The big year 7 test was on and it was a bit hard but I think I pulled it off. If there’s 3 things I enjoy doing they would have to be skate park, hanging with friends and rugby league and union. The skate park is so much fun on bike and scooter. I’m getting a bike soon. It will be the same as Barry’s also known as Ryan. Ryan is my best friend (one of a million). Ryan is a good friend with a nickname Barry. My other three best friends are Spasm, Big Blue and Timmy. Spasm’s real name is Cam and Big Blue is Dean. Timmy doesn’t have a nickname. Anyway, I would like to hear the life of an army man. What are the grounds like? BecauseI can picture them quite hilly. When you get told to go out are you scared? I think that would be one of the most scariest things you could do that’s why I truly look up to you guys. What type of weapons do you use and are they hard to fire? I don’t know if you have kids of your own but if you do you should know that they would think the world of you. Well if my Dad was over there that is how I would think. I don’t know how you feel but if you get time to one day, could you please reply to this. Because that would mean the world to me. I do not know which soldier of the 4th Battalion in Afghanistan received Jake Gould’s letter. But, knowing soldiers as I do-and I am looking across at the member for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly, who also knows soldiers-I know that Lieutenant Fussell would have read one of the letters from Helensvale State School, and I know it would have brought him enormous comfort, as heartfelt letters always do. The year 7 students of Helensvale State School will never forget the men of 4th Battalion, RAR. They will never forget Lieutenant Fussell, who would have read one of their letters, and nor will this grateful nation. Dr KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (5.06 pm)-I rise as a member of parliament, as a member of the Defence portfolio team, as a member of the ADF and as a member of the rugby fraternity to farewell Lieutenant Michael Fussell. There is never any getting used to these casualties and, as the member for Fadden, Stuart Robert, knows, every time one of these things happens it is like losing a member of the family, and you feel it deeply-though not, of course, as much as the members of his family themselves. But it is a tight fraternity in the ADF, and his friends and colleagues and the members of his unit in Afghanistan will be feeling this keenly at the moment. All of our thoughts and prayers, I know, are with those members in Afghanistan at present. We had a very special individual here in Lieutenant Fussell. He was a true leader. And it is very obvious, from the service record that has been outlined by many of the members who have spoken, what type of man he was. He was not only a keen sportsman but also, as he pursued his career, he achieved greatly through the Royal Military College and then, as he went on to the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery, he qualified as a paratrooper-and that exercise in itself tells you a lot about the man. It is not an easy thing to step out of a perfectly serviceable aircraft. If anyone knows anything about paratroop training, they will understand that it is always the officers who are asked to step out of the plane first, ahead of the rest of the troops. So what we had, in Lieutenant Fussell, was really one of those men who are of the ‘follow me’ type, and a great loss he will be to the Australian Defence Force and to our community. Who knows what he would have gone on to achieve, not only within the ADF but in life in general. Certainly, our thoughts and prayers are with Madeline and Ken, his parents, and his siblings, Daniel, Nikki and Nyah. It is worthy of note that this family has offered this nation two MAIN COMMITTEE sons to the service of the ADF, and our thoughts and prayers are with Daniel, in particular, at this moment in the 1st Field Regiment of the Royal Australian Artillery. It is also important to note that this casualty occurred as a consequence of contact with an improvised explosive device. The bulk of our casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan have been caused by these improvised explosive devices. They are an insidious threat not only to our personnel but also to NGOs and everybody who operates in these environments. We are facing an ongoing battle with insurgents and terrorists. It is, effectively, a cat-and-mouse game of measure and countermeasure that is being played in dealing with these insidious devices. I would like to take this opportunity to salute the wonderful service of the men and women of the ADF’s Counter IED Task Force, led so ably by Brigadier Phil Winter. This task force is doing outstanding work. They are quiet achievers. They are not well known outside of the Defence Force-or, indeed, within it-but the work they do is as important as anything else that is being done within our organisation. The establishment of this task force has led us to acquire important capabilities and make improvements in the posture and the capability of the Defence Force in that it has forced us to acquire weapons technical intelligence capabilities associated with this effort. Those capabilities in themselves have enabled us to, if you like, get inside the loops of the insurgents and the terrorists that we are dealing with. The information that is yielded through this capability is essential and important to our ongoing effort against terrorism and insurgency. Once again, I wish to draw attention to and salute the efforts of the Counter IED Task Force. We need to do more in this area to continue the battle of trying to stay one step ahead of the enemy. It was my privilege, as director of the Middle East strategy group within Defence, to pursue this effort with a lot of vigour because I was well aware, of course, of the threats being posed to our personnel. We will reach out to our allies and to any in the international community who are pursuing research and development in this area to further the benefits to our personnel of greater force protection, technologies, measures and assets. That is an ongoing effort around the world as we speak, and certainly it has been my privilege, in this current portfolio position, to assist in pursuing that effort. As the member for Melbourne Ports emphasised, when we suffer casualties in Afghanistan it is important to remind the Australian community and the parliament and reassure the family of the member who has been lost that the war in Afghanistan is important and the deaths we have suffered are not in vain. The war in Afghanistan is important for a number of reasons in relation to our national interests and the cause of international peace. Probably about 20 per cent of the drugs on our streets emanate from Afghanistan, so the effort in Afghanistan is important in relation to our fight against drugs nationally. It is also important because, as the member for Melbourne Ports highlighted, Afghanistan was a haven for terrorism, and not just in relation to the infamous 9-11 attacks. Certainly, Afghanistan was a haven for terrorism throughout the South-East Asian region. The Bali bombers, who caused such havoc, in particular to Australian citizens, received their succour and support from the terrorist infrastructure that existed in Afghanistan. It is currently being rebuilt in the ungoverned spaces in Pakistan today, in the federally administered tribal areas of North Waziristan and South Waziristan and in the North-West Frontier Province. A great effort needs to be mounted there not only by Pakistan but through all the assistance that the international community can render to President Zardari and the Pakistani government. MAIN COMMITTEE It is important to deny terrorists that safe haven. We cannot win a counterinsurgency effort in Afghanistan without denying them that safe haven and continuing to assist our brothers and sisters in Afghanistan-and I acknowledge the presence of the ambassador here today-in building good governance and infrastructure and a better future in Afghanistan. That is how we will win this counterinsurgency. As a counterinsurgency rule of thumb, these conflicts are won by a combination of about 20 per cent military security and about 80 per cent social, economic and political factors. We need to make a better effort towards that 80 per cent and mesh our military and civil construction efforts much better, as has been highlighted many times. We continue to promote that effort internationally and now we have equipped ourselves nationally to improve our ability to do that through the establishment of the Asia-Pacific CivilMilitary Centre of Excellence in Australia, which is based in my electorate. The other key point to make about the war in Afghanistan is the potential for the spillover of that conflict to destabilise the region generally. Of course, one of the most significant risks there is in relation to Pakistan itself, a nuclear-armed state which we cannot afford to allow to become an ungoverned space or, indeed, to fall into the hands of Islamic extremists. All this is to say that Lieutenant Fussell’s death and the efforts of all of our men and women in the ADF continue to be of importance to our national security and to the international effort for peace and security. I salute the service of those men and women. I salute the service of Fuss and I tell Fuss today: we will not forget you. chael Fussell. It is significant that we set aside days in our calendar year when we commemorate and say thanks to all who have served, right throughout our history, to help shape our nation and to give us the gift of freedom that we enjoy. The ANZAC spirit which originated in Gallipoli is the common thread that winds through every war and engagement that we have had as Australians and leads us to this condolence motion today. Michael Fussell was in fact the inheritor of that tradition and he upheld that tradition, as do all our members of the ADF. But he laid down his life as well. The incident of 15 schoolgirls having acid thrown in their faces because they dared to seek education, with one blinded and others permanently disfigured, shows we have a long way to go. But Lieutenant Fussell was there; he showed how important it was, by the way he conducted himself. He believed in the justness of the war he was fighting. The war is importantand I, too, would like to acknowledge the presence here today of the ambassador of Afghanistan. The pride that we have in all our men and women who serve our nation wearing the uniform, fighting under a flag, is a pride that we extend to and indeed embrace Lieutenant Michael Fussell with today. Six deaths have preceded his. It is remarkable that those deaths, each of them tragic, are indeed so few. And the reason they are few is that our troops are so well trained and that their dedication to remaining well trained and well disciplined is ingrained in them. They serve, and we are the beneficiaries. To parents Ken and Madeline, to brother Daniel, himself a serving officer, and to foster sisters Nikki and Nyah, I extend my sincere condolences and sympathy. But I say to them, as I think to myself: to have known such a young man must give you eternal pleasure; to know that he is lost to you will give you eternal sadness. But know that the nation shares with you a MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Condolences
209,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (5.14 Pm),"I, too, rise to honour Lieutenant Mipride in your son and your brother. I think that is an important thing that we do in this parliament, and that is why I am adding my remarks today. members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places. Honourable members having stood in their placesMs KING (Ballarat) (5.18 pm)-I move: That further proceedings be conducted in the House. Question agreed to. Economy Debate resumed from 1 December, on motion by Mr Albanese: That the House take note of the following document: Australia’s response to the global financial crisis Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (5.19 pm)-The government’s response to the global financial crisis has been characterised by its failure to heed warnings from 2007 and specific warnings from late 2007 and throughout 2008 as the failings of the US subprime market infected the global financial sector. Had the government read the signs and heeded the warnings, it could have responded in a far more considered and reasoned way, both with a coordinated overall strategy, not the ad hoc, hasty decisions that we have seen, and in a more calm and measured and steady manner that would have boosted confidence in Australia, not destroyed confidence as it has lurched from one bungled response to another under the guise of ‘decisive’ action. The Prime Minister and his ministers’ pavlovian response that the government acted ‘decisively’ in response to the global financial crisis might mean it acted quickly but it does not mean it acted in a considered, well-advised, thought through or measured way. The government’s lack of preparedness to respond to the global financial crisis was highlighted by the Deputy Prime Minister in a radio interview on 24 November this year, when she said: No-one 12 months ago was talking about a global financial crisis, now everybody is talking about a global financial crisis. How wrong she was. In fact, on 12 November 2007, the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, warned of: The collapse of the sub-prime US lending market which is now having reverberations around the world. And all of these things will buffet global inflation, they will buffet our economy, they will buffet exchange rates, they will affect growth and job opportunities. They will require careful management on the Budget, on tax, on structural policy, on industrial relations, on competitiveness, on investment. That is what former Treasurer Costello said on 12 November 2007. But if the Deputy Prime Minister did not want to heed the words of the then Treasurer, by the time the Rudd government came to office it should have at least read the Reserve Bank warnings, and they had begun not in 2008 but in early 2007. The Reserve Bank’s Financial stability review in March MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Condolences
210,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Kj Andrews),I understand it is the wish of honourable,166,Ministerial Statements
211,The Deputy Speaker,"I thank the Committee.2007 referred to the increase in delinquencies on subprime loans causing significant difficulties for many subprime lenders. Reflecting this, it said: … more than 20 sub-prime lenders have shut down and, on average, the share prices of the largest subprime lenders in the United States have fallen by nearly 40 per cent since the start of the year … The problems in the sub-prime market have also weighed on other financial stocks … They went on with another warning. The Reserve Bank’s Statement on monetary policy in May 2007, talking about the three main risks being identified and their impact in the US economy, spoke of ‘a generalised tightening in credit standards leading to a “credit crunch”’. The Reserve Bank of Australia was referring to the US credit crunch of May 2007. It went on to refer to: … an overly aggressive regulatory response by state and federal agencies which could also cause a decrease in credit provision; and a deepening of the ongoing contraction in residential construction and stagnation in house prices. In its September 2007 Financial stability review, the Reserve Bank referred to the marked increase in the delinquency rate on subprime mortgages, and spoke about a large number of mortgage originators in the United States closing and potential losses on the subprime mortgages of some US$100 billion. In February 2008, the Reserve Bank statement warned again of the ongoing turbulence in international financial markets since the last statement, including a large correction in global equity prices, and it spoke about the growing pessimism among investors about the outlook for the US economy and, by extension, for global growth. The United States congress, in early 2008, was already implementing significant measures to deal with the slowdown in the US economy-a slowdown which would, as we know, impact worldwide. Economic indicators had suggested an increased risk of recession in the United States. I point out that, in January 2008, the US congress enacted the Economic Stimulus Act 2008, signed into law on 13 February 2008. Its provisions included tax rebates to individuals, and business tax incentives. In fact, the total cost of the bill was US$152 billion. The Reserve Bank of Australia sent out another warning in its Financial stability review of March 2008 and another warning of the impact of the US subprime crisis globally in its Statement on monetary policy in May 2008. So for the Deputy Prime Minister to say in November 2008 that no-one was talking about the global financial crisis 12 months ago shows that the Deputy Prime Minister was not following international financial trends, nor was she following Reserve Bank warnings. In fact, the government was so ill prepared for the impact of the global financial crisis that in early 2008 it declared that its No. 1 priority was fighting inflation. The Treasurer had his entire focus on fighting inflation, egging the Reserve Bank on to put up interest rates when the rest of the world was loosening monetary policy to deal with the impact of the pending global financial crisis. We all recall the Treasurer’s now infamous statement on the eve of the Reserve Bank meeting that the inflation genie was out of the bottle. He was egging on the Reserve Bank to put up interest rates. The Prime Minister was in on this as well. Inflation was ‘public enemy No. 1’ for the Prime Minister. On 21 January 2008, he declared a ‘war’ on inflation and he set out a five-point plan to fight inflation. He went on in June of 2008 to talk about the inflation ‘monster’ wreaking havoc on interest rates. Even as late as 27 August 2008, in the House of Representatives, he spoke about inheriting inflation running at 16-year highs and putting downward pressure on inflation. MAIN COMMITTEE As we know, that was precisely the wrong message to be sending. While the rest of the world was loosening monetary policy, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the government were egging on the Reserve Bank to tighten monetary policy. The government’s first budget gave another sign of the fact that the government was completely misreading the economic circumstances that were unfolding around the world. It was so blinded by its desire to harm the record of the former coalition government on economic management, so blinded by its political efforts to damage the coalition on one indicator, inflation, that it took its eye off the ball. The budget included tax increases-$20 billion in increased taxes and revenues. That was precisely the wrong fiscal response for that time, and yet the government refused to acknowledge that it should be easing fiscal policy. By 15 September, once Lehman Brothers had collapsed and the catastrophe in the United States was becoming evident even to the government, it started to talk about the global financial crisis. Of course, on 12 October the Prime Minister made the first announcement comprising part of the government’s response to the global financial crisis. But, as we know, that response was not in relation to what was happening around the world; it was a response to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition and I had called a press conference on 10 October and set out a number of suggestions for the government on bank guarantees, on the residential mortgage backed securities market and on delaying the emissions trading scheme in the face of the unprecedented global crisis unfolding around us. The government’s announcement of an unlimited government guarantee for bank deposits has been canvassed on numerous occasions in the House of Representatives. Suffice to say that the opposition believed the government when it said that it took explicit advice from the Reserve Bank governor, the man charged with the responsibility in this country for the stability of the financial markets. We believed the Prime Minister when he said that he had explicit advice from the Reserve Bank governor. We now know that this unlimited bank guarantee has caused enormous dislocation in the financial markets. That was an inevitable consequence when the government announced that it would guarantee some deposits in some institutions and the Prime Minister says that they are therefore protected and safe. In the minds of the public, that means that deposits that are not in those institutions are not guaranteed, not protected and not safe. It is no surprise that billions of dollars of funds were moved out of one sector of the financial markets into another. We also know that many of these funds and institutions had to freeze their accounts to ensure that there was not a run on them. It has been estimated that some 270,000 Australians have had their funds frozen in mortgage funds and the like as a result of the government’s bungled unlimited bank guarantee. And who will forget the Treasurer’s response to those who were suffering hardship as a result of their funds being frozen? His response was, ‘They can go to Centrelink.’ That was an insult to thousands and thousands of self-funded retirees around this country. But the government’s bungling continued. The government informed those institutions that did not receive the guarantee that they could just convert into banks and it gave APRA more money to fund the conversion. Anybody would know that it does not take days to convert into a bank. It could take months, if not years-and that is if they wanted to do it. The government also said, ‘Well, those suffering hardship because their funds have been frozen can get ASIC to somehow assess their hardship and then try and unfreeze the funds.’ We have not heard too MAIN COMMITTEE much about that. Eventually the government caved in, after weeks of uncertainty in the financial markets, after weeks of hardship for Australians, and imposed a cap of $1 million, with a fee for deposits above that amount. As we know, the Reserve Bank governor has been begging the government to impose a cap-‘the lower the better’. The government has also bungled its introduction of the wholesale term funding guarantee for Australian banks. For weeks the opposition suggested that the government should introduce legislation with a standing appropriation to ensure that the guarantee was unconditional, irrevocable and timely, but of course the government would not do that. It has now conceded that that should have been done at the time of the announcement. The government has also announced a stimulus package of some $10.4 billion following Treasury advice that it needed to act in a manner that was temporary, targeted and timely. As that package has yet to be delivered, time will tell whether it will have the desired effect. But there is another view of fiscal packages, and that is that they be permanent, pervasive and predictable. This alternative stimulus mantra has been offered by John Taylor, a professor of economics at Stanford University, in testimony before the Committee on the Budget in the US Senate on 19 November this year, as the United States Senate considers the options for a second stimulus package in addition to the US$152 billion boost in the Economic Stimulus Act passed earlier this year, which I have just referred to. Another concern is the government’s failure to provide the Australian public with confidence. It has been talking down the economy. In order for banks to lend and people to spend, they have to feel confident about the government’s handling of the economy, growth in Australia and our prospects for the future. So what does the government do? It announces that it will go into deficit. Unlike virtually every other comparable country in the world, Australia has no government debt. It had a surplus of $21 billion, it has growth at two per cent and it has plenty of room to move in monetary policy. The government is yet to provide any modelling, research or evidence to back up its responses to this global financial crisis. It has yet to update its forecast. It does not keep people informed of what it is doing. Jobs are at stake and people deserve to be kept informed. bit more than two decades I actually ran a small to medium sized business: a law firm. I had business experience and built it up virtually from scratch. At 26 years of age, I put out my shingle-with a bit more courage than common sense, to be honest with you. I have listened to the member for Curtin on numerous occasions. I saw her on The 7.30 Report, A Current Affair and on the news. I heard her speaking on economic issues many times. As a candidate in the last election, we got briefings from the national secretary of the ALP. We saw statements made by the ministers of the then government. But I cannot recall at any stage hearing anything from the member for Curtin about a looming global financial crisis. In fact, in the debates last year between the then Prime Minister and then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, I cannot recall that the global financial crisis, looming like a sword of Damocles over Australia and the rest of the world, was a topic that was really discussed. It is great to be wise in hindsight. I listened intently to the member for Curtin just to find out what the opposition’s response was and what they would do if they occupied the treasury bench. What would be their response? In 15 minutes, we heard nothing about what they would do. We heard plenty MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Ministerial Statements
212,Mr Neumann (Blair) (5.34 Pm),"BeforeI was elected on 24 November last year, for aof criticism of us and plenty of prophetic utterances but virtually nothing about what they would do. The global financial crisis is a real issue for my electorate, which is in South-East Queensland. Because of its large dependence on the mining sector and on agriculture-on the dairy, beef and horticultural sectors-Queensland suffers a lot when there is a downturn in the economy. My area, which is around Ipswich, has historically suffered a lot when there have been downturns. We have relied on the coal mining industry, on railway workshops, on woollen mills and on the agriculture just outside of Ipswich in the Lockyer Valley and the old Boonah shire for employment. When global crises have hit us in the past-I am thinking back to the recessions that we had in the nineties, the eighties, and in the seventies when I was growing up-we copped it pretty hard. My dad lost his job. I know my friends’ parents lost their jobs. They say that all politics is local. The global financial crisis will have a big impact upon the men and women in the electorate of Blair, which includes Ipswich and the rural areas outside of it. I know it will have a big impact on rural areas in Queensland. I see the member for Kennedy here; it will have a big impact on his electorate as well. We are not talking about stuff here in this chamber that is trite or trivial. Making political points and criticising us as if somehow we should have seen this coming and as if we are at fault for not seeing it really does not go down well. The truth of the matter is that we are talking about really serious stuff. People are going to lose their jobs. People are going to lose their houses. Their kids are going to suffer as a result of this. Whole communities-both rural and metropolitan-in Queensland and elsewhere in this country are going to suffer. Whilst we may be geographically an island, we are not financially. We know that we are integrated into the world economy. At the push of a button, people can move millions of dollars all around the globe. People in my electorate look at the Dow Jones and the FTSE, and they look at how their superannuation is being affected. They have told me that they worry when they see statements from their superannuation funds. So this is not a time for cheap political point scoring; this is a time for true bipartisanship. That is what this should be about. I almost feel sorry for the member for Curtin. She came in here and really ripped into us about this without giving any positive response as to what she might do if she happened to have ‘Treasurer’ after her name. This is a time of fear in the community. It is a time when we only have about 13 banks in this world with AA ratings-four of them are, fortunately, in this country. It is a time when 1.2 million jobs have been lost in the US. It is a time when 200,000 jobs in the automobile industry in this country are at risk, and that is why we have committed $6.2 billion to the car industry. Fears are crossing the world. In this globalised world that we live in, we have seen the best and the worse of globalisation. We have seen people suffer across the world, and we know that in our electorates they are going to suffer. Anyone who does not think that business is suffering ought to go Christmas shopping. Go Christmas shopping in metropolitan Australia and see the specials that retail outlets are putting out now, the kinds of specials that we are used to straight after Christmas in this country. Retailers in my area, South-East Queensland, have told me that they are experiencing a downturn. People are staying home. They are making their own lunches. They are not buying that car. They are not buying the house. They are not buying that item for Christmas. They are cutting back. That is why we need true bipartisanship. That is why we need to act in this country with precision, with clarity and with true MAIN COMMITTEE commitment to the welfare of our country. We need to protect, as much as we can, the people of our country from this unprecedented period of economic volatility. We understand that the global financial crisis started in the US. I think the people in our electorates understand that. But we are not able to sandbag our economy; we just cannot do it. The truth is that we are so integrated with the world. When the Prime Minister talks about acting ‘decisively’, it is not a term for derision; it is a term that is true. We are trying to protect our economy with a $10.4 billion economic stimulus package. We are confronting the worse financial crisis which our modern market economy has ever faced. I know that, from 8 December this year, nearly 44,000 people in my electorate will benefit from that package. That is older Australians, those with young families and those who have been doing it tough for a long time. They welcome the package. I think it is high time that those opposite said the same thing. We are trying to ensure that our economy can remain as robust as possible and that our people do not suffer the kinds of problems that we have seen overseas, where at least six of our OECD partners are in recession. We face the challenges of the severity of a global financial crisis here in Australia as well. We are entering a new and dangerous time in our economy. It is time for governments to be responsible, and it is time for politicians, who represent the people of this country-whether they be Independent, Green, Labor, National Party or Liberal politicians-to act responsibly and get behind the government. In a sense, it does not really matter what party the government is, Labor or Liberal; politicians need to get behind the government in a bipartisan way. I am pleased that the Prime Minister has announced the kind of package that will help the families, the carers, the first home buyers and the senior citizens in my electorate. These one-off payments will find their way into the economy and will help mitigate the worse effects of declining consumer sentiment. It is important for us, as politicians-even those who have just been elected-to show compassion, understanding and commitment in what we say and what we do, because we are the ones, whether in the ministry, in the cabinet or simply as backbenchers or cross-benchers, who have to stand up before the people in our communities, talk about these issues and see the pain, the hurt, the lack of self-esteem and the travails of those people. Anyone who has seen the look of despair in the eyes of a man who has lost his job and his house and who has to look after his wife and kids will understand what a challenge this will bring to our economy and to the families of our country. We have seen analysts, conservatives, progressives, trade union leaders, people in ACOSS and people in the business community welcome the package that we have rolled out, because it will have an impact on local communities. It is not just the $10.4 billion economic security package that we have handed out; it is also the $300 million that we are giving to local councils. In my electorate we have seen Ipswich City Council get $921,000 as part of this response to the global financial crisis, the Lockyer Valley council get $661,000 and the Scenic Rim council get $667,000. I have talked to the mayors of these councils-to Paul Pisasale, the Mayor of Ipswich City Council, to Steve Jones, the Mayor of the Lockyer Valley Regional Council, and to John Brent, the Mayor of the Scenic Rim Regional Council-about what they are going to do. I spoke last evening to John Brent and to Dave Cockburn, the deputy mayor of the Scenic Rim council, and I know they are considering some infrastructure programs. I know Scenic Rim are considering today what they can do in terms of a hydrotherapy complex that will make a big difference in health MAIN COMMITTEE and rehabilitation in the Scenic Rim, in the Boonah and Beaudesert areas and the areas south of Ipswich and that will also bring in tourism. That is the sort of infrastructure project that they could not afford without this money. Community projects that will boost local economies will do a lot for my area, and I have spoken to the mayors of those councils about what they will do in terms of sporting grounds, community centres, libraries, walkways and swimming pools. These are important community facilities that the local people use. I have also talked with the mayors about what they could do in terms of the $50 million for strategic projects. This response by the Rudd Labor government should be commended, but we have heard very little from the other side. We have heard a lot from local mayors and from the 565 councils and shires. Many of the mayors came here with their CEOs to talk about how to refurbish infrastructure. Funding for local community infrastructure is so important, and this is a timely response to the global financial crisis. I also warmly welcome the COAG process which will see about $15.1 billion injected into our economy as part of our response to the global financial crisis. That will make significant reform possible in the areas of health, education, housing, business deregulation and Indigenous affairs. In my area we have three particularly great private schools, Ipswich Grammar School, Ipswich Girls Grammar School and St Edmund’s, and another good school, St Mary’s. But when I look around the state schools and some of the primary schools in my area I can see they are in real need. The funding we are talking about here, as part of our response to the global financial crisis and through the COAG reformation process in the historic education reform package, will make a big difference in those schools, particularly in the disadvantaged schools. We are talking about a huge injection, of $1.1 billion, to help low socioeconomic status communities. The schools I am talking about in my area include schools like Boonah State High School, Bremer State High School, Ipswich State High School and Lockyer District State High School, which will benefit from this funding. So this is another great response to the global financial crisis which will have an impact on the schools in my area. I commend what the government has done. This is a time for true bipartisanship. It is not a time to be making petty points. It is not a time to be criticising us without putting alternative propositions to the chamber. I suggest that the member for Curtin get behind the government and make a contribution which is positive to the local community in my area and in hers. (Time expired) the Prime Minister’s statement on the global financial crisis. I will not go over all the elements, as I have had the opportunity to reflect on some of the local opportunities that I hope the Frankston City Council and the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council will take up in terms of the stimulus package. Much has been said about the tactical and political responses of the Rudd government, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and member for Curtin has eloquently outlined that argument. I have also heard a bit about bipartisanship. My understanding of that is that it is not a call from one side to demand an almost one-party-state approach where there is some slavish adherence to a world view put forward by one side of the parliament. Bipartisanship has a sense of shared purpose, of valuing a broader range of input, of mutual adjustment and then moving forward together. I invite the members of the government who have arrived at a rather strange understanding of what bipartisanship means to reflect on that. The reflection might bring a more collaborative manner to their involvement. MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Ministerial Statements
213,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (5.49 Pm),"I rise tonight to make a contribution to the debate onWhatI will do tonight is talk about what I think the global financial crisis requires of all of us, and that is to look forward and see that this time is one where we could reflect on what it is we are trying to achieve. I advise my colleague the member for Kennedy that I am filling in for the member for Cook and take that opportunity to point out what I think we need to do. We need to embrace the three steps to a greener growth economy to improve sustainability. I characterise those three steps as Californication, alignment and transformation: three elements that I think the government should embrace. Our gift to the next generation must be a greener growth economy and a more sustainable high standard of living. This means an Australia with an economy that builds on secure resources used conservatively and efficiently, where we nurture dependable and improved prospects for future prosperity, where the improved health of our natural systems is what we consistently work for and enhanced personal well-being and community vitality. We peer across the Pacific and see our nearest mainland American neighbours living a lifestyle and pursuing ambitions not dissimilar to our own. Peel away the obvious similarities and you will discover a quite different way in which enterprising Californians are going about creating wealth and improving living standards. This experience presents a pragmatic and inspirational case study for Australia that we could wisely emulate. If you need convincing of the opportunities, let me share a simple metric with you: California uses about the same amount of energy as Australia-to power almost twice the number of people and an economy twice the size. On the energy front, the Californian example demonstrates how, through a systematic, better practice performance approach, gains are being secured on a project-by-project, buildingby-building, decision-by-decision basis. Over time, this aggregates into a substantial improvement in energy efficiency and use. New business opportunities have emerged as the performance standards drive innovation. Consumers and investors look for proven and viable sustainability features as key selection criteria to satisfy smart regulatory requirements and to avoid premature obsolescence. Essentially, the Californian example embeds sustainability principles and objectives in the regulatory framework operating at the state, county and municipal level as it relates to property development and land use, production plant and equipment, durable consumer goods, household and workplace appliances and service consumption. These sustainability performance improvements became inculcated in things people do and buy and in decision making, just like safety. Securing these improvements should be our first step. This is the Californication step. Our next step should be to make sure governments get their own house in order and ‘walk the talk’. This goes to the element of alignment. The public sector’s own activity needs to be more alert to opportunities to pursue sustainability objectives in concert with programs that also pursue other public policy goals. This alignment of public policy objectives recognises that governments can and must chew gum and walk at the same time. A positive example is how the Commonwealth as tenant seeks office space and commercial premises that incorporate sustainability attributes. Governments need to set an example, offer attractive work environments and reduce the operating costs of these premises. Fleet selection and fuel contracts are other areas of some positive action. But these are very obvious opportunities where sustainability considerations are and should be front of mind when it comes to value for money and other routine procurement disciplines. Perhaps less obvious are the opportunities to secure sustainability gains in parallel with other, more explicit public policy goals across govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment. Embracing this alignment ethos is another way government can pursue a greener growth vision. The Commonwealth should insist on sustainability objectives being embedded in programs and policies on a whole-of-government basis and as a ‘must have’ feature of any program or project for which it is a partner. Examples include ensuring that transport plans and projects incorporate broader mobility objectives like reducing journey need and distance, and opportunities for optimising public and active transport modes. Facilities and buildings commissioned by the Commonwealth should showcase design features, construction methods and materials, technologies and best-practice-use sustainability attributes. Facilitated activity like that overseen by the Defence Housing Australia organisation, as it accumulates its property portfolio, should emphasise sustainability features in dwelling options. And what a missed opportunity the $622 million National Rental Affordability Scheme is, with sustainability attributes of new housing projects relegated to the ‘nice to have’ project selection criteria rather than being a fundamental requirement of proposals seeking government funding and support. It could not be clearer that a home that incorporates leading-edge sustainability attributes would be cheaper to run, as well as cheaper to rent, under the scheme. A showcase alignment opportunity has been passed over for what the Rudd government claims is an initiative that will ‘leverage private sector investment of up to $13 billion over the next four years’. A whole-of-government consciousness about policy alignment opportunities to pursue sustainability improvement is becoming more important given the Rudd government’s ‘watch’ of the erosion of the strong fiscal position and positive economic legacy left by the Howard government. What remains of the coalition’s treasure chest must be deployed wisely. A handful of major, high-profile, headline-grabbing ‘plaque’ projects alone will not markedly lessen our environmental footprint or bring about the greener growth gains we need to make. The remaining nest egg of infrastructure funds and our enduring positive fiscal position makes it possible and necessary to reach beyond incremental baby steps and the policy alignment gains I have mentioned, to pursue sustainability improvements that embrace meaningful reform. Australia’s hard earned financial capacity should be applied to secure a great leap through targeted investment in transformational change-to bring about structural, systemic and technological change to greatly advance a greener growth agenda for improving productivity, sustainability and living standards. This concept was explored and teased out at the recent Australian Davos Connection’s Infrastructure 21 Summit, From Incrementalism to Transformational Change. As ADC chairman, Michael Roux, put it: Transformational change is required to take a generation step forward envisioning the Australian society of tomorrow. This leap forward will require creative policy innovation, resilient leadership and concerted cooperation across jurisdictions. While this perspective related more specifically to the infrastructure challenges this nation faces, it is an important approach that extends beyond the infrastructure networks of our future economy into the broader agenda of a more sustainable Australia. Cross-jurisdictional, public, private, corporate and individual collaborative action is required to secure a positive and fundamental step-change in how we go about making operational our vision for an Australia where economic growth and a cleaner environment go hand in hand. MAIN COMMITTEE Beyond the built form element of proposals that may absorb much of the available funds, project selection and success criteria would also require a whole-of-system strategy to optimise sustainability outcomes through governance and regulatory reform, asset performance and efficiency standards, demand management, pricing transparency and reform, smart systems use and best practice management models. A relevant example is the coalition’s commitment to ‘replumbing’ rural Australia to make irrigated agriculture more sustainable and secure and to shore up reliable environmental flows. The practical action of piping public and private water delivery systems, lining dams to stop leakage, and taking steps to avoid evaporation should be accompanied by institutional and structural reforms and structural adjustment programs, proper pricing for infrastructure and resource use, smart systems for water management and use, efficient use and demand management incentives, and functioning and transparent markets that encourage resource security, investment and the best use of our scarce water. Commonwealth funding would then support infrastructure ‘hardware’ but, importantly, also facilitate the transformation of the complementary structural and systemic ‘software’ and the renovation and reform that these need. Assessing candidate projects against this more comprehensive set of interrelated goals would support calls for transparent and objective evaluation of project proposals and evidence based allocation of funding. Whole-system thinking would be embraced. This brings forward the need for broader expertise, like that offered by the Productivity Commission, to the crucial task of proposal evaluation. An example might involve a rail network enhancement proposal. Such a bid would need to be accompanied by proponent funding undertakings, commitments to improve the management and operation of the system, its interconnection with other transport modes, sustainability dividends, timetable enhancements, signalling investment to optimise current and proposed line use, rolling stock upgrades, complementary land use changes and possible private sector collaborations. The partnerships would be essential for actioning a transformational approach, which would help to ensure Commonwealth funding secured the best of all involved and that the federal government was not viewed simply as a soft touch for cash with no strings attached. The greener growth Australia agenda and a concerted effort to secure a more sustainable future for Australia, our people, our economy and our natural systems requires this three-step approach. We need a focus on pursuing incremental and gradual gains inspired by the Californian example, sustainability objectives embedded in all activities of government and aligned with policy goals across all portfolios wherever possible and the use of infrastructure funds and the more positive fiscal position provided by the coalition government to leverage transformational leaps forward. This is what the agenda for the future should be. This is the challenge we should tackle and react to in light of the challenges of the global financial crisis. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (6.01 pm)-I speak in strong support of the Prime Minister’s ministerial statement of 26 November on the global financial crisis that began out of the US subprime crisis 12 months ago and has spread from a small number of cases to a crisis of epidemic proportions. I speak in strong support of the Rudd government’s actions, including Treasurer Swan’s particular actions, which are decisive, timely and needed in this challenge that we face. And correct action it is, in not just responding but also pre-empting the situation as it develops-in the much heard but correct phrase, ‘to keep us ahead of the curve’. That is what MAIN COMMITTEE decisive action is about. It is not just responding; it is pre-empting and it is staying ahead of the curve so that we can continue to come out of the global financial crisis with our economy, which is strong, more intact. I speak in strong support of the particular actions that form the nucleus of the government’s Economic Security Strategy, a strategy designed to stimulate the economy and one that is acting in partnership with monetary policy. The budget framed by the Rudd Labor government and shaped and delivered by the Treasurer provided and provides the backdrop for the government’s ability to act now, as the global financial crisis impacts on us here. The $9 billion tax cuts, as one example, which were introduced in the budget to help ease the cost-of-living pressures, have certainly positioned us well for the things that are now starting to affect us. One key plank of the Economic Security Strategy is the $10.4 billion package that was delivered in October. There are a few items in that, obviously. There is assistance to pensioners of over $4 billion in cash payments nationally. Also, there are about two million families eligible for the family tax payment A who will benefit from the package. There are also the first home buyers, whose grant is going up from $7,000 to $14,000, and if you are building it goes up to $21,000. All of this package is part of what is designed as the economic stimulus. In fact, it is welcomed by all, including the opposition. The honourable member for Cowper, who also comes from the Northern Rivers and North Coast area, like me writes a column in a local newspaper. He welcomed the Rudd Labor government’s $10.4 billion economic stimulus package and was happy to showcase that in his writings for the local electors. There are other components of it which came after. Last weekend we had the $11 billion for critical government services, notably health and education, come out of the COAG agreement. There is also $6.2 billion for the auto industry that will kick in by 2010. To put it in context, I will just give a brief snapshot of the global conditions resulting from the crisis. There are at least 30 bank bailouts. The share markets are down 50 per cent-and counting. It has come to that in Australia as well. As of November, the governments of at least 15 countries that we know of have put together rescue packages, and more are doing so now. Recently we heard the President of the EC, His Excellency Jose Manuel Barroso, talking about the bailout package for the 27 EU countries. Major economies are falling into recession. Germany was the first cab off the rank, followed by Japan and Italy. Others have already experienced negative growth: the UK, the US, Canada, France and others. The projections for the US and others are bleak, and we know that projections globally are not good. There is no use gilding the lily. Some people ask, ‘Why are we talking about it?’ We have an obligation to be open and frank with the Australian people, just as I do toward the people of Page, who I represent. They need to know exactly what is happening and, equally, what action the government has taken to cushion us from some of the shocks. These economies I have referred to are generally strong economies, as, indeed, is ours-a little bit sounder than others, I might add. But our economy is now being bombarded by some forces out of our control. What is under our control is our competence and leadership. Leadership is important in these times, and the decisive action that has been taken by the Rudd government with the economic stimulus packages will help. I say ‘help’ because it helps to insulate us somewhat from the shocks to our system. It is a bit like being buffeted with a grenade. Some of the other economies are being buffeted by a rocket. There is a comparative difference. That is the way I think about what is happening to our economy and to other strong MAIN COMMITTEE OECD economies at the moment. We are starting to read about what is happening to developing economies, a lot of which are right here in our own backyard in this region. That cannot help but impact on us. There is a global financial trend downwards. We are the world’s 14th largest economy, and we experience the good and the bad of globalisation. Globalisation is a fact of life. We experienced good out of it, particularly over the past 17 years of sustained economic growth, but the tide has turned globally and it is dumping on our shores. I want to talk a little bit about trade, because the countries to which we send over half our exports have economies that are slowing or in recession. That, coupled with falling commodity prices, gives us a bleaker outlook for our terms of trade. The official forecasts are for an 8.5 per cent downturn. It makes it even more important that we give attention to completing the Doha negotiations. I note that one of the things to come out of the G20 meeting was a renewed vigour to complete some of the agreements in the Doha Round. All of the respective ministers have been instructed to be in Geneva, and I wish our Minister for Trade well in his deliberations there. I have a few comments that are relevant both on the national scene and locally in Pageand, indeed, in all of our electorates. The Australian share market has fallen by up to 50 per cent. Some local independent retirees and others tell me their incomes have fallen 40 to 50 per cent. Some are able to adjust and withstand that; for others it creates a lot of difficulties. There are falling house prices. We know that in the last two quarters consumer confidence has been at levels unparalleled since the early nineties. The November figures tell us that retail sales grew marginally after falling for two previous quarters. I note the retail sector got some degree of comfort that sales were actually up, because a big part of the objective of the economic stimulus package is aimed at spending. Building approvals are down. Car sales are down by about eight per cent nationally-I know my local car dealers are affected by thatand that flows on to all of us. Credit conditions are tough. It is difficult for businesses to obtain finance; that difficulty is at a 26-year high. Here is another issue, both nationally and also in Page. I had three local mortgage investment companies with about 10,000 local investors. Some of those were pensioners, some were short-term investors and some were charities and other groups, and all of them had been impacted by the global financial crisis. Another example of the government, particularly the Treasurer, taking action is when they worked with ASIC through the time when there were freezes on redemptions. ASIC worked out with the government a system whereby those investors could apply under hardship conditions. They did it through their mortgage investment companies. They could access up to $20,000 plus half of the balance of what they had left in there. That seems to be working quite well and things have now settled down in that area. In these times, we face a scenario described by the Prime Minister-though he was clear in stating that we have not reached this scenario yet-in his statement: If global growth continues to deteriorate in the period ahead, consistent with the economic data that is emerging during November, then there will be a further slowing of growth in the Australian economy-as surely as night follows day. If Australian economic growth slows further because of a further deepening of the global financial crisis, then it follows that the Australian government revenues will reduce further. We have heard that they could be down by as much as $40 billion, which certainly impacts on the ability to deliver new programs. The Prime Minister said that we have not reached that MAIN COMMITTEE yet, but he was flagging that, if we do get to that situation, that situation would be the trigger for a temporary deficit. It was just putting the cards on the table for the Australian people, saying to them, ‘If we get to this, then we’ll need to do that, and we’ll need to do it because it will trigger a further economic stimulus that will be needed to help that situation.’ With those comments, I give my strong support to the Prime Minister’s statement of 26 November. view that one of the major problems that we have in government in Australia is that, for many of the people who come into this place, when they were little their mummies and daddies never had them play Monopoly. If you have played Monopoly you will, of course, understand that if you own all of the utilities you can charge seven times the amount that you could if you only owned one utility. Anyone who has been in business for themselves knows that you do not go out there to create competition-you go out there to eliminate your competition. That is the name of the game. Yet people in here somehow think that by allowing a free market you are going to create competition. The Australian economy is probably one of the greatest examples in world history of the marketplace having been freed up completely-and I think that Paul Keating did probably establish the freest economy in the world. But what happens is that you do not thereby create competition. Take Woolworths and Coles-let me be very specific. They had 50.5 per cent of the Australian market in 1991 and by 2002 they had over 82 per cent of the market. So we most certainly did not create competition in the field of fruit and vegetable retailing in Australia-and I could go through all of the other sectors of the economy if you wished me to. I would say that I would have maybe two or three times as many economics books in my house as anyone else in this place, and I would say that I would probably be the only person who has read The Ascent of Money by Niall Ferguson, who was one of the best-selling historians in the world and who has turned his hand to this book on economics. In The Ascent of Money, Niall Ferguson talks about the game of Monopoly in exactly the same way as I have addressed the game of Monopoly today. There are people we in Australia call ‘economic rationalists’-they may be called ‘market fundamentalists’ in other countries-and anyone who does not agree with their viewpoint is regarded as somehow imbecilic or very limited in their intellectual capacity and very poorly read, and as someone who does not understand economics. People like me are relegated to the garbage can of intellectual debate. The economic rationalists of the previous government and the one before it have almost eliminated manufacturing in this country. AndI do not pluck ideas out of the air: every single thing that I say here I can back up with hard statistical evidence, and I am quite happy to give you the references. In the year before Mr Keating lowered tariffs on motor cars, 79 per cent of Australian motor cars were Australian made. Last year, 19 per cent of Australian motor cars were Australian made. And, since the decline is picking up very dramatically, it is expected that over the next 10 years only five per cent of Australia’s motor cars will be Australian made. There is virtually no manufacturing taking place in this country. For instance, I buy Baxter shoes-and, contrary to popular belief, RM Williams boots were not the ones with elastic sides; they were Baxters. I could not buy any and so I rang Mr Baxter up. I said, ‘I am very, very pleased, Mr Baxter, that you are still in business.’ And he said, ‘Don’t hold your breath, MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Ministerial Statements
214,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (6.14 Pm),"I have said in this place many times that it is myBob. We’ve got 120 employees this year; next year we’ll have six. We can’t compete against the Chinese. And their quality is very good. I’m not going to say their quality is poor-it is not; it is as good as we are able to produce here. So,’ he said, ‘next year we have to join them or we go under.’ I said, ‘You’ve been around for a fair while, haven’t you?’ He said, ‘Don’t you read your box? We’ve been around since 1854.’ They have survived government after government and setback after setback, but they could not survive the whirlwind and holocaust of economic rationalism which has been perpetrated upon this country over the past 15-or, arguably, 18-years. Mr Clinton was also a great advocate of the free market-contrary to the beliefs of all the run-about lefties. He liberalised the administration of and effectively abolished the restraints and safeguards placed upon housing loans in the United States so that people were able to sell off their mortgages, particularly the poor ones. They were collected into a big heap-I am not going to use technical terms. I am trying desperately to avoid technical terms because a person who comes into this place and uses a whole stack of buzzwords and phrases like ‘monetarism’ and ‘fiscal horizontal equalisation’ only confuses people. And those who actually understand those terms realise the complete intellectual bankruptcy of these galahs, who use big words that have no substance to them whatsoever. Let me return to Mr Clinton. They used the term ‘collateralise’ but all that meant was that they put together a heap of poorly performing housing loans and flogged them off to somebody. That was called the subprime market. There were enough rubbish housing loans out there to gravely threaten the major financial institutions of the United States. There had been no prudential behaviour. There had been no demand upon banks to act responsibly. The attitude was: in a free market you cannot restrain people; let the market look after itself. You loan money to everyone you can loan money to. The head of St George obviously put enormous pressure on his salesmen to go out there and flog off housing loans, and they did. The net result was that in 2003 in Australia the average house cost 28 per cent of average weekly earnings. Last year that had risen to 40 per cent. There were people out there who were grossly irresponsible. When I had a marketing agency with the AMP Society, prudentially responsible behaviour was demanded of us. If 20 per cent of our insurance contracts lapsed then we were shown the door-the agency was taken away from us. If the figure was over 10 per cent you were asked to explain. That was prudentially responsible behaviour; that was not the free market running amok, saying, ‘You will go out there and sell, sell, sell.’ Yes, they said that to us but they also said, ‘If you sell rubbish, if you give a person a contract that he cannot complete, then it is on your head.’ Over the last seven or eight years the banks have never said that to anyone, and we have had this explosion in Australia. If the subprime market pulled America down, people in this place had better take note. In America, the price of a house is 3½ times average annual earnings. To put that in perspective, when I bought my first house I had an income of $16,000. The average price of a house then was about $42,000 or $43,000. My house, humble as it was, cost only $23,000. I was in a country area and I did not have to pay much for the land. That was less than three times average annual earnings. When America hit house prices that were 3½ times average annual earnings, it got into very serious trouble. So you might say that Australia, if it was not travelling really well 20 or 30 years ago, is travelling a hell of a lot worse now. To put a figure on that: MAIN COMMITTEE America got into trouble because its house prices were 3½ times annual earnings. In Australia the figure is six times. So if they are in trouble, I leave it to your imagination, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, to figure out just how much trouble we are in. IfI wanted to be very technical about it, I would say we are in double the trouble. Having read widely on economics-and I am still doing it; for example, I just read Niall Ferguson’s book-I have come to the conclusion that the specific anecdotal evidence is far more valuable than the macro approach, to use the technical term. In the Gordonvale cafe I was enjoying a cup of tea with the IGA Queenslander of the Year, Davey Chalk, president of the local branch of the RSL, a TPI Vietnam vet and a really good bloke, and in walked the spokesman for the local coalition parties. He was not very friendly to him. His name is not Sam, but I will say it is Sam, and I said to him, ‘Sam, what do you reckon about next year?’ And he said, ‘I was going to buy a truck but now I am not going to buy a truck.’ AndI said, ‘Yeah, my son and my wife were going to build three units in Mount Isa next year and now they are not.’ Multiply that by one million and you have what is going to happen in Australia next year. There was $1.1 billion spent last year. It is not going to be spent next year. There are going to be people working in hardware stores that sell nails that will be put off, there will be people who sell and repair trucks that will be put off, and there will be people who are builders and electricians that will be put off, have no work and have great difficulty meeting the repayments on their houses. That is what is going to happen next year. That is the bad news. The good news is that we had a Great Depression and in that Great Depression there were many men of towering intellectual capacity, men whose names resound loudly to this very day: John Maynard Keynes, Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht and John Kenneth Galbraith to name but three. Those great men could see beyond the pettiness of politics and the specifics like ‘Oh! We have got a deficit budget! We cannot have deficit budgets! Deficit budgets are bad!’ I am colossally staggered and also scared by the opposition saying that deficit budgeting is horrible. The coalition is showing towering ignorance. If you are not deficit budgeting in a recession then that is very bad. If you deficit budget in ordinary times then I agree with the coalition-that is not good. But these are not ordinary times. Their own rhetoric has said again and again that these are not ordinary times. These are very troubling, extraordinary times. I try to use language that people understand. I return to the Gordonvale cafe: I said that the good news is that the government can write on a piece of paper, ‘We owe the bearer of this piece of paper $1,000 and we will pay it back to you in 10 years time, and we will pay you four per cent interest.’ That is what is called a government bond. But I do not want to say that; I want to say that the government writes on a piece of paper, ‘We will pay you $1,000 in 10 years time.’ If they print a million of those and give them to the Reserve Bank, then the Reserve Bank has collateral to give the government $1 billion to spend. So then roadworks will be done at Gordonvale and someone will buy a truck. The government, in its wisdom-we hope-will say: ‘Yes, there is housing needed in Mount Isa. So even though little Robbie Katter did not build those three units, the government will build them.’ Then people will not lose their jobs in Australia. Read about the Depression, read about when the police came into people’s houses and at gunpoint threw them out in the streets in Sydney, and all their earthly belongings sat there MAIN COMMITTEE whilst the children sat on top of the mattresses and howled their eyes out. Ask about the people who lived on the riverbanks and who died of starvation. Ask about that and about the number of people who committed suicide during that period of time, and you are looking down the gun barrel of what could happen now. Ask about how many people lived on rabbits during that period. In one of our great movies, Caddie, the rabbitohs were ubiquitous. We had a great fight over the football team-they were the Rabbitohs. Roosevelt saved America from communism, it is said-and I think that is a fair call. Funnily enough, Milton Friedman-of all people-would be one of the people responsible for the basis of what I am saying. Milton Friedman was the great champion of the exact opposite viewpoint I am putting here. If you read and understand his works you can see that he backs up every single thing that I am saying. I will give just one example. During the Great Depression America established the Tennessee Valley Authority. They built a canal right into the heartland of America where they could float out their timber and cotton. They did not have to build roads. (Time expired) on the government’s response to the global financial crisis. I must admit that when I listen to the debates around this topic, not just in this place but outside of this place, one could be forgiven for thinking that for the last 10 years Australia ran deficit budgets and we built up massive debtthe same courtesies. I am sure some may think that may have been the case in other places and I know it is the case in other countries. But one thing I do know is that in this country for the last 10 or so years we have had outstanding financial management. That financial management built up surpluses and it has enabled this country to face the storm that we are now facing. This country is not in the situation faced by many of those countries described as developing and also countries that are developed. Our country is in a position where it can actually face this crisis with a sense of confidence. One of the things that have disturbed me outside of this place and inside of this place is a sense of defeatism that says that somehow this crisis will defeat us, that somehow this crisis is not something that can be weathered. It was the former Prime Minister who made the point that it is dangerous to compare our current situation to the very tragic times of the Depression. It is very dangerous to make those comparisons because the situation is very different. TonightI wanted to make two points, firstly about deficits and then about housing matters in my capacity as shadow minister for housing. A youth worker in my electorate once told me that the single most dominant factor in determining how your children will turn out is who they hang around with. That is why it is important for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to be a little bit careful about how much time they spend hanging around with many of the nations they meet at the G20. At the next meeting, I suggest they seek a spot sitting next to the Canadians. Notwithstanding the Germans’ reputation for Oktoberfest, binge drinking is not the culture the Prime Minister and Treasurer must be careful to avoid at these gatherings. Rather it is the binge culture of deficits and debt that many G20 nations are famous for. It is no surprise that the majority of the G20 think it is time to go into deficit. They are already there and have been there for years. In fact, deficits are the norm for these countries. If MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Ministerial Statements

217,Mr Morrison,"I listened to you, Member for Kennedy, and I am sure you can extendthe Prime Minister and the Treasurer are taking their definition of a temporary deficit from their friends at the G20, then there is one thing we can be certain of: it will not be temporary. According to the IMF, the French and Italians have not had a budget surplus for over 25 years, the Japanese had their one and only surplus during this time in 1992 and the Germans have had only two surplus budgets since 1980, one in 2000 and the other in 1989. In the UK, the last surplus purple patch was from 1999 to 2001, when they achieved a trifecta, showing just how rare such an achievement in budget management can be in the G20. Across the Atlantic, Bill Clinton is the only US President to have presided over a budget surplus in almost 30 years, from 1998 to 2000. Yet in question time last week the Prime Minister held out Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan as his reference points for conservative fiscal management. By contrast, Australia has been in surplus for more than 10 years, including the current financial year. Only Canada and South Korea come close to this record, based on the available IMF statistics, despite a few more deficits during this time. So when it comes to picking our friends on responsible economic management, it is worth peeking over the shoulder of the Canadians to see how they are answering the question. Last week, the Canadian Finance Minister made a statement to the Canadian parliament on Canada’s fiscal outlook. He said the government is planning on balanced budgets for the current and next five years. Of significance is the fact that the Canadian economy is forecast to grow at a lower rate than Australia, at just 0.6 per cent this year and 0.3 per cent next year. You also pick up from Finance Minister Flaherty’s comments on the prospect of a deficit a much stronger resolve than that shown by our Prime Minister in terms of going into a deficit. He correctly says that ‘no government can guarantee the future’-and, to be fair to the Australian Prime Minister, he has said the same thing-and that tough choices are ahead for the next budget. However, after drawing attention to the Canadian government’s decisions to reduce federal debt by $37 billion, reduce taxes and engage in reducing the tax rate on new business investment to the lowest level in the G7 by 2010, he makes this comment: We do not take the potential of a deficit lightly. The thought of a long-term structural deficit would be even more serious-one that the Government is unable to climb out of, even when the economy improves. The days (and years, and decades) of those chronic deficits are behind us. No matter what 2009 brings, they must never return. This is wise advice. The Canadian finance minister is not advocating a deficit as the first policy of his government in terms of how to address the global financial crisis, which is the concern the coalition has about the government. Australia is even better placed than Canada to avoid a deficit, thanks to the economic legacy left to the Rudd-Swan government by John Howard and Peter Costello. Rather than lazily allowing ourselves to fall into such a trap, as so many of the G20 have done for more than 20 years, we should be strengthening our resolve, as the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition are arguing. Labor just simply cannot be trusted on deficits. I now want to turn to the issue of housing, which featured in the government’s stimulus package, particularly in relation to first home owners grants. My comment is that we really need to be thinking a lot more outside the square than the first home owners grants in terms of the issues we will be confronting in the 12 months ahead at the very least. MAIN COMMITTEE In 2003, long before the global financial crisis, the former Prime Minister’s home ownership task force introduced the concept of shared equity mortgages. The leader of that task force was the now opposition leader, Malcolm Turnbull. Rather than paying off interest on an 80 per cent mortgage, a shared equity loan allows, say, a much smaller 60 per cent mortgage combined with a separate 20 per cent loan on which no interest or rent is paid. In return, the borrower gives the shared equity investor a minority portion of future capital gains, capped at 40 per cent. If the property’s value stagnates, they simply repay the original 20 per cent sum with no interest. If the value declines, the shared equity investor actually wears 20 per cent of the losses. Importantly, since the lender has no ownership interest in the property, the borrower has complete control over it. Shared equity has since been taken up in Australia by the Bendigo Bank and the Adelaide Bank as well as by the South Australian, Western Australian and, most recently, Tasmanian governments. The Australian model has also been inspiration for the UK and New Zealand governments to support similar shared equity products, with the British investing £1 billion in their scheme. Despite acknowledging their merits, the Rudd-Swan government have done nothing to support shared equity mortgages in this country. When it comes to housing, they show little interest in the 80 per cent of Australians who are in private housing. With more than 200,000 people expected to lose their jobs over the next few years, this will put increased pressure on people trying to pay their mortgages. A few months ago, in response to the Leader of the Opposition, the government decided to invest $8 billion in the residential mortgage backed securities market-the RMBS market-to increase liquidity and ensure continued competition for housing finance. Only $1 billion of these funds has so far been committed. I note reports this week in the media that the government has been largely the sole investor in these RMBS products that have come onto the market. Some 80 per cent of the purchasing of funds making investments in these products has been done by the government. Shared equity funds were not a beneficiary of this decision. Unlike the banks, they do not benefit from the government’s deposit guarantees. However, these shared equity funds are similarly strained by the global financial crisis. The chief long-term investors in shared equity are super funds. These investments are their way of accessing Australia’s $3.2 trillion housing market. However, due to losses in share portfolios and application of their rigid asset allocation models, super funds are now withdrawing from shared equity. The Rudd government has an opportunity to break the capital drought faced by shared equity funds by immediately setting aside up to, say, $500 million from the $8 billion already committed to the RMBS market to invest in the shared equity sector. This would allow 5,000 Australian households to access shared equity mortgages and instantly cut their monthly mortgage repayments by up to 30 per cent or more, or reduce their upfront home purchase by a similar margin. This is especially necessary given the government and the OECD are now forecasting an increase in unemployment, as I mentioned before. Moving to a shared equity loan is one way to reduce this burden. A rise in mortgage default would undoubtedly stress our housing market, which has so far weathered this crisis relatively well. In fact, the biggest challenge facing our private housing market across Australia at the moment is unemployment. Mortgage default for banks is still, however, 40 per cent less than it was when Labor last left office in 1996 and the coalition government took over. The key MAIN COMMITTEE difference is that back then unemployment was at 8.1 per cent. Sharp increases in mortgage default caused by rising unemployment would lead to dumping of housing stock and a collapse or even just a fall in house prices. The human costs would also be great, with families forced to rely on already overcrowded social housing and other government support. These impacts would not be temporary. For some the impact would be intergenerational. Just last week I was speaking to the homeless council here in parliament, and I stated very clearly that I thought the biggest risk for their clients was there being more clients coming their way as a result of them being unable to remain in the private housing market. Keeping people in their private homes is one way to ensure that the important resources we have available for social housing in this country remain available for those who most need it. For all these reasons we must do all we can to keep Australians in their homes during this crisis. This will require governments and lending institutions working together to give people and families struggling with their mortgages real options, and that includes passing through rate cuts in full. I am disappointed to learn that Westpac has today chosen not to do that for their mortgage holders. Kevin Rudd, the Prime Minister, and the Treasurer should move now to invest in shared equity. The government should also consider providing access to rent assistance for mortgagees who have lost their jobs. Why we spend $2.2 billion on income support to help eligible families pay the rent but not a mortgage is a question worth asking, especially in these times. Ideas such as government providing HECS style income contingent loans through the tax system, to provide a lifeline to mortgagees while they get back on their feet again, as recently suggested by Melbourne University academic Joshua Gans and the ACTU President Sharron Burrow, also deserve consideration. Finally, as I have mentioned, banks must pass on rate cuts in full and they must work to tailor solutions to keep their clients in their mortgages and in their homes. This crisis brings many challenges to this country. This country is well placed to meet those challenges. The single greatest challenge facing us now, particularly for the housing market, is unemployment. We need to ensure that there are commercially sustainable solutions available to people to keep them in their homes and to keep them in their mortgages. The banks, together with the government and community sectors, need to work together to do all that they can to keep people in their homes, because, as we know, if you lose your home, if you lose your job, you can also lose your marriage. The level of social dislocation and family breakdown that will result from that is something we are all far too familiar with in our own electorates. We see people come through our doors on a daily basis to tell their stories. Those stories usually start with one massive life-impacting event, which is either the loss of a job, the loss of the home or something of that nature. We are going to face the social consequences of this in the next 12 months. We need to ensure that we have things in place to give people options to get themselves back on their feet so that we do not consign them to generations of dependence-on social housing, on social support and on all these other institutionsMr Melham interjectingwho will always need that support. I do not want that support to be overcrowded with people who have the opportunity to get back on their feet again. We need to give them that support MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Ministerial Statements
218,Mr Morrison,"because I know, as the member for Banks knows, that there are peopleby ensuring that right now we take the funds that we have set aside for investing in the RMBS market and put some of those funds into shared equity mortgages. That will provide another option. We should consider these measures as well; it is not simply about a plan to provide first home owners with a $14,000 or $21,000 bonus. The latter measure, in particular, is one that I support, because it does provide a stimulus to the housing construction industry, although at present all we have noted happening is a clearing of stock, not a building of new stock. That measure on its own will not keep Australians in their homes. We need to look at those who are already in their homes and make sure we enable them to stay there. The best thing we can do for them is to ensure that they stay in their jobs for a start. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. Migration Committee Report Debate resumed from 1 December, on motion by Mr Danby: That the House take note of the report. report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled Immigration detention in Australia: a new beginning: criteria for release from immigration detention. This report is the first of three reports under the inquiry’s terms of reference. This report addresses the criteria that should be applied in determining how long a person should be held in immigration detention, the criteria that should be applied in determining when a person should be released from immigration detention following health and security checks, review mechanisms for ongoing detention, removal practices and detention debts. The second and third reports will be tabled in 2009 and will address alternatives to detention, financial costs, service provision and the infrastructure required to support the immigration detention framework for the future. Currently there are about 280 people in detention in Australia; that is the figure as at 7 November this year. While this report was largely a bipartisan effort and all members agreed to the 18 recommendations, three members filed a dissenting report expressing their concerns about the appropriate time frame when access to judicial review should be available for detainees, but I will leave those members to record their points of view on this issue. I see this report and its recommendations as part of a continuing process of evolution of Australia’s policy on the processing of unlawful arrivals to our shores. Madam Deputy Speaker, you may recall that in 2005 the previous coalition government moved to improve the detention process and practice. The coalition provided that the Commonwealth Ombudsman have the obligation to review the circumstances of people held in detention for over two years and to report their advice to the minister. Further in 2005, with bipartisan support, the Howard coalition moved to prevent children and families being held in detention centres and, instead, ensured that children and their families were appropriately housed in residential housing within the community. In this regard I acknowledge the excellent contribution and hard work of the member for Pearce, Mrs Judi Moylan, the then member for Cook, Mr Bruce Baird, and the member for Kooyong, Mr Petro Georgiou, who is here in the chamber today and who is also a member of this joint standing committee. Further, it also MAIN COMMITTEE",184,Ministerial Statements
219,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (6.44 Pm),"It is a privilege to be able to speak on the release of theshould be noted that the previous coalition government moved to close down detention centres. Woomera was closed in 2003, Port Hedland was closed and Baxter was closed in August 2007. I believe that the 18 recommendations in this report further refine this evolutionary progress and, in fairness and equity, seek to establish the important balance of acknowledging the duty of care that the government has to people in the wider Australian community as well as preserving the sovereignty of Australia in maintaining mandatory detention as an essential component of strong border control while at the same time-and I think this is importantacknowledging the basic human rights of unauthorised arrivals and the inherent human dignity of each and every one of them. The report attempts to set out a process of dealing with unauthorised arrivals in a manner that is open and transparent, not only for the people of Australia but for the detainees as well. I think this report has succeeded, although I am aware that there are those who have already criticised the report for going too far, as well as those who have criticised the report for not going far enough. So it seems that we have probably got the balance just about right. BeforeI briefly cover the recommendations, I would like to acknowledge the excellent support the committee has received from the inquiry secretariat headed by Dr Anna Dacre, inquiry secretary Ms Anna Engwerda-Smith, senior research officer Mr Steffan Tissa and office manager Ms Melita Caulfield. I wish to record my appreciation for their professional and enthusiastic support and for their active interest in the subject of this report. Most particularly, I wish to record my respect for the personal commitment and unrelenting focus by each member of the secretariat in their response to the many requests by members of the committee. I believe their conspicuous attention to detail ensured we produced a well-researched and intellectually rigorous report that will be of great interest to many Australian families. This inquiry was undertaken against the immigration detention policy framework that was set out by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on 29 July 2008. I would like to cover those particular sets of values-there are seven-because they provide the basis on which we conducted the inquiry. First, mandatory detention is an essential component of strong border control. Second, to support the integrity of Australia’s immigration program three groups will be subject to mandatory detention: (1) all unauthorised arrivals, for the management of health, identity and security risks to the community; (2) unlawful noncitizens who present unacceptable risks to the community; and (3) unlawful noncitizens who have repeatedly refused to comply with their visa conditions. Third, children, including juvenile foreign fishers, and where possible their families, will not be detained in an immigration detention centre. Fourth, detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable and the length and conditions of detention, including the appropriateness of both the accommodation and the services provided, will be subject to regular review. Fifth, detention in immigration detention centres is only to be used as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time. Sixth, people in detention will be treated fairly and reasonably within the law. Seventh, conditions of detention will ensure the inherent dignity of the human person. I do believe that to a great extent this report has achieved the objectives that we set out against that particular policy framework, and I note that the conditions, of which there are 18 in the report, are there in the report to be read. I would like to concentrate on recommendation 18 with regard to detention costs. Before that, I would also like to record that while in Sydney the committee had the opportunity of speaking to people released on bridging visas who had MAIN COMMITTEE previously been for many years in detention centres. It was quite striking to me on a personal basis that these people were damaged by their experience of long-term, indefinite and interminable detention. The evidence that the committee received about the length of detention was highly indicative of the fact that people have to understand how long they are placed in detention for. It was the indefiniteness, the interminable period, the not knowing and the uncertainty that caused great distress and great mental anguish that led to depression and mental illness in the people who were detained. Many had been detained for years not knowing if or when they would be released or what the outcome of the process was. This was another problem. It seemed almost impossible for detainees to actually find out exactly where their particular application was in the pipeline of procedure and process. This is one of the reasons that we wanted to ensure with the recommendations in this report that the process and the practice was open and transparent and there were appropriate time checks-a review by DIAC itself after three months if anyone still remained in detention; an ombudsman’s review that was going to be tabled in parliament; an advisory review to the minister from the ombudsman in a six-month time frame; and anyone who was maintained in detention would only be there because they were an unacceptable and significant ongoing risk to the Australian community. Those people, if they were still in detention, at the end of a 12-month period would have access to an independent tribunal review and, subsequently, if they were still unsatisfied with the result, they would then be able to proceed to judicial review. I think that really allows people who were held in detention to understand exactly the process that is going to happen to them and it will hopefully alleviate any concerns regarding depression and mental illness. Of the people we did see on this particular occasion, all of them Asian, the middle-aged women who had been held in detention for many years-who would hardly be any assault on Australian security-were broken women. They particularly found it very hard. One gentleman, a man from Korea, was a highly qualified engineer and it seemed entirely inappropriate that a man such as that with a category of qualifications which this country actually needs right now with our skill shortages should be held in such a position. The government of course must have its mandatory checks and it must make sure of our wider duty of care to the Australian people, but it seems that there is a better way. We do not need to damage people to the extent that I saw these people damaged. Another aspect of the process that we reported on, and it is recommendation 18, is detention debt and how that impacted on people. We actually recommended that this particular aspect of the detention process be reviewed. I understand that the minister is reviewing this. The recommendation was that it be completely abandoned. The policy for charging a detention debt began in 1992. The current charge for an individual being held in immigration detention is $125.40 a day. Spouses and dependent children are also liable for charges, with the parent or guardian being liable for the cost of a dependent child. In the last four financial years, a total of 17,355 detainees have been invoiced with a detention debt amounting to over $170 million. The committee received evidence that Australia is the only country in the world to charge people for immigration detention. Further, Australia does not charge people for other forms of detention, such as detention in prison or detention under mental health or quarantine acts. The practice of applying detention charges would not appear to provide any substantial revenue or contribute in any way to offsetting the costs of the detention policy. Further, it is MAIN COMMITTEE likely that the administrative costs outweigh or are approximately equal to the debts recovered. In 2004-05, less than 2.5 per cent of the detention debt invoiced had been recovered. This is because most debts are either left unpaid, waived or written off by the Department of Finance and Deregulation. The committee received evidence-and this is what was important to us-about the negative impacts of this policy on the mental health, financial security and ability to leave and return to Australia of former detainees. Even where a debt was eventually written off or waived, former detainees still received an invoice for a large amount of money, causing considerable stress and anxiety. Where a debt was written off, detainees were aware that the government could choose to call in that debt at any time, which has detrimental effects to their ability to make financial commitments and to get on with life. The policy may also be functioning as a way of keeping former detainees out of Australia, since having a debt to the Commonwealth makes it difficult to get another visa into Australia. However, if there are people who we genuinely do not want to return to this country, we do not need to rely on debts, as there are other provisions in the Migration Act that would allow DIAC or the minister to achieve this end. The evidence that the committee received on the detention debt policy was uniformly damning, asking that the policy be abolished. No evidence was received in support of the policy, and the committee was unanimous in its recommendation-at least, no objections at all were voiced in report consideration meetings. No evidence was received to suggest that the policy was a deterrent to people coming to Australia unlawfully. I understand also that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has said that this policy is currently under review and has admitted that he sees little logic in it. I commend recommendation 18 to the minister, as I do all the recommendations of the committee. I want to again thank my co-members of the committee for their diligence, for their continued interest and for the genuine openness and honesty with which this issue was deliberated on at some length by the committee. I commend the report not only to the minister but also to the people of Australia. Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (6.58 pm)-I rise to speak in support of this report as a member of this parliament and a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. This is a report on the inquiry into immigration detention in Australia by the committee. This report is the first of three reports on the inquiry into immigration detention in Australia. This report addresses the criteria that should be applied in determining for how long a person should be held in immigration detention, the criteria that should be applied in determining when a person should be released from immigration detention following health and security checks, and a review mechanism for ongoing detention, removal practices and detention costs. The second and third reports, which are to be tabled in 2009, will address alternatives to detention, financial costs, service provision and the infrastructure required to support the immigration detention framework for the future. This inquiry was long overdue. The Australian community was tired of the way that unauthorised persons were treated in this country. There is no doubt that Australians expect a government to ensure strong border protections. However, Australians also expect that this will be done in a fair and balanced way and in a way that supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Prime Minister has just spoken on the Universal Declaration of Human MAIN COMMITTEE Rights in the chamber. The Prime Minister noted the focus of this Labor government on ensuring that the policies adopted by this government in dealing with unauthorised arrivals are applied in a humane way. On 29 July 2008, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator the Hon. Chris Evans, announced a series of values that would underpin Australia’s immigration detention policy. Those seven values are as follows. Mandatory detention is an essential component of strong border control. To support the integrity of Australia’s immigration program, three groups will be subject to mandatory detention: all unauthorised arrivals, for management of health, identity and security risks to the community; unlawful noncitizens who present unacceptable risks to the community; and unlawful noncitizens who have repeatedly refused to comply with their visa conditions. Children, including juvenile foreign fishers and, where possible, their families, will not be detained in an immigration detention centre. Detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable, and the length and conditions of detention, including the appropriateness of both the accommodation and the services provided, would be subject to regular review. Detention in immigration detention centres is only to be used as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time. People in detention will be treated fairly and reasonably within the law. Conditions of detention will ensure the inherent dignity of the human person. Since this inquiry commenced, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced changes to detention that fundamentally reintroduce basic human rights into the way that this country deals with people that are unauthorised arrivals in this country. The premise of the new changes was that unlawful arrivals should be held in detention for the least amount of time possible and only for certain reasons. There is no doubt that not only were the policies and processes surrounding detention and unauthorised arrivals flawed but they did in fact, in some cases, cause distress to the persons detained. A recurring concern about the current immigration detention system has been the indefinite nature of detention, with little scope for information about the reasons or rationale for detention. This report tackles those uncertainties and sets out clear and definitive guidelines for detaining individuals. This standing committee heard much evidence from organisations and individuals that clearly identified that serious flaws exist in the current programs and policies in the way detention occurs. Even though there were reports that indicated that the treatment of detainees and the processes have improved in recent times, much more work needs to be done. Within the short time. I have to speak on this report, I would like to take this opportunity to provide a brief summary of the recommendations. Recommendations 1 through to 5 outline the committee’s criteria for release relating to health, identity and security checks. The key element of these recommendations is that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, DIAC, develop and publish criteria for each of the areas considered in relation to release-that is, health, identity and security. Also the criteria should be made explicit and public. In relation to health, the criteria should draw on the treatment standards and detention provision that otherwise would apply to all visa applicants and to Australian citizens and residents who pose a potential public health risk. It is also recommended that there be a time MAIN COMMITTEE frame for health checks, such as five days, and that this time frame be established in consultation with relevant stakeholders. The committee recommends that a risk based approach be applied where a person’s identity is not conclusively established within 90 days. In such circumstances, it is recommended that mechanisms be developed that would allow a person whose identity has not been established to be released and that the release can be subject to conditions. The release should occur unless a demonstrated and specific risk exists or where there is clear evidence of a lack of cooperation or refusal to comply with reasonable requests. The same criteria should apply in relation to the security check after 90 days where there is little indication of a risk to the community, as advised by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and the person has been cooperative or compliant with reasonable requests. Importantly, to ensure that people who continue to be detained beyond 90 days as a result of a risk assessment are provided with ongoing review through an open and accountable process, a further assessment will occur after six months. The committee recommends that the Australian government empower the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to review the substance and procedure of the security assessment and the evidence on which it is based. The inspector-general should provide advice to the Commonwealth Ombudsman as to whether there is a legitimate basis for the delays in security assessments. Recommendations 6 and 7 are that DIAC develop and publish the criteria for assessing whether a person in immigration detention poses an unacceptable risk to the community and that the criteria be applied equally against persons detained following a section 501 visa cancellation. Further in relation to section 501 detainees, DIAC should take into account other assessments and reporting requirements already undertaken in relation to the detainee by other authorities. Recommendation 8 once again outlines the need for open and accountable criteria in determining whether there is a need for detention due to repeated visa non-compliance. Importantly, recommendation 9 ensures that territories excised from the migration zone are subject to the same risk based approach and values announced on 29 July 2008. Recommendation 10 addresses the call by many inquiry participants for an increased level of formal review. That is why the committee recommended that DIAC develop and publish details of the scope of the three-month detention review and that the review be provided to the person in immigration detention and any other persons they authorise to receive it, such as their legal representative or advocate. It is surprising that in the year 2008 such a recommendation has to be made and that such processes had not been in place previously. This, of course, is a basic right for any individual who has had a decision made against them, to have access to the grounds and reasons for such decision and the mechanism applied in reaching such a conclusion. That is why recommendation 11 is such a substantial shift in the practices that have come before it but will provide comfort to those who have fought for so long to see a government that is open with and accountable for its detention practices. The recommendation states that the House of Representatives and/or Senate resolve that the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s six-month detention reviews be tabled in parliament and that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship be required to respond within 15 sitting days. The minister’s response should address each of the Ombudsman’s recommendations and provide reasons why that recommendation is accepted, rejected or no longer applicable. MAIN COMMITTEE Importantly, the committee recommends at point 12 that the reforms announced by the minister in July be enshrined in legislation and that the Migration Regulations and guidelines are also amended to reflect these reforms. The committee has taken the step of recommending a maximum time frame of 12 months for detention for all persons other than in the circumstances that a person is determined to be a significant and ongoing unacceptable risk to the community. Such release could be subject to conditions. Recommendation 14 states that where a person continues to be detained it is appropriate that rights exist for the person to seek external review, firstly through an independent tribunal and subsequently through a judicial review. Recommendations 15 to 17 outline a process for removal to ensure adequate notice and important considerations are given to health and other issues, before that person is removed from Australia. Last but not least, recommendation 18 notes that as a priority the Australian government should introduce legislation to repeal the liability of immigration detention costs. The committee further recommends that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation make the determination to waive existing detention debts for all current and former detainees, effective immediately, and that all reasonable efforts be made to advise existing debtors of this decision. The previous speaker, and it was you, Madam Deputy Speaker Vale, noted that there are no other forms of detention around this world that charge a fee, nor are there other forms of detention in our own country that apply a charge in such circumstances. These charges cannot be retained or justified. As may have been noticed in taking the chamber through these recommendations, there is a common theme. That is that there needs to be a fundamental shift from an internal focus and process with little or no accountability to one that involves open and accountable processes in decisions made by detention facility operators and by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Those criteria should be developed with key stakeholders and they should be published. I appreciate and respect that other members of the committee may have differing views on the method of ensuring procedural fairness and accountability. These recommendations, however, in my view are a step in the right direction and are a positive step forward for Australia and its reputation internationally in ensuring that universal human rights are applied to all persons in the context of our national security obligations. To finish up, I would like to record my thanks for and acknowledgement of the extensive and thorough work done by the chair, Michael Danby, and I would like to make special mention of the secretariat for all their work. I would also like to mention the wonderful work of the deputy chair, Danna Vale-who is now in the chair in this chamber-and I also wish to acknowledge the willingness of all of the committee members to contribute to the discussions in the development of this report. I look forward to speaking in much more detail, upon the tabling of the remaining two reports, on the evidence heard and read in relation to this inquiry. inquiry into immigration detention by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. The Australian immigration detention regime has been the subject of considerable contention, both domestically and internationally, since the introduction of mandatory detention by the Keating government in 1992 and, with that introduction, the introduction of charges for being detained. It was more than a decade before a combination of external and internal factors saw a significant amelioration of some of the harshest elements of the policy. Externally, the key MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Committees
220,Mr Georgiou (Kooyong) (7.10 Pm),"I am pleased to speak about the first report of thefactor was a major decrease in the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat without visas. Domestically, public attitudes shifted both because there was decreased anxiety about the flow of unauthorised arrivals and because there was growing dismay about the consequences of mandatory detention: the considerable length of time people were deprived of their liberty; the mental and physical harm suffered by vulnerable men, women and children; and the unlawful detention of Australian residents and, indeed, Australian citizens. Significant changes in law and policy were adopted in 2005, and, in July, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced further welcome changes to the immigration detention regime. This inquiry by the joint standing committee provides an opportunity to maintain the momentum of reform. I believe that in this first report we have partially made good use of this opportunity. The report makes a number of very important recommendations to improve the fairness and transparency of Australia’s detention regime policy. One particularly worthy of mention-and it has been mentioned by others-is the recommendation to stop charging former detainees the cost of their detention. I rarely use the word ‘outrageous’ because it is much overused by politicians, but this was outrageous. Detention debts can be huge and well beyond the means of people to repay them, and the Commonwealth Ombudsman and others told the committee of the great stress and financial hardship that debts can cause. I do hope the government will move rapidly to implement this, and other recommendations, as soon as possible. There is one critical subject upon which members of the committee do differ, and differ strongly. This is the length of time a person is detained before the merits of the decision to detain them are subject to scrutiny by a tribunal or a court. As the law stands, the executive, immigration department officials and their minister have the unfettered power to indefinitely detain certain people, even if they pose absolutely no risk to the community. This was held to be so in the Federal Court in 2003, in the Al-Kateb case. The Federal Court judge in that case was John von Doussa, who was until recently President of the Australian Human Rights Commission. He has recently said this about the case: As a judge, I was not asked to understand the emotional trauma of the detainees that appeared before the court. I did not know the conditions in which asylum seekers were detained-nor did I ask. Although international law prohibits inhumane and arbitrary detention, Australian law does not. The results are troubling. As a judge, I felt the decision at which I arrived was both legally correct and morally reprehensible. The new arrangements introduced by the minister in July do not, unfortunately, change the framework of this regime, and I think that, to speak frankly, it is fatuous to talk about paradigm changes while we detain people for up to a year without any external review. The changes have improved the processes of departmental review and of review by the Ombudsman, but they impose no new constraints on the executive’s power to detain. The committee’s recommendations relating to reviews by the immigration department and the Ombudsman will improve the framework. However, the committee in its majority report does recognise that these changes are, in themselves, not enough to create a viable system of review and accountability. The report states: MAIN COMMITTEE The Committee noted the strong evidence received that the lack of merits and judicial review for the decision to detain has in the past meant that people have been held wrongfully, unlawfully and for a period of years on the basis of a contested departmental decision. The evidence pointed compellingly to the critical need for the Migration Act to be amended so that a tribunal or court could examine whether decisions to detain were reasonable and necessary in accordance with the new policy. The majority believed that there was no need for such independent oversight until a person had been detained for 12 months. Senator Eggleston, Senator Hanson-Young and I differed very strongly. Twelve months is a grossly excessive period for public servants to be able to make unfettered decisions involving the deprivation of liberty, given the potential harm such decisions may cause. The changes introduced by the minister and the changes recommended by the committee will not ensure rigorous and timely assessment of whether immigration detention is necessary and reasonable. Neither the principles of justice nor concern for the welfare of detainees suggests that 12 months is an acceptable period. It is certainly far in excess of the powers that public servants have with respect to the detention of people arrested for alleged criminal misconduct or detained because their mental illness endangers them or others. When the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced a new immigration detention policy on 29 July, he pointedly mentioned that the United Nations Human Rights Committee had on a number of occasions found that our immigration detention system violated the prohibition on arbitrary detention under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The new policy, he said, honoured our international human rights obligation. This message is one that we have heard from other members of the Rudd government, not least from the Prime Minister today and, a couple of weeks ago, from the Attorney-General, when he told a conference that the government is ‘committed to introducing into Australian law the rights that are recognised and protected in the international instruments to which Australia is a party’. I hope this is a serious commitment, because, if it is, the government will have to move quickly to amend the Migration Act to comply with the prohibition on arbitrary detention. One change that has to be made to the law is that a person cannot be placed into immigration detention unless it is necessary and reasonable on specified grounds. The second essential change is stated in straightforward terms in article 9(4) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful. I emphasise that the article states that the court must be able to decide without delay whether the detention is lawful. This surely cannot mean that a detained person would be denied the right to take legal proceedings for 12 months, which is what the committee recommends. I hope that, the next time the Attorney-General makes a speech on the Australian government’s plans to bring Australian law into conformity, he gives prominence to the reform of the immigration detention regime. To achieve such reform, the dissenting report proposes that a person who is detained should be entitled to appeal immediately to a court for an order that he or she be released because there are no reasonable grounds to consider that their detention is justified under the criteria MAIN COMMITTEE specified for detention. If honourable members think that this is too quick or that it is not necessary, let me just quote a couple of cases from a report of the Ombudsman-and there are dozens of them. I have chosen a couple that are simple and not too long. The report says: MrM had been in Australia lawfully for three years. He had lodged a request for the Minister to intervene in his case and grant him a visa. While the Minister was considering this request, MrM was granted a second bridging visa but this was not recorded on ICSE (The department database). On December 24 2003the Christmas seasonwhile waiting at Melbourne Airport for a friend, MrM was detained and transferred to a detention facility. Even though a review of Mr M’s records could have readily clarified his status, he remained in detention for seven calendar days until DIAC officers returned from their Christmas/New Year break and reviewed his case. Take another case: MsK had given an oral account of her lawful immigration status to DIAC officers both before the decision to detain and on the following day when she was interviewed. This information was consistent with that held on DIAC’s system, yet no checks were conducted to verify the information that MsK had provided. Ms K’s solicitor contacted DIAC on the second day of her detention and advised that he could provide DIAC with a certified copy of Ms K’s passport, which he did. DIAC advised the solicitor that a certified copy was insufficient and that DIAC would need to sight the original. The solicitor, based in a separate city to where MsK was being detained, was also told by DIAC that it would not be acceptable for him to take the passport to the office in his city as that office would not know the case and could not make an identity assessment. Ms K’s passport was subsequently viewed by DIAC after she had been detained for eight calendar days. These are not people who have no right to be in Australia, which is where the argument is sometimes misunderstood; these are people with a legitimate right who we are locking up with no right to appeal to a court. I do not regard that as acceptable and I do not think any of us should. Paradigm shifts are difficult to achieve but you have to keep on pushing. The dissenting report also proposes: A person may not be detained for a period exceeding 30 days unless on an application by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship a court makes an order that it is necessary to detain the person on a specified ground and there are no effective alternatives to detention. This is consistent with the Minister’s commitment that under the new system ‘the department will have to justify a decision to detainnot presume detention’. I commend the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship for requesting this review; I commend the many people who have given us an unparalleled amount of information, evidence and experience; and I commend the secretariat and my colleagues for their capacity to work together under sometimes difficult circumstances. I look forward to working with my committee colleagues to prepare the next two reports in this inquiry. immigration detention in Australia by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. First, I would like to commend this report and the committee’s chair, the member for Melbourne Ports. It is a thorough, well-researched report that attracted support from both sides of politics and whose recommendations set the tone for a strong but fair approach to dealing with border protection and those who seek to come to Australia. The report draws attention to the ComMAIN COMMITTEE",191,Committees
221,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (7.23 Pm),"I rise to speak on the first report of the inquiry intomonwealth Ombudsman’s investigations into the problems of past detention policies and makes a series of suggestions as to appropriate future policy. It is interesting to see that the joint standing committee, which includes the opposition spokesperson for immigration and citizenship, the member for Murray, supported in this report the government announcement in July which outlined seven values that would form the new immigration policy. That included the determination that three groups will be held in mandatory detention: unauthorised arrivals to be checked for identity and health, those who pose an unacceptable risk to the community and those who have repeatedly broken visa or immigration conditions. Those outside these three groups will reside in the community until their case is resolved. We heard the member for Murray just this morning on Sky News warmly endorsing the joint standing committee’s report. In light of the support that has been expressed by the member for Murray as the opposition spokesperson, it is interesting to see the coalition’s rhetoric on this important issue return to that of the Howard years-the time of ‘mean and tricky’. Yesterday in question time, the member for Murray accused the Rudd government of ‘giving the green light to people smugglers’. It has to be said that the member for Murray and her sidekick, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, simply cannot get their story straight-whether it is about detention centres, budgets, boat people or the intervention by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in individual cases. The member for Murray has no credibility when it comes to her own policy let alone the government’s. In September, she said: I am pleased to see the new Labor government choosing to continue the Howard policies … Then in November the member for Murray said that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship had to: … loudly and clearly articulate what Labor’s border security policy is. Then yesterday the member for Murray said that Australia is ‘still very strict and strong’ in regards to border protection. As if that level of inconsistency from the opposition was not enough, Senator FierravantiWells, who acts as the coalition’s shadow parliamentary secretary for immigration and citizenship, is saying something different again. When talking in the Senate about Labor’s immigration policy yesterday she said, ‘There’s been a decisive shift in the way you guys are doing business.’ So which is it? The same question could and really should be asked in regards to the member for Murray’s thoughts on detention and processing centres. After the Rudd government closed down the Nauru and Manus Island detention centres, the member for Murray criticised us in October for having only one facility at Christmas Island. Yet yesterday-which was a very busy day of totally flipping on anything she had previously said about the Rudd government’s immigration and detention policy-the member for Murray said, ‘I don’t think we need to again have Nauru or Manus Island operating, because, of course, we’ve got Christmas Island.’ The member for Murray is not just lacking credibility when it comes to policy; she also seems to lack the ability to count. How many boats have illegally arrived in Australia this year? Good question. The member for Murray claimed at a doorstop interview yesterday that MAIN COMMITTEE it was seven. Then in question time she claimed it was eight. In fact, the number is four boats, carrying 48 passengers. For the record, five boats arrived last year and six in 2006. While the success of the government’s border security policy cannot be judged purely on the number of boats that arrive on our shores, the least the member for Murray could do is get her facts right and not-as she did in question time yesterday-incorrectly claim there has been a ‘surge’ in attempted boat arrivals. We have seen this tendency towards inconsistency and being misleading in this policy area from the Liberal Party before not just on how many boats have arrived on our shores but also earlier this year. The member for Murray has also claimed that there has been $67.4 million cutthis report is directly concerned with border security issues. As I said, the claim made by the member for Murray and the shadow parliamentary secretary, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, was a false claim that $67.4 million had been: … stripped out of the critical area of border security and immigration processing. The facts are that the budget papers clearly show that the closure of the offshore processing centres in Nauru and Manus Island results in a $68.7 million saving over five years. The budget papers also show that the $68.7 million saving is offset by a $1.3 million cost for the abolition of temporary protection visas granted to refugees by the previous government. What we have had from the member for Murray and Senator Fierravanti-Wells is a false claim designed to mislead the public that $67.4 million has been cut from border security measures. The budget papers reveal directly that there has been a $116 million increase in total net resourcing for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for 2008-09. It should be made clear: the Rudd Government’s track record refutes the opposition’s claims that we are somehow weak on border security. We have maintained the excision around some of Australia’s territories, and we have maintained the Christmas Island detention and processing centre. Our immigration policy is tough, but also fair and humane. It gives me tremendous pleasure to say of the Rudd government that it has been able to put an end to what is fairly described as the ‘barbarity’ of the previous government’s immigration policies. It is worth mentioning also that the member for Murray misled the public just a few weeks back in relation to another immigration matter on the issue of a Western Australian midwife whose daughter suffers from Down syndrome, who was seeking to stay in Australia. On 10 November this year, the member for Murray called for the exercise of ministerial discretion in this case and she called for it again in a media release on 26 November which has mysteriously fallen off her website. The former call led on 13 November in Senate question time to Senator Boyce asking the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship whether he would exercise his ministerial discretion in this case. Then the member for Murray on 19 November in a speech said: Their case has been waiting for ministerial discretion, having reached the end of the whole business of ministerial tribunal reviews for a very long time now. Then in the media release of 26 November, the one that has now gone missing, the member for Murray said: MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Committees
222,Mr Irons,Is this all relevant to your report?,196,Committees
223,Mr Dreyfus,"Border security is very relevant to the report because the issue raised in… Minister Evans steadfastly refused to use his special powers, leaving the almost identical case of the Robinson family in Perth languishing. After nearly seven months sitting on Minister Evans desk, and with only weeks left on their visa, the Robinson family and their Down syndrome son David were finally granted a permanent visa after public outrage and embarrassing questions asked of the Minister in Parliament. The facts of this matter are that the minister made the initial decision to approve the family’s visas in August and, subject to normal security and health checks and following completion of those checks, the files were returned to the minister for the second round approval in November and approved on 12 November 2008. You might note that the family’s ministerial requests had been knocked back twice under the former government-so much for the level of consistency or any accuracy at all in the way in which the member for Murray has been dealing with these immigration issues. The protestations about this case by the coalition, indeed the recent statements by the member for Murray generally on border security, are alarming. However, I return to this report. Regardless of the member for Murray’s indecision and inability to understand basic statistics, it was good to see her endorse the Joint Standing Committee on Migration’s report. Therefore she is making a warm endorsement of the Rudd government’s immigration policy. I am pleased to see that the member for Murray agrees with me that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has done a fine job in keeping our borders secure, and in massively improving our treatment of refugees in his first year in office. I commend the report to the House. gration I take this opportunity to speak on the presentation of this report on immigration detention centres in Australia. It is appropriately titled Immigration detention in Australia: a new beginning, because I see both the work of the committee and the policy announced earlier this year by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, as a new beginning in policy with respect to detention centres in Australia and as a new beginning for those people who come to this country and are for one reason or another detained in those centres. At the outset I thank the secretariat, who assisted the committee with the work that was carried out for the last 12 months. I was elected in 2007 and this is the first report that I have been associated with, albeit that I do sit on two other standing committees of parliament. I commend all of the members of the secretariat. I thank Dr Anna Dacre, Ms Anna EngwerdaSmith, Mr Steffan Tissa and Ms Melita Caulfield for the assistance they gave to the committee. I have worked with public servants over the years on many occasions and I have to say the work of all these people was absolutely professional in arranging the visits, researching information, organising public hearings and managing the workload, which they did above and beyond what I would have generally called the call of duty. Their absolute professionalism in everything they did is commendable. I believe that the final report is in no small part a measure of their contribution to the whole process. I also take the opportunity to thank the chair of the committee, Mr Michael Danby, the member for Melbourne Ports, and you, Madam Deputy Speaker Vale, for your tolerance, your compromise, your experience and your wisdom as senior members of the committee. I valued very much the fact that along the way you were able to manage the process. And it was not an easy process; it was very difficult because of the types of issues we had to deal with, the MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Committees
224,Mr Zappia (Makin) (7.33 Pm),"As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Miplaces we visited, the people we were talking to and the processes that we needed to go through. As I say, the experience and wisdom of both the chair and the deputy chair of the committee were gratefully received by me and I am sure by other members of the committee. The committee visited detention centres in Sydney, Darwin, Christmas Island, Melbourne and Perth. There was one visit I was not able to attend. We also received 139 different submissions. We held public hearings, which were attended by many people, including some of those people who had made public submissions but also, and very importantly, former detainees of the detention centres that we had visited. I put those detainees broadly into four different categories. There are people who have arrived on our shores as what we generally refer to as illegal boat arrivals, although I question the term ‘illegal’. Others would say there is no such thing. There are illegal fishers, people who had breached section 501 visas and people who had for other reasons breached different visa categories and ultimately ended up in detention centres. In the course of our inquiry we also spoke to many of the people who worked with and visited these people and assisted them while they were in detention centres right around the country. I stress that it was right around the country because I found from my experience that at each detention centre we went to it was a different experience, and therefore it was important to hear from those people individually. You made the point in your own comments on this report, Madam Deputy Speaker, that as at 7 November there were some 279 people held in detention. The breakdown of those was 189 in immigration detention centres, 44 in community detention, 25 in alternative temporary detention in the community, 16 in immigration residential housing, three in immigration transit accommodation and two restricted on board vessels in port. I cite those statistics simply to highlight the different forms under which people may be held in detention. It is not simply one particular type of place. So, when people try to envisage how people might be held, they can see there is a range of options available to governments and they have been used by governments over the years. In quoting the recommendations from the report I note that there were some 18 recommendations that the committee ultimately adopted. I know that, in respect of some those recommendations, some members of the committee prepared a dissenting report, but I should note that there were certainly consistency and agreement on the majority of the others. So it was clearly a case of one aspect, which I will come back to, where we might have had some disagreement but, overwhelmingly, the recommendations were agreed to unanimously by all members. On page 9 of the introduction of the report the recommendations are summarised, and I will quickly go through them: 5 day time frames for health checks up to 90 days for the completion of security and identity checks, after which consideration must be given to release onto a bridging visa, a maximum time limit of 12 months’ detention for all except those who are demonstrated to be a significant and ongoing risk to the community, and the publication of clear guidelines regarding how the criteria of unacceptable risk and visa non-compliance are to be applied. MAIN COMMITTEE The report goes on to recommend: greater detail and scope of the three month review conducted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship ensuring detainees and their legal representatives receive a copy of the review ensuring the six month Ombudsman’s review is tabled in parliament and that the ministerial response to recommendations is comprehensive providing increased oversight of national security assessments that may affect individuals enshrining the new values in legislationthat refers to the new values of the minister’s policy, announced on 29 Julyestablishing a maximum of 12 months in detention unless a person is determined to be a significant and ongoing risk to the Australian community, and opening the door to merits and judicial review of the grounds for detention after that person has been detained for more than 12 months. I believe that those recommendations essentially summarise the general direction that the committee would like the government to go in when it comes to policy on detention centres. Those members of the committee who dissented did so on the question of judicial review, and I simply want to make this point: it is my clear impression that their judgements were based on events, practices and processes which took place in the period prior to the Rudd government coming into office. Therefore, they made judgements about what should be done based on the experiences that were brought to them from the submissions made about how people were treated prior to the Rudd government coming to office and certainly prior to Minister Chris Evans’s announcement of the new policy. WhilstI can understand the dissenting report, at this point in time it is not one that I would support. Nor do I believe it should be supported by the government. We have a new policy in place and it is only once that policy has been applied that we can make judgements about whether we ought to make further recommendations to the minister. I believe that the member for Kooyong said that there was no process after the Ombudsman’s report at the six-month period for any further action to take place. My recollection of the recommendations is that in addition to the six-month report by the Ombudsman we are requesting the minister to respond within 15 days to the Ombudsman’s report. So there is an opportunity for matters to be taken up by the minister. I will just make some personal observations about the work that the committee did. Firstly, setting aside the submissions from the government departments that we received, which one would expect to be impartial and non-political, my recollection of all representations that were made to the committee were either critical or highly critical of the past policies in respect of detention centres. Secondly, all of the representations that I can recall that made comment about the new Rudd government policy commended that policy. That policy was well received by all of the people who made submissions to the committee, albeit that some might have wanted the government to have gone further. Thirdly, in all the evidence that I can recall being put to the committee, there was none which supported any suggestion that terrorists were entering Australia as refugees or boat people. I saw no evidence at all to support that notion. Fourthly, there was substantial evidence that people held in detention centres for any period of time, and certainly those held in MAIN COMMITTEE detention centres for lengthy periods of time, ended up with mental health issues. And, fifthly, the majority of the people who were held in detention centres were ultimately released into the community. It seems to me, given those observations, that what we need is a change in policy-and we have seen that in the welcome policy response by the Rudd government. We need a fundamental change in mindset, and I have to say that the introductory comments in the report talk about the need for a paradigm shift in the way we address the issue of people being held in detention centres in future. Again, I welcome that. I believe that we need to adopt what I would refer to as principles of natural justice when we deal with people who come into this country for whatever purpose. Those principles of natural justice would rely on us giving them the same provisions in law that we apply to anyone who, for one reason or another, comes before the law in this country, and that is that they are presumed to be innocent until they are found to be guilty. I am pleased to say the Rudd Labor government is going in that general direction with its policy. That policy announced on 29 July by Minister Chris Evans has seven key values. The first is that mandatory detention is an essential component of strong border control. None of us dispute that. Second, to support the integrity of Australia’s immigration program three groups will be subject to mandatory detention: (a) all unauthorised arrivals, for management of health, identity and security risk to the community, (b) unlawful noncitizens who present unacceptable risks to the community and (c) unlawful noncitizens who have repeatedly refused to comply with their visa conditions. Third, children, including juvenile foreign fishers and, where possible, their families, will not be detained in an immigration detention centre. Fourth, detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable and the length and conditions of detention, including the appropriateness of both the accommodation and the services provided, would be subject to regular review. Fifth, detention in immigration detention centres is only to be used as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time. Sixth, people in detention will be treated fairly and reasonably within the law. Seventh, conditions of detention will ensure the inherent dignity of the human person. I finish with this comment. I share the comments made by the member for Isaacs and I too was concerned by the question raised by the member for Murray in the House yesterday. I say this to the member for Murray: whilst there was a dissenting report in respect of this matter, those of us who had the first hand experience of visiting detention centres, speaking to people within them and speaking to people who assisted them all came away with a very strong view that our policy ought to be more humane-and even the dissenting report goes further than our committee did in terms of wanting to make it more humane. I therefore find it objectionable that that question was raised in the House. I say to anyone: before you make a judgement about detention centres and the people who come here, take the time to visit those detention centres, as the committee did. bate, I seek leave to speak again without closing the debate. Leave granted. tee on Migration on its inquiry into immigration detention in Australia entitled Immigration detention in Australia: a new beginning.

226,Mr Danby,"Yesterday I presented to the House the report of the Joint Standing CommitMakin, Isaacs and Petrie are all very proud. Madam Deputy Speaker Vale, I apologise for missing your contribution to this debate as the member for Hughes. I value your views and I have got to know them as our committee has gone through this inquiry. Your contribution, as the member for Makin said, has been extremely wise and very helpful in the deliberations of the committee. We have had a very hard working core group of people on this committee, including a couple of senators-Senators McEwen and Bilyk. Certainly the members for Hughes, Makin and Petrie have helped form the core of this committee and, together with the member for Kooyong and I, have been at most of its hearings. TonightI want to briefly consider recent comments made by opposition members on the matters discussed in this report. I will begin my conclusion by referring to the matters the member for Makin and the member for Isaacs discussed, and that is the comments made by the member for Murray. The member for Murray alleged that changes made by the current government to the detention policy are encouraging people smugglers. She implied in her question in the House yesterday that there has been a so-called surge in unauthorised boat arrivals in Australian waters. Regrettably, there was a story on the front page of the Australian yesterday that reported this as a fact rather than a mere allegation. I rang Mr Steve Cook from the International Organisation for Migration in Jakarta yesterday and he told me that the claim that there was a surge in illegal boats coming to Australia was not made by him. If you are going to make such grave allegations, given the history of this debate in Australia, you ought to check with an important international public servant working for an important, fair minded organisation such as the International Organisation for Migration before you make such an allegations. As the member for Isaacs pointed out, there is no such surge. There have been four unauthorised arrivals with 48 passengers so far this year. Since it is now December, that is probably the total for the year. Last year, which was the last year of the Howard government, there were five boats with 148 passengers and the year before, 2006, six boats with 60 passengers. In other words, the total of unauthorised boat arrivals in the first year of the Rudd government has been lower, not higher, than it was in either of the last two years of the Howard government. The trend in unauthorised boat arrivals has been downwards, not upwards. The member for Isaacs exposed the allegations that the Rudd government has somehow weakened our surveillance of Australian waters and allowed this mythical surge of unauthorised arrivals to take place. In fact, no boat containing unauthorised persons has reached the Australian mainland since the Rudd government was elected. The last time a boat reached the Australian mainland was in November 2006, when a boatload of 83 Indonesians arrived at Cape York. That was when the Howard government was in office. It is of course true that people smugglers are active in our region. It is also true that, before the election of this government, Australia continued to work with its South-East Asian partners to deter people smugglers. A number of groups have been intercepted in the region recently. As we all now know, rather than locking up thousands of people in remote parts of Australia in detention centres like Baxter and Woomera as some kind of deterrence, the effective way of managing Australia’s sovereignty and borders is to have good relations with our neighbours, particularly with neighbours like Indonesia. One thing that we learnt during this report was that the activities of the Navy, of Customs and of Immigration, integrated with the same organs of the Indonesian state, are the really effective way of making sure that people do MAIN COMMITTEE not endanger their lives by putting to sea in the types of boats that previously came to Australia. Moreover, seen from the perspective and context of Europe, the arrival of 4,000 people in these boats in the beginning of 2000 was not something to be hysterical about anyhow. I recently met with the deputy chair of the German Bundestag in parliament house, and he asked me to describe the nature of the problem. After hearing of those small numbers of arrivals in 2000, the deputy chair responded in a very surprised tone, saying, ‘ Mr Danby, we received 350,000 from Yugoslavia in that one year.’ So you have to see this in context. Australian law enforcement and immigration agencies continue to work with our counterparts in South-East Asia to respond to people smuggling. There has been no diminution of Australia’s efforts in this respect under this government. The government has maintained patrols of our borders by the border protection command and has maintained a system of mandatory detention and excisions. The fact that we have shut down the Howard government’s Pacific solution does not mean that we have abolished mandatory detention for unauthorised arrivals, as the member for Kooyong has vociferously pointed out. It is deplorable that the opposition has again sought to drag the Royal Australian Navy into a political debate. They claimed falsely that the Royal Australian Navy supported their version of events during the ‘children overboard’ affair. We know now from the documentary that has recently been on television that the Navy did not. Now they are trying to do it again. The Chief of Navy has repeatedly assured the public that extending the traditional six-week leave period by a further two weeks will not have any impact on operations. The opposition has virtually accused the Chief of Navy of lying and dereliction of duty. The opposition should stop these insinuations and show some regard for our hard working Navy. I mentioned the assertion of Mr Stephen Cook of the International Organisation for Migration that there was no surge. I do think all this is really regrettable. You have to be very serious if you are going to make the kinds of allegations in parliament like those that led to such political trauma in Australia during the Hanson period. You ought to try and establish that these facts are true yourself, as I did with a simple phone call. That is what you have parliamentary staff and researchers for. This allegation was not fact; there is no surge, according to Mr Stephen Cook of the International Organisation for Migration. The member for Makin made a very good point. All the committee members agreed with the majority of the recommendations. However, despite my best efforts and those of the deputy chair, there were a number of issues on which consensus could not be reachedparticularly on the issue of judicial review. Regrettably, some of the media has focused almost exclusively on that minor issue to the exclusion of the benchmarks and guidelines set out by the committee. The committee majority believes that extensive reforms to existing immigration detention procedures and cultural change in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship will bring the best outcomes in terms of national security as well as just and humane treatment of immigration detainees. The committee’s recommendations make a paradigm shift. We have done exactly what we said in the foreword. The paradigm shift, I am sorry to say to the member for Kooyong, happened in November 2007 at the election. A new government was elected with a completely different Weltanschauung, as the Germans say, or world view of these matters. In June, Senator Chris Evans outlined his criteria for immigration detention and spoke on behalf of the government’s different world view. That is the cultural change that led to the setting out of the MAIN COMMITTEE benchmarks which implement the more humane Evans criteria, which still address the issues of security for the wider Australian community. The committee’s recommendations place the onus on releasing people from detention. The onus is on releasing people, not keeping them in. The committee sees the best way of doing this is to give clear deadlines by which further detention must be justified. Specific dates include after 90 days, when, if the identity of detainee is unable to be established, and in the absence of a demonstrated and specific risk to the community, the committee recommends a conditional release from detention. The committee has recognised that it is important to establish the identity of people coming to our country. However, the committee was concerned that, if people had to wait for the conclusion of the identification process before they could be eligible for release, these criteria could potentially discriminate against asylum seekers who may have come from countries without secure identity systems or who may have left their country without documents for reasons of persecution or whatever. The committee also considers that this 90-day time frame should be reviewed after a period of time with a view to further reducing it if it is possible and practical to do so. Let us be clear about this: 87 per cent of people who come to Australia unauthorised are released within 30 days. We are talking about 13 per cent of those who are here illegally after that. After 90 days, if a security assessment of detainees is ongoing and it is identified that there is little risk to the community, as advised by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation-who made a very professional presentation, as you would expect, to the committee-the committee recommends conditional release from detention. The security and identity criteria are linked as it is difficult to know whether someone is a security risk when we do not know their identity. But the available evidence suggests that on balance of probability the security risk posed by unauthorised arrivals is very low. As we have repeatedly been told before in this committee, against the mythology of ‘those dreadful Afghan Hazaras on that boat’, of the tens of thousands of unauthorised arrivals in the last decade only two adverse security assessments have come to public attention-against Iraqi nationals on Nauru, and one of those had the adverse assessment later dropped. If al-Qaeda is coming to Australia they are going to do it in the same way that they did in September 11-in first class, in the front seats of a plane where you will not be able to recognise them. Persecuting poor Afghan Hazaras on boats for political purposes is not going to keep terrorists out of Australia. I must say I was very impressed by the Director-General of ASIO’s explanation to the committee about the comprehensive way that they assess the small number of people that are kept in detention after 90 days. The committee further recommended that after six months, if a security assessment is ongoing, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security provide advice to the Commonwealth Ombudsman as to whether there is a legitimate basis for delays in security assessment. The committee also recommends that the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s six-monthly detention reviews be tabled in parliament and that the Minister the Immigration and Citizenship be required to respond within 15 sitting days. So, quite against what the member for Kooyong said, there is a whole series of new benchmarks and guidelines that would have to be accepted. The onus again is on releasing people, not keeping them in. The minister would have to respond to the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s report after six months and give an explanation to parliament as to why people were being kept in. It is not simply a matter, as in the old days of the Howard government, of keeping them in forever. MAIN COMMITTEE Then again, as a further failsafe, the committee recommends that after 12 months, provided a person is not determined to be a significant and ongoing and unacceptable risk to the community, the person should be released from detention onto a bridging visa. The committee noted that length of time spent in detention centres continues to be a concern for many detainees, oversight bodies and advocacy groups. In recent years, and especially since the new government came to office, the number of people in detention for such a long periods has been greatly reduced. The committee hopes that its recommendations are followed and that this number will be reduced further. With these deadlines in place, the onus will shift from detaining people to releasing people from detention and will mean that the processing of the detainees will be greatly expedited. What some people, I think, cannot accept-and I listened to the member for Kooyong-is that the change in government, the crucial cultural change that happened, has brought about a change in this detention policy. It is all very well, as the member for Makin said, to look backwards to the past and to all of the injustices that happened then. You could have crossed the floor; you could have done a whole lot of things. What we did was elect a different government with a different world view. That is what has changed. There is an essential humanity and rationality in the way in which we have approached immigration detention in Australiaas we said, a new beginning. The dissenters argue that judicial involvement in the detention process is the best way to expedite the processing of detainees. From the information that we were provided, the committee feels, as has been previously mentioned, that benchmarks, as well as other related recommendations, are the best way to move forward at this stage. Judicial involvement creates its own problems such as greater potential expense, the possibility of clogging up courts and the fact that court procedures take time to occur.

228,Mr Ripoll,"Firstly, I would like to again thank the secretariat of the Parliamentary JointEmina Poskovic and Ms Laurie Cassidy. This was a very extensive inquiry done over a very short time frame and this is, I think, a very good report. The franchising sector on the whole is a great sector. It is a sector that contributes greatly to employment and to the GDP. On the whole, it tends to operate well, but there are problems and issues within that sector. There are some rogues that would abuse the power imbalance that necessarily exists to ensure that franchising is a flexible, relational type contract arrangement. This report goes some way to dealing with those issues. Franchising has evolved over the past 30 years in Australia. It was once very much an agreement between two parties that was seen at the time to be an agreement for life. Franchisees would come on board and build the business on the franchisor’s behalf across the country. The contracts were merely reviewed after a period of maybe 10 or 20 years rather than there being end-of-contract arrangements. But, as the sector changed, we found ourselves in a situation where franchising contracts would have end dates-they would end after a 10-, 15or 20-year period. In more recent years, as it has evolved further, we have seen shorter and shorter franchise agreements with very strong end dates, some of which are followed through with. That has certainly been one of the issues within the sector. At the core of the sector has been the evolution also of the regulatory environment. The sector went from no regulation-there was no specific legislation that dealt with franchising, merely the Corporations Law or the Trade Practices Act or the ACCC as a regulator-to a voluntary code and now to a mandatory code. There have been a number of inquiries, including state and federal inquiries, and reviews over a number of years. Earlier this year, on 1 March, some regulatory changes were made to that code relating to disclosure requirements. This report follows on all of that work over the past 20 or 30 years and forges a very solid middle road of trying to build upon the great improvements that have been made in that sector. We must make sure that there is enough regulation to not only protect franchisees but also to encourage the growth of franchising without it becoming a burden upon franchisors. We must respect the freedom of a contract, the freedom of a bargain, and allow people to get on with the business of being in business while at the same time making sure that there is a good regulatory framework for people involved in the sector. The reasoning behind that is quite simple. For a franchisee, they will often stake all of their life savings-everything they have-on entering into a franchise. For a franchisor, they often stake their reputation and their core business on the trust they have in their franchisee doing the right thing by them. The focus of the committee inquiry was very much about finding that good middle road to ensure that rights and responsibilities are met for both sides and that everybody plays their part in what is a quite unique contractual arrangement. It is unlike any other business arrangement. From the date you sign a franchise agreement, the exploratory and developmental nature of the relational contract really takes shape. There is so much good faith vested in the behaviour and conduct of the participants in these relational franchise contracts that, over the years, there has needed to be further regulation and codes, and we now have a mandatory code. What we propose in the report is to build upon the structure that currently exists. I want briefly to run through the recommendations that were made by the committee and expand on a few. The first recommendation is: MAIN COMMITTEE … that the Franchising Code of Conduct be amended to require that disclosure documents include a clear statement by franchisors of the liabilities and consequences applying to franchisees in the event of franchisor failure. We discovered through this process that a number of franchisors, for whatever reason, either fail, go out of business or decide to exit franchising as a sector but that it is often not clear to franchisees what their liabilities or responsibilities may be when that occurs. We felt it was very important that that be more clearly disclosed and not remain an area of silence, so that people in the pre-education environment better understand exactly what they are getting into. It also came up during the inquiry that we really do not have any good statistics or data. There is no registration, of any nature, of franchising in itself. We were of the view that there needs to be some very simple form of registration-perhaps something as simple as an online form-that requires a franchise system to nominate itself, clearly state the nature of its business and, in doing so, assure franchisees that the franchise system is meeting the requirements of the mandatory code of conduct. We thought that that was important to deal with a range of issues around some sort of registration system. It would be very simple, online, cost effective and efficient. The third recommendation was: … that the government review the efficacy of the 1 March 2008 amendments to the disclosure provisions of the Franchising Code of Conduct within two years of them taking effect. The provisions are only new, and I think it is only fair that after a two-year period we go back and review them. But we need to give it some time. Two years is a good time period after which to go back and review the provisions to see whether they are working and whether they have had some positive impact on the sector. The fourth recommendation was: … that the government explore avenues to better balance the rights and liabilities of franchisees and franchisors in the event of franchisor failure. This relates to the first recommendation in terms of the balance between rights and responsibilities, the liabilities, and what issues are at stake when a franchisor fails. There are contractual arrangements for when a franchisee fails. That is easily dealt with. But there needs to be some clearer paths for how things work when a franchisor fails. The fifth recommendation was that we amend the code of conduct to ensure that there is disclosure to franchisees before they enter into an agreement. The process will actually be at the end of a contract. We do not want to tell franchisors what it should be but we believe it should be clearly stipulated. The disclosure of end-of-term arrangements needs to be in writing in the contract. Again, it goes back to good faith and pre-education requirements. If people are to better understand what they are entering into, they need to understand what takes place at the end of the arrangement. This is something that many franchisors already do. We are not asking them to do anything different from current industry practice. This would go a long way to resolving many disputes that currently take place. In the sixth recommendation, on the submission of the ACCC, we agreed with them that the name ‘the Office of the Mediation Adviser’ was not clear enough as to the office’s role and that it should be ‘the Office of Franchising Mediation Adviser’. We believe this is a simMAIN COMMITTEE ple and clear way forward on giving the sector a better understanding of what the role of the office is. The seventh recommendation was: … that the government require the Australian Bureau of Statistics to develop mechanismsfor collecting better data. It became absolutely clear during the inquiry that we do not have any really solid or credible statistics or data. A survey is done every two years but it is too narrow. We need something from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and I would encourage the government to work with the ABS on mechanisms to provide it. One of the really big issues, the one that takes up the vast majority of time in franchises and has done for many inquiries, is that of good faith. There are many different views and debates. People try to define it and they try to talk around this issue as much as possible but, at the end of the day, good faith is something that is understood by everyone in some form. There is already a clear indication within the Trade Practices Act as to what good faith is. It is in other bits of legislation to do with fair trading; it is something that is well understood and can be dealt with by courts through litigation. We have recommended as a committee that the Franchising Code of Conduct be amended to insert a new standard of conduct clause which says: Franchisors, franchisees and prospective franchisees shall act in good faith in relation to all aspects of the franchise agreement. It should be the case and it is the case in the industry in most areas that there is a good faith clause in the agreements which actually says that both parties shall act in good faith towards each other and there should be no lesser standard or expectation. I think this is a good middle road in tying together all the issues around disputation back to some clarity in the form of good faith. It is a minimalist approach but one that does give clarity and takes it from just being implied in the Trade Practices Act to actually being codified in the Franchising Code of Conduct. The ninth and 10th recommendations of the committee are both in the areas of pecuniary penalties in relation to breaches of either the Franchising Code of Conduct or sections 51AC, 52 and 51AD of the Trade Practices Act in relation to other codes and breaches for misleading and deceptive conduct. One of the clear issues that came out of this inquiry was that while there were a number of regulations, laws and codes, there was no stick that could be applied other than going to a court and seeking some remedy. There needs to be clearer pecuniary penalties for people who in particular deliberately breach their responsibilities in terms of the code or the Trade Practices Act. This was a recommendation also by the ACCC. The committee agreed with them and we think it is a good way forward. The final recommendation of the committee was: … that the ACCC be given the power to investigate when it receives credible information indicating that a party to a franchising agreement, or agreements, may be engaging in conduct contrary to their obligation under the franchising code of conduct. While the ACCC does have powers currently to investigate, their view is that unless they have sufficient evidence that would give rise to a successful case in a court they do not pursue that particular information. We are of the view that we should support the ACCC and give them MAIN COMMITTEE that extra power to be able to do some investigative type work to look at the possibility of the systemic abuse of power in certain franchise systems. Overall this report builds on the previous good work of other inquiries both at a federal and state level. It is about supporting the sector as a whole-franchisors and franchisees. It is about finding a good, solid middle ground. It is about ensuring the future growth and stability of a very important sector, a sector which this committee and all of its members were very supportive of. I believe this report deals with all of the big issues. There are two particular issues which, while we have discussed them in the report, we do not have recommendations on. One in particular, and I know it was very popularly discussed through the inquiry, was that of goodwill. We felt as a committee that goodwill in itself was already contained within the aspects of end-of-term arrangements in terms of the market value of the business and the transferability of value. It is really part of recommendation 5 that in determining end-of-term arrangements the process should give due regard to the potential transferability of equity in the value of the business as a going concern. This is something that already exists without trying to define or put a formula to what good will is. The final point I would like to make is that the committee received a number of bits of evidence that an ombudsman or a tribunal would perhaps help, but on further investigation and on reflection we believe that it would add an extra layer of bureaucracy and confusion and would not provide the sorts of outcomes that people were seeking. The best process to do this is to try to mediate at the franchise level then through the Office of the Mediation Adviser and, if it cannot be resolved, through the courts. I commend this report to the House and I wish the franchising sector all the best in the future. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (8.19 pm)-I also rise to speak as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on the committee’s report Opportunity not opportunism: improving conduct in Australian franchising, which was tabled in the House last night. I commend this report to the House. I also commend the work of the committee, particularly its chair, the member for Oxley, who has just spoken on this matter, and the secretariat, who very adequately supported our work. The report follows a five-month inquiry that held four public hearings and received more than 150 submissions from franchisees, franchisors, representative organisations and academic and legal experts. The committee has made 11 recommendations, all of which are aimed at raising the standard of conduct in Australian franchising. They get the balance right between regulation and encouraging free enterprise. The franchising relationship is based on a prescribed business model which is offered by the franchisor and carried out under their guidance and oversight by franchise owners. Many franchise agreements have, of course, resulted in highly successful and profitable ongoing business relationships. There is little doubt that the franchising model has become increasingly popular in Australia. At best, franchise agreements for businesses should offer an extra degree of protection for new entrants and particularly some stability and backup for those people going into small business for the first time. To know they are part of an established supply chain under an established brand-a well-marketed brand, in some cases-can offer a degree of comfort to new businesses. MAIN COMMITTEE A recent industry survey commissioned by the Franchise Council of Australia suggests that franchise systems enjoyed a 14.6 per cent growth rate between 2006 and mid-2008 and that franchises now represent 3.7 per cent of all small business in Australia, employing an estimated 413,500 people. So they are a significant contributor to our economy and the small business sector. Notwithstanding the rapid growth of franchises in Australia over the last decade, the lack of independent, reliable data has remained a significant issue for this sector, and I think everyone will welcome the committee’s recommendation that the ABS develop mechanisms for collecting and publishing relevant statistics on the franchising sector. Despite the success of many franchise agreements, evidence presented to the committee also served to highlight the conflicts that currently exist between some franchisors and franchisees. The committee notes that issues arising during the term of the agreements can and do cause tensions and that these issues have the potential to escalate into major disputes. Disputes most frequently arise as a result of differing expectations and understandings about the obligations of each party to the agreement and asymmetric power dynamics within franchise agreements, with the potential to lead to an abuse of power. Improved collection of franchising statistics, with a focus on disputes and dispute related unit franchise turnover, will help us to develop a better understanding of just how extensive disputation truly is. To have this data publicly available as a source of information for those contemplating entry into a franchise arrangement would allow them to identify any trends or patterns of conflict. A reduction in disputes is nonetheless the most desirable outcome for all, and the committee noted a number of suggestions to improve dispute resolution outcomes, including an increased focus on premediation strategies, the creation of a tribunal to make determinations and the introduction of a franchising ombudsman. But it is the committee’s view that many of the issues which lead to disputes and the need for mediation or alternative dispute resolution mechanisms would be mitigated by the introduction of an explicit obligation into the code of conduct for all parties to a franchise agreement to act in good faith. Several of our recommendations also are about clarification of disclosure-the sort of information parties to a franchise agreement should be in possession of. That includes clear statements of liabilities and consequences applying to franchisees in the event of failure. We recommended that government explore avenues to better balance the rights and liabilities of franchisees and franchisors in the event of franchisor failure. We also recommended that the Franchising Code of Conduct be amended to require franchisors to disclose to a franchisee, before a franchising agreement is entered into, what process will apply in determining end-of-term arrangements. That process should give due regard to the potential transferability of equity in the value of the business as a going concern. Our preferred course of action was to emphasise the good-faith angle of both negotiations and entering into any contractual arrangement. The committee believes that acting in good faith at all stages of the franchise relationship provides a deterrent against opportunistic conduct in the franchising sector. There is no denying that the treatment of some franchisees when their contract ends has been truly appalling. The committee heard disturbing evidence of some franchisors who had exploited and abused their market power and position, had taken advantage of their dominance within the partnership and had shown little regard for the regulatory system or for the outcomes and potential loss to the franchisee. I know that as MPs we have all had cases in our MAIN COMMITTEE electorates brought to our attention. I have worked with one such case in my electorate for more than three years now; it is still not completely resolved. The trauma experienced by mum-and-dad franchisees who at the end of their contracts have walked away with nothing, and continue to live in fear of losing the roof over their heads, speaks volumes for the need for this inquiry and for the recommendations it has put forward. In dealing with the cases that I have in my electorate, I want to thank the franchise sector representative groups. They have been very helpful. I also point out that, in these agreements, frequently the franchisor’s bank is the bank that enters into the agreement as financier for the franchisee. I think that is a less than desirable situation, but it is not something that came across sufficiently in our inquiry. But it does seem that, just as in purchasing a home one might use a different bank than the vendor; the franchisee should perhaps have a very separate bank arrangement. I also take this opportunity to point out that there is a high degree of ignorance of people’s rights in the banking sector. There are customer advocates at our major banks, and they are there to be advocates for the customer. In cases of major sums of money, there is also a banking ombudsman. Those sorts of facilities and avenues of redress should be made available, because often the situation is that a franchise business does not return enough to make payments owed to banks for that contract. I think there are issues that we could not deal with in this report but that still exist. As this report makes clear, though, franchise agreements should clearly stipulate what the end-of-term arrangements and processes are. These arrangements should be fully and transparently disclosed to prospective franchisees. To reduce disputation around end-of-term arrangements, the committee recommended that those disclosure provisions in the code of conduct be amended to increase transparency, before the start of a franchise agreement, about what process will apply at the end. Unfortunately, people go in with a very optimistic viewpoint. They rarely contemplate the worse-case scenario or consider that there will be an element of failure or financial risk. The committee also recommends the introduction of pecuniary penalties and enhancement of the ACCC’s proactive investigative powers in relation to potential breaches of the code. I take this opportunity to congratulate Graeme Samuel. Under the new government, I have seen much greater interest in protecting small business and in representation for small business when they are in a dispute with a major business. I recommend that course of action and I am very pleased to see the ACCC taking up that challenge. In conclusion, I commend this report to the House. I look forward to working with the government to ensure ongoing improvements in the standard of conduct in the Australian franchising sector. I hope that the relevant ministers will take up our recommendations, put them into effect and be very open to representation by the franchise sector for any further reforms. I think this report builds on a long period of action and responses, but they have not been completely effective. The adding of penalties, the strengthening of legislation and the role of the ACCC and, in particular, changing the code of conduct-basing it on good faith and adding clarity to it-will, if adopted, make sure that this sector is a vibrant and successful one and one where we would certainly like to see a reduction in disputes.
