6,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Prime MinisWould the Minister consider asking the Joint Committee for the Australian Capital Territory to conduct an inquiry into the usage and tenure of land within the Australian Capital Territory, particularly the rural lands of the area? Specifically, would the Minister ask that committee whether it would recommend to him a change in the terms and conditions of leases that would give the farmers of this community more secure tenure of their land-tenur e against which they could approach a bank for finance for the development of the land? Government did receive a request from the recent debate on the Loan (Housing) Bill, Rural Lessees Association that a clause in was I correct in stating that the amount of rural leases be deleted. This clause is comgrants monly known as the withdrawal clause and gives the Commonwealth the right to resume land should it be required for Commonnot responsible for the honourable member's wealth purposes. The Government agreed statement. to delete the clause at the wish of any rural lessee, subject to the term of the lease and the rental being re-examined. Since that condition was offered, I have had no corgrants made by this Government under the respondence from the rural lessees, but I Aged Persons Homes Act has now reached will look at the honourable member's request. £14,800,000? Prime Minister. On 17th May, he said that ture under the Aged Persons Homes Act. the United States was to build a radio The information I gave him then was, to the station in Western Australia. On 28th best of my knowledge and belief, correct in August, in reply to a question I asked, he every way on the day the information was said that he would give the House full given. From that time onward, and from details, as soon as possible, in a manner that week to week the figures are constantly would permit debate. Is the Prime Minister changing, and grants approved by the aware that there are numerous reports, from Government under the Aged Persons people who have actually been on the spot, Homes that work has already started?

I have informed one or two honourable members, by way of a confidential letter, of the reasons why Miss Angela Fontana was not allowed to come here. There are very substantial health reasons why she should not be allowed to come. These reasons apply also in the case of two of her brothers who are still in Italy. I would ask the honourable member not to press me to tell bim and the House publicly what the reasons are, out of respect for the feelings of the young woman concerned and her family. SALE OF IMPORTED GOODS. addressed to the Minister for Trade. Is there any evidence to support the statement made by the honourable member for Scullin, when speaking recently on the tariff legislation, that large emporiums in Australia are keeping goods of Australian manufacture under the counter while they push the sale of imported goods? If there is any such evidence, will the Minister make a full investigation of all the circumstances? such a suggestion made by anyone other than the honourable member for Scullin in the speech referred to. I would be astonished if Australians of great repute, who have given excellent service to this country, were giving priority to imported goods over Australian-made goods. In the absence of any information to suggest that this is so, I do not believe that it is so. the Minister for Immigration. Is he aware of demonstrations recently held by Spanish immigrants at the Northam immigrant centre as a result of their having been brought to this country when work was not available for them? Is it a fact that this shortage of employment opportunities has caused some of these immigrants to be transferred to the Minister's own State, South Australia? Is it not a fact that these tection, except that which can come from immigrants, who, I understand, are 500 in number-and another 500 are on the way -hav e been brought to this country before full employment was available for them? think the honourable member is entided to draw that conclusion. It is true that there has been some little delay in the placing of some, but by no means all, of the Spanish migrants who have been brought to Northam. It is a mistake, however, to exaggerate these things. It is quite true, as the honourable member has said, that a minor demonstration was held; but it was not, I understand, in any way vicious. This demonstration was in protest about some delay in finding work for these people. It is not to be thought that work was not offered them. As I understand it, work at fairly lucrative wages was offered to these Spanish immigrants, but they decided that it was not to their liking and therefore rejected it. The situation now is that most of these people have been transferred at the Commonwealth's expense to other States, and I am quite sure that it is only a matter of a comparatively short time before they will be quite comfortably absorbed into the economic life of the community. addressed to the Minister for Shipping and Transport. I refer to the recent vandalism which has been responsible for serious damage to the unmanned lighthouse at Cape Liptrap. I ask the Minister what positive steps his department proposes to take to prevent a recurrence of this type of vandalism. brought to my attention just before the week-end. It was a deplorable action which might have caused loss of life because the damage was done to an unmanned lighthouse. I have called for a report on the damage. I must say that this lighthouse is in a very isolated position and much trouble and effort must have been taken by those concerned to get there. Because of this isolation it will not be very easy to afford the lighthouse any pro-",13,Immigration

SALE OF FN RIFLES AND addressed to the Minister for Supply. Will the Minister give the House details of the reported sale of FN rifles and ammunition to India? Is the Minister in a position to state to what extent it will be necessary to increase production of FN rifles to meet the order and to satisfy Australia's defence requirements? honourable member I can indicate my own Australia?

Minister the following question:-In view of the general concern shown at the lack of opportunities for apprentices, and in view of the statement by the New South Wales Premier, the Honourable R. J. Heffron, recently, that he would take the necessary action to increase the number of young people apprenticed in the Public Service, will the Prime Minister follow the lead given by the New South Wales State Premier and take the necessary steps to increase the number of apprentices in the Commonwealth Public Service, thus creating greater opportunities for young people who are about to leave school? discuss this matter with my colleague, the obtain the figures in which the honourable Minister for Labour and National Service, gentleman is interested and other relevant called "" another place"", to wit, the International Labour Conference. of the ""Pacific Islands Monthly"" that the Nauruan people will be making a request to the Australian Government to assist them to settle on Fraser Island? Is the Minister able to say whether this report is correct, and whether such a request has been made to the Australian Government? that kind has been made; nor does occasion arise for a formal request to be made. For some time past, I have personally been having discussions with the leaders of the Nauruan people in order to assist them in reaching an opinion on the re-settling of their people and the selection of a future home. In conjunction with those discussions, representatives of the Nauruan people, under arrangements made in co-operation with the Queensland Government, inspected various places on the Queensland coast. I am sure that the honourable gentleman, as a member from Queensland, will be flattered to know that the Nauruan representatives considered that the Queensland coast was some of the most desirable country in Australia. Whether or not a future home is to be found there depends on very many other matters which will be the subject of discussions between the leaders of the Nauruan people and this Government. the Minister for Trade, I refer to the recent visit to Ghana of a flour survey mission.

As the honourable member will be aware, we had an oversubscription of some £30,000,000 in the first domestic loan of this year's programme. Rather better prospects for overseas borrowing have opened up than seemed likely at Budget time. We do make from time to time a review of the way in which the economy is faring, and I expect that we shall, as has become customary over recent years, be looking at the programmes of the State governments, particularly in the new year. Although the degree of deficit financing is somewhat less than was estimated at Budget time, the rate of economic expansion, the degree of activity in fhe economy and the confident expectations of my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service, that the economy will absorb with reasonable comfort the addition to the workforce of people leaving schoolthese are indications that no special action is necessary beyond that envisaged when the Budget was introduced. I can perhaps refer in passing to such indicators of buoyancy as record motor car sales, an increase during each of the last four months in building approvals, and a variety of matters of that kind all pointing to a buoyant economy. So, 1 repeat, in those circumstances it would not appear that any special action is necessary. WOOL. to the Minister for Primary Industry.

Mr O'CONNOR I ask the Minister for Defence: Is he aware that last Friday 64 employees at Cockatoo dockyard were dismissed and there is a possibility of more dismissals due to the lack of naval shipbuilding orders? Also, is the Minister aware that due to lack of orders shipbuilding in Australia is facing a serious decline? If the Government can find £50,000,000 to be spent over the next three years in purchasing naval ships which are to be built overseas, is it not a reasonable request that the Government should find a sum of approximately £8,000,000 to be spent in Australia on naval needs, and thereby ensure the retention of skilled artisans and labour at both Cockatoo dockyard and Williamstown dockyard for the next three and the House that we have done a tremenment of the United Kingdom, for instance, to refit one British submarine a year; and that work has been given to the Cockatoo",18,Budget Deficit

I am pleased to inform the honourable member that the annual grant from the Commonwealth to the National Fitness Council in each State was previously £72,500 and the grant has been increased, this financial year, to £27,500. Together with the allocations from other sources-fro m the States and from sources outside-it will give an increased allocation to the National Fitness Council this year of about £64,454.

This consists of service flats or chalets. They have been used by the RAAF. officers for some time and have been found quite suitable. So far as the reduction of the allowance for meals is concerned, all that the RAAF. has done in regard to the teachers is that it has paid the full amount for three meals a day for them. If they were moved into the chalets they would be charged less there, although I am assured that the meals are very reasonable. However, in view of the representations that have been made to me both by the teachers concerned and by the teachers' federation, I have decided to suspend action until a report is received from the commanding officer at Butterworth and from the headmaster there.

The purpose of this bill is to obtain the approval of Parliament to an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of Western Australia providing for financial assistance to the State towards the cost of construction of a new jetty at the port of Derby. This is one of the State developmental works to which I referred in my Budget speech as being projects in connection with which the Commonwealth had undertaken to provide State governments with special financial assistance as a means of furthering the important national objectives of the stimulation of increased export earnings and the development of northern areas of Australia. For some years the Commonwealth has been actively participating in the financing this project followed a request from the of developmental projects in the north of Government of Western Australia for Western Australia.

In addition to the £5,000,000 grant, the Commonwealth is also providing substantial sums for expenditure on cattle roads in the area. Subject to the ratification of this Parliament, an agreement has been made between the Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments under which the Commonwealth undertakes to provide special financial assistance to the State of Western Australia of up to £800,000, of which up towards the cost of replacement of the Derby jetty. The text of the agreement is set out in the schedule to the bill. Derby is the major port at present serving the West Kimberley region for the shipping of live cattle to the abattoirs at Fremantle and for discharge of supplies and materials. Its importance as a supply centre for the region will no doubt increase with the development of agriculture and the pastoral industry in the area. The existing jetty at Derby is old and extremely costly to maintain. Its design and condition are such that it cannot meet the present-day requirements of Shipping. The State Government plans to erect on the south side of the existing jetty a composite steel and concrete single-berth jetty with modem cattle loading and cargo handling facilities which, it is hoped, will go far to eliminate present maintenance and port operating difficulties. The works are estimated to cost approximately £800,000 and to be completed within two years. The Commonwealth's decision to assist",21,Public Accounts Committee
68,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"the Government decided that special Commonwealth financial assistance for the construction of the new jetty should be provided. The terms and conditions under which the financial assistance will be made available to Western Australia are set out in the agreement between the State and the Commonwealth, the text of which is, as I have said, set out in the schedule to the bill. Under clause 3 of the agreement, the Commonwealth undertakes to provide to the State amounts not exceeding £800,000 towards meeting the cost of the jetty works, of which up to £300,000 is to be provided in 1962-63. The State undertakes, in accordance with clause 6, to repay to the Commonwealth one-half of the total amount advanced by means of payments spread over fifteen years. The balance of the amount to be advanced is not repayable to the Commonwealth. Repayments do not commence until December, 1964, by which time the Western Australian authorities expect the works to be completed. Interest is to be paid on the repayable advances at the long-term bond rate applying when each advance is made. The requirement for the State to repay one half of total Commonwealth advances under the agreement arises from the consideration that the new jetty will be a revenue-earning State asset, coupled with the fact that the provision of the new jetty will result in substantial savings to the State on maintenance expenditure. The State has undertaken to ensure that the works are carried out in conformity with sound engineering and financial practices and as expeditiously as possible. Provision is made for the variation of the works described in the schedule to the agreement, if circumstances so require. The agreement also contains appropriate provisions relating to the furnishing of estimates, the supply of information, audit and the giving of notices. All of these provisions are similar to those in other comparable Commonwealth-State agreements relating to special developmental projects in the States. In conclusion, I should like to point out that, in agreeing to make available this financial assistance, the Commonwealth Government is providing a further indication in ter for Repatriation) [3.33] -by leave I a practical way of its desire to promote the movedevelopment of our northern areas and of the potential of those areas from the viewpoint of increased export earnings.

These amendments are being proposed following a comprehensive review of the hospital benefits arrangements which was undertaken by the Government earlier this year. As a result of this review, the Government considers that the development of the hospital benefits scheme has been extraordinarily successful. It was in January, 1952, that the Govern£40,000,000, comprising more than ment first embarked on the policy of pro£25,000,000 Commonwealth benefits and viding additional hospital benefits for £15,000,000 fund benefits.

It is sometimes claimed that the finance made available for hospital expenses through the insurance scheme is not adequate. I want to inform the House that the facts simply do not support this claim. In the year ended June, 1952, a total amount of £7,500,000 was paid from Commonwealth and hospital insurance fund sources towards hospital expenses. The amounts paid from these sources in the year ended 30th June, 1962, totalled £35,700,000.

The arrangement has been that a benefit of 8s. a day has been deducted from the patient's hospital account and an additional benefit of 12s. a day has been paid to the patient by his insurance organization with his fund benefit. In future it is proposed that insured patients will receive the whole of their Commonwealth benefit of £1 a day in a single payment from their insurance organization.

We accordingly regard to which the existing arrangements decided that we should offer a special benefit to hospitals who treat pensioners free of charge in order to assist them to continue this service. At a recent conference with State Health Ministers the Commonwealth Minister for Health (Senator Wade) undertook that the Government would introduce legislation to provide a benefit at the rate of 36s. a day for the hospital treatment of pensioners and their dependants who are entitled to the pensioner medical service, this benefit to be paid in cases where public hospitals provide free treatment for all such pensioners who are classified as public ward patients. In the discussions with the State Ministers it The Government hopes that public hospiif they individually prefer to do so. Some There is one other group of patients in have not been operating satisfactorily, and that is the patients in convalescent and rest homes and in the infirmary sections of State benevolent homes and State and private homes for the aged. Because many patients in these homes are pensioners and because they very often remain in the homes for long periods of time, the Government has decided that they should not be obliged to join an insurance fund to qualify for Commonwealth benefits. It is therefore proposed that patients in these institutions will committee stage. receive a Commonwealth benefit of £1 a day, which will be deducted from their accounts by the institution, regardless of whether they are insured with a hospital insurance fund. The institutions to which this arrangement will apply are institutions which in the past have been treated as "" unrecognized hospitals"" in the hospital benefits legislation. In future it is proposed should be an increase in this benefit for that patients in these institutions will be classified as nursing home patients, and the legislation provides that the Commonwealth benefit of £1 a day will be payable for "" nursing home care"" in these nursing homes. This benefit will be paid from the first day of their admission to the nursing home and will continue without limitation as long as they are patients there. I believe that this amendment will be joining or continuing in insurance funds, welcomed by the patients of these homes. and that would be a great disservice to the They will be saved the expense and inconhospitals and to the people themselves. venience of paying weekly contributions to an insurance fund and their benefits will be automatically deducted from their concerned, the only change proposed by this accounts.

Tbe amendments I bave referred to are the most important changes in substance being made by this bill. They involve a complete recasting of the hospital benefits provisions of the act. Consequently, Part V. of the act, which contains those provisions, is being repealed and a series of new provisions inserted in place of the existing ones. I will be pleased to supply honourable members with detailed explanations of the clauses in the bill when we are in the There is one other matter in regard to hospital benefits which I should make clear at this stage; that is, that the present hospital benefit of 8s. a day will continue to be deducted from the hospital accounts of patients who are not insured. It has been advocated in some quarters that there uninsured patients. This bill provides for a large increase in benefit for uninsured patients who are pensioner medical service pensioners. It does not provide for any increase in benefit for uninsured patients who are not pensioners, because the very best means of help in these cases is selfhelp, that is, by joining a hospital insurance fund. An increase in benefit for uninsured patients might discourage people from So far as uninsured patients generally are Treasuries. This will facilitate a simplification of existing procedures and enable There is a further series of machinery tions previously carried out by the British Medical Association in Australia. The existing act provides for an agreement between the Government and the British Medical Association in Australia regarding the provision of the pensioner medical service. It also provides for the nomination of members of various committees under the act by the federal council of the British Medical Association in Australia. The bill provides for all these references to the British Medical Association in Australia to be changed to the Australian Medical Association in order to provide proper authority for the Government to deal with this new body. I am sure that we have a very good hospital benefits scheme in Australia. What this bill is doing is to make that good scheme a better scheme. The amendments are all designed for the simplification and better public understanding of the scheme by the removal of difficulties and anomalies. I am certain that the new arrangements will be more satisfactory to patients, to insurance organizations and to hospitals. The total cost of the proposals will be £3,200,000 per annum and the new benefits will be of very great value to the people for whom they are provided, especially pensioners and nursing home patients.

The amendment moved by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti), which I strongly support, is designed to ensure that consumers will have a majority on the authority which is to be established, and that there will be representation on the authority of the employees through the Canberra branch of the Electrical Trades Union of Australia. I think it is appropriate, at this time, to say something about the history of the supply of electricity in the Australian Capital Territory. During the period of approximately 40 years in which that supply has been in existence it has always been under departmental or semi-departmental control. In the course of its history, it has been controlled by the Department of Home Affairs, by the Department of Works and Railways, by the Federal Capital Commission from 1925 to 1930 and, subsequently, by the Department of Works and the Department of the Interior. In those years the electricity supply was a section of the department executive officers have been the chief electrical engineers. The electricity supply authority in the Australian Capital Territory has always been fortunate in the personnel entrusted who have made up its office and outdoor staff.

72,"(Vide Page 2535), On Motion By Mr Freeth","late Mr W. E. Gray. It was his great ambition to have the electricity supply taken to all portions of the rural areas of the Australian Capital Territory. It is pleasing to know that, after a period in which there were no further extensions, that aim will now be achieved. The late Mr Gray had a son who is still with the Canberra Electric Supply. I am sure that in the field in which he is entrusted with responsibility he carries on the fine tradition of his late father. The present engineer-manager of the efficient organization. Canberra Electric Supply, Mr Speaker, is a man of most outstanding ability and extensive experience. I refer, of course, to Macquarie and the Opposition, that the Mr Alan Jones, who came to Canberra in proposed authority should be widened so as 1928 as a cadet with the Federal Capital to provide a real opportunity for greater Commission. He has been engineerlocal representation in this field. The manager of the Canberra Electric Supply Minister for the Interior, in his secondsince its formation as a separate unit, still reading speech, saidunder departmental control, some years ago. The authority, whatever its form of estabanother authority in the field of local administralishment, will have, I believe, great potential the Department of the Interior and it has been for success if the Government retains as chairman or chief executive its present engineer-manager, Mr Alan Jones, who, as I have said, is a man of outstanding ability and most extensive experience, and one who has the ability to deal with men. I think he should sometimes be referred to as an employees' representative because he has the complete trust of the employees of the Canberra Electric Supply. I do not know what the Minister for the Interior( Mr very effectively, described the establishment Freeth) has in mind and it would not be appropriate, of course, for him to mention the name of the appointee at this time, but I hope that Mr Jones will be retained in the chief executive position with the new authority. The Canberra Electric Supply has amongst its employees many of long service and many who have become stalwarts in this community, going back to the years when Canberra was little more than a small construction settlement on these limestone plains. I refer to men such as Mr Murdoch McGregor, who now is known as the installation superintendent of the Canberra Electric Supply, and who has been connected with the supply of electricity in the Australian Capital Territory since 1923. He is a man who has taken a great part in our community activities and who has a great knowledge of the reticulation and installation problems that can be encountered. We have on the staff also Mr Dave Lamond, who has been with the electric supply authoriity here since 1924 and is now maintenance superintendent for the Canberra Electric Supply. I mention these men because I believe that credit must go not only to those who have held the executive positions but also to those who, in the outdoor field, the workshops and elsewhere have contributed to what has become a very I believe, with the honourable member for Another aspect of this bill with which I would like to deal is that it establishes in Canberra tion. Until now the undertaking has been part of easy to arrange liaison with other branches and sections of the department The presence on the authority of an officer of the department will preserve the means for this liaison to be continued. The relationship and co-operation established to date by the Canberra Electric Supply with the National Capital Development Commission and with the Department of Works will of course continue. The"" Canberra Times"", which, I believe, speaks for this district and speaks for it of the authority proposed by this bill as a first step in local government. It statedThis is not just another local administrative authority comparable in all respects with existing government agencies. It represents the first step in granting to residents of the Territory active participation of a significant public utility. The Canberra electricity undertaking has grown to a point at which it exceeds in size many County Councils in New South Wales which form part of the local government pattern. The difiiculties of transplanting municipal government as it is understood in Australia to Federal Capital administration are well enough understood, but not to the extent that some form of municipal government cannot one day have a place in Canberra or that the way to some form of municipal government should not be taken step by step. The Canberra electricity undertaking presents a favourable starting point in that it controls an essential public utility which affects every resident as well as every government activity. The initial composition of the new authority is thus justifiably representative of both Government ahd the citizen. In addition to the responsibilities of running the electricity undertaking, the new authority will have to cope with growth problems for which there is no exact parallel in Australia. Thus, its members will be actively engaged in providing services in newly developing areas with a much higher rate of capital expenditure than any other electricity undertaking has to manage. Thus, this is not a simple problem of buying and selling power and of managing an undertaking economically and efficiently for the Commonwealth which provides the capital and the consumers who will provide the revenue. This is the type of activity in which participation by an elected member will significantly pilot the way to other responsibilities being given in due course to the residents of the Territory. We are merely suggesting, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Government might have taken the opportunity, in presenting this bill, to give much wider representation to the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory. True, the authority as proposed in the bill will number among its three members one elected by the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council, which, itself, of course, is not a completely elected body. It consists of eight elected members and four nominated members. It may well be that the people of this community are prepared to stand for election to the Advisory Council to serve the community on that body, but it may not be fitting to suggest that a person who is prepared to take on that responsibility in the community should by inference place himself in the position of being required to take on additional duties as well. I would think-w e may have an opportunity to expand this at the committee stage-that the proposed authority could well have been enlarged to include a majority of elected representatives as well as a representative of the Electrical Trades Union of Australia. As the honourable member for Macquarie said when he opened the debate on this measure for the Opposition, plenty of precedents exist in Commonwealth legislation and Commonwealth authorities for employee representation. These are only a few of the authorities and boards established by the Commonwealth on which there is employee representation as well, of course, as consumer representation and producer representation: Australian Apple and Pear Board, Australian Egg Board, Australian Meat Board, Australian Wheat Board, Australian Dairy Produce Board. SoI suggest that the Government could well have taken the opportunity to entrust the people of the Australian Capital Territory with some measure of self-government by giving them an authority with a majority of elected representatives and proper employee representation. Mr Deputy Speaker, there are a number of matters which I believe that the proposed authority will have to take into consideration when it is established, and it is necessary to refer to those matters to consider properly the powers that are proposed to be given to the authority under the terms of this bill. Those powers are delineated in clause 17, which readsThe functions of the Authority are(a) to supply electricity in the Territory; (b) to promote the use of electricity in the Territory; and (c) such functions in relation to matters affecting or connected with the supply or use of electricity in the Territory as aro conferred on the Authority by the laws of the Territory. Clause 18 goes on to amplify those powers to some extent. I hope that the authority will be given the wide power that is necessary to enable it to act fully according to the terms of clause 17. The headings of the powers set out there are wide enough to permit the authority a very extensive field of action. Under the heading of promoting the use of electricity in the Territory, I hope that the authority will really come out into the field and endeavour to persuade people that electricity is the most efficient means of heating, cooking, lighting and so on. I hope, too, that the authority will come out into the appliance-selling field in competition with the private-enterprise firms which sell or hire electrical appliances such as stoves, bath heaters and sink heaters. All electrical appliances of this kind could be sold by an authority such as is now proposed on terms advantageous to the authority but not onerous to the purchaser, and this would introduce some real competition with the firms already engaged in this kind of business. I should like to see the authority go out into the field of advertising and seek to sell its product and to sell or hire the appliances by which its product is consumed. The authority, I believe, should take every available opportunity to put the consumer in the position in which he can use increasing quantities of electricity. The proposed authority will start its work, of course, in the face of some competition already provided by the very government which creates the authority itself, because this Government, in its wisdom, has given a franchise to a firm supplying bottled gas or gas in bulk for heating and cooking in one housing settlement in this Territory. The authority will encounter that form of competition in the private field as well, so I hope that the Government will not restrict the authority in any way in its duty of promoting the use of electricity in the Territory. To carry out its duties efficiently the authority will have to attract employees of the calibre required to undertake the very considerable extensions of supply and the very extensive installations proposed. In this respect it might well be thought fitting that the authority should be given some assurance that housing will be provided for its employees. If we are to attract into the Australian Capital Territory the competent, capable, trained workmen whom we require -thi s does not apply only to the field of electricity supply but to many other fields as well-w e must be able to hold out some benefit to them. I do not think we will attract employees here if they know that when they arrive they must put their name on the housing list and live for three and one-half years in whatever accommodation they can find until a house is provided for them. If the authority is to go ahead with the vast work which it must undertake on behalf of the Government and of the community, it should be able to attract competent trained staff to Canberra. One means of doing this is to promise that housing v/ill be provided. As the Minister knows, this has been done already by the Canberra Electric Supply in relation to linewill be provided with sufficient money to men who were brought to Canberra and housed in the prefabricated area of Narrabundah. I do not suggest that that type of housing will be adequate for the kind of tradesmen that we require. The Minister has given an assurance, be disfigured by such poles. However, with and the bill so provides, that the rights and the exigencies and the pressures which have entitlements of Commonwealth public followed the development of this city, we servants and Commonwealth employees have seen, unfortunately, a very considerwho will be transferred from the Canberra able use in various parts of the city of overElectric Supply to the new authority will head wires carried on wooden poles, and it be safeguarded. The' act specifically menis to be hoped that the new authority will tions the provisions of the Commonwealth have the funds, as it has the desire, to Employees Compensation Act but I suggest to the Minister that there will be a need to have the new Canberra electricity supply authority designated an authority of the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Commonwealth Employees Furlough Act so that its employees-ther e are some 300 members of the Electrical Trades Union employed by the supply authority at present -wil l have their entitlement to long service leave carried over into their new employment. As the Minister has said, the authority will face great tasks in this rapidly developing city where the population is increasing by 6,000 or 7,000 a year, where whole new suburbs are being constructed and where whole new areas of administration are being developed. The authority will rely on this Parliament for its capital funds. I hope that the Minister and the Government will ensure that the funds to be provided will be adequate. They will be more than would be required if this were an authority being established in a settled community. Here we have a rapidly developing community requiring the undertaking of a vast amount of capital expenditure which obviously cannot be met by revenue from the sale of electricity within the area. There will need to be subvention for capital funds. The bill does not make the position quite clear to me. It stipulates that the funds of the authority shall consist of the assets as delineated in the bill, but there will need to be a very substantial provision of capital funds to meet the cost of the work to be undertaken. It is my hope, and the hope of many people in the community, that the authority enable it to do at long last what was planned when this city was first established, that is, to eliminate the use of street poles to carry electricity and telephone wires. This was to be a. city in which the streets would not see that supply lines are placed underground wherever possible and that if poles are necessary they will be situated at the backs of houses so that they will not disfigure the streets. We are not seeking anything that is not available in other communities, because in other communities local government authorities have the power to make arrangements of that kind for their own electricity supply. By precedent and by custom they can arrange with the Postmaster General's Department for the lines to be placed underground. I do not propose to go into detail in relation to the tariffs which will be charged. Clause 19 (1.), which is in the following terms, gives the authority certain powers:The Authority may, from time to time, make determinations fixing or varying the charges that are, subject to this section, to be payable to the Authority for or in connection with the supply of electricity. Sub-clause 7 of this clause statesIn determining charges under this section, the Authority shall take into consideration the financial position of the Authority and the future requirements of the undertaking of the Authority, with a view to making those charges as low as practicable having regard to the revenue required for the maintenance of the affairs of the Authority on a sound commercial basis. I have taken out thefigurescomparing the tariffs of various State and county authorities with the tariffs already chargeable in Canberra. I hope that the authority will honour the undertaking which the bill requires of it to keep its charges as low as is practicable. The Canberra Electric Supply has an excellent record in reticulation, repair and maintenance, quite often in the face of great difficulties caused by the type of equipment which was supplied by tender to consumers through government agencies. Frequently we received very inferior equipment, particularly stoves, because of the requirement that the lowest tender should be accepted. The Minister and his predecessors know something of this. In the face of all those difficulties the Canberra Electric Supply has maintained an excellent record of service to the people. I hope that the wider authority envisaged by the bill, and the much wider authority envisaged by the amendment, will be able to carry on those traditions to the members opposite would, if agreed to, benefit of the community. I hope that the represent a drastic experiment in a local Parliament will see fit to direct that the authority shall be so formed that it will have a majority of elected representatives and proper representation of its employees. If that is done I am sure there will be nothing to halt the progress of this authority provided that it retains and seeks the appropriate personnel in all categories to carry on this very important undertaking. Interior and Minister for Works) [4.19] in replyI rise to speak only briefly and to satisfy the curiosity of honourable members opposite as to whether we propose to accept their amendment. Let me say at the outset that we do not find the amendment acceptable. I do not want to engage in long debate on this matter. I hasten to say that the form of the proposed electricity supply authority is not necessarily the final form for all time. We are in a transitional stage where it is felt that an authority freed from departmental procedures will function more efficiently and more in keeping with the present requirements of the Australian Capital Territory. Without doubt, ideas in regard to the degree of local self-government will change as the community grows, and more opportunities will be available for different kinds of representation by local consumers or by local ratepayers or whatever finally may be decided. But I hasten to correct one impression which may have arisen from something that the honourable member for Macquarie said. He accused me of attacking the present electricity supply authority. That, of course, was quite incorrect. I made no attack on the authority. In fact, I join with the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) in commending the efficiency of the authority. I am delighted that the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory has paid a tribute to the work done by the Canberra Electricity Supply under quite substantial difficulties, not the least of which is the fact that the authority is tied to fully departmental procedures both in relation to staff recruiting and accounting, and also in relation to all the other things which are commonly known as government red tape. The amendment proposed by honourable",27,Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Bill 1962
73,Mr Freeth (Forrest,"Minister for theauthority of this type-so drastic that none of the present State authorities have embarked on it to anything like the degree proposed here. In fact, in all the States the central electricity supply authority is appointed by the State Government. The numbers of members vary and the procedures vary. Some States provide that the government must appoint representatives of certain organizations or interests, but those representatives are actually appointed by the government concerned. The only cases in which the members of an electricity supply authority may be said to be wholly elected by the consumers are those in which a local government authority also runs the local electricity supply. I think that honourable members opposite would be the first to agree that the Australian Capital to accord to the employees of other departTerritory Advisory Council, which is the closest approach we have here to a local authority, is hardly equipped, in its present state of development, to run the electricity supply for the Australian Capital Territory. In the States there are varying degrees of centralized or decentralized electricity authorities, and this, I think, caused some confusion in the mind of the honourable member for Macquarie, because he did not seem quite clear whether, in alluding to a decentralized authority, he was alluding to one that was governed by the consumers or one that was governed by the responsible government of the State. In discussing this point I referred to the various types of centralized and decentralized authorities. In some cases the whole or almost the whole of the electricity supply of a State is provided by one authority set up by the State government, whilst in other cases there is a central authority, and various other authorities which are either subsidiary or independent or are something in between, supply electricity to different parts of the State. But in all those cases the authority is either appointed by the government or consists of the local government authority itself, which is elected. I do not think that any one would suggest that in the present stage of the Australian Capital Territory's development we should approach the proposition with the idea that control should be decentralized and that we should bave more than one authority. I think that it would be laughable to suggest that we have developed here to the point where we could sustain separate electricity supply authorities for different parts of the Australian Capital Territory. The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory raised several matters connected with the rights of employees of the Canberra Electric Supply. I want to say that it is the firm intention of the Government to see that the employees are not penalized in any way by transferring to employment with an independent authority instead of remaining in the employment of a government department. The honourable member also mentioned housing. Of course, where it is necessary, employees would be granted the same kind of priority in housing as we find it necessary ments when there is difficulty in obtaining recruits without giving some special priority in housing. That is not to say that they will get any special privileges or be put in any stronger position than the employees of other government departments in relation to housing, a matter in which there is quite strong competition in the Australian Capital Territory. But at any rate they will be no worse off. Part of the Opposition's amendment suggests that the employees should have direct representation on the authority. In only one State is this provided, and that is in Western Australia, where there is a commission consisting of nine members, some of whom are representatives of consumersand are appointed by the government concerned-and one of whom is a representative of the employees of the commission. He is not a representative of one trade union. If he were the principle applied would in one sense be far wider, because a union would embrace people who were not necessarily employed by the authority. In another sense it would be far narrower in that he would not represent members of other unions who might be employed by the authority. But, in any event, even in Western Australia the representative of the employees of the State electricity commission is a person who is selected from a panel of names submitted by the State executive of the Australian Labour Party. Here we take the view that the employees are adequately protected by the conditions of their employment, by the tribunals and awards which are available to them and by all the machinery and procedures of the arbitration system which enable them to have any dispute or demand promptly settled. We do not believe that they can make a really substantial contribution to the major purpose of this authority, which is really an administrative and business organization for the supply of electricity in the Australian Capital Territory. We have always maintained that there is conflict of interest if you put employees on the board of management of any company. their participation in management? cumstances, but where you have them In control, or partly in control, we believe that there is a conflict of interest. We believe that quite adequate provision is made to protect the interests of the employees, and we hope and expect that they will take an interest in the efficient functioning of the organization. For all those reasons, and without going into the matter in greater length, I must inform honourable members that we cannot accept the amendment.

77,1 Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [4.38],"New South Wales distribution is in the hands of elected people-the local people. This trend is in evidence in Queensland, to a lesser extent in Victoria and to some extent in South Australia. The National Parliament of Australia should accept this unique opportunity to provide for a majority of members of this authority to be elected. The Opposition has no fault to find with the establishment of an authority. It is the type of authority that concerns the Opposition. The Minister has said that this is not final for all time. If it to be able to accept the principle that local is not final for all time, surely some basis should be provided for a reasonable period so that we will have an effective authority for some years to come. I wonder just how far the National Capital is proceeding towards self-government. It seems to me that a Papuan village council would possess more effective power to deal with its own intimate and urgent problems than would the people of the National Capital of Australia. The Government still regards the National Capital as a ministerial preserve where the Minister shall be supreme and will control the affairs of the National Capital. What must this city do to prove to the Minister and to the Government that it has reached the maturity needed to control its own affairs? The Opposition continues to feel bitter about this matter. We are extremely disappointed that the majority of members of the authority will not be elected by the people. We appreciate the view of the Government that great sums of money are spent from the public purse here, but we also believe that the people have reached such maturity that they should be able to elect the majority of members of this authority. We have not argued, nor do we argue now, that the chairman should not be appointed by the Government. The Minister has said that what we propose is a drastic experiment. I am surprised to learn that bringing self-government to the National Capital is a drastic experiment. After all, this is the first city of the nation. What size must this city reach before it is considered to have the maturity man, you are aware of the effective roles played by the county councils in New South Wales. You know of the important role of the Shortland County Council in Newcastle. This council controls the reticulation of electricity for the whole of the Newcastle area and the adjoining shires and local government areas. In addition to providing electricity for domestic consumers, commercial users and heavy industries, it also provides electricity for rural development. If this can be done effectively in an area like Newcastle, it seems to me that here in the National Capital there is very little pioneering work to be done and we ought self-government ought to be supreme. A public authority without an elected majority seems to me to be a retrograde step. We ought to be going forward. The Opposition is not content with the snail-like pace of the Government in this matter. The whole of the affairs of the National Capital seem to be controlled by ministerial direction and are subject to ministerial patronage. That is a most unhealthy development, and at times I fear that in the National Capital, as in certain other Territories, there will develop a belief that the all-powerful central government is right and that local self-government has no place, that Father Christmas, the Minister, is always right. There will develop a belief that the Minister will give his bounties, and the people will accept them instead of being self-reliant and prepared to accept their responsibilities in local affairs. I should like to move in committee, if I may do so, that the clause be amended to provide for an elected majority and that a representative of the Canberra branch of the Electrical Trades Union be included. Order! If the honourable member wants to move an amendment, he must relate it to a specific clause in the bill. posal moved previously and I thought it would be opportune to test the committee now. As the Chair has so ruled, I do not intend at this stage to press the amendment. I have expressed the view of the Opposition that the Government's proposal is not satisfactory. It does not safeguard the consumers of the National Capital. It",33,Pairs

79,The Chairman ( Mr Lucock),,34,Pairs
80,Mr Luchetti,"That was the prodoes not protect those people engaged in the growth of local government in this area. It denies to the people of this great city an opportunity to control an important undertaking. For that reason, the Opposition believes that it cannot accept this clause of the bill which falls so far short of the requirements of the Australian Labour Party. Mr J. R. FRASER (Australian Capital Territory) [4.48] I speak on the provisions of clause 6 of the bill. I believe that the authority to be established under the terms of the bill will not give any form of self-government to the people of the Australian Capital Territory, although that claim was made for the bill by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Freeth) in his second-reading speech. It is true that one of the three members of the authority shall be a member of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council elected by the members of that council. The council itself is not a fully elected body. It is partly elected and pardy nominated. It has eight elected members and four members nominated by the Government to represent certain departments concerned with the administration of the Territory. I can see no reason why the bill should not make provision for the people of the Australian Capital Territory to elect a majority of members of what will, after all, be a board administering this supply undertaking. Governments in the past have seen fit-this Government has not changed the arrangement-to entrust the management and the control of a huge undertaking like the Canberra Community Hospital to a board which has a majority of elected members, it has five elected members. The Electricity Authority is not a major authority. Although the bill gives it power to generate electricity, it will not be generating eleetricity, at least not in the foreseeable future, and, I should think, even less in the dim future. At the present time the Canberra Electric Supply undertaking purchases all its electricity either from the inter-connected system in New South Wales or from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. Its position is in no way different from that of the Sydney County Council or other county councils or supply authorities or reticulation authorities throughout the States of Victoria and Queensland, which simply purchase in bulk and distribute to the community in the areas they serve. Here we have a community in which the very business of government is carried on, and in which a great proportion of the population is engaged in the very business of government. Those in the higher brackets of the Public Service, in fact, advise the national government on national policies. Yet we say to them, ""We cannot entrust you with the task of running an electric supply authority."" It is ridiculous. Why should not the people of the Australian Capital Territory be given the opportunity to elect a majority of members of this authority? Let there be the three appointed members; let there be a chairman appointed by the Governor General; let there be a representative of the Department of the Interior; let the Government, if it wishes, appoint an employees' representative from a panel of names submitted by the unions or associations concerned; but let the people of the Territory elect four representatives to that body, so that they would represent an elected majority. Then the people would really have an opportunity of running an organization for themselves. A lot of flapdoodle is talked about extending self-government to the people of tbe Territory, but nothing is ever done about it. There has been talk of widening the field of authority of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council, but I think it is talk and nothing more. Here is an opportunity, if ever there was one, to give the people of the Australian Capital Territory some say in deciding the way in which a public authority should be managed and conducted, but the opportunity is not to be given. give it. Mr J. R. FRASER I do not know that they are exactly frightened, but I think they are reluctant to give up any authority, and the fault may be with the department itself. It may be that the department does",34,Pairs
81,Mr Duthie,"They are frightened tonot want to relinquish the authority that it now has. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Freeth), of course, is now presiding over a department that is gradually being whittled away from underneath him. He has been losing sections of the department, and now he is to lose another section of it. I can see no reason why the suggestion that has been made should not be given effect to in this measure. There is something else lacking in this measure, to which reference is made in the encompassing section, from which it appears that the authority will not be given any power in the matter of licensing of electrical contractors. I would like to direct the committee's attention to the fact that quite recently, within the last twelve or eighteen months, a meeting was held of representatives of the Electrical Trades Union, the Electrical Contractors' Association and the Apprenticeship Board of the Australian Capital Territory. The meeting made recommendations to the Government concerning the licensing of electrical tradesthe electoral rights of the people and the men in the Australian Capital Territory. It suggested that there should be a board representative of the Electrical Trades Union, the Electrical Contractors' Association, fhe Canberra Electric Supply and the Apprenticeship Board, with a chairman appointed by the Minister. It recommended that the board should have power to license electrical tradesmen in the Australian Capital Territory, to cancel or suspend licences, to examine or set up examining boards, to call any licensee for the purpose of extracting prima facie evidence of a complaint, and to hear appeals of tradesmen who might have had their licences cancelled or suspended. The licensing of tradesmen in tbe Australian Capital Territory at the present time is far from satisfactory. There are not adequate provisions to ensure that electrical installations are always made by men manent organization capable of meeting the who are properly trained and qualified in requirements of the national capital to-day, this field. I admit that there is no specific to-morrow, or for the next five years or ten section in the legislation referring to this years. The Minister is merely tinkering with matter, but there is a section in the bill this important matter. Clause6 in particuwhich provides that such powers, normally lar fails dismally to meet the requirements. exercised by an authority of this kind, shall The fact is that in the national capital there be exercised through the laws of the Terriare people who have the capacity to distory, the ordinances and regulations and charge their duties effectively as elected repso on. I do not propose to speak at any greater length on this matter. I repeat that there is no reason why the section should not have been widened to give the people of the Australian Capital Territory an opportunity to participate in the management of a local authority of this kind. What a slur it is on the people of the Territory to say to them, "" Oh, yes, you can advise the Government on external affairs, you can advise it on defence, you can advise it on development and on repatriation and on all the other affairs of government, but, so help me, you cannot run an electricity supply undertaking in your own back-yard "". The Opposition feels so keenly about this matter tiiat it is not prepared to vote for the acceptance of clause 6 of the bill, which violates the very principles underlying our presence here in the Parliament. We are the elected representatives of the people, and, naturally, we have a bounden duty, a sacred trust and obligation, to try to extend authority of elected persons wherever we get the opportunity to do so. We do not argue to any extent the merits of the measure with respect to quite a number of matters dealt with by it. However, I do agree with the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) that the failure of the Minister to make provision for the licensing of tradesmen, and to keep a more diligent watch on safety precautions, is of great importance. If this authority is to be established, it should have powers with respect to all the matters that such an authority is normally expected to deal with. This seems to me to be a piecemeal measure, demonstrating the Micawber-like attitude of those who have drafted it. It pays no regard to the building of a perresentatives of an authority of this kind.",35,Pairs
82,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [4.56],"To suggest that the National Capital lacks the kind of people who could control such an authority or assist in the management of it is to show a lack of confidence in the leaders of this community. Consider the people who live here. There are those whose work is connected with the Australian National University and with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. There are the officers of the Parliament and the various government departments. There are the members of the "" Hansard"" staff, and there are leaders in the business and industrial fields. Surely amongst all these people can be found some with the capacity to run an undertaking such as that which is proposed. I am reminded that in my own electorate the Hartley County Council opened a new building at the week-end, and that the chairArmitage, J. L . man of that county council is Alderman Heffernan, an engineer at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. This gentleman was selected as a member of a Duke of Edinburgh study group, the first group to go overseas. He is a man of outstanding capacity, and he occupies an elected position in the county council. If in the Hartley community, which includes the Blaxland and Rylstone shires and the city of Lithgow, the right kind of people can be found for election to an authority of this kind, surely here Einfeld, S. D . in the national capital it would be a violation of our sense of what is right and proper to say that there should not be a majority of elected members on this authority. Because of the failure of the Government to accept the responsibilities of having a majority of elected members it is the intention of the Opposition to vote against clause 6, and we will be obliged to do so by voting against the bill.

On 18th March, 1959, I asked the Prime Minister this questionThe Prime Minister will probably have learned that in mid-1956, Sir Arthur Fadden, while acting in his stead, told the House that the right honourable privileges to nominated members of the gentleman had given consideration to bringing down legislation to declare parliamentary privilege and to revise the procedure for dealing with breaches of privilege, and that Sir Arthur promised to bring the matter to the right honourable gentleman's notice when he returned. The Prime Minister will also recall that he was asked a year ago, upon notice, whether he had given further consideration to the question and that he replied in April, 1958, ""Not yet"". I now ask him whether he has yet given this further consideration to matters which the Constitution leaves to the Parliament and which are once more before this House. The right honourable gentleman repliedQuite frankly, I have not, but I think it is a matter to which our attention should be directed quite soon. I am indebted to the honourable member for giving me a reminder on that point. May I now congratulate the Minister for Territories on having acted after two and a half years on behalf of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory on a matter in which his leader, after seven and a half years, has not shown similar initiative I commend the Minister for the haste with in this Parliament. The Opposition does not oppose the bill. House of the benefits which the bill will Mr Speaker, the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) seeks by means of this bill to amend in particular a certain section of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910-1961. It is remarkable that of all the things in that act that cry out for amendment the Minister has selected only onethat dealing with the powers, privileges and immunities of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory. I do not think that the Minister will deny-indeed , I think that everybody will agree-that the members of the Legislative Council bave been crying out time and time again for amendments, not only of the section now to be amended, but also of other sections of the principal act. I could recite a dozen or more instances were it not for a ruling just given by you, Sir, which confines me to the limits of this bill-limit s to whioh attention was directed by the Minister himself. It seems that he is being mighty touchy. On an occasion like this, when we have an opportunity to air quite a few of our grievances concerning the Northern Territory (Administration) Act, we are to be prevented from doing so as a result of an objection taken by the Minister. The Opposition does not oppose the bill but we do argue that it is not right to give Legislative Council. We are concerned with the expanding privileges of the council and if for a short period nominated as well as elected members come within the scope of the proposal we shall not raise any objection, but a case can be made for objecting to granting such powers to nominated members. One must remember that the Legislative Council is dominated by nominated and not elected members. In his second-reading speech the Minister, when referring to the origin of the bill, statedIt is the result of a resolution passed by the Legislative Council last year, requesting me to promote and carry in the Commonwealth Parliament legislation to establish the powers of the Legislative Council to compel the attendance of witnesses, their submission to examination, the production of documents, etc., before the council or committees of the council. which he has taken note of this resolution of the Legislative Council and I remind the",40,Northern Territory

104,Mr Nelson (Northern Territory) [5.29].,"confer in giving the council the power to compel the attendance of witnesses, their submission to examination and the production of documents. This has always been a problem because in the past certain Commonwealth departments have refused at times to permit their officers to produce evidence and to submit to examination before committees. We know that such departments as the Department of Health, the Department of Works, Postmaster-General's Department and Attorney-General's Department are independent of the Northern Territory Administration and are therefore outside the scope of the Legislative Council. It is true that a member of the Attorney General's Department is a member of the Legislative Council but the other departments are not represented in any way. At one time the Department of Health was represented and on another occasion the Department of Works was represented but those departments now have no representation. Apparently they felt that departmental interests would conflict at times with the functions of the Legislative Council so they withdrew from it. If the council receives the privileges and powers which this bill seeks to give it I hope that Commonwealth departmental officers will be compelled to produce documents, to submit to examination and otherwise to assist the Legislative Council. Another matter I want to raise is this: What will happen when select committees arrive at decisions by virtue of the powers which will be conferred on them by this bill? Often reports of such committees are thrown in the waste paper basket. If these reports are still to be disregarded the granting of powers and privileges by this bill is nothing but a waste of time. I should like the Minister to tell us how many reports of select committees of the Legislative Council have been acted upon. As my deputy leader has stated, we do not oppose the bill because we are glad that the powers and scope of the Legislative Council are to be extended even in such a small measure. We hoped to have an opportunity to debate more fully the functions of the Legislative Council and to refer to those matters which impinge upon the council's privileges and powers but we have been prevented from doing so. I have nothing further to add beyond repeating that the bill will give the council a greater degree of power than it has at present. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: The bill. move That the following new clause be added to the bill:"" 4. The principal act is amended by omitting section 4Y."" If this amendment is carried it will remove the most odious and otiose section of the principal act by which the Governor General may disallow an ordinance to which the Administrator has already assented. This is the irony of the position: The Administrator only assents to a bill for an ordinance of the Legislative Council if the Minister agrees to it. Under section 4Y of the principal act the Governor General, on the advice of the Ministry, can overrule something which the Minister has already approved. Order! I rule that the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is out of order as it is not within the title of the bill or related to the subject-matter of the bill. Mr Chairman, or shall I move dissent from your ruling forthwith? of the Opposition may state his reasons and then if I still rule against him he may move dissent from my ruling. ment I have moved falls within the long title of the bill, which is in these termsA bill for an act relating to the powers, privileges and immunities of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory.

I have submitted, Mr Chairman, that the amendment which I have moved falls within the long tide of the bill. It concerns the powers of the Legislative Council because, if my amendment were carried, the powers of the Legislative Council would be augmented. Now, Sir, I imagine that you have in mind the phrase which occurs in clause 2, which inserts a new section 4SA into the principal act which would give the Legislative Council power to make ordinancesdeclaring the powers (other than legislative powers), privileges and immunities of the Legislative Council. That is, Sir, you are contending for a meaning in the long title which would make these parenthetic words ""other than legislative powers"" pure surplusage. To put it in another way, if the word "" powers "" has the restricted meaning which you are disposed to give it there is no need to cut the meaning of the word down by putting in parenthesis "" other than legislative powers "". If the powers do not include legislative powers then you do not have to say that the word objection to the ruling in writing)"" powers"" means "" other than legislative powers"". This is a perfect illustration of a legal principle which is so well established as to be trite. It is expressio unius, exclusio alterius. I would agree that the amendment does not come within the new section 4SA to be inserted by clause 2; but I do contend that it comes within the long title. The word ""powers"" in the long title inArmitage, cludes "" any other legislative powers "" given Beaton, N . L . to this Parliament or any others given to the Benson, S. I .

I would not agree with him that the words in parenthesis here are not necessary. I would say that in determining whether or not an amendment is within the title of the bill the Chair has to decide the meaning and scope of the words in the title. The key words in the title, to my mind, are ""Powers, Privileges and Immunities"". I am of opinion that the words must be taken together and that they have, and can only have, the limited meaning which exactly similar words have in section 49 of the Constitution providing for the privileges of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The legislative powers of the Commonwealth Parliament are expressly stated in section 51 of the Constitution. In this case clause 2 of the bill makes it quite clear that the bill does not relate in any way to legislative powers, which are specifically excluded. The word ""powers"" cannot be divorced from the whole and considered as haying a separate definition which would allow an amendment outside the limited title of the bill to be moved.

Debate resumed from 4th October (vide That the bill be now read a second time. first bill I handled in this House on behalf of the Australian Labour Party was for the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act 1956, which the present bill amends. I am delighted to see that the bill's significant Government. Public enterprise in which amendment is to improve the borrowing limits available to the commission, which I said six years ago would be necessary. The commission operates a highly efficient and profitable socialist enterprise. I propose to give some examples of its efficiency and its profitability. First, the cost per ton of cargo it carries has fallen from £2 14s. 5d. in 1958 to £2 Os. l i d . in 1962, a fall of 25 per cent. This cost could fall even further with fleet improvements and greater access to funds. These reductions which have already taken place occurred in a period of heavy competition from other forms of transportimproved surface transport between Australian ports by rail, road and air. Secondly, apart from an upward adjustment following the basic wage decision of 1958, there has been no general rise in freight rates charged. In some cases, it has been possible for the Australian National Line, which is the operating instrumentality of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission, to National Line and its achievements, which I reduce its charges. roll-on roll-off vessels, there has been an average reduction of at least 20 per cent, in freight rates. Private enterprise was subsidized to the extent of £200,000 a year on the Melbourne to Devonport run. The Australian National Line operates as a commercial proposition on this run without any subsidy and in addition it has reduced freights on this run. The commission's last report showed that there had also been a reduction in the cost of forwarding goods on pallets or in containers to Darwin and for shipment of copper from Rockhampton to Port Kembla. Thirdly, the net profit of the commission after tax in the last financial year was almost £1,400,000. This represented a return on capital of over 8 per cent. Not only is it the cheapest line on the Australian coast, it is also the most profitable line. In the five and a half years of its operations, the line has made profits of £12,600,000. from Labour administration. all Commonwealth enterprises since the last war, most of them established by the Labour the Commonwealth has participated since the war has been invariably profitable. These profits are not bad for a shipping line which the Government wanted to sell and which no private enterprise wanted to buy. The line, of course, was not established in 1956, but during the war. The act was passed in 1956. Fourthly, the line has the only modern and efficient fleet on the Australian coast. At the end of last year, the average age of vessels belonging to the line was eight years; the average age of other vessels on the Australian coast was double that. The expansion of the line has been financed entirely from retained profits and reserves without any calls being made upon the Commonwealth Treasury for additional funds. The value of the fleet has increased from £16,800,000 in June, 1957, to £26,900,000 at the end of last June.

128,Mr Whitlam,"It is in keeping withremarkable in view of two facts. The first is that its operations are tied to those of its competitors. The public operator, the Australian National Line, has been fettered in all its ancillary operations. Competition by the line is not fostered but curbed. It is the only operator on the Australian coast which is not free to accept bookings of passengers or cargo. It is unable to undertake stevedoring operations and it is the only operator which is unable to pick up and deliver goods at the warehouse or factory itself. All these operations of the Australian National Line are placed in the hands of its competitors. The second fact is that its access to funds has been much too restricted, as the present amending bill demonstrates. In 1956, the Opposition pointed out that a maximum overdraft of £1,000,000 was inadequate. I said on that occasionThe legislation provides a limit of £1,000,000 on the temporary overdraft which it may secure. It is not enough for the commission to carry out any of its obligations in a satisfactory manner. coasting trade. I am not suggesting that it The Minister has given convincing reasons why the overdraft limit should be raised from £1,000,000 to £5,000,000 and convincing reasons why that would have enabled the line to carry on its operations with greater initiative and greater responsibility since 1956. The regularly in voyages between the States. But it is not allowed to engage in all such voyages. A clear case at present in the mind of the Australian public is that of coastal tankers. In the last ten years, the Menzies Government has by-passed the industrial safeguards in the Navigation Act by granting exemptions to all tankers on the Australian coast. The Constitution gives this Parliament the power to make laws with respect to trade between the States, and this Parliament has passed the Navigation Act which requires that the crews of vessels operating in the coasting trade be paid Australian award rates. This is not a matter of racial prejudice but of industrial safeguard. It does not matter of what race the crews are; it is important that they should all operate under Australian award conditions. The number of exemptions from the Australian award conditions, but the MinisNavigation Act has scandalously increased ter has exempted every such tanker until in tbe last ten years, since oil refineries were now. There is no need for him to continue established in AustraUa. The scale of this scandal is revealed in replies to questions on notice which the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Opperman) has given me in the last few weeks. He has told me that no continuing permits had been granted to tankers in 1951 but eleven continuing permits were granted in 1961. He has also told me that single voyage permits rose from 48 to 134 in those ten years. In answer to a question I put to him without notice, the Minister refused to undertake that he would grant no more continuing permits or single voyage permits exempting tankers from Australian award conditions. He also , refused to take steps to ensure that in the I near future all tankers in the Australian coasting trade, wherever built, should operate under conditions laid down in the Navigation Aot for the last generation and more. It is true that the Commonwealth Parliament cannot make private shipping companies build tankers for the Australian is desirable or necessary that the Commonwealth Parliament or the Commonwealth Government should try to make private shipping companies build tankers to engage in the Australian coasting trade. The Government could, with more justification, require the oil companies, all of which line is at present engaged import crude oil to Australia and refine it in refineries on the Australian coast, and ship it around the Australian coast in foreign tankers, to operate Australian ships, to build and charter Australian ships, or at least operate their ships under Australian award conditions. In fact, they would all have to do so if this Government had not exempted every tanker on the coast from the operations of the law of the land. The Government is empowered, under the act which the Parliament passed in 1956, to build tankers, to charter tankers, to operate tankers. Does anybody suggest that the tanker fleet is not a profitable one? Does anybody suggest that the tanker fleet will not be required during the foreseeable future, and that Australia will not require more and more fuel of all varieties? Australia can build every such ship. The law requires every tanker to operate under such exemptions. There is every opportunity for him under the present act, and there is every industrial and economic justification, to see that the Australian National Line goes into tanker operation and construction. I wish to pass now from the operations of the Australian National Line on the Australian coast to its operations overseas. It is not generally realized that under sections 15 and 16 of the principal act of 1956, the commission, through the Australian National Line, can operate in international trade. It does so spasmodically, I am suggesting that it should do so regularly. ably? depending, of course, on how profitability is measured. Qantas does. The Australian National Line has operated completely profitably in its coastal operations, despite its handicaps. seas people who operate tankers on the Australian coast. There is no protection, when it comes to these costs, as regards the Australian National Line. That line has in fact competed thoroughly satisfactorily on every route on which other lines are prepared to operate. It has provided a service on some routes on which nobody else is prepared to operate, particularly around the northern coast of this continent. It has pioneered routes and methods of conveyance, to Tasmania, for instance, which no other company had the initiative to consider or to introduce. Why should we fear that the Australian National Line would not operate effectively overseas? It has been a thoroughly successful organization in all traditional operations, and in all those operations which it has been allowed to pioneer. Now, Sir, I propose to pass to some of the arguments for an Australian overseas line. I do not have to call in aid politicians on this subject. I do not have to quote persons in this Parliament, on either side, or their supporters. I can go to disinterested or even academic persons who are interested in Australia's economy, and particularly in its trade. It will be remembered by honourable members that Sir John Crawford, a former head of the Department of Trade, said recently at Sydney UniversityWe may need to recast our shipping policies. He was speaking in the context of overseas trade, and he spoke particularly of the effect of the European Common Market upon our traditional avenues of trade and means of conveyance for that trade. The former First Assistant Secretary of the Department of Trade, Mr Eric McClintock, who resigned at about the same time as Sir John Crawford resigned his post, said in the June issue of the "" Australian Quarterly ""It cost too much to deliver our products to Asian markets. Australian manufacturers face a herculean task if they are to be expected to manufacture at a price which will carry freights which are often 60 per cent, higher than the freights paid by their Japanese competitors. Those are two statements by persons who, by their positions in academic and commercial and Public Service circles, command respect for their opinions. The cost of our overseas freights is becoming more and more important in a period such as that which we have passed through in the last ten years, when our balance-of-payments position has been deteriorating. We have paid our way, of course, in the last decade only because of the inflow of capital or, more particularly, because overseas investors have not repatriated their dividends. We have been using capital moneys to pay our current expenses. Over the last ten years our current account in our balance of payments has been £1,600,000,000 to Australia's disadvantage. The freight costs have represented a very large proportion of this. In 1960-61 our transport costs, solely on imports, were £157,000,000. Last year they were £154,000,000. Some of this, of course, is recouped by overseas ships purchasing goods in Australian ports. which trade to Australia purchase some goods in Australian ports, whether they are Australian-owned or foreign-owned ships. So the local purchases would not affect the position if that overseas shipping were to be replaced by Australian-owned shipping. But the cost to our balance of payments represented by the transport costs on our",45,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962

134,Mr Whttlam,"Of course any shipsimports is only half the story. Australia also had to forgo similar amounts before earning export income. We get less for our exports because we have to pay foreign shipping to carry those exports. Australia's position is unique in the world. We have the largest navigable coastline of any country. We are one of the very few countries whose trade must go wholly by sea. Britain, Japan and New Zealand are in that position, but how many other countries depend entirely on sea transport for all their never had to subsidize civil aviation. trade? Again, Australia can build, or could have built, every ship which operates in overseas trade to and from Australia. Whatever the size and whatever the type of ship, it could have been built in Australia. The facilities of Australian shipyards would perthat to build an Australian overseas fleet mit the building of 40,000-ton ships without any extension of those facilities, and without ment which his leader always brings in at any new skills being required. ber is singularly helpful. He has been feeding these matters to me which otherwise I thought may have been out of order. The argument that is very often used against an Australian overseas line is that which has been put by the honourable member's leader, the Minister for Trade, and Leader relies on extreme propositions. He computes the number of ships trading to and from Australia at present, and the tonnage that they represent, and he then puts two propositions. He says, "" What would it cost to build all these ships now, and, secondly, what would it cost for Australians to operate all these ships now? "" No trading country has all its own trade in its own hands. It is true that the converse applies to Australia because Australia is the only country in the world which has all its trade in foreigners'hands. There is no country in the world which has all its trade in its own hands. The ideal position is a balance where every country carries half its imports and half its exports. Again, no line is completely built at one time. This is a gradual process, but a steady process which we advocate. We say that Australian shipyards, which are not fully engaged at the moment, many of which, in fact, have no orders at the moment, and most of the remainder of which have only their current orders, could, with their present men, machines and installations, build a very great number of ships which would be suitable for our overseas trade. aviation by £150,000,000 in the last ten years and there is no complaint about that. doubt that that is so; but externally we have member for McPherson for having given me the opportunity to deal with the objection would cost a lot of money. It is an arguthe drop of a hat. Let me quote from some of the reports which are made to us by the primary industry bodies. Incidentally, every export marketing authority established since the war in Australia was established by a Labour government. I hope that that will not be held to their discredit by honourable members of the Country Party; but let me recall to them some of the reports that those bodies have made to this Parliament within the last few months concerning our freight costs overseas. The report of the Australian Meat Board for the last financial year stated that to ship canned meat to the United Kingdom from Australia cost 224s. 8d. per ton, but that from New Zealand the charge was 162s. 6d. The distance to the market is the same, but the Australian product is charged 50 per cent, more! exchange? I will give all others, as comparable figures. If the honourable member for Gippsland read the export marketing reports he would find out these things for himself. honourable member reads them; apparently he has forgotten what they contain.

145,Mr Whttlam,"I accept that theown flag trading between New Zealand and the United Kingdom. New Zealand award conditions are as high as Australia's, but the freight from New Zealand to the United Kingdom is only 66 per cent, of that charged on Australia's products taken to the same market over the same distance under comparable award conditions. Let me quote from the annual report of the Australian Dried Fruits Control Board for the last financial year. The Board said that as the Australian people were so dependent on export income for their living standards, the time had come when Australia as a whole must accept the responsibility for industry freights. The chairman of the board, at the export convention held at Canberra in May, 1960, said it is essential to subsidize freights. Honourable members will recall how the Dried Fruits Control Board quoted the increase on freights for its products carried to the United Kingdom in the same season when freights from California to the United Kingdom had dropped. The reason is, of course, that America operates its own merchant marine, whioh is the largest in the world. great number of American seamen and ships operate under the flags of Panama, Liberia, Honduras and Costa Rica. Those seamen are paid American award rates and the shipping companies are not subsidized by any of those flag countries nor by America. The ships operate quite profitably around the world. They operate under the flags of those other countries because, by so doing, they do not have to pay as much taxation as they would if registered in America. But America pays award rates to its seamen and officers which are four times as high as those paid on Australian ships. It is astounding to hear these arguments about award rates. The Minister for Trade makes comparisons between the United Kingdom and Australia or Japan and Australia. When it comes to award conditions, admittedly it costs much less in wages to operate a Japanese or British ship than it would cost to operate an Australian ship. We need not go into all the reasons why this is so, but we have frequently complained in this country, and in this Parliament, that Britain, by its cheap food policy, at our expense, and Japan, by its cheap wages policy, at our expense, have operated unfairly against us. Surely they are not the examples we should take when we want to compute the practicability, profitability or utility of an Australian overseas shipping line. If one compares Australian award rates with those of France or any of the Common Market countries, or with the Scandinavian countries, one finds that there is not much difference in the rates for seamen. In fact, some Australians are paid less than their opposite numbers in the ships of Common Market or Scandinavian countries. Let me return to the report of the Australian Canned Fruits Board for the last financial year. The report further statedFor general cargo between Australia and the United Kingdom and Continent . . . a 5 per cent, increase is to operate shortly. This has been made more unpalatable with the recent announcement that Californian canners will have the benefit of a 20 per cent, reduction in freight rates on principal varieties of canned fruits shipped to the United Kingdom after the 23rd July this year. How is it that the freight goes up 5 per cent, here and goes down 20 per cent, between our chief competitor and our principal market? I have referred to three of the export marketing board reports which are made to this Parliament. These have all been made within the.last few months, but honourable members will find that for years past, and in the case of every export marketing board, the theme has been the same, namely, that the rise in freights between Australia and London has been greater than between any other supplier and London. All roads lead to London, so far as Australian trade is concerned, but the toll rise is more rapid and greater on the road from Australia to London than on the road from anywhere else to London. I turn now to industrial exports and speak, first, of steel. Australia produces the cheapest steel in the world. Australia is situated in the midst of a great arc of countries which all import steel and which all have to pay more for steel in the countries whence they import it than they have to pay for Australian steel in Australia. The difference lies in the freight they have to pay between Australia and their ports",48,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
146,Mr Barnes,A t a terrific loss.,49,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
147,Mr Nixon,It is subsidized heavily too.,49,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
148,Mr Vrtdtlam,"On the contrary; acompared with the freight they have to pay between other suppliers, three times as far away, and their ports. Honourable members will recall that last year, when speaking, I think, to the Estimates, I quoted figures given by Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, showing that the freight on steel between Europe and Singapore was 130s. Australian per ton, and between Australia and Singapore, from 140s. to 145s. per ton a greater amount for a third of the distance. Again, the freight on steel between the United Kingdom and Europe and the west coast of America was £A.6 6s. per ton, but between Australia and the west coast of America, a shorter distance, it was £A.7 lis. 6d. per ton. On many occasions, I have heard the Minister for Trade abuse the British Government for its trading practices. But I have yet to hear him offer a word of criticism of the British shipping companies which have failed the Australian exporters, primary, industrial and mineral. It is not just the British Government which is to blame; it is the British companies, still more. The great trouble with our overseas shipping services up till now, as we are realizing in the aftermath of Britain's appliposition that it is prepared to use public cation to join the European Common Market in July of last year and its approaches to the Common Market a year before that, is that our existing shipping arrangements tie us to the declining markets of Europe. Shipping services should bs complementary to export promotion. They should assist, not hinder, our export drive. At present, shipping places us at an initial competitive disadvantage. It may have been justifiable for us to have ment supporters. been dependent on British shipping, credit and insurance as long as Britain took over 50 per cent, of our exports, as she did before the war when all roads led to London. It is sheer stupidity for us to rely on British shippers when we export less than 20 per cent, of our exports to Great Britain. There are no other countries in the world which depend entirely oti foreign shippers for their overseas trade, as I have pointed out, and there are very few countries in the world, as I have also pointed out, which depend entirely on shipping for their foreign trade. I know that there are arguments against an overseas shipping line conducted by Australia. I have anticipated some of them. I do not know whether people are timid in their economics or deficient in their patriotism in this regard. Listening to his answers, one would think that the Minister for Trade would rather have Australian ships fail in overseas trade than have his pet theories upset and have the practice of a long ministerial life exposed. On one occasion he saidI cannot think of any more devastating situation for Australian export industries . . . than to have it demonstrated that our own line was costing more . . . to carry goods than an overseas line was proposing to charge. What an assumption to make! Tasmanians will not believe such an assumption when it comes to shipping in the hands of the Australian Government. The people in the northern part of this continent are not going to make such an assumption. Australians who travel by air by Qantas, as they mostly do, know that such an assumption is not valid. But the Minister for Trade is clearly determined that a government-owned shipping line should not succeed. He is still more determined not to run the risk of its succeeding. The Government so realizes the weakness of its servants in order to provide Government members with a case to bolster their support of the present shipping arrangements. In all fairness, I must say that the Minister to-day gave the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) and, a couple of hours ago, also gave me, this publication which I have here. I have not been able to look through it fully. They did not get it any earlier. I promised you that, and I carried out my promise. ter for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Opperman) for that information. I do not think that he previously said that Government supporters had not received this any earlier. If he did make that clear I apologize for misrepresenting him. Questions based on newspaper reports were asked of the Minister as to whether he would make this publication available to us. He said that he would, and he has. It appears to be a very much more factual and reasonable document than one would expect from the",49,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
149,Mr Opperman,Neithe r have Govern,50,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
150,Mr Whitlam,"I thank the Minisargument put by the Minister for Trade on this subject. There is information here which will be useful to us all. I want to make it clear, as I said in answer to the interjections of the honourable member for McPherson( Mr Barnes), that the Australian Labour Party does not envisage a large and spectacular expansion of overseas shipping operations, but a steady increase as opportunities present themselves and as needs arise. Even a small overseas line and the threat of expansion would have a most beneficial effect. The Australian Labour Party says that Australia should participate in international shipping, including the chartering of ships. The Labour Party says that Australia should now do what in the last generation every other trading country in the world learned that it must do. Everybody is in step on this matter except Australia. The expansion of overseas shipping would assist our shipyards. Here again, the Labour Party does not envisage an unlimited or excessive shipyard programme, but a sufficient programme to maintain our shipyards at their most efficient level of production. They are well below that level at present, and successive Tariff Board reports have demonstrated that to the Parliament. I regret that many of the recommendations of the Tariff Board have not been carried out. Honourable members will recollect that a couple of years ago the Tariff Board recommended that the Government should confer with New Zealand, which does not build ships, concerning the building of ships, and the repair and servicGovernment supporters. The existing act ing of ships under the New Zealand flag, in Australian shipyards. It further suggested, at a time when both the "" Wanganella "" and the "" Monowai"" were still operating, that the Government should consider operating a trans-Tasman shipping line in association with New Zealand. The Government abandoned that project. So the only Tasman shipping now is either New Zealand or foreign. There is clearly a case for our establishing and operating an ANZAC shipping line across the Tasman. The Australian National Line is prepared to engage in overseas trade, and does so from time to time. Many ships are idle at present. With excess capacity, the line sometimes finds it more profitable to engage in overseas trade than to lay up ships. Its annual reports since 1957 show that certain overseas operations have proved profitable. In 1957, the line reported. . . tramp voyages completed to 30th July, 1957, have shown fair margins; from every port visited good reports have been received on the keen attention to business shown by the masters; the steady bearing of the crews; and the general working efficiency of the ships. Subsequent reports have shown that despite low tramp freights the line has been able to participate in overseas trade from time to time-suga r from Queensland to New Zealand, sleepers from the eastern States to India, pig iron from Australia to Japanpost-war, I hasten to assure honourable members-and minerals from New Caledonia to Australia. In present circumstances, the line does not find it unprofitable to participate in some overseas operations. It made 25 overseas voyages last financial year, but they are spasmodic, not regular. The Government provides all sorts of export aids such as trade commissioners, advertising, promotion, and tax incentives, yet it refuses to face up to the greatest handicap to our export trade-the lack of an overseas shipping line in Australian hands. Overseas shippers have seized on the tax incentive to exporters to raise their shipping freights and so deprive exporters of the benefit which the tax incentive was designed to give. The problem of exploitation by overseas shipping companies is a nettle which has to be grasped. It will not be grasped by faint-hearted and defeatist already recognizes the need for the Australian National Line to assist in noneconomic developmental runs in the Australian coastal trade. It must recognize a similar need in international trade. The"" Petroleum Gazette"", in its issue for September, 1962, statedAustralia is one of the few maritime countries in which shipowners do not enjoy some form of subsidy or taxation concession to help to bridge the gap between original purchase price and eventual replacement cost of ships. Representations for such concessions have recently been made to the Government by Australian shipowners. We do not know the result yet. Other countries subsidize their overseas shipping companies. The United States of America is the chief example. subsidize by means of generous depreciation and taxation concessions. The Australian National Line has not participated greatly in international trade, however, because it is engaged in commercial operations and must pay dividends and taxes. The taxes have amounted to f 11,000,000 in the last 5 i years. Many of our primary products are subsidized in one form or another-som e directly and some indirectly. It is likely that with Britain's entry into the European Common Market some will have to be subsidized even more. A subsidy on overseas shipping to reduce freights and to service new markets would be a better economic proposition for Australia and our export industries than direct subsidies to individual industries which were affected. Are Australian wages really so high that we cannot participate in overseas trade? I have already pointed out that American seamen's wages are four times as high as ours and that wages in western Europe are much the same as ours yet these countries operate overseas ships. allegedly high wages there has been very little increase-indeed , there has been some decrease-in freight rates on the Australian coast in the last six years. Further, wages represent only one-quarter of the costs. The Government estimates that payment of the 39 seamen on the "" P. J. Adams"" at Australian rates would involve a subsidy of only £40,000 a year. Such a subsidy for the bridging of the gap between the ""highcost "" Australian labour and the "" low-cost"" foreign labour which is being employed does not seem particularly large. Australia's stevedoring costs also are no higher than are those of other countries. On this point, I quote Mr Syme, the chairman of directors of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, who has saidAlthough we are not aware of actual stevedoring costs in the United Kingdom and Europe we doubt whether they are less than those applying at the Newcastle Steelworks wharf or at the Port Kembla Inner Harbour products berth. Also we are of the opinion that our loading rates at these pay taxes and contribute profits to the Treapoints would compare favourably with those in UK./Europe. This Government believed that the Australian National Line, operating on the Australian coast, would not pay, and endeavoured to sell it. The Government's Many countries judgment of the efficiency and profitability of the line was badly astray. Its judgment about venturing into international trade may be quite as bad. The only other international transport field in which the Commonwealth can operate is aviation. In particularly difficult years, Qantas Empire Airways Limited has proved to be outstandingly successful in world competition without a subsidy. It has had no loss in any year. The costs of the Australian National Line are falling rapidly-2 5 per cent, in four years. With improved port facilities in Australia and with some rationalization of the wharf facilities provided by three dozen different harbour authorities in this country, stevedoring costs would fall by a similar proportion. It is quite clear, Sir, that the arguments for an Australian overseas shipping line and greater use of chartered ships have been unanswerable for years. The pleas and the comments by all our export industries and all our export marketing boards have made this plain to all honourable Despite our members and to all interested members of the public for years past. The trading position in which we are likely to find ourselves in the next few years of the present decade as a result of Britain's probable membership of the European Common Market will make it all the more necessary that we have our own ships to service our own exports. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Deputy Speaker, I am glad that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) has supported this bill and has paid tribute to the efficiency of the Australian National Line, particularly the efficiency that it has demonstrated since 1956. The line has done an extraordinarily good job. The feature that is of most interest is that the line, since it was put on a competitive basis and compelled to endure proper competition and to sury, has succeeded. How often when a national shipping line was operated by labour governments were losses made? Hardly ever has a national shipping line operated by a Labour government been able",50,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
151,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock).,,52,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
152,Mr Howson (Fawkner) [8.45],"Mrto make a profit. Only because the present line has been made to compete, to pay taxes and to earn profits has it been successful. The events of the last three or four years have demonstrated the considerable success of the Australian National Line. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also said that he was pleased that in 1956 he foreshadowed an increase in the demand for working capital for the line. He may seem just at the moment to have been right. But it is interesting to note that the Minister Let us consider it from the standpoint of for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Opperman), in his second-reading speech, made it quite clear that the increase in overdraft limit proposed is to provide the normal facility of access to funds to meet temporary peak demands only. So it looks as if there will be only a temporary increase in the overdraft limit. In a few years' time, the limit will probably be back again to the present level and the forecast made in 1956 by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will be proved to have been wrong. The honourable gentleman also said that Qantas Empire Airways Limited has been very efficient, and he mentioned the way in which this Government has shown that it can conduct an airline more efficiently than an Australian Labour Party government could do. I wonder how profitable Qantas would be to-day if it were forced to use aircraft built in Australia. What would its costs be and what subsidies would be required? We know that if we ask the Australian National Line to use ships built in Australia we have to subsidize the construction of the vessels by 33i per cent. Since the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has raised wider issues, let us have a look at some of them. BeforeI turn to them, however, I want to say that I commend the bill because it demonstrates again the way in which the Australian National Line, put on a competitive basis, is operating profitably. At this point, let me take the Deputy Leader of the Opposition up on a matter that he raised. Early in his speech, he said that he was pleased that the line was making profits, but towards the end of his speech he suggested that the Government should be paying a subsidy to enable the line to undertake unprofitable ventures. Which does he want-profit s or subsidies? I believe that this line, rightly, is required to make profits. When it is required to make profits, it is successful. If we start paying subsidies and try to make the line uncompetitive, so that it will have no interest in costs, we shall get back to the same sort of situation that we had when the Australian Labour Party was in office and tried to run the line with increasing losses. Why does the Opposition want the Australian National Line to operate on overseas routes? Let us consider this matter as if each of us was a shareholder in the line. the Australian taxpayer, because we, the people who pay the taxes, surely must have regard for the costs that would be incurred in overseas operations. Let us consider the matter from the standpoint of, say, the chairman of the board of directors of the line. Quite rightly, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, the Australian National Line has operated overseas, and has done sO profitably. What is more, it is not fettered in any way in undertaking any venture so long as at the end of the year it earns a profit. It is not fettered in entering into the tanker business, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition indicated that it should do. If it believes that it can earn profits in tankers, it may enter that field. The Government does not stop it from doing so. The Government hopes that the line will find avenues for profit anywhere in the world. The line has looked overseas successfully at certain times. I call to mind the time immediately after the Suez crisis when charter rates were high. The line earned profits by carrying railway sleepers from Eden to India because at that time it had a ship of the right size available to enter the port of Eden. Now let us look at some of the ways in which the Australian National Line has tried to compete but has failed to obtain an order. One would think that the line would be particularly successful in handling bulk cargoes or anything for which a general purpose cargo non-refrigerated ship could be used, but let us look at two recent instances. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition mentioned the carriage of bulk sugar from Australia to New Zealand and from Queensland to Europe. Recently we tried to get an order for the carriage of 10,000 tons of bulk sugar to Europe. Overseas competitors quoted a freight rate of £5 Australian a ton so thc freight would amount to £50,000. On the basis of Australian rates the cost of taking the sugar to Europe would be £57,330, a loss of £7,330 on that one voyage. If no return cargo were available there would be a further loss of £30,000 for the return trip, in all a loss on that one voyage of £37,000. Another case mentioned related to the carriage of 50,000 live sheep from Victoria to Kuwait. The cost of transporting this cargo on an Australian ship would have been £337,500 whereas the cost on an overseas ship was £127,500. With such differences in costs can we really expect the Australian taxpayer to bear the burden of a subsidy? I believe that the important thing is to ask the line to compete where it can do so profitably. That raises this question: Should we do a job ourselves when we can get some one else to do it much more cheaply? Would it not be better to use the proposed subsidy in other industries where the return would be greater? In my speech during the Budget debate in August this year I pointed out that for an investment of £35,000,000 in coal ports in New South Wales and Queensland we could increase our coal exports by £10,000,000 a year. A similar investment in Australian-built ships for an overseas line would produce a balance-of-payments savings of £2,000,000. Surely it is better for ferred to the carriage of meat. It costs the Government to invest in the most .0216 pence per lb. to transport frozen economical way rather than in the most meat from Australia to London whereas the uneconomical way which has been proposed cost from New Zealand is almost identical by the Opposition. Even if we granted subsidies to the Zealand has an overseas shipping line her amount that I have mentioned we still international freight rates are lower than would succeed only in reducing our freights ours, but the cost of transporting frozen to existing overseas rates. The proposed meat is almost identical. subsidies would have to be even greater if we were to reduce our freights below overseas rates, which apparently is the Opposiown figures which you have worked out tion's objective. What is the reason for or did you obtain them from some source entering into the overseas shipping business which can be checked? unprofitably? Is it to reduce freights? Is it to save foreign exchange? Is it to employ more Australian seamen? Is it to help our able to every honourable member in the Ausdefence needs? Or is it merely for reasons tralian "" Year-Book"" and from the of prestige and patriotism? If, as was foreCommonwealth Bureau of Census and shadowed by the Deputy Leader of the Statistics. The cost of transporting frozen Opposition, it is a matter of prestige or patmeat from the Argentine to London is riotism, I ask each member of the Opposi.0336 pence per lb. compared with the tion to state how much the Australian taxAustralian cost of .0216 pence and the payer should be asked to pay to engage in South African cost of .0276 pence. In this a patriotic venture. There is no prestige case also the average cost is much higher for Australia in doing a job badly and unthan the Australian rate. economically, as is likely to be the case. The only real prestige lies in doing a job properly and profitably. There is no point in doing a job for any other reason. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition mentioned certain overseas costs so let me refer to them. Are our overseas freights exorbitant? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to Australian canned fruits and canned meats. He compared the cost of transporting meat to London from Australia and from New Zealand. I have taken out some figures relating to costs between Melbourne and London, Wellington and London, Buenos Aires and London and Cape Town and London. 1 have based thefigureson the cost in sterling for each 100 miles of the voyage. Let me deal with apples first. It costs 1.316 pence sterling to transport one case of apples for each 100 miles of the voyage from Melbourne to London. From Wellington to London the cost is 1.140 pence, from Buenos Aires to London thc cost is 1.940 pence and from Cape Town to London the cost is 1.710 pence. The average of those costs is 1.542 pence a case, so the Australian charge is well below the average. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition reat .0212 pence. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition claimed that because New Mr £. James Harrison -Are these your",52,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
153,Mr Howson,"Thes efiguresare availTurning to wool, it costs .0292 pence a lb. to transport wool from Australia to London whereas the cost is .0293 pence from New Zealand and .0230 pence from tbe Argentine. Again in this instance the Australian and New Zealand costs are almost identical, so again the claim of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that because New Zealand has an overseas line her freight rates are lower than ours is not supported. If he considers our bulk cargoes such as wool, meat and apples-ou r big exports-h e will see how his claims have been disproved. He mentioned also the cost of steel and they should be repeated. The requirement, in doing so read from a speech that he if we tried to carry all our own cargoes made last year, but he did not bother to overseas, would be 500 ships costing at check his statements because he said that least a total of £1,000,000,000. the cost of transporting steel from Great Britain to Singapore was 145s. Australian. He was wrong. The cost is 145s. sterling. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be wise always to check his facts. A fortto carry all our overseas cargoes ourselves night ago, when participating in the debate we would need 500 ships to do it. on housing, he cited certain figures in such a way that, if they were not intended to at all. deceive, they certainly got very close to deceiving. I wish the honourable gentleman would have a look at the comparative costs of carrying steel to the Far East from members opposite should realize where their Australia and from Great Britain. The arguments lead. Honourable members freight on 1 ton of steel sent from opposite have suggested in the past that Australia to Hong Kong is 110s. Australian; Australia should carry all its own cargo. the freight from Great Britain to Hong Kong is 181s. Australian. What is more, I point got the necessary ships. Let us have some out that already 35,000 tons of steel have figures on this, because if the Australian been taken from Australia to Hong Kong taxpayers are going to be asked to carry at these costs. So let the honourable gentlethe burden they are entitled to know what man be quite certain that he is giving tocost will be involved. Let us assume that we day's costs when he is dealing with this carried 5 per cent, of our overseas trade in matter and not quoting from figures that he our own ships and served particularly our got, partly erroneously, six months ago. The next point is whether there is a United States of America. The requirement shortage of shipping to carry our goods would be 28 ships of varying tonnages, overseas. No such shortage has yet been between, say, 3,000 and 10,000 tons. A demonstrated. present freights are too high? freights are comparable to the freights paid by the taxpayers. At the present rate charged shippers in other countries. The of building in our own shipyards it would Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that take twenty years to build those ships. Now our freights were higher than anybody else's. let us compare the cost of operating a ship, In fact, they are below the average charged to other countries shipping goods to Great Britain. He tried to make out that our costs were higher because we did not have an overseas shipping line of our own, but, I repeat, our costs are lower than average. Honourable gentlemen opposite should be quite certain that they have understood the argument of their own Deputy Leader before they try to disprove my argument. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not try to suggest that Australia should make an attempt to carry all its cargoes overseas. I know that the figures in relation to this point have been given before, but I think Mr O'Brien -He did not suggest that suggested it, but I think that honourable However, if we could not do the whole job let us assume that we did part of it and trade with Japan, South-East Asia and the number of those ships would have to be refrigerated, because we have to take compete in those markets.

157,Mr Howson,"I repeat, if we wished",55,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
158,Mr Howson,"I did not say that hesay of 10,000 tons, with costs overseas. Here again let me point out that an Australian 10,000-tonner needs a crew of 37 and costs £718 a day to run. This makes an annual cost of £262,000. A United Kingdom ship of the same size needs a crew of only 26 and costs £508 a day to run, or an annual cost of £185,000. A Greek ship costs only £490 a day to run compared with £508 for a United Kingdom ship and £718 for the Australian ship-and other nations can operate ships even more cheaply. So, even comparing the Australian ship with a United Kingdom ship manned by a European crew, our charges are 41 per cent, higher. To operate those 28 vessels, which would have involved an investment of £95,000,000, would cost £11,700,000 a year. The cost of operating 28 comparable United Kingdom ships is only £8,313,000, so that we would have to provide a subsidy of £3,500,000 a year. Are we to ask the Australian taxpayer to do this? How can we ask him to meet an annual subsidy of £3,500.000? If we had those ships we would save in foreign exchange £6,400,000, but we would have no saving in freights, because I am assuming that we would have the same freights to meet as those against which we are competing at present. In order to lower freights the subsidy would have to be increased. In a nutshell, a saving of £6,400,000 would be made in foreign exchange, but the taxpayer would have to meet a cost of £3,500,000 a year on an investment, made with his money, of nearly £100,000,000. Surely such a drain on our national resources would offset all the other benefits foreshadowed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Can we really, just for some sort of national prestige, expect the Australian taxpayer to meet these high costs? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition alluded to the way in which the national lines of other countries operate. He mentioned particularly national ships in America. the new partnership to look at through-transportaLet honourable members consider for a moment how many American national line ships are laid up at present. It is no use building ships for prestige reasons if they are going to sit alongside the wharfs unable to operate. I suggest that it is time that the efficiency in this industry can be obtained Opposition adopted a more constructive approach to the whole matter of shipping. In the very near future there will be a tremendous revolution in the types of ships used and in the methods of operating ships. The day of tbe completely automatic ship is not far distant. In some cases it is only 20 or 30 years away. There are certainly many forms of automation now coming into use in ships which will reduce crew numbers. The high cost of Australian shipping comes mostly from the high scale of manning. As I have said, an Australian 10,000tonner needs a crew of 37 compared with a crew of 26 required for a similar British vessel. If the aim of the Opposition is saving of exchange and a reduction of freight costs, then I put it to honourable members opposite that they should cooperate with the Government in reducing shipping costs by encouraging the use of automation in ships and encouraging a reduction in crew numbers when automatic devices are part of the equipment of a new ship. That has already been done to an extent in the case of the "" Princess of Tasmania"" and I am glad that there has been an improvement; but there can be a great deal more improvement and even the "" Princess of Tasmania"" could do the job with fewer men than is the case at present. I put it to the House that if Australia is to compete with overseas countries in this industry she will have to do so by means of ships fitted with automatic devices and requiring smaller crews. There is one other way in which the Opposition should look at this problem. There is an interesting paragraph in "" The Times "", of London, of 30th July last. It statesIt is in the liner trade, though, that the greatest gains can be made. An item of general cargo passes through a succession of physical and tinancial frontiers on its way to its destination; the lorry, owned by a private haulier, the dock, operated by an independent trust and manned by private stevedores, the ship, owned by any one of half a dozen shipowners, and so on. The separate physical and financial structure of each section of what should be a unified process makes correlation almost impossible except in the most haphazard fashion. It must be a prime task of tion as a coordinated process. From this, the new initiatives in each section must spring. I suggest that the greatest reduction in freights and the greatest saving in exchange, together with the greatest increase in through materials handling, looking at the goods as taken from door to door and not just their carriage in the ship itself. To an extent this has been done in the "" Princess of Tasmania"" and in certain new ships in the Australian trade which are developing this door-to-door service. But a great deal more must be done, and it needs the co-operation of all bodies concerned. As I said in my speech on the estiniates of the Department of National Development, it must be done by looking at the whole movement of goods-in the case of wool, from the time it leaves the shearing shed until it gets into the mills of various countries; or in the case of meat, from the time it leaves the abattoir until it gets into the supermarkets. Shipping must be regarded as only one part of the process. I believe honourable members opposite must look at the question of examining automatic devices in ships and, if they are installed, must be agreeable to a reduction in the size of crews provided the safety factors are fully considered. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke about increasing efficiency, but there are many ways in which this can be done. I think my suggestion is a much more constructive way of looking at the question -than just to hammer away at the uneconomic National Line operating overseas. If the Opposition could approach this matter along the lines I have suggested I think we could start a new era in the shipping industry. If we go on as the Opposition suggests we will simply be prolonging the end of the old era. gratulate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) on a very fine speech. He spoke as one who knows quite a bit about his subject. I listened to the remarks of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Hill Proprietary Co, Ltd., at Whyalla. Howson) and I cannot agree with much of what he said, because a lot of hisfiguresdo not ring true. Talking about the number of crew for a 5,000-ton or 10,000-ton cargo ship he said that in an Australian ship a crew of 43 would be required whilst 26 would be required in a British ship. That is not right, because 50 Australian seamen would be required and 40 British. I do not know where the honourable member got his figures, but I think he may have got them from Captain Williams, because, when speaking during the Budget debate he quoted figures given to him by Captain Williams. about figures given to you by Captain Williams. Captain Williams to an economic society meeting and they are available to honourable 1 members in the Library. honourable member's figures in respect of wages and the costs of running an overseas line. The honourable member asked why we want an overseas line. We want it because we want to stand on our own feet as other nations do. We want to have our say on what ships come to Australia, what cargoes they shall carry and what freight rates Australia shall pay. At present Australian freight rates and the shipping to and from Australia are controlled by the Overseas Shipping Representatives' Association. They are the people who say what will be done and what will not be done. People from Norway, New York, Germany, the United Kingdom and all parts of the world have a say in what Australia will pay, but Australians do not. We, on this side of the House, believe it is time Australia had a say. I was glad to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition put forward his case so strongly, (n his second-reading speech the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Opperman) saidApart from vessels already on order by tbe Commisison, I recently announced the acquisition by the Commission of the first of the 21,400-ton vessels, to be known as the Musgrave Range currently building at the shipyards of the BrokenI am glad that Australia, through the Government, is building these ships. I congratulate the Government on the fact that we are now building ships capable of carrying huge bulk cargoes, in line with those carried by the ships of the leading nations of the world. Vessels of this class, although primarily intended for the carriage of ironstone around the Australian coast, could easily be used in the overseas trade, especially in the carriage of bulk cereals and phosphate rock.

163,Mr Benson,"That is the source of theoverseas but relies mainly on the other nations of the world to do her fetching and carrying. Nations such as the Scandinavian countries, which are much smaller than Australia, find it very profitable to do this work. The argument that it is too costly to use Australian ships manned by Australian seamen, because their wages are said to be the highest in the world, is unsound. The Scandinavian countries now pay wages and offer conditions comparable with those applying in Australia and, in some cases, higher. Of the bigger nations, America, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, finds it profitable to trade to Australia and at the same time pay wages higher than those paid to Australian seamen. The advent of the Musgrave Range type of ship could be the beginning of a plan to trade overseas. I hope the Government will give consideration to this venture, because surely, holding the title of the eighth trading served. nation of the world, we should act accordingly and have our own ships, as other nations have. It is a national calamity thai the Australian flag is not seen on trading ships overseas. The flag of a nation, seen often enough overseas, is something to be respected and generally shows that the ship showing that flag is capable in its own right of meeting the vessels of other nations in the trade. I hope it will not be long before we see this happening in the case of Australian ships. If that comes about it will be a good thing for this country, especially in view of the probable entry of Britain into the Common Market. I wish to repeat what I said when speaking on the defence estimates. From the defence point of view, it is most important that Australia has commercial ships and ships that could be used in an emergency. Adequate Australian merchant ships can be a new and potent implement for the provision of national gain. We sbould start now and build our own merchant ships and fighting fleets to a standard required by a nation that enjoys the status that we have. We should immediately break into the migrant-carrying trade. We could start in a small way, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said. The honourable member for Fawkner said that we would need SOO ships. Of course we would need SOO ships if we intended to carry all our goods, but no nation has sufficient ships to carry all the goods it exports. Let us make a start by getting into the migrant trade. honourable members why I select this figure. At present, Britain is operating on the Australian run the "" Strathmore, "" Stratheden "", "" Canberra "", "" Iberia "", "" Arcadia "", "" Himalaya "", "" Oriana "", "" Orsova "", "" Orcades "", "" Oronsay"" and "" Orion "". We do not operate any vessels. Italy has the "" Australia "", "" Neptunia "", "" Oceania "", ""Fairsky"", ""Fairsea"", "" Castel Felice"", ""Flavia"", ""Aurelia"", ""Roma"" and "" Sydney"". Greece has two ships, the "" Bretagne"" and the "" Patrix "". The Dutch have, the ""Oranje"", ""Wilhelm Ruys"" ""Zider Kruis"", ""Grootebeer"" and the "" J.V.O."". are well served. We are not. The ships I have mentioned are supplemented by four other ships, making a total in all of some 33 ships operating in the migrant trade to Australia. I believe that we should have six Australian ships in this trade. That is starting in a conservative way, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said. We could easily break into the trade without any financial loss to the country. The ships would be assured of migrants, because they would surely have priority over other ships. The benefit of these ships in time of war has already been explained in the debate on the defence estimates. If merchant ships are vital to a country in time of peace, how much more does a country depend on them in time of war? This is a lesson we do not seem to understand, and I hope that the Minister will keep this in mind and will build a sufficient number of ships. Should the need ever arise, we will then be prepared and we will not have to cry overseas to get some other nation to come to our aid. We should keep in mind that during a war, ships are very had to get. If a nation's commercial ships are of sufficient value in time of war to warrant their support and protection, it is surely necessary that some provision be made for them in time of peace. In order",57,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962

166,Mr Buchanan,We are pretty well,58,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
167,Mr Benson,"But at what cost? Theyto prosper in peace and to ensure adequate defence in war, a nation must maintain two distinctfleets-a merchant fleet and a fighting fleet. These fleets are complementary, one to the other. It is useless and wastful to build up naval forces and at the same time to disregard merchant ships. Most nations subsidize their merchant fleets. I would like the Government to understand this, because the honourable member for Fawkner had quite a lot to say about subsidies. Britain as far back as 1839 subsidized Samuel Cunard so that he could remain in the trans-Atlantic service, and the Cunard line has been subsidized ever since. But when this country is asked to give aid to shipping, there is an outcry from the Government side of the House. It is all right for Britain and for other countries to pay a subsidy, but Australia is not allowed to do so. America, Holland and Japan in various ways have subsidized their shipping, and we in Australia have done so to a very small extent. The Minister will know that we paid £150,000 to a service between Sydney and New Guinea, but that is about all we have done. I would like to direct the Minister's Whyalla, have orders on hand there is adequate attention to an article that appeared in the capacity at the main yards to build over the next "" Sydney Morning Herald"" of 9th Novemfew years all the tankers that would be required ber, 1962, under the heading "" Fenwick to Fleet Replacement"". It statedUnder Federal Government legislation, the importation of vessels under 500-ton gross is prohibited and when vessels of this tonnage are built in Australia, no subsidy is granted. In fairness to owners of smaller vessels this position calls for will consider having some tankers built in some action, directors state. I hope the Government will look into this matter and will give the necessary financial encouragement to the owners of small vessels. Tug-owners are just as entitled to a subsidy as are the owners of vessels such as the "" P. J. Adams "", but the owners of small ships get nothing. ""Hansard"" of 2nd October, 1962, reports that in response to a question asked by the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Hansen), the Minister revealed that between 27th October, 1961, and 9th April, 1962, he gave permission for seven vessels under 500 tons to enter Australia. The vessels came from Holland, the United States, Norway and New Guinea. This seems very unfair. Small shipowners, such as the owners of tugs, are not allowed to import vessels, but they do not receive any subsidy for building in Australia. On the other hand, the Government is pleased to do business with Ampol Petroleum Limited by granting a subsidy of over £1,000,000 for fhe building of the tanker ""P. J. Adams"" at Whyalla, with the proviso that the ship should be registered outside Australia and that Asiatics should be employed as crew members. I hope the Government has by now realized the seriousness of this decision and will in the future provide that the ship be manned by Australians. The Minister in his report dated 30th June, 1960, dealing with Australian Shipping and Shipbuilding Statistics, saidAltliough various dry cargo vessels are under construction for the coastal trade it is notable that the only tanker on order in Australia is for use in overseas trade, despite a complete absence of any Australian owned tankers engaged in coastal trading. Refined petroleum products are the second largest individual item carried between coastal ports being exceeded only by the ironstone lift. If suitable tankers were build in Australia and engaged in distributing the produce of our oil refineries it would be a great stimulus to both the shipping and shipbuilding industries. Although local shipyards, particularly the BHP. yard at lift. cater for the local refined petroleum product Since this report, no tankers other than the "" P. J. Adams"" have been built in Australia and the Government does not intend to build any. I ask the Minister whether he Australia. I know that the Minister represents the electorate of Corio, and that he would, therefore, have a lot to do with tankers. I am sure that he can look at this matter again, forgetting all about the Shell company, and provide for us to build something for Australia, because it is badly needed. Much has been said about foreign tankers coming to Australia. Many of these vessels come to Geelong, which is in the Minister's own electorate. I suggest that when a tanker arrives at its port of destination on its marks, or, as happens in some cases, over its marks, it is obvious that it must have been overloaded when it left its loading port. If a ship arrives at its port of destination on its marks after having been at sea from eighteen to 24 days, it is reasonable to asume that it was pretty deep when it left its loading port. I would like to see more attention paid to this matter, because it has been argued that these overseas ships can be run more cheaply than Australian ships. The fact is that they are not carrying out the safety precautions that Australian vessels are required to carry out. I hope the Minister will give the appropriate instructions, in order to ensure that those precautions are observed. I am sorry to see so many foreign ships being allowed to trade around our coast, and I want to say something about the very bad practice that is growing of allowing these ships to trade around our coast without being required to comply with the manning scale and safety precautions laid down for Australian ships. Obviously these vessels can be run more cheaply when they are allowed to disregard the regulations that must be followed by Australian ships. There are certain international rules laid down for the safety of ships, and when overseas vessels, carrying flags of convenience, are allowed to come here and get away with flouting the rules, it is obvious that they can company, but Britain could. There are operate more cheaply than Australian vessels. I hope the Department of Shipping and Transport will do something about this matter. At the present time a small Japanese tanker, the "" Shotuku Maru"", is operating on the Australian coast, having been licensed by the Commonwealth Government to carry molasses. This vessel has a permit which is not due to expire until 3rd April, 1963. The Navigation Act says that ships may engage in the coasting trade only after securing a licence or a permit from the appropriate department of the Commonwealth Government. Part VI. of that act provides that if no Australian ship is available, the Minister may, in the public interest, grant permits to other ships, subject to such conditions as he thinks fit to impose. A permit may be issued for a single voyage or for a continuing period. In the case I have mentioned, it seems that no Australian ship is available, although I do not know why this is so, and so we have a Japanese ship operating in Australian coastal waters. The Minister is evidently issuing these permits because no Australian ships are available to perform the required tasks. The Minister could easily overcome this problem by seeing that tankers are built in Australia, and I earnestly ask him to do so. I now wish to say something about the various Commonwealth countries that have nationally owned ships. First, I want to say something about the British tanker company. This company, which carries the products of the British Petroleum organization, is controlled by the British Government, which has 51 per cent, of the shares in the company, the remaining 49 per cent, being privately owned. The company is the biggest shipping company in the world. It has 155 vessels, of which 134 trade overseas. It is all right for Britain to trade overseas v/ith a national line, but Australia is not allowed to do so. We are not allowed to stand on our own feet.. This British tanker company has ships of 32,000 tons. Australia has no ships at all. When the Australian Government sold out the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, the purchaser was the British Petroleum organization. We could not have that oil many other Commonwealth countries that have nationally owned vessels. The Indian Government owns 69 ships, 53 of which trade overseas. The South African Government owns 61 vessels, eighteen :>f which trade overseas. Little Nigeria has 22 vessels, nine of them trading overseas. Some three years ago the Australian Government fitted out a Swedish ship called "" Milos"" as a trade ship and sent this vessel to the near east. It went to the Philippines and Hong Kong. I protested at the time, not about the fact of a trading ship going overseas, but becau:e it was not an Australian ship. I hope the Government will consider providing a permanent trading ship, an Australian vessel manned by Australians and carrying Australian goods for display overseas. I was glad to read recently that a Mr George Ellis, commercial manager of the JamesN . Kirby organization, shares my view. Mr Kirby was a member of the recent 45-man trade mission to Latin America, and this is what he saidThe Federal Government could greatly assist Australia's export drive by outfitting a permanent trade ship. A permanent trade ship could be specially set up for the display of our manufactured products and space could be let to interested exporters for scheduled tours abroad. On 7th November in this HouseI asked what subsidies were being paid to the newly formed and so-called Australian Boomerang line, which trades between Australia and South America. Having such a name as the Australian Boomerang line, it would be natural to assume that this line is purely Australian. It is not. It is a Swedish line, and the Minister has said that the Government has subsidized the line to the extent of £100,000 per annum. The Minister also said that another Scandinavian line, serving the southern part of South America, was being subsidized to the extent of £175,000. I feel that the Government's action in granting these subsidies is wrong, it is un-Australian, unpatriotic and unnecessary. I agree that it is necessary to trade, but Australian ships should be trading, they should be manned by Australians and we should be very proud of them. The bill before the House proposes to increase £1,000,000 to £5,000,000. Ours is the eighth trading nation in the world, and I believe that the amount to be provided is not enough. To give the House an idea of what is happening in overseas countries, let me tell honourable members that last month the Italian Parliament passed two acts, the first designed to encourage the mothballing of outdated and uneconomical ships and to provide for the building of new ships. Under this measure an additional amount of £A17,142,587 will be added to the £A74,285,714 previously allobecause the capital expenditure envisaged to cated for this purpose. This shows what Italy is doing on a national basis. Compare it with the paltry effort that we are making in Australia in raising the overdraft limit to £5,000,000. The other act passed by the Italian Parliament was designed to enable Italy to compete more favourably with world shipping. It provides for financial aid to the extent of £A142,857,143 for the building of new ships. That is in one year, while we are making provision for £5,000,000. I say that it is not enough. I hope the Government will look further into this matter. We must trade overseas. That is obvious. It has also been pointed out that for defence considerations we should have our own ships. At present we have not a ship capable of carrying refrigerated stores overseas. I say that it is wrong to put large sums of money on the Estimates for defence but to make no provision for merchant ships. It is all very well to have guns, but you must be able to feed the people who are to fire the guns. It is a waste of money to depart from the equation. From the little that I know of mathematics I believe that anything that appears on one side of an equation must appear also on the other side; but we are not doing that. Australia is getting destroyers from overseas and is buying this and that, but is making no provision whatever for maintaining those ships. This is a wonderful opportunity for us to build our own tankers and our own merchant ships. For trade overseas we could have six ships, each of 15,000 tons and capable of 30 knots. They could be used for bringing migrants to Australia, and if ever the sad day arose when we had to use them for purposes of war we would have them. At present we do not have them and I am the overdraft limit from sorry to see that our Australian merchant fleet is so depleted. Mr Speaker, the remedy is in the hands of the Government, and I hope that it will do something. I know that when we become the Government this matter will be given high priority because it is most urgent. Speaker, the main feature of this bill is to increase the Australian National Line's bank limit from £1,000,000 to £5,000,000. I believe that this is a very reasonable request, 30th June, 1964, is £6,500,000. I think thesefiguresindicate a very successful business venture on the part of the Commonwealth Government. It is a very remarkable venture when one considers the excursions into national shipping by the Labour Party when it was in government. Honourable members have heard a lot to-night of plans and suggestions from members of the Opposition for what they consider to be, as the honourable member for Batman( Mr Benson) said, a first priority when and if Labour gets into oifice. It would",58,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
168,Mr Barnes (Mcpherson) [9.42],"Mrbe unfortunate for this country if that ever happened. A Labour government should be the last to consider a national shipping line in view of Labour's record of failure in this field. Our first venture into national ownership of ships was during the 1914-18 war. history of this because I am a primary producer. I hope that primary producers who are represented by Labour members will take notice of the remarks made to-night, because this is a very important question for primary freight costs. He mentioned that in 1960producers. I agree that during the 1914-18 war we were desperately short of shipping because of the inroads made upon it by the U-boats. For this reason we undertook ownership of vessels, but when the war was over and the world's shipping line came back to a degree of normalcy we lost millions of pounds because we could not hope to compete. up to 1927. The honourable member for Stirling should look at history before advocating this sort of venture. We ended up getting rid of national shipping to save tremendous losses. During the 1939-45 war the Labour Government embarked again on national shipping. That project was in such a desperate mess and was losing so much money when this Government came into power that no one would buy it. We tried to sell it, but no one would buy it. So, being a government of responsible people and representing responsible people, we set to work to build up a business-like shipping line. We did so not by going into the general cargo trade or passenger trade around the Australian coast; we went into the bulk cargo trade, which is entirely different from passenger shipping or general cargo shipping. We went into the most profitable of cargo trades, the carriage of bulk cargo, which has been a success around the Australian coast line. Honourable members opposite have mennot forget this: If we had an overseas shiptioned the cost of shipping and have sugping line it would be an uneconomic investgested that we should build up a national ment. It would have to be a subsidized shipping line to carry on our overseas trade. investment. Both honourable members said They should consider the disastrous fate of that there was very little difference between our coastal shipping lines. An Australian overseas shipping line would follow the same course. Before the 1939-45 war Australia had eleven passenger ships in the coastal service. To^lay we have none, because we cannot afford them with our wage rates, stevedoring charges and all the rest of it. In 1939 it cost 22s. a ton to transport cargo from Sydney to Melbourne; to-day it costs £9 15s. That is why motor transport has come in, taken up the lag and given us a chance to have reasonable transport charges. Much has been said by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) about 61 we paid £150,000,000 in overseas freights. He said that that was a drain on our overseas balances. He claimed that in 1961-62 the amount was £154,000,000. But he did not mention that overseas shipping lines spent more than £90,000,000 in Australian ports in servicing their ships. That is another picture altogeher. When I asked the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, by interjection, what would be the capital cost of establishing an Australian overseas shipping line, he avoided my interjection altogether. It would have been very disastrous to have answered it. The honourable member for Batman, who I understand is a seafaring man, appeared to know all the names of the ships. honourable member for Batman was at sea. He mentioned the "" Oriana"", the "" Canberra "", the "" Himalaya"" and goodness knows what else, but he did not disclose that the ""Oriana"" and the ""Canberra"" had each cost £19,000,000. Honourable members opposite would have us own a shipping line, but how many millions of pounds would this cost? Mr Ian Allan -He wanted only six ships. for Batman wanted only six ships, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wanted considerably more.

These are the comparative operating costs, excluding depreciation, of a 10,000-ton motor ship sailing under British and Australian flags. For the British ship, the crew's wages cost £stg.83 per day, and for the Australian ship £193. The cost of provisions is £15 and £21 per day respectively. Stores cost £18 per day for the British ships and £23 per day for the Australian ship. Insurance costs £29 per day in both cases. Service and maintenance costs are £58 per day for the British ship and £110 per day for the Australian. Those figures give a total of £205 per day for the British ship, as against £388 per day for the Australian ship. What hope in the world have we of competing on those terms? Should we ask our taxpayers to pay the extra costs in which we would be involved? Are we expecting our primary producers to pay these extra amounts in order to have an Australian shipping line? There is also the defence aspect of this matter to be considered. We needed a considerable amount of shipping in the last war and, for that matter, in the First World War. During the last war there were 150,000 officers and men in the British merchant marine service, of whom 50,000 lost their lives. In that war, 11,000,000 gross tons of British merchant shipping was lost. Are we going to encourage the United Kingdom to keep her flag flying or should we take the risk of building up something that we would have to subsidize? An honourable member stated that we should build up our tanker fleet. I remind him that in 1960-61 we imported 21,000,000 tons of freight, 13,000,000 tons of which was crude oil. From memory, £120,000,000 worth of our imports of crude oil went into our refineries, which this Government has encouraged. All the refineries in Australia have been constructed since the present Government came to power. Of the £120,000,000 worth of crude oil that I have mentioned, we exported £20,000,000 worth in refined products. If we used our own tanker fleet to carry the oil, which accounts for about 70 per cent, of our import tonnage, and if we charged freights comparable with other Australian charges, we should go out of business as a private enterprise country. Oil is essential to our primary and secondary industries. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggested that we could compete successfully overseas. How does he account for the fact that the rate quoted on the Baltic Exchange, which fixes freight and charter rates all over the world, is practically half the rate that any Australian ship could be chartered for? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Batman both mentioned that we had made successful export ventures overseas. I agree that this is so in respect of specialized cargoes-timber , pig iron and a few other commodities. But, in July, 1961, there were over 2,000,000 tons of tanker shipping idle. To-day, 10 per cent, of the world's shipping is idle. If we dug up the capital to establish a shipping line to take all our exports and to serve all our shipping needs we should have a tremendous investment tied up. This would be something which we should have to subsidize and on which we should not earn a penny. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition mentioned the success of the Tasmanian service. That has been brought about by eliminating labour. Roll-on, roll-off ships are being used. We have also developed the packaged cargo system, which has cut down costs. These are the methods by which we can make a success of that trade. The honourable member instanced the United States of America, which subsidizes its shipping, but he did not mention the tremendous losses that are incurred there. United States shipping subsidies are really tremendous. Many United States shipping companies have registered their ships in the Republic of Panama and other republics where taxation does not apply. They escape charges on their shipping in that way. That is the only way in which they can exist. Years ago, when I was in the United States of America, I saw in some of the harbours thousands of tons of shipping which was tied up-kep t in mothballs. It had been used during the First World War in times of stress, when there was a great demand for shipping and when shipping was desperately scarce, but when conditions of competition",62,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
176,Mr Daly,Mak e it short.,63,Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Bill 1962
177,Mr Barnes,"I shall make it short andcame back other nations just pushed the Americans right out of the shipping picture. I believe that if honourable members opposite would study the American position, they would, if they were honest, take a completely different view of an Australian shipcompany constructed vessels of a class ping line. The Americans have vast resources available to them and it is amazing what they can achieve. There is great rivalry on the Atlantic crossing between New York and the United Kingdom. The blue riband of the Atlantic was held at different times by the "" Queen Elizabeth "" and the "" Queen Mary"", and then the Americans subsidized the liner "" United States"" to the extent of ""Iron Duke"" and the ""Iron Monarch"", £50,000,000 so that they could have the prestige of holding the blue riband. I gather that that is the sort of thing which honourable members opposite are suggesting that we should do. Not one honourable member opposite has yet laid any basis for bis argument. Opposition members have made wild statements and appealed to our emotions. An Australian shipping line sounds very nice, but all I can say isIf we judged the argument of the Opposition in favour of a national shipping line on the in the development of this nation with anbasis of the Opposition's achievements, I think no Australian would ever accept it. Deputy Speaker, I always have the greatest respect for the honourable member for McPherson( Mr Barnes) as a racehorse breeder. In that capacity he has quite a deal of achievement to his credit. His views time trade on the Australian coast, as were on shipbuilding and the steel industry demonstrate that he should stick to horsebreeding. The honourable member spoke of the excellent job that the Australian National Line has done over recent years and of what the present Government has been able to achieve by the business-like manner in which it has discharged its responsibilities concerning that line. He said that the River class ships were sold because they were uneconomic to operate and said that this Government was responsible for the Australian National Line entering the bulk trade. Let us look at the facts. The River class ships were built during the war at a time when the design to which they were built was the standard design for the kind of trade in which they were to be engaged. This Government looks on the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited as the bulwark of private enterprise, as the glowing example of efficiency in industry. That almost identical with the River class ships. If any one wants the names of all these vessels, they can be found in the statistical bulletin entitled ""Australian Shipping and Shipbuilding Statistics"", which is published twice a year by the Department of Shipping and Transport. I shall name only two ships. The of 8,030 dead-weight tons each, were built by BHP. in 1943. At about the same time, the ""River Fitzroy"", the ""River Loddon"" and numerous other River class ships were built for the Commonwealth shipping /ine. Each of those vessels had a deadweight of 8,500 tons. We know now that ships of that type are uneconomic in comparison with the bulk ships now being used on the Australian coast. Likewise, the ships at present in use on the Australian coast are outdated compared with overseas shipping. When one compares the achievements of one government with another or of one era other, one has to look at all the facts and not just mention those which suit ones own McPherson did. He cited figures whicb suited him but which did not present a correct analysis of the real position. The fact is that the River class ships are uneconomic to-day. They were built for warthe ""Iron Duke"", the ""Iron Monarch"" and similar vessels built for the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. New methods have now made those ships out of date. That is something that the honourable member for McPherson ignored. I want to discuss the failure by the Minister for Shipping and Transport ( Mr Opperman) in this bill to provide adequately for the necessary development of the Australian National Line. I believe that although the proposal to increase the line's overdraft limit from £1,000,000 to £5,000,000 is a progressive move, the Government's approach to the needs of the line is completely inadequate for the discharge of the responsible job of developing the line.

180,Mr Jones (Newcastle) [10.0],"Mr argument, as the honourable member forthat there is a need, in view of conditions in the world to-day, particularly in Australia's trade, to develop this country's maritime fleet. If one examines the published facts and figures, one will find no record of the ownership of any ships engaged in the Australian trade. There are two distinct sections of shipping-the tanker fleet and the general freight fleet of bulk carriers, refrigerator vessels, passenger ships and the like. I want in the oil-producing world brought about to deal first with tankers in relation to Australian trade. recently had two ships built overseas and one constructed in Australia. In recent months, there has been a great to-do over the manning of the tanker built in Australia. I do not intend to discuss that matter in any detail, Mr Deputy Speaker. I shall say only that this company is prepared to accept the profits and advantages of operations in a high-wage nation such as Australia but, at the same time, wishes to use the cheap labour obtainable in other countries. This company advertises that its operations are based on the principle, "" Buy Australian, be Australian "". Why is it not a little more Australian in outlook itself? Why does it not have its ships built in Australia and have them manned by Australian seamen? The additional cost of manning the tanker in question with Australian seamen is only some £40,000 a year. As the last balance-sheet of tbe company disclosed, in the last twelve months its profits have increased by more than £300,000 compared with the previous year. As I have said before, I believe that any company or enterprise that is prepared to accept tbe advantages of trading in a high-wage country with a high standard of living, and advertises that it works on the principle, "" Buy Australian, be Australian "", should employ Australian labour. This brings me to the need for an Austraing the annual report of the company to lian tanker fleet. In 1961, full-time permits were granted to eleven overseas-owned ships to trade exclusively and completely on the Australian coast. They are named in the issue of ""Australian Shipping and Shipbu .ilding Statistics"" which states the position as at 30th June of this year. out that these ships have been given permission to trade on the Australian coast. In addition permits were given to 134 tankers to make single voyages to Australia for the transport of crude oil to this country for refining here. This Government has taken great credit for the establishment of oil refineries in Australia during its term of office. Is the Government honest, sincere and fair dinkum when it claims that it was responsible for the establishment of those refineries or have changed circumstances the establishment of refineries in Australia? Ampol Petroleum Are the oil companies afraid to establish oil refineries in the new nations? Are they prepared to invest money in those new nations for the establishment of oil refineries? To my way of thinking, Mr Deputy Speaker, the oil companies are not prepared to take the risk. They realize that their assets are safe in Australia and therefore they have decided to establish refineries here. Is it coincidental that, at the same time as oil refineries are established in Australia, we find this growth of nationalism in the oil-producing countries? I think that the answer is quite obvious. The oil refineries were not established here because of the efforts of this Government. They were established here because the oil companies wished to protect their assets and were afraid of what could happen to those assets if the refineries were established in other countries. Why have we not a tanker fleet in Australia? Why have we not tankers owned and controlled in Australia, manned by Australian seamen working under Australian conditions and rates of pay in the Australian trade? That is the question that I ask the Minister and other Government speakers to answer in this debate. On 13th January, 1961, the chairman of directors of Ampol Petroleum Limited, presentthe shareholders, saidAs the Directors' Report states, our Tankers have been continuously employed transporting our requirements of crude oil from Indonesia to the Refinery at Kurnell. I emphasize that sentence, Mr Deputy This bulletin clearly sets Speaker. The tankers owned by Ampol Petroleum Limited have been fully employed in transporting crude oil from Indonesia to Australia, not in some other trade such as that which it is suggested that the "" P. J. Adams"" will engage in. The chairin the steel industry to handle cargo and to man referred to the fact that the ""P. J. make it much easier and cheaper to deal Adams"" would be coming into service soon, with the goods that it produces. and he went on to say that it wouldmake us less dependent on charter tankers where( Mr Howson) said earlier that the Labour with to transport our requirements which are Party would oppose new ideas in the shipalready exceeding 100,000 t.p.a. So far as Ampol is concerned, when the support new methods and new ideas in "" P. J. Adams"" goes into service and which, shipping, but I say to the House that the incidentally, will replace charter tankers, people in the industry are entitled to their its three tankers will be employed entirely share of any reduction of costs that results on the transport of crude oil for the Ausfrom those new methods. Similarly, they tralian trade. That is another reason why are entitled to their share of any increase in I believe that if these people intend to transproductivity that results, or benefits which port goods exclusively to Australia, it must flow from increased efficiency leading to be done by Australian seamen under Ausgreater profits. The workers in the industralian conditions. Ships must be built and try should receive their share. If we are to operated by Australia.

Why does not the commensurate increases in long service Government do something about the leave, annual leave and so on. matter? We all know the position regarding freighter field. In the last annual report, freights and the charge that they represent the following statement appears:on the national export income. We are aware that in the last five years freights effort have cost this country £748,000,000. That for ships of the Fleet, with the result that 25 figure relates only to freight on the transport voyages were undertaken to various parts of the of goods to this country. Yet the Governworld, representing the carriage of 184,688 tons ment does nothing about the matter. It as speaks of building up overseas reserves and the like. Freights are a charge against our market has occurred, the reverse in fact, and on export income, but the Government is not rare occasions only has it been possible to show prepared to take the necessary action to a profit from overseas voyaging.

I personally am prepared to One of the tragedies of the Australian National Line is its failure to move into the Throughout the 12 months, every possible has been made to obtain overseas business compared to 44,283 tons during the preceding year. Unhappily, no recovery in the world tramp hand, losses overall were less than those involved ships been laid up. . . . The position is that the Australian National When I suggest that an overseas freighter than that, in order to permit the development of the line overseas, so that we might enter into the freighting industry on an organized basis. Let us consider the places to which Australian exports go and those from which our imports come. The figures that I am about to give are taken from the Department of Trade bulletin which is published every month, and are those as at 30th June this year. They disclose that shipping lines operating between Australia and Europe, via the Suez Canal, to Commonwealth countries, carry £298,000,000 worth of goods to Australia and £246,000,000 worth of goods from Australia. The total for all Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries is £478,000,000 worth of goods to Australia and £487,000,000 from Australia. Shipping lines that operate via the Cape of Good Hope include in their operations many African countries. The figures disclose that nor disagreeing with hisfigures;I am merely £12,200,000 worth of goods are brought to Australia and £14,100,000 worth taken away from Australia. Ships travelling between the there would have to be a subsidy of United States of America, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, take away from this country goods worth £201,000,000 and bring here imports worth £226,000,000. For ships trading between Australia and Japan, Asia and the Philippines, the exports from Australia amount to £253,000,000 and the imports to £70,000,000. Of course, to those figures we can add £65,000,000 worth of exports from Australia to Communist China and £4,000,000 worth of imports from that country. Does the Minister mean to tell me that our Australian National Line is unable to arrange for the transport from Australia of exports and the transport to this country of imports in sufficient volume to warrant the establishment of a Commonwealth owned overseas shipping line? I am not suggesting for one moment that we would insist on everything that left Australia or came to this country being transported in Australian-owned and controlled ships. I believe that that would be unreasonable and impracticable of implementation. Nevertheless, I am convinced that we can and must work out a system whereby at least 50 per cent, of our exports and 50 per cent, of our ferences. They are pricing Australian steel imports are transported in Australian-owned and controlled ships. That is the only way in which we could operate an Australian owned and controlled shipping line. We know that much of the trouble in the shipping industry to-day has been brought about because countries which have attained their independence of recent years have moved into the shipping industry. Ghana, Nigeria, Indonesia, India, Pakistan and Ceylon, to mention only a few such countries, have established their own nationally-owned shipping lines. None of those countries is as big a trader as is Australia. If they can establish their own national lines, why cannot we do so? The honourable member for Fawkner referred to subsidies. He came into the House and told us that on a capital expenditure of £100,000,000, which is what he said it would cost to establish an Australian-owned and controlled shipping line, it would be necessary to provide subsidies to the tune of £3,500,000 a year. I am neither accepting stating them. The honourable member appeared to be appalled by the thought that £3,500,000 a year. Let us look at some of the subsidies we already pay to industries in Australia. I asked a question on this matter some time ago, and it was answered on 10th May. The information given shows that a subsidy of £13,500,000 per annum is paid to the dairying industry, which is considerably more than the £3,500,000 which the honourable member for Fawkner suggested would be necessary for the shipping industry. We pay a subsidy of £2,700,000 for petroleum research; £660,000 for goldmining; £1,056,000 for the production of sulphuric acid; £931,000 for the construction of tractors and £11,906,132 to the wheat industry. We do not hear the honourable member for McPherson, the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) or other Country Party members complaining about the £13,500,000 butter subsidy. If it is necessary to subsidize any industry obviously it is necessary to subsidize the shipping industry if by so doing we can provide competition with overseas lines. At present the Australian steel export industry is in jeopardy because of the freights which are being charged by overseas shipping conout of the New Zealand and adjoining Asian markets. A complaint was made recently by a gentleman in the fertilizer industry that high freights blocked sales to Asia. I could mention numerous examples of Australian industries being affected seriously by freights. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition stated that New Zealand beef is being transported to Europe at a cheaper rate than is Australian beef although New Zealand beef has to travel 1,000 miles more than Australian beef. There are many obvious examples of the overseas shipping conferences exploiting the Australian primary producers and those who complain about our suggestion that an overseas shipping line should be established. The United States of America realizes what is taking place. It has ruled that at least 50 per cent, of goods provided under the overseas aid programme must be transported in American-owned and manned ships. If America, that great bastion of free enterprise, is prepared to take such action why does not this Government take similar action and establish an overseas shipping line in Australia? As I pointed out earlier, the trend among the new nations is to establish their own shipping lines. British shipping lines are complaining like the devil about this-and so they should, because their export income has fallen from £221,000,000 in 1952 to £138,000,000 in 1958 and to £72,000,000 in 1960. That is the effect of the competition which has been provided by the new shipping lines. That is why there are many tramp ships tied up to-day. The independent nations are on the move and are determined to be no longer subject to the price fixing which the conference lines have indulged in for years. They will no longer pay the high freight rates which have been charged, and they have established their own shipping lines to provide very necessary competition. We have asked the Minister on numerous occasions to expand and develop the Australian National Line to permit Australian ships to trade overseas. If you examine the profits which have been made in recent years by the Australian National Line you will see that it is a profitable undertaking. After paying taxation, as any ordinary company does, the Australian National Line has been able to accumulate profits from 1958 to 1962 amounting to £7.265,000. That is a clear indication that it can be and is being also producers and manufacturers want operated efficiently. I repeat my request to the Minister to extend the facilities of the Australian National Line so that it can compete with overseas fines. What if it is necessaryI do not claim that it is-to subsidize the Australian National Line? I have shown already that we subsidize numerous other Australian industries to enable them to compete overseas. We know that overseas shipping lines are subsidized by way of depreciation allowances, taxation concessions and so on. If it is necessary for overseas countries to do that why can we not also move into this field? The present shipping lines are not providing the service which is required of them. I have a cutting from the "" Newcastle Morning Herald"" of 6th October, 1962, which contains a report of a meeting of the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce. A Newcastle company representative complained of the lack of service being given to various organizations in that city by the overseas shipping companies. Numerous speakers have mentioned the laying-up of overseas vessels. The honourable member for McPherson claims that we cannot enter the shipping business because so many ships are tied up overseas already. But the tying up of these ships has not resulted in a better service. The conferences have used the fact that they have a monopoly of the Australian shipping business to say that they will do, in effect, what they like. This supports our claim that competition must be provided, and only a government-controlled shipping line can do so. Honourable members opposite should not claim that Australia cannot compete overseas. We have only to consider Qantas. Last year Qantas was one of the few international airlines which was able to earn a profit. Nearly all of them had a bad year and lost millions of pounds but Qantas, after paying taxes and meeting all commitments, still earned a profit of £480,000. Why can we not establish a shipping line to work like Qantas? I have spoken to numerous business men, and our party committee recently interviewed a person in the textile industry. He knows that he is being exploited by foreign companies and he advocated the establishment of a shipping line, Australian-owned and controlled like Qantas. So not only the Opposition, but Australia to compete with overseas lines. The manufacturers want it because they know how private enterprise operates. At present we subsidize shipbuilding, where necessary, to the extent of 33 per cent. From my own experience I know that although all yards at present have a ship on their slips there is no continuity of employment. Recently the honourable member for Batman( Mr Benson) asked a question of the Minister for Defence( Mr Townley) about the two destroyers being built overThat the House do now adjourn. seas for Australia. In his reply the Minister statedI hasten to say that I have the highest regard for the work done by the artisans in Australian shipyards. I believe that it is second to none. Unfortunately, however, experience has shown that Australian shipyards work slowly. That is a complete untruth. I will not say that it is a lie, because if I did so, Mr Noes. . Speaker, you would make me withdraw the statement, but it is a complete untruth.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. Original question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.36 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated:Industrial Arbitration. Mr L. R. Johnson asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice1. How many court-controlled ballots have been conducted in respect of the Amalgamated Engineering Union? 2. In respect of each Amalgamated Engineering Union court-controlled ballot, who made the decision to conduct such a ballot and what was the reason for making such a decision? 3. In what manner are ballots conducted under the registered rules of this union considered to be (a) undemocratic or (b) irregular? 4. Has the Industrial Registrar of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission sought any changes in the rules governing the union's elections; if so, what changes were sought? 5. Do the rules of the Amalgamated Engineering Union provide-(a ) that all members are notified of the date, place and time when the ballot will take place; (b) that members unable to attend at the place when the ballot is in progress can apply for a postal vote; (c) that absentee members can attend and cast their vote at a branch meeting where they are temporarily residing; (d) that the ballot-box is displayed at a branch meeting before it is locked and before the ballot opens; (e) that balloting is secret; and (f) that the ballot-box must be unlocked at the conclusion of ballots by the president in the presence of tellers? 6. Is it possible in the conduct of a general postal ballot as decided by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer that irregularities can occur-(a ) in the printery where the ballot-papers are printed; (b) in the electoral oifice where ballot-papers are despatched; and (c) in the process of transmitting ballot-papers of members to the Electoral Office? 7. Why are these court-controlled ballots conducted by post rather than in accord with the rules of the union? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. There have been nineteen officially conducted ballots. 2. The legislation provides that a written request Calwell, A. A. for an officially conducted ballot may be made to Whitlam, E. G. the Industrial Registrar either by the management Cameron, Don committee of an organization or by a prescribed James, A. W. number of its members. On receiving such a Mclvor, H. J. request the Registrar is required to decide whether it has been duly made and, if so, to grant it, inform the union accordingly and arrange for the conduct of the ballot. All officially conducted ballots held so far in respect of the Amalgamated Engineering Union have resulted from requests duly made by the prescribed number of members of the tution arid granted by the Registrar. 3. I am not in a position to comment on the conduct of elections by the union itself. What is a matter of common knowledge is that when ballots have been officially conducted a much higher percentage of members has voted. As an example, in the election for Organizer, Division No. 1, conducted in 1959 by the union in accordance with its rules less than 25 per cent, of members eligible to vote did so. In the officially conducted postal ballot for the same position in 1962, 60 per cent, of eligible members voted. 4. Before certifying the revised rules of the Amalgamated Engineering Union in July this year, the Industrial Registrar, in order to give effect to a decision of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission following an appeal by the union in regard to rule 2, clause 12 (a), after conferring with the union, made an alteration to the rule which provides for a longer term of office (five years instead of three) in the case of an official re-elected to the same office. The effect of the alteration was to restrict the longer term to an officer who was immediately re-elected and not to include one who had previously held the office but was not the current occupant. 5. The rules of this union are not easy to follow and the following are the best answers I can give:(a) It can be inferred from a number of rules that the members are to be notified of date, place and time when the ballot will take place. (b) Yes. (c) Yes. (d) There is no rule in these terms but the rules do provide that the ballot-box must be under the strict supervision of the tellers elected in each ' branch to attend to ballots. (e) Voting is by ballot for general secretary, all general officers, delegates to annual meetings or final appeal court, branch secretaries, district secretaries and presidents and district committeemen who represent more than one branch. Voting for otber branch officers and delegates is by show of hands. In ballot voting, the tellers are required to issue ballot-papers to members and the members, having voted, place their papers in the ballot-box. (f) There is no rule in these terms but there is a requirement that at the close of a ballot the tellers, in conjunction with the president of the branch, count the votes.",69,Adjournment
184,Mr Mcmahon,"The answers to theI am, of course, not in a position to know to what extent there is compliance with these rules in the conduct of elections by the union. 6. Having regard to the wide knowledge and experience of Commonwealth Electoral Officers, I should have thought it could be taken for granted that they are well qualified to conduct ballots properly and can be relied upon to take all possible precautions against irregularities 7. The legislation authorizes the person conducting an election to take whatever action and give whatever directions he considers necessary for its proper conduct. He is not restricted to any particular method of ballot nor is he subject to any direction in this respect. The fact that Commonwealth Electoral Officers have usually decided on a postal vote in such cases would seem to indicate that they find this method the most suitable and practical having regard to what is required of them and the resources available to them. See also answer to question 3. PhysicaUy Handicapped Persons. Mr Reynolds asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1. Has the Government's attention been drawn to the statement of the chairman of the Civilian Maimed and Limbless Association in which he refers to the great savings in social service payments that could be made and the increased national production that could result from the proper provision of training facilities and suitable workshops for physically handicapped persons? 2. Will the Government give consideration to the provision of grants to assist in the establishment and maintenance of such training and workshop facilities, and will it request government departments and statutory bodies, wherever possible to provide work contract opportunities for these organizations? able member's questions are as follows:1. My attention has been drawn to a press report on the 2nd October of certain statements by the president of the New South Wales Civilian Maimed and Limbless Association. The rehabilitation of handicapped persons is a matter to which the Government has given much attention in recent years, with some striking, if necessarily limited, success. As honourable members are aware, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service provides treatment and training for invalid pensioners and persons in other eligible groups who have reasonable prospects of being rehabilitated into normal employment, and all new grants of invalid pensions are screened for cases likely to benefit from such assistance. However, it should be borne in mind that to qualify for an invalid pension a person must be permanently disabled for work to the extent of at least 85 per cent. Consequently, the percentage of invalid pensioners who could be trained to the stage of undertaking normal employment would be very small. Of 1,623 persons in the age group sixteen to nineteen years granted invalid pensions in 1961-62 only 71, or 4.3 per cent., were considered suitable for rehabilitation assistance. Therefore, it is extremely doubtful whether savings in social services payments and additions to national production of the order suggested are feasible. 2. There can be no doubt about the social and economic value, to say nothing of the humanitarian aspects, of well conducted sheltered workshops and it is pleasing to note that, chiefly through the activities of voluntary organizations, the sheltered workshop movement has grown considerably in Australia in recent years. On the specific question of Government contracts, it is already established policy to give sheltered workshops equal opportunity to compete for contracts. Trade with Communist China. Mr Hayden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1. Has mainland China moved to a position of prominence as a foreign nation engaged in trade with Australia? 2. Could he indicate the position of importance of that country as a foreign nation engaged in trade with Australia, for each of the past three years? 3. Do present indications suggest that that nation will become even more prominent and much more important in the field of trade with this country? 4. Do these changes indicate that the Government recognizes the existence of the nation of mainland China? 5. Do these changes also indicate that Australia is now dependent to a considerable extent, and in the future will be even more dependent, upon trade with mainland China for the maintenance of a sufficiently favorable balance of payments to ensure full employment and economic growth? 6. If so, would formal recognition of mainland China by Australia and support for her admission to the United Nations assist the growth of this favorable trade relationship? honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. The degree of prominence of mainland China as an importer from Australia is indicated by the fact that in value of total trade it has ranked fifteenth, ninth and sixth over the years 1959-60, 1960-61 and 1961-62 respectively. 3. The prominence achieved over recent years results mainly from large purchases of grains from Australia by mainland China. I am unable to forecast whether mainland China will continue to make such large purchases of grain. 4. The Government has not closed its eyes to, nor does it ignore the existence of, the Communist administration in mainland China. 5. Present indications do not justify such an inference. 6. There is no evidence that recognition by other countries of the Government of mainland China and support for Peking's demand to represent China in the United Nations is related to the development of trading relations with that country. The recent fall in British and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics trade with mainland China is relevant in this respect.",70,Answers To Questions

186,Mr Menzies,"The answers to theCoal and OH. Mr Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for National Development, upon notice1. In view of the reference in paragraphs 16 to 22 of the Joint Coal Board Report for 1961-62 to the unfair competition to the coal industry from heavy oil fractions, will the Minister request the Australian petroleum refineries to maximize their production of the lighter fractions and correspondingly minimize production of the heavier fractions? 2. Would this result in a better use of resources of coal and oil as suggested by the Joint Coal Board? 3. If the Minister is prepared to make the request referred to and the Australian petroleum refineries will not co-operate, will he take the necessary legislative action to compel them to comply? National Development has supplied the following information:1. When present refinery developments are completed about the beginning of next year it is expected that the local production of motor spirit will overall be in balance with domestic requirements. It would be difficult to justify a policy which would require Australian refineries to produce more motor spirit than they could expect to sell in AustraUa. The quantity of the fuel oil produced at the same time as this motor spirit will depend not only on the equipment installed but also on the crudes used. Australian refineries are producing proportionately less fuel oil than those in most other industrialized countries. Furthermore, only about 44 per cent, of the fuel oil produced in AustraUan refineries is at present being disposed of on the inland market; the balance of about 56 per cent, is used in ships bunkers or is exported. Therefore a reduction in the quantity of fuel oil produced by Australian refineries would not necessarily result in less fuel oil being disposed of on the inland market. In these circumstances I am not proposing at this time to make a request to the industry of the nature suggested. However any significant change in the above mentioned percentages of fuel oil disposal would give the Government cause for concern. 2. The answer to this question depends on many things including the course of future events. It depends on the future supply of and demand for the two sources of energy over the years, on the policies that might be followed by the industries concerned, e.g., on exports, and on the criteria used to judge which on various hypothetical results was the better. The question therefore seeks for an expression of opinion rather than a judgment based on facts. 3. See my answer to 1. Coal Miners' Pension Funds. Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice1. Is he able to say whether the coal miners' retirement pension funds operated in New South Wales and Queensland are considered to be reaching a stage where rhey will become actuarily unsound if they continue to operate on the present system of contributions from employer and employee? 2. If these schemes are considered to be reaching a stage of actuarial unsoundness, wiU he consider introducing a scheme maintained on an excise imposed on coal production tonnages and payable by the employers? 3. If so, will he arrange to include representatives of the coal employees' union and of the retired coal employees' associations in any discussions which he may hold for the purpose of developicg the scheme? able member's questions are as follows:1. The New South Wales and Queensland coal miners' pension funds are within the jurisdiction of the governments of those two States and 1 am unable to comment on the position of the funds. 2 and 3. See reply to 1. Homopolar Generator. Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Prime Minister, upon notice1.

What was the estimated cost of this equipment at the time the decision was made to proceed with its construction and instaUation? 3. What was the estimated time for its completion when approval for installation was given? 4. Has the machine been completed; if so, what was its actual cost? 5. If it is not now completed and in normal operation, when is it anticipated that it will be completed and in service and what estimated additional costs wiU be involved in its completion? able member's questions, I have been informed by the Australian National University as follows:1. The basic design of the homopolar generator in the Research School of Physical Sciences at the Australian National University was prepared in 1954. 2. The estimated cost of equipment was £500,000. Thisfiguredoes not, of course, include the cost of employing the scientists and craftsmen who have designed and constructed the generator. 3. The estimated time for completion was four years. 4. The first stage of the machine has been completed. The cost is £400,150. 5. It is expected that the generator will be fully completed and in normal operation in about one year and that the further cost wiU be about £20,000.",71,Answers To Questions

In view of the prospective deficit, estimated at over £118,000,000, the Government decided that it would not be appropriate to grant further taxation concessions at that time. However, the Government has recently adopted a number of measures specifically directed to the development of the north of Australia. These measures include increased provisions for beel cattle roads in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, assistance for the financing of a scheme for development of the brigalow lands in central Queensland and provision of finance for the construction of a new jetty at Derby.

194,Mr Adermann,"In. answering the quesInformation regarding (c), (d) and (e) is not recorded by the Commonwealth against individual projects but, by research, could be obtained from records maintained by the State, (f) and (g) would require an arbitrary apportionment. On the assumption the honourable member is interested in the cost of providing farms by the development of virgin land on Kangaroo Island, the following answers are provided:1. Acquisition, £55,353; development, £3,935,119; total, £3,990,472 to 30th September, 1962. As development of a few farms is still proceeding, the total cost will exceed this amount. 2. As the work of developing farms is costed on a project basis, the amount to be written off will not be known until all work has been completed and valuations of the resultant farms have been made. On the experience of valuations made to date, it appears that a write-off of excess costs will be incurred. 3. The rentals of farms are determined by officers of the Commonwealth and the State appointed for the purpose, having regard to estimated net returns from the farms after allowing for a reasonable labour return and meeting such financial commitments as would be incurred by a settler possessing no capital. Repayment of advances made to settlers by the credit authority has relation to the purposes for which they are made, e.g., advances for working expenses are repayable from returns they are used to produce. Other advances are made to purchase and effect improvements and acquire plant and stock. In line with normal practice for rural credit, the objective is to have these repaid over a term related to a reasonable estimation of the life of the asset, e.g., advances to purchase plant should be repaid within the useful life of that plant, assuming reasonable maintenance is carried out. Someflexibilityof the terms of repayment is at the discretion of the credit authority. All advances carry interest at 3} per cent. Eggs and Egg Pnlp. Mr Beaton asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice1. What was the volume of exports of (a) eggs and (b) egg pulp to (i) Britain, (ii) other European markets, and (iii) other markets during the financial year 1961-62? 2. What volume, in each case, was exported by the (a) Australian Egg Board, fb) New South Wales Egg Board, (c) Victorian Egg Board and (d) any other organization? 3. What was the average price received for (a) eggs and (b) egg pulp during the year 1961-62 by each of these organizations? 4. What are the prospects for the export of eggs and egg pulp this year compared with the year 1961-62 and other years? 5. How do prices being obtained for eggs and egg pulp this year, compare with those obtained during 1961-62? honourable member's questions are as follows:1The volume of exports of eggs and egg products from Australia in 1961-62, is set out on pages 7 and 8 of thefifteenthannual report of the Australian Egg Board which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 8th November, 1962. 2. The volume of exports of eggs and egg products from each State by destination is shown in Appendix (D) of the above-mentioned report. In respect of the United Kingdom, the Continent and certain other markets for shell eggs, the Australian Egg Board ships under a pooling arrange-' ment on behalf of all States with the exception of New South Wales. A pool in which all States other than New South Wales participate, is alsooperated by the Australian Egg Board in respect of shipments of egg pulp to the United Kingdom market. The New South Wales board ships shell eggs and egg pulp to all destinations including the United Kingdom on its own behalf while the other States export on their own behalf only to markets other than those mentioned above for which the pooling arrangements operate. 3 (a) The fifteenth annual report of the Australian Egg Board states that the average net returns for shell eggs exported by that board were ls. 5.8'd. per dozen for the 14-lb. pack and ls. 9.13d. per dozen for the 16-lb. pack. I am not aware of the returns received by the other egg boards which export in competition with each other to most destinations, (b) The Australian Egg Board sells in competition with the New South Wales Egg Board on the United Kingdom/ Continent markets and neither board discloses its returns for the sale of egg pulp. 4 and 5. As Australian egg production this season is expected to be lower than last season, the exportable surplus will be smaller. Prices in the United Kingdom have been so low that there have been no exports of eggs in shell to that destination this season. For destinations other than the United Kingdom/Continent, the State egg boards export in competition with each other and normally do not disclose their prices. For egg pulp, the present price in the Umted Kingdom-virtuall y Australia's only export market for pulp-is ls. lOid. sterling per lb. ex store. The comparable price at this time last year was 2s. sterling per lb. The present return to Australian producers from egg pulp sales is the lowest since the 1947-48 season and there are no indications of any worth-while improvement. Tuna Fish.

Mr Beaton asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice1. Is it likely that in order to expand our markets for foodstuffs in Asia, Australia will have to develop and produce foods which will suit Asian eating habits; if so, will this entail a reappraisal of Australia's food production? 2. Is the University of New South Wales the only Australian university which has, as part of its establishment, a food technology department? 3. If so, will he investigate the need for further similar university departments or, alternatively, the expansion of the existing department in the University of New South Wales? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Australia already supplies the foodstuffs markets in Asia with considerable exports of natural and processed primary products. In 1961-62, we exported foodstuffs of animal and vegetable origin (and non-alcoholic beverages) to Asia and Eastern countries worth about £122,000,000 in value, which, excluding wool, represented over 59 per cent, of our total exports to this area. Foodstuffs such as sugar, wheat, meat, fruit and dairy produce including butter, cheese and eggs, find ready markets in Asia. The department, however, is continually seeking to encourage exporters to give more attention to the specific requirements of overseas markets, particularly Asia, and is continually examining measures which are likely to increase the acceptability of our products in these markets. The honourable member may be aware that a food survey mission is to visit Japan shortly to investigate specifically to the what foodstuffs we can sell in that country. is as Another example of our activity in this field is ghee, which is a butter-fat preparauon used extensively in Asian countries for cooking purposes. 2,400,000 lb. of this product worth approximately £539,046. 2.

Mr Cairns asked the Minister for Air, upon notice1. What types of missiles have been installed in Australia? 2. What is the cost, number and range of these missiles? 3. What is the area and number of people they actually protect? 4. Is it expected that similar missile protection will be extended to the rest of the Australian population? 5. What would be the cost of this extension? 6. Could these missiles be equipped with nuclear warheads? 7. Are they offensive or defensive weapons, and why are they so classified? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Bloodhound Mk. 1 surface-to-air missile system. 2. The cost of the system installed is about £3,000,000; the number deployed in Australia is one squadron, and the range of these missiles is that required to repel hostile aircraft in the air defence system of a particular area. 3. The missile squadron is at present located at Williamtown, New South Wales. It is not operated to protect a specific number of people. It is part of the general air defence system covering the Newcastle/Sydney/Port Kembla area. 4. There is no plan to extend the missile system to cover the rest of Australia. 5. The cost of extending missile cover to the whole Australian population would be astronomical.",77,Answers To Questions

In the determination of the distribution of Australia's international reserves many complex factors are involved, some of them arising from particular circumstances. Broadly, however, they include such factors as considerations relevant to Australia's membership of the sterling area and its financial relations with the United Kingdom, the extent to which particular currencies are normally used m thefinancingof Australia's external transactions, the convertibility of holdings in different currencies and the possible earnings thereon. Such factors would continue to be relevant in determining the distribution of our international reserves whether or not Britain joined the European Economic Community but their impUcations would not necessarily be the same in both cases.
