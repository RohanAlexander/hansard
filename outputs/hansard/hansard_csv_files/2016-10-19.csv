7,Mr Wilkie,"10 minutes.Bill read a first time. Second Reading for Counter-Terrorism) (09:32): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Law Enforcement Legislation Amendment (State Bodies and Other Measures) Bill 2016 makes amendments to a number of acts to ensure state integrity and anti-corruption bodies have the necessary powers to discharge their functions and to ensure property acquired unlawfully is not kept by criminals. The measures in the bill will:  support the establishment of the New South Wales Law Enforcement Conduct Commission and its inspector;  ensure Victoria's Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission has investigative powers under Commonwealth law equivalent to other anti-corruption bodies; and  clarify the meaning of 'lawfully acquired' in the Proceeds of Crime Act to address issues raised in a recent court decision. Law Enforcement Conduct Commission This government is committed to supporting state and territory governments to tackle corruption and misconduct. It is common for persons participating in corrupt conduct to utilise clandestine communication methods and attempt to avoid detection by law enforcement and integrity bodies. In response to the Tink review into police oversight, the New South Wales government will abolish the state's current police oversight body, the Police Integrity Commission, and replace it with the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission. The new commission will be responsible for detecting, investigating and preventing police corruption and misconduct, and will have comparable investigative powers to anti-corruption bodies in Australia. The bill provides the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission with access to information obtained under the Commonwealth interception regime, similar to other state anti-corruption commissions, which would be vital to that commission's investigations. The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (interception act) strictly regulates how agencies that receive intercepted information are able to use and communicate that information-this is important in ensuring that privacy and oversight considerations are part of the interception regime. The Victorian commission Like the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission discharges a critical integrity and oversight role. Commonwealth law already provides a number of investigative powers to that commission, including powers under the interception act. This bill would ensure the commission has powers under Commonwealth law consistent with those available to equivalent state anti-corruption bodies.",22,Bills
8,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime MinisterProceeds of crime The Proceeds of Crime Act is a key part of our response to serious and organised crime. It creates a scheme to trace, restrain and confiscate the proceeds and benefits gained from criminal activity. The bill clarifies that property or wealth is not to be considered 'lawfully acquired' where it has been subject to a security or loan that has been discharged using property that is not lawfully acquired. These amendments address the consequences of the West Australian Supreme Court decision in Commissioner of the Australian Federal Policev Huang and ensure criminals cannot circumvent the Proceeds of Crime Act. The amendments are necessary to prevent criminals from funnelling unlawfully obtained funds into real property, which is one of the most common assets restrained under proceeds of crime actions-by, for example, obtaining a mortgage using a lawfully obtained sum as a deposit, then using proceeds of crime to pay off that loan. The bill clarifies that courts must 'follow the money' and examine the arrangements underpinning the acquisition of property in determining whether the property has been 'lawfully acquired'. This bill demonstrates that the government remains committed to making our streets and communities safer by taking effective steps to combat crime. Conclusion This bill will ensure agencies responsible for combating serious criminal activity are able to access the tools that they need to support their functions and that those tools are fully effective. I therefore commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Bill 2016 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Keenan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading for Counter-Terrorism) (09:37): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Bill 2016 (the bill) will amend the Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) to require entities subject to the Privacy Act to notify the Australian Information Commissioner and affected individuals if the entity experiences a data breach of a kind specified in the bill. High-profile data breaches in recent years, such as the breaches involving the dating website Ashley Madison or the US Office of Personnel Management, have demonstrated the potential harm that can result to individuals following unauthorised access to or unauthorised disclosure of personal information.",23,Bills
9,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime MinisterThe rationale for mandatory data breach notification is that, if an individual is at likely risk of serious harm because of a data breach involving their personal information, receiving notification of the breach can allow that person to take action to protect themselves from that harm. For example, an affected individual might change an online password or cancel a credit card after receiving notification that their personal information has been compromised in a data breach. Forty-seven US states currently have mandatory data breach notification schemes to deal with data breaches of this kind. Canada and the European Union have introduced schemes which are yet to commence, whilst New Zealand has also committed to introducing a scheme. By contrast, with the exception of eHealth data breaches falling under the My Health Records Act 2012, mandatory data breach notification does not exist yet in Australia. The former Labor government's Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2013 received bipartisan support to introduce such a scheme, but did not pass the parliament before the 2013 election. Background to the bill The mandatory data breach notification scheme contained in this bill implements a commitment the government made in response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's February 2015 report on the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015. The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) recommended the introduction of a mandatory data breach notification scheme in its 2008 review of Australian privacy laws. Following that review, the Australian Privacy Commissioner established a voluntary data breach notification scheme based on the principles the ALRC recommended, and published guidance material about appropriate data breach notification practices. The voluntary data scheme received 107 notifications in 2015-16, which is 245 per cent higher than the 44 notifications received in 2009-10. Despite this scheme, the commissioner has publicly expressed concerns that data breaches in Australia go underreported. The bill draws on the ALRC's recommendation and practical experience gained from the commissioner's voluntary scheme and associated guidance material. It is also expected that the commissioner would issue guidance material under the mandatory scheme to assist entities to comply. Consultation undertaken in developing the bill The bill has also been subject to extensive consultation before introduction to ensure that the proposed scheme provides effective privacy provisions for Australians without placing an unreasonable regulatory burden on industry. Exposure draft legislation and explanatory material was released for public consultation between 3 December 2015 and 4 March this year. Forty-seven public submissions were received on the exposure draft; most supported the proposal or were supportive subject to particular technical changes. The Attorney-General's Department also held discussions with a broad range of industry and civil society stakeholders during the consultation period. The government considered all stakeholder contributions made during the consultation. This has helped ensure that the bill's mandatory data breach notification scheme is workable for regulated entities while still protecting the privacy of individuals. Operation of the bill The Privacy Act currently requires most Australian government agencies, private sector organisations with annual turnover of more than $3 million and specific kinds of smaller organisations (such as health service providers) to take reasonable steps to protect personal information they hold. Equivalent requirements also apply to specific other kinds of information, such as tax file number information. The bill's mandatory data breach notification scheme applies to all entities who are subject to these existing requirements and experience an 'eligible data breach'. An eligible data breach is 'notifiable', as per the bill's title, where it satisfies conditions specified in the bill, and no exceptions to notification policy apply. An eligible data breach is where there is unauthorised access, unauthorised disclosure or loss of personal information that a reasonable person would conclude is likely to result in serious harm to individuals. Experiencing an eligible data breach under the bill will not necessarily mean that the entity concerned has breached the existing Privacy Act information security requirements. For example, it is possible that, despite having taken reasonable steps to secure personal information it holds, an entity may nonetheless experience a data breach due to human error or other circumstances that are not reasonably foreseeable. Where an entity has reason to suspect that an eligible data breach may have occurred, the entity is required to undertake a reasonable assessment of the circumstances. If an entity has reasonable grounds to believe they have experienced an eligible data breach, after an assessment or otherwise, the entity must notify the Information Commissioner and affected individuals. The entity has flexibility to notify affected individuals directly or, if that is not practicable, to publish an online notice about the eligible data breach. Entities are required to undertake notification in these forms unless an exception applies. These exceptions are designed to balance privacy protections of individuals with other matters in the public interest, such as avoiding prejudicing the activities of law enforcement agencies or disclosing information where that disclosure would be inconsistent with a secrecy provision in another law. An exception will also apply where an entity can determine with a high degree of confidence that it has taken action to remediate the harm arising from an eligible data breach before that harm has occurred. Finally, entities can apply to the Information Commissioner for an exception from the notification requirement, either altogether or for a specific period of time. The commissioner has an additional power to direct an entity to notify an eligible data breach. The mandatory data breach notification scheme in this bill is connected to the existing enforcement framework under the Privacy Act. This means that the Information Commissioner's existing investigatory powers will apply in the event that an entity breaches a requirement of the bill. This will ensure that the commissioner can investigate possible non-compliance with the mandatory data breach notification scheme, and potentially make a determination requiring the entity to remedy such non-compliance. In the case of serious or repeated non-compliance, the commissioner can also apply to a court to impose a civil penalty. Conclusion This bill will improve the privacy protection of Australians in the event of a data breach without placing an unreasonable regulatory burden on business. The extensive consultation undertaken in developing the bill will ensure that the bill's mandatory data breach notification scheme is both workable and effective. Debate adjourned. Migration Amendment (Visa Revalidation and Other Measures) Bill 2016 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Dutton. Bill read a first time. Second Reading move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Migration Amendment (Visa Revalidation and Other Measures) Bill 2016 amends the Migration Act 1958 to support important government initiatives which seek to promote Australia as an attractive destination. It will also facilitate the use of enhanced technology to improve the traveller experience at the Australian border. Schedule 1-Visa revalidation Schedule1 to the bill contains amendments to the Migration Act to introduce a visa revalidation requirement. This will support the pilot of the proposed new 10-year validity visitor visa to ensure that only genuine visitors retain the right to travel to and enter Australia. Tourism is a vital part of the Australian economy, providing employment for around 600,000 Australians and accounting for more than $120 billion of economic activity. The government is committed to boosting tourism across the nation, which in turn helps grow our domestic economy. The introduction of a 10-year visitor visa will encourage repeat visits by genuine tourists and businesspeople choosing Australia as their preferred destination. However, 10 years is a long time and it is likely that an individual's circumstances will change throughout the visa validity period. To manage the risks that this may present, schedule 1 of the bill introduces a mechanism that will allow for the department to seek revalidation of certain information from visa holders over the life of the visa, either through a 'routine' revalidation or a 'public interest' revalidation. This 'revalidation' will be used to ensure that visa holders continue to meet genuine temporary entrant, identity, health, character, passport, national security and other criteria over the 10-year period.",24,Bills
10,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (09:46): IThe introduction of a 'routine' revalidation requirement will simplify visa processes for frequent travellers. It means that, after completing a visitor visa application and being granted a visa, a frequent traveller will not need to do so again for up to 10 years. Instead, they will only need to periodically revalidate some key details. This will result in a significant reduction in red tape for low-risk, high-volume travellers to Australia. It is an example of how we are making the visa process for travellers easier, and seamless. It is expected that the introduction of longer validity visas will also lead to an increase in the total number of visitor visa holders overseas. In terms of travel facilitation this is a desirable outcome, allowing potential visitors to more easily take advantage of last-minute travel deals and choose Australia as their preferred destination-but we also need to consider the risks. A serious incident overseas, for example, may create a situation where it is in the public interest to reassess a number of longer validity visa holders' individual circumstances. Accordingly, schedule 1 of the bill also introduces a 'public interest' revalidation check to manage specific, serious, or time-critical risks in relation to an identified cohort of visa holders. In such circumstances, issuing a personal ministerial revalidation requirement will immediately prevent specified visa holders from being able to travel to and enter Australia until they successfully revalidate their visa. This will ensure that we have up-to-date information on an individual's circumstances and we can effectively mitigate potential risks to the Australian public, while providing a streamlined mechanism to facilitate travel as appropriate. In our digital age, international travellers increasingly expect to be able to transact with the government online. Accordingly, governments are increasingly playing a role to deliver seamless, accessible and timely services to clients to meet both public expectations and a broader digital transformation agenda. Revalidation is consistent with this digital approach by facilitating real-time interactions online between visa holders and the government. It provides an online mechanism for visa holders to update the information they have previously provided (for example, contact details) as their circumstances change. The amendments in schedule 1 of the bill will ensure that both the integrity of the visitor visa framework and public confidence in the visitor visa program are maintained as the new 10-year visa is introduced. Schedule 2-Cessation of visas not in effect The amendments made by schedule 2 clarify the circumstances in which a visa can cease to be in effect under the Migration Act. While most visas come into effect immediately upon the grant of the visa, there are a small number of visa classes that are granted, but do not come into effect immediately. There is currently ambiguity as to whether a 'ceasing event' under sections 82, 173 and 174 of the Migration Act can apply to a visa that has been granted, but not in effect. The amendments contained within schedule 2 will ensure that, subject to limited exceptions, a visa will cease if a relevant ceasing provision applies to it, even if the visa is not in effect at the relevant time. The measure is particularly important in light of the new revalidation check framework being introduced by schedule 1 of the bill which will increase the number of persons who may hold a visa that is not in effect at a particular time. Schedule 3-Contactless immigration clearance Finally, schedule 3 of the bill makes amendments to support the next generation of contactless smart gates. In 2014-15, over 19 million travellers arrived into Australia, of which over six million selfprocessed through our automated immigration clearance system known as SmartGate. Forecasts suggest that the number of travellers arriving in Australia will increase by almost 25 per cent over the next four years. To meet the challenges associated with the ever increasing number of travellers, this government continues to implement new technologies at our borders to ensure that the ABF can continue to facilitate traveller flows, minimise delays and identify persons of concern. As part of the 2015-16 budget, the government committed $93.7 million to the Seamless Traveller initiative, which included the expansion of SmartGates, and when fully implemented, we expect 90 per cent of travellers will self-process through these gates. The next generation of SmartGates use leading edge technology to confirm a traveller's identity without the traveller having to present their ePassport. The live facial image of the traveller at the SmartGate will be compared with a verified image from departmental holdings to confirm a traveller's identity. As such, travellers will no longer be required to physically present their passport unless specifically requested, therefore reducing the time it will take for a traveller to self-process through a SmartGate. However, while they may not be required to present it, it is important to note that travellers will still be required to hold a valid passport and carry that passport with them whilst travelling. In addition to faster processing and a reduction in queues, contactless technology delivers stronger security at our border, as the identity of the traveller is based on a facial image as a unique identifier, instead of document based checks. This automated system will remain voluntary and travellers can choose to use SmartGates or be processed by a clearance officer. Contactless SmartGates will be available to both Australian citizens and non-citizens departing and arriving into Australia, expanding the selfprocessing option to a greater number of travellers. Additionally, as more and more travellers self-process through SmartGates, Australian Border Force officers can be freed up from manual processing tasks to focus instead on higher risk traveller interventions. Introducing contactless technology into our border clearance processes is an important step in strengthening border security as traveller numbers continue to grow, and the amendments in schedule 3 of this bill will enable the use of this world-class, contactless SmartGate technology. Conclusion In conclusion, this bill makes a number of important amendments that will not only ensure that visa holders continue to meet entry requirements under the 10-year visitor visa pilot, but also support improved and streamlined passenger movements at our borders. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Consideration of Legislation move: That, in respect of proceedings specifically on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the following from occurring: (1) resumption of debate on the second reading of the bill being called on and the first Opposition Member immediately called to speak; (2) at the conclusion of the speech of the first Opposition Member on the second reading of the bill, the Prime Minister being called immediately to conclude the second reading debate and the question then being put immediately on the second reading of the bill, a Governor General's message being reported and the question being put immediately on the third reading of the bill; and (3) any variation to this arrangement to be made only by a motion moved by a Minister. The debate management motion that I am moving this morning will ensure that the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill can be dealt with expeditiously by the House and be transmitted to the Senate. We hope it will be passed in the Senate. This will be the fourth time that the House of Representatives will have considered exactly the same bill. So, to anticipate the Manager of Opposition Business's outrage about a debate management motion on this bill, the reality is that this is exactly the same bill that has been passed by the House of Representatives three times. I hesitate to pre-empt the House of Representatives but I suspect that it will be voted on and passed a fourth time today and transmitted to the Senate. The bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives and the second reading was moved on 14 November 2013. It was referred to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee on the same date, with a public hearing in Melbourne on 26 November 2013. That report was delivered on 2 December. A second reading debate occurred here in the House on the 3, 11, and 12 December. It was referred to the Senate Education and Employment References Committee on 9 December with a public hearing in Sydney. It was passed by the House of Representatives on the second and third reading on 12 December 2013. It was then introduced into the Senate and the second reading was moved on 12 December. The Senate Education and Employment References Committee report was delivered. The second reading debate occurred on 13 and 14 May 2014 and, unfortunately, the bill was negatived by the Senate on 14 May 2014. Then the exact same bill was introduced into the House of Representatives and the second reading was moved on 19 June 2014. The second reading debate occurred on 25 June and 14 and 15 July. The bill was amended by the government on 15 July and passed by the House of Representatives through all stages on 15 July 2014. It was introduced into the Senate and the second reading was moved on 17 July 2014. The second reading debate occurred in that place",27,Bills
11,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (09:55): Ion 11 and 12 February and 2 March 2015-so many, many months later. The second reading was negatived by the Senate on 2 March 2015. We tried a third time in the last parliament, the 44th Parliament. We introduced the same bill and the second reading was moved on 19 March 2015. It was referred to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee on 14 May 2015, and the second reading debate occurred on 25 June 2015. It was passed by the House of Representatives on 25 June 2015. It was then introduced into the Senate on 25 June 2015. The Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee reported on 11 August. The second reading was moved and the second reading debate occurred on 17 August 2015, and it was negatived by the Senate on 17 August 2015. This is one of my more compelling speeches! Finally, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 was introduced into the House of Representatives and the second reading was moved on 31 August 2016 in this parliament and was immediately again referred to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee on 1 September. My point, after that voluminous and long list of scrutiny of this bill, is that this matter has been dealt with again, and again and again. It has been looked at from every possible anglefrom upside down and inside out. This bill has been referred to Senate committees. It has been looked at scrutinised by the House of Representatives. It has been dealt with on three occasions-even more than the Australian Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013. We know exactly what the Labor Party's position is and, given the automatons that populate the House of Representatives for the Labor Party, especially among the 22 new members, none of whom would dare to have a different view to their factional bossesRegistered Organisations Commission. It would be nice to think that I could be surprised by a Labor Party member having an original thought of their own that they put to the House of Representatives but, sadly, after some decades in this place I am reasonably confident that not one member of the Labor Party will cross the floor to vote with the government on the Registered Organisations Commission bill. Therefore I commend my motion to the House. Bruce used an unparliamentary term. He will withdraw. Mr Hill: I don't know what I said. Mr Hill: I withdraw. a division is coming on. I would have thought they would wish to be here for it. comments that the Leader of the House concluded with, because he was talking about members on this side. I think the challenge for him in moving this motion is not whether or not members of the Labor Party will say something he was not expecting but that he is now dealing with the fact that members of his own side, almost every hour, say things that he was not expecting.",30,Business

17,Mr Burke (Watson,"Manager of Opposition Business) (10:00): I will start with theIt is hard to believe that today is Wednesday, because the government have brought forward their weekly stuff-up. We had got used to the fact that either on the Wednesday or Thursday of a parliamentary sitting week the government would bring forward their own-goal either by not being here or, as was the case last week, by being here and deciding to spontaneously combust and vote with the Labor Party. This week the own-goal moved from members of the backbench or members of the frontbench to the Prime Minister and they brought forward the stuff-up to the Tuesday. That is why we are having motions like the one before us today. Let's not forget what the radio coverage was full of on Monday morning. On Monday morning we were told that in this parliamentary sitting week the government were going to spend the entire week debating industrial relations, debating the bills that were the reason for the double dissolution. Of course, what then happened was that they got to Tuesday morning and decided it was time not to have the debate but to shut the debate down. If they thought this debate was going well for them, they would have it. Let's not forget that the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, the one that we are talking about now, is one that they never want to have the debate on in the parliament. Earlier this year the parliament was prorogued in what was viewed at the time as a great constitutional stunt from the Prime Minister. We all went across to the other place for one of those riveting Governor General's speeches that we all look forward to, and the Governor General gave both houses the job of dealing with two items of legislation. This bill was one of them, and the government never even brought the bill on for debate. The government do not want there to be a discussion of this piece of legislation. They did not bring it on when the parliament was prorogued and now, after having a double dissolution on two pieces of legislation, they do not want members of parliament to talk about the reason for there being a double dissolution federal election. The member for Sturt has been here for a long time. Many of his constituents would believe he has been here for a very, very, very long time. It seems not to have occurred to the member for Sturt, as he is gradually consumed by the green leather, that there are a large number of members of parliament, who are in the chamber right now, who have never had the opportunity to speak on this bill. They came to this parliament in a double dissolution election that was meant to be about this piece of legislation, and the motion from the Leader of the House, which is before the House right now, says they will never get to talk on this piece of legislation. If the government have the courage of their convictions, if the government think this is a piece of legislation worth defending, then they should defend it. But they will not; they will not defend this piece of legislation. The opposition will be moving amendments in the other place, and when the opposition spokesperson on this issue, the shadow minister, makes his contribution he will be foreshadowing those amendments to the House for the first time. It is reasonable to have a consideration in detail opportunity to be able to question the government on the impact of the issues that will be raised in those amendments. It is reasonable to have a consideration in detail stage of the debate to allow questions to be asked of the minister at the table-to ask questions of the person with portfolio responsibility in this House. Of course, the person with portfolio responsibility is the Leader of the House. The person who would have to answer those questions and defend the bill is the Leader of the House. The person who would have to understand what was in the bill in front of the chamber is the person who is moving the motion to make sure he does not have to answer any of those questions. It is no accident that somebody who has a reputation for being rhetoric rich but policy light does not want there to be any opportunity in this House for arguments to be directed at him or for questions to be asked where he would be responsible for providing answers to the House. I will be moving an amendment to the motion, to be seconded by the shadow minister, which would allow there to be a consideration in detail stage. Obviously, we are opposed to the whole motion. We are opposed to the concept of gagging debate on any piece of legislation, where you take away the rights of members of parliament. But for a parliament that was formed to have a view about this bill, it is beyond belief that we now have a motion preventing members of parliament from expressing a view on the bill. Of all the pieces of legislation to gag, you should not be gagging-this House should not be limiting-debate on items of legislation that were the double dissolution trigger. It is bad enough to do it on any bill, but people on each side of the parliament have been elected based on that double dissolution having been called, and the government now says, 'That may well be true, but we'd rather no-one spoke about it.' If you do not want people to be able to make speeches, I do not understand why you want to be elected to the parliament. I do not understand why those opposite, if they have such a problem with people putting a point of view, view this as a safe workplace for them to be involved in. If the Leader of the House hates the concept of the house debating legislation, I would suggest he probably ought to get a different job. As the Leader of the House he is meant to be the defender of the House debate and, at the very least, is meant to be defending the right of the House to debate the issues on which the double dissolution trigger was called. CanI say that, I remember when, previously, under the Howard government, they had contentious legislation. I remember when they had the Work Choices legislation on industrial relations, and they would allow people to try to win the argument. They ended up not winning that argument, but John Howard did not shy away from having the debate. John Howard believed in what he was doing-he believed in something, which would not be a bad start for some of those opposite-and he would have the backbench make the case. Instead, we have a motion today that is designed for government members to bury their own backbench, a motion to make sure they do not take the risk of what their own members might say. The Leader of the House needs to know that his colleagues will find a camera anywhere, even if he shuts them down here. They will find ways to undermine the government, and it will not just be the backbench that manages to undermine this government. As we saw yesterday, even the Prime Minister will have a go from time to time at undermining this government. The amendment that I move is in the exact same terms that have been circulated. It does not turn a dreadful resolution into a good one, but it does allow there to be a consideration in detail stage. I therefore move the following amendment to the motion put by the Leader of the House: Omit paragraph 2 and substitute the following words: (2) at the conclusion of the speech of the first Opposition Member on the second reading of the bill, the Prime Minister being called immediately to conclude the second reading debate and the question then being put immediately on the second reading of the bill, a Governor General’s message being reported, a consideration in detail stage taking place, any questions necessary to complete the detail stage being put and the question being put immediately on the third reading of the bill; AndI urge the government: if they want to truncate the consideration in detail stage after people have had a chance to give five minute speeches and to ask questions, then they will still do so and move that the question be put. But the alternative to allowing this amendment is to say that not one new member of parliament gets to have their say on one of the triggers for the double dissolution election. It is an extraordinary attempt by the Leader of the House to silence this parliament. The amendment that is being put forward is modest. It does not fix the problem but it at least stops what is in front of us right now from making a complete joke of what was meant to be the purpose of the election. If the Leader of the House just wants to accept that the double dissolution game from the Prime Minister was a joke, he will vote against this amendment. If he believes that members of parliament who are new members of parliament have something to contribute, including from his own side, then he will take the risk and allow the parliament to do something really radical, like debate a piece of legislation. exactly why. We know that this government has, firstly, predicated an election on two bills. There was the double dissolution election-of which, of course, one bill was not quite debated yesterday. We had a gag to not debate the ABCC legislation and not have consideration in detail on that bill. The Manager of Opposition Business has, I believe, compellingly argued the case that members of this place deserve a right to consider the detail of this bill, a bill that is supposedly so important that the Prime Minister chose to run an election on it. Of course, he did not mention this bill or the bill that was gagged yesterday for 55 days during the election campaign. We barely heard that mentioned in the entire election campaign, one of the longest election campaigns this country has ever seen-a very good tactical move by the Prime Minister, I might add. We have some serious issues to raise with respect to this bill. As the Manager of Opposition Business has made perfectly clear, we are not happy with the attempts to stop members of parliament speaking on this matter. In particular, those new members of parliament that sit behind me now, that were elected to this place for the first time, have never contributed to this area of public policy, this particular bill. And, as the Manager of Opposition Business has made perfectly clear, we did not have an opportunity to go through the proposed amendments we sought to make to this bill because when the Prime Minister chose to prorogue the parliament-you might remember, Mr Speaker, we had a situation where two bills were also the basis upon which that parliament was prorogued. You might recall, the Prime Minister wrote to His Excellency the Governor General, and he referred in that letter to two bills that were so important that we had to prorogue the parliament. I have to say. I think they dragged His Excellency the Governor General into a stunt. And that is not a reflection on the Governor General; I think it was unfair. The hollowness of the sincerity of the Prime Minister was shown on the occasion of our return to parliament in that week because this bill was not debated in this place or in the Senate, despite the fact that they raised with His Excellency the Governor General that it was of such",31,Business
18,The Speaker,Is the amendment seconded?,34,Business
19,Mr Brendan O'connor (Gorton) (10:10,"It is seconded. I would like to explainimportance the parliament had to be prorogued. This is the length that the government is willing to go to to play politics with this issue. If they are so confident in the merits of this bill, why not have a debate in this place? This motion will not fix all of these matters-indeed, it will still restrict the matters insofar as all members speaking-but at least we would have an opportunity to consider in this place, the people's chamber, the proposed amendments that are foreshadowed and will be foreshadowed in my response to the second reading speech and will be moved in the Senate. They are significant amendments. They are not just political amendments. These are amendments that, firstly, consider why, instead of having the registered organisation bodies, we will have ASIC, the regulator of companies, be the regulator for registered organisations. That is a significant amendment and it is one, I believe, the Leader of the House, acting on behalf of the Minister for Employment, should be responding to in this place in consideration in detail on this bill. But, if the Leader of the House votes against the amendment moved, he is saying, 'I'm not willing to answer questions in relation to the government's views on this matter.' He is also not willing to consider the whistleblowers protection that we believe should be afforded to people in registered organisations, or the fact that we would like to see auditors have high levels of accountability in their conduct in such bodies, or the fact that-and this might be, perhaps, the real reason we are not getting consideration in detail-we will seek to move an amendment to this bill that would have electoral disclosure laws at $1,000, not only for candidates of registered organisations but for candidates at federal elections. We know that Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister, likes to talk about transparency and donation reform. If he supports donation reform, they will consider our amendment to this bill that will mean that candidates who want to run in federal elections, to run the country, will have the same laws apply to them as candidates who run in union elections or employer body elections and in the same way. Why not have one law for all elections that are governed by the Australian Electoral Commission? That is the sort of thing we wanted to talk about in this place, but it would appear that the government will gag this amendment, gag this debate on the bill, which is a dreadful shame. honourable member for Watson has moved, as an amendment, that certain words be omitted with a view to substituting other words.

Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. this country-the largest social movement in Australia. Every one of those 1.8 million people belong to a movement that can claim a large share of the credit for building modern Australia. Whether they belong to a union or not, Australians know and appreciate the benefits of what unions have delivered for them: a generous social safety net; decent conditions at work; the weekend itself and penalty rates for working on it or at other unsociable hours; annual leave and sick pay; Medicare and the foregone wage increases to pay for it; universal superannuation; and, perhaps most importantly, occupational health and safety and workers compensation. The reform era so often invoked by pale imitators and editorial boors would not have been possible without the foresight, cooperation and sacrifice of the Australian union movement. No group has done more to raise the living standards of working and middle-class Australians. When the World Bank chief economist and Nobel laureate, Joseph Stiglitz, when visiting Australia, was asked why Australians were faring better than their American counterparts, why our society was more equal and why our society was fairer, he replied in one word: unions. Building a better future for this nation depends upon the active participation of working men and working women and their unions. This is a social and economic reality the Liberal Party have never understood and have always resented. They do not see unions as partners in economic progress. They see them and view them as an obstacle to their true mission: a lowwage, easy-to-hire, easy-to-fire society-a race to the bottom on pay and conditions. And the shabby way they have dealt with this legislation speaks for all of that. Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough, you might remember that the legislation currently before the House is from the Prime Minister's double dissolution. Do you remember that political masterstroke, that agile, innovative move, a compliant new Senate, a thumping new majority-all on the back of this vital legislation? Yet as far as we know it did not get a mention except on day 1 and on night 55 of the election campaign. Now this legislation has been dragged out of the bottom drawer because this is a government that is so bereft of anything to say, so devoid of any plan for the future of this nation. It is a government full of ministers incapable of answering basic questions. It is a government that last week actually voted to censure itself, calling on itself to demand it explain its own failures. Now, in flailing desperation, the Prime Minister has returned to this tired old attack, diving back down into the old anti-union, anti-worker, anti-fairness agenda the Liberals have always clung to. The last two days have brought so much deja vu, haven't they? The master of subtlety, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, deploying his usual forensic skills. The Treasurer, yet again, confusing volume with quality. But I have to say I was a bit disappointed in the Leader of the House. He has gone shy on us. I was waiting for him to leap to his feet",37,Business
22,Mr Brendan O'connor (Gorton) (10:33,"There are 1.8 million union members inand deliver another heartfelt hymn of praise to Kathy Jackson. Remember in 2014 when he summoned us all into this chamber so that he could say: 'Kathy Jackson is a revolutionary. Kathy Jackson will be remembered as a lion of the union movement. More strength to her arm.' But, as usual, the disappointment-in-chief, the crowning mediocrity, came from the Prime Minister. Watching the Prime Minister's performance, such as it was in question time the past two days, we could not help thinking on this side: 'At least when Tony did this, he put his heart into it.' At least when the member for Warringah stood up, he stood for something. He was not this weak, pathetic, sell-out we have now. At least the member for Warringah had a proper crack. He would have had his backbench up and going, clapping along. Instead, they are stuck watching this bad tribute act, this cover band, butchering the Abbott government classics. You can often hear a lot of the flat earthers over there stand up in question time and say, 'Raise your hand if you've had business experience.' And like little school children they raise their hands in glee and begin a crescendo of cries that Labor does not understand how business works. Of course, most of the ones that might have had business experience find their way onto the front bench. They are usually corporate lawyers. Of course, they have other roles in life but they have not run too many corner shops or small businesses. They might have had some business experience-and, indeed, there are people with business experience on this side-but you never hear them say, 'Raise your hands if you've ever represented working people.' That is because they haven't. They are consumed with themselves and their back pockets rather than belonging to a movement that tries to assist all. It should come as no surprise that many of us on this side of the chamber do come from unions, and we are proud of it. We are proud of every day we spent standing up for workers and helping build a prosperous and fair country. Like my colleagues in this place, we are deeply grateful for what the working people of Australia taught us. We would not swap that for Goldman Sachs. It is because on this side of the House we know the importance of the union movement. We value the work unions do on behalf of Australians, who go to work every day and want to come home safe. We support unions and we support the best possible standards of union governance. As I have said many times, as the Labor leader has said and as colleagues on this side have said: Labor has no tolerance for corruption wherever it occurs. Criminal behaviour, whether the offender sits in a boardroom or works in a factory, should be met with the full force of the law. But let's not pretend that this legislation as it stands is about better workplaces or stronger unions. No conservative government in history has ever wanted that-and this mob is no different. The government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to take the slightest skerrick of interest in the criminal rip-offs occurring at 7-Eleven. They were happy to sit back while workers in this country were paid less than half the minimum wage. There are still 7-Eleven workers who have not been paid. There has been no legislative remedy proposed by the government. There has been no priority put forward about the exploitation of workers in relation to that scandal. Indeed, they have done nothing to look at the widespread reports of corruption and rorting in the 457 and temporary work visa systems. Again, the Fair Work Ombudsman on the weekend released a report explaining the scale of exploitation. It does not instil confidence in those visa schemes if we do not redress exploitation. The Prime Minister could not even scratch up a tweet for the Ford workers on the day the factory closed. The only time they talk about wages is when they complain that the wages are too high. For the Liberal Party, workplace relations is always about ideology; it is always about politics. When you look at Labor governments of the past and, I can assure you, Labor governments in the future, you see that when we sit down to talk about the challenges of this country we sit down with employers and unions. They are at the table when we talk about the challenges that confront us as a nation-never the Liberal government. Unions are banished when the Liberals are elected to government. They are banished, they are demonised, they are defamed, they are slandered and they are libelled by members of a Liberal government. That is why they set up that grubby, politically motivated royal commission, with a royal commissioner who wanted to moonlight at Liberal Party fundraisers to smear his opponents. We know this Prime Minister is only talking about this legislation to try and keep the hardright wolves from the door for another week. We have seen it again in terms of his willingness to consider changes to the gun laws in this country. We know what the Nationals want on the Adler shotgun. We know what they want. In fact, Senator McKenzie belled the cat today when she said, 'We want to see a lift on that ban.' The conduct of the Prime Minister and his ministers in dealing with Senator Leyonhjelm is reprehensible. Senator Leyonhjelm has every right to express his views if he wants to liberalise gun laws, but the government has no right to horse trade in that manner. It is all about the Prime Minister trying to secure his support in his party room, and this legislation is all about that. CanI tell you, Deputy Speaker, Labor is better than that. We are interested in improving the legislation to make it worthwhile, to genuinely improve conditions for employees and employers. Of course, that does depend upon an honest conversation. As the Prime Minister often likes to say, 'We need to see the world as it is, not as we would like it to be.' That is why it is worth looking at the existing regulations that already apply under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. From what the Liberals say, you might think there is currently no regulation of registered organisations, as if all lay in darkness until the Prime Minister, who has just joined us, said, 'Let there be light.' Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, as a result of the changes that the Labor leader made when he was minister for workplace relations, we have seen that the regulation of trade unions and registered employer bodies in Australia has never been stronger, accountability has never been higher and the powers of the Fair Work Commission to investigate and prosecute for breaches have never been broader. It is because Labor, only Labor, tripled the penalties for offenders that penalties have never been tougher. Let's be clear about what is already in the registered organisation act. The act already prohibits members' money from being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns. It already allows for criminal proceedings being initiated where funds are stolen or obtained by fraud. It already ensures that the Fair Work Commission can share information with the police, as appropriate. It already provides for statutory civil penalties where a party knowingly or recklessly contravenes an order or direction made by the Federal Court or the Fair Work Commission. Officers of registered organisations already have a fiduciary duty akin to those of directors under the Corporations Law. The act already requires officers to disclose their personal interests. For all of those important protections that already exist, on this side of the House we are genuinely interested in passing good legislation, and that is why we are proposing substantive and constructive amendments to make this legislation worthwhile. Labor believes in better unions, higher standards and tougher penalties for people and organisations who do the wrong thing. First, rather than creating a new government bureaucracy, the Registered Organisations Commission, Labor proposes that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission uses its extensive coercive powers to investigate serious breaches of the Fair Work Act. Second, we will increase penalties for behaviour which is intended to deceive union members or, indeed, members of employer bodies or the regulator. We will double the maximum penalties for all criminal offences under the act. We will increase the fine for false and misleading conduct and, for paid officials who act in a way that materially prejudices the interests of a union or employer body or its members, we will increase the fine from $10,800 to $216,000. Importantly, only officials in paid positions who are responsible for decisions about the financial management of registered organisations will be subject to these aggravated penalties. We will exempt volunteers. The government's bill treats volunteers, workers and small-business people who sit on committees of management like chief executives of corporate boards, except without the same pay and conditions and the expertise they get to rely upon. They are treating them like directors of publicly listed companies. We do not believe that is right. We want people to participate, employer bodies and unions alike. This will deter people participating. It is clear that the Prime Minister and the government are not too worried about these volunteers. We would hope they would accept our amendment to exempt them from the application of this bill. It is also worth making the point that the majority of submissions to the Senate inquiries into the previous iterations of this bill, from both employer bodies and unions, were against measures still contained within this bill. Given that the Prime Minister has joined us, I hope he has listened to the Ai Group who said: If the proposed criminal penalties and proposed massive financial penalties for breaches of duties are included in the RO Act, this would operate as a major disincentive to existing voluntary officers of registered organisations continuing in their roles, and would deter other people from holding office. While the Ai Group apparently now support the bill-I still believe they support our amendment-despite these elements being just as problematic, these are genuine concerns that have not been addressed by the government. We will also create a new penalty provision for improper participation in a decision by those seeking to personally benefit, punishable by a fine of up to $216,000 for very serious contraventions. Third, Labor's amendments will increase audit requirements and penalties for auditors. We want to make sure that the people who are charged with the responsibility of independently examining the finances of registered organisations do it in a professional and accountable manner. Auditors who choose not to report malfeasance or criminal misconduct in registered organisations could themselves be subject to imprisonment. This will ensure that auditors are not complicit in their silence. Further in relation to auditing, we will require the rotation of auditors so that there is sufficient turnover to ensure that new parties come in to examine the books, resulting in greater security and independence. Fourth, we are proposing a new donation threshold for union officials and politicians alike. It is time to extend the current electoral funding laws to donations and expenditure for all elections managed by the Australian Electoral Commission, whether they are union elections or indeed a federal election. Any entity associated with candidates in such elections should be required to publicly disclose the total value of payments made, receipts and debts each year. For a long time, Labor has argued for lower disclosure thresholds. Our amendments to this legislation will reduce the current disclosure thresholds in the Commonwealth Electoral Act for election funding from over $13,000 to $1,000, as well as prohibiting anonymous donations over $50 and introducing measures to end the practice of donation splitting by related entities, which can be used to avoid disclosure thresholds and undermine donation transparency. We really do hope the government are listening to this amendment. We hear a lot of rhetoric about improving transparency with respect to donations. We hear a lot of rhetoric from the government and in particular from the Prime Minister. He has an opportunity with this bill to support Labor's measure to reduce the disclosure threshold so that candidates in federal elections will have to disclose at the same level as union candidates and, indeed, employer body candidates of elections. The government, of course, as we have seen, are happy to go after unions when it comes to disclosure thresholds and transparency, but to date they have not been willing to apply the same standards to themselves. Think about this: the Liberals want to have a higher standard of donation disclosure on those who seek to run a union than on those who want to run the country. Five, we want stronger protections for whistleblowers. Currently, the penalties for those taking adverse action against whistleblowers are limited to $4,500 or imprisonment for six months or both. Labor's improvement to this legislation will extend whistleblower protections to the private and not-for-profit sector. This means people who seek to intimidate or silence whistleblowers will face up to two years in jail and a fine of up to $18,000. And whistleblowers themselves will be able to take civil action for reinstatement and compensation. These are substantive proposed improvements that Labor wants to put in place to the proposed legislation in order to transform it from a piece of political puffery to a genuine act of better governance. This is, of course, a test for the government. They can beat their chests, they can carry on with the same dreary old scare campaign, desperately seeking one last crumb of political advantage, and they can continue in relation to their rhetoric about donations. We know the Prime Minister likes donations-he has two million reasons whybut, if he wants to see improvements to donations, if he wants to see improvements to disclosures, if he wants to apply the same law to unions as to himself and other members of this place, he will support our amendment in relation to improving disclosure by reducing the thresholds for all elections that are governed by the Australian Electoral Commission. On this side of the House we know where we stand. We are here to offer tougher penalties, higher standards, greater transparency for union candidates and for candidates who want to run in federal elections, and a better way forward for employer bodies and unions. That is the Labor tradition. We are proud to live up to it today. We would ask the government to seriously consider these amendments, because they are moved in good faith. We have a few weeks, because the Senate does not sit until 7 November. We would say to the Prime Minister in particular, let us have a conversation on these amendments. We will certainly be talking to the crossbenchers. I am very happy to be talking to the Minister for Employment on these matters, because we believe that these amendments will add value, and we think that if the government and the Prime Minister were sincere in relation to this issue they would take up our offer to consider these amendments in a genuine way. Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill. It is the second vital tranche of workplace reforms reintroduced into this House for the fourth time this week. As I said in my speech introducing this bill third time it was brought into the House, since 2013 the coalition has sought repeatedly to honour the commitment it made to the Australian people to legislate to improve the governance and accountability of registered organisations-unions and employer organisations. The legislation was blocked by the previous Senate repeatedly and, consequently, it was one of the two reasons for July's double dissolution election. We fought the election on these commitments to workplace reform and we won. The mandate to proceed with this bill is clear and the case for reform is compelling. Better run workplaces, safer workplaces, workplaces not subject to corrupt or unlawful behaviour will deliver stronger economic growth, more jobs and higher wages. This was never about union busting; it is about economy boosting. Following our election, we are therefore, again, for the fourth time seeking to honour our commitment to the Australian people by reintroducing this bill. Mr Perrett interjectingorganisations play in workplaces in Australia. These organisations-unions and employer organisations-stand in positions of trust. To remain strong, it is vital that they are seen to do the right thing by their members. Yet the truth is that officials of some of these organisations have been in flagrant abuse of the responsibilities they owe to their members. They have misused union funds for personal gain. They have rorted membership rolls to increase their clout within the Labor Party. They have ripped off hard working members to indulge their own political or personal interests. Is it any wonder that union representation in the workforce, particularly the private sector workforce, is at an all-time low? Is it any wonder that there should be a crisis of confidence in this culture on display by too many senior officials in the union movement? The coalition has repeatedly sought to honour the commitment it made to the Australian people to improve the governance and accountability of registered organisations. This is a policy we have now taken to two elections. The case for change has been made. The gross breaches of trust and financial impropriety displayed, for example, by officials of the Health Services Union provided the initial impetus for reform. One senior official is serving a jail sentence; another is currently facing dozens of charges; and yet another has been penalised nearly half a million dollars for his indiscretions. Since then, the findings of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption have revealed myriad examples of bad behaviour by union officials. The current system of regulation is doing very little to deter them. As many judges have noted, they treat the small fines imposed under the current law like parking tickets-a cost of doing business. The royal commission revealed how officials from the National Union of Workers used union credit and corporate cards to pay for dating services, holidays, corporate box seats at major events, toys, hairdressing and other personal services. Officials from the Transport Workers Union used members' funds to purchase two luxury foreign cars and changed redundancy rules to ensure they could keep the cars for their personal use even after they left the union.",39,Bills

25,Mr Turnbull,"The government acknowledges the important role registeredThe TWU also appointed its own official to a concurrent position at its superannuation body. He was paid $93,400 for 2½ days work over the course of the year. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was Secretary of the AWU, accepted a company donation for over $40,000 to pay for a political operative to manage his campaign to win a seat in the federal parliament, and he failed to disclose it until two days before he was due to give evidence at the royal commission. The Leader of the Opposition's successor at the AWU, Cesar Melhem, repeatedly issued false invoices from the AWU to companies, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. At the same time, the unions received lists of the names of the employees of those companies to be added to the union's membership roll. Many of them had no knowledge that they had become union members. Others had their union dues paid by the company when they had already paid them themselves. Those opposite would have us believe that the Heydon royal commission uncovered just a few bad apples. It is true that many union officials are law-abiding and well motivated, but there are systemic issues here, undeniably. In the words of commissioner Heydon: It would be utterly naive to think that what has been uncovered is anything other than the small tip of an enormous iceberg. Mr Perrett interjectingrequirements placed on registered organisations. It will increase penalties for those found to have done the wrong thing and it will establish a strong, independent watchdog, the Registered Organisations Commissioner, to give the regulation of these organisations the focus and the resources it needs. At the same time, it will reduce the unnecessary red tape imposed by the existing act that was the work of the Leader of the Opposition when he last amended these laws. It is clear that the corrupt and illegal conduct of many union officials will continue unless there is effective parliamentary intervention. When politicians are presented with a clear problem for which there is a proven solution, they have a responsibility to act. This is the fourth time members of this parliament have been given the opportunity to consider this legislation to clean up registered organisations. Those opposite have been shameless in their efforts on behalf of their union supporters to frustrate and obstruct this important reform. I have always found it very hard to understand why the Labor Party resists with such fervour this legislation. Given the extent of the scandals exposed in the royal commission and elsewhere, you would have thought leaders of the union movement and their political wing in this parliament would have said, 'Now is the time to clean up our act, to reassure our members and potential members that unions are run in their interest.' But no. When it comes to a choice between protecting the interests of rank-and-file members and defending the freedom of corrupt union officials to rip off those they claim to serve, the Labor Party has locked in slavishly behind the union bosses. Almost a year ago I asked this question of Labor: whose side are you on? Are you on the side of the members or are you on the side of the officials? Sadly, we have the same answer today as we had back then. Those opposite remain stubborn apologists for the appalling exploitation of hard working Australians by union officials abusing their power.

VET Student Loans Bill 2016 VET Student Loans (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2016 VET Student Loans (Charges) Bill 2016 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government's failure to properly administer the VET FEE-HELP scheme, leaving taxpayers and students to deal with the consequences of their mismanagement.' Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (11:16): It is a pleasure to be able to continue to speak on the VET Student Loans Bill 2016 today and, in particular, to support the amendment put forward by the shadow minister for TAFE and vocational education, the member for Adelaide. This cognate debate addresses some very significant and important issues around the VET FEEHELP scheme. As the shadow minister has rightly indicated in the amendment that she put forward, there is an absolute need, given the history leading up to this point, to have a look at the decisions the government have made so far and what has happened on their watch with this scheme, and to allow that understanding to feed into how we respond to this bill. As the shadow minister indicated, the bill has our in-principle support, but we are concerned to ensure that the detail and the implementation are well understood and well explored. This is important because we have seen, since around 2014, a number of changes made by the government to deal with the VET FEE-HELP scheme. I have to say most of those-in fact, all of them-have been supported by the opposition, but, on each and every occasion, we have made the point to the government that they were not taking serious-enough action and they were not acting fast enough. So we again find ourselves with another bill before the House dealing with the VET FEE-HELP scheme and we need to make sure that the detail is right. As many of my colleagues in this place understand well, the vocational educational and training system is complex, it is very large, but it is also critically important to the skills development of this nation, to job opportunities for people across all of our communities, to the expansion and growth of new businesses and new industry sectors. It is not given too often the attention it deserves as an important sector in the education story across the country. I was very pleased when we first went into opposition that the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, gave it priority and created a dedicated shadow ministry for it. It is a bit disappointing to see the government, having followed that led, now downgrade it to an assistant minister position, although I acknowledge that the minister in the other place has responsibility for and carriage of it as well. The VET FEE-HELP payment system sits within the HELP scheme, and the story of how this developed is important to understand so you can look at how you are going to deal with the rorts and disgraceful behaviours that have been exposed in recent years. Of course, John Howard originally put forward the proposition to extend the HELP scheme to people who were studying in the vocational education and training sector. When Labor came into government, we implemented and continued that proposition because it was clear that some people studying at the higher levels of vocational education were facing costs that were a bit prohibitive in terms of finding the money up-front. So it was then, and I think it is still, a reasonable proposition to have a loan scheme available. There were some changes made in 2012 to the scheme to broaden its capacity to provide funding for students doing diploma levels, with a bit of a trial around the certificate IV level qualification. Given the nature of the debate that has gone on this place and the attempt by government speaker after government speaker to portray this as a Labor failure somehow, it is important to point out that not only was it initially John Howard's idea but the introduction and changes that we made in government were supported by those opposite. In fact, some of them in speaking made the point that it was good to get red tape out of the sector. By 2014, there had been a change of government and those opposite were in power. There started to emerge, particularly in the media, stories about abuses happening in the scheme, and those were largely around quality issues and the exploitation of students. My first comments on my concerns about this were in response to the ASQA reports that were done on some of the industry sectors and behaviours that had become apparent and that ASQA were alerting the government to. In the intervening time, Senator Kim Carr and I began to raise with the government our serious concerns about what was happening with the scheme. Now, if you set up any government scheme-and those opposite are progressing a line that governments can set up schemes and then just turn a blind eye and ignore whatever happens to them-you actually have to monitor and be on top of what is happening in that scheme as it operates. I have with me a massive pile of media releases that Senator Carr and I put out over that period of time calling on the government to respond with some urgency and effectiveness to what was unfolding in the sector. They start from February 2014. At that point, it was becoming quite obvious that quality was in danger. At that point, it was then Minister for Industry, Minister Macfarlane, who was responsible for the sector. We were concerned, particularly because ASQA reports had come out about different sectors where issues had been raised of exploitation and poor quality. The minister was at that point basically running the line that there was too much regulation in the system, and that caused us very great concern. Between then and now, there was report after report on this in the broadsheet newspapers and the ABC's Background Briefing ran some excellent exposes. It was quite clear that there was a significant market failure that meant that vulnerable students were being signed up to completely inappropriate courses at exorbitant prices with little chance of repaying their debts. There were real implications on many levels that required serious action. The government did some tinkering around with standards and the operation of the scheme, over a number of changes. On each occasion we said: 'We will support this; it is good. You need to deal with standards and you need to deal with regulation, but you need to go further; this is a systemic problem.' But we kept being told: 'No, these are one-offs. It is just a small section of the private education sector that is doing the wrong thing.' That was not the case. There was evidence brought before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Employment and the Senate committees about the systemic nature of this behaviour and how problematic it was. The really frustrating part of that was that the year we left government about $700 million was spent on VET FEE-HELP loans. That had blown out to $3 billion in the 2015 year. It was growing at an exorbitant rate-a rate that one would think would raise some sort of red flag with the government. I mean, in 12 months the scheme more than doubled. There were providers who in a 12-month period massively increased the amount of training they were providing. Anybody who understood the system would have been looking at that thinking: 'Hang on. How on earth can you grow at that rate and actually be delivering quality education and training?' The system of VET FEE-HELP was sending red flags that the government should have been aware of, should have been monitoring, and should have responded to more quickly and more effectively. Under this government's watch, we saw over that time massive damage being done to the reputation of the sector, significant disadvantage to the students who were being signed up and completion rates of five per cent. Why? Because there was no interest in signing up students who had the capacity to complete the course. In fact, infamously, one provider on Paddy Manning's ABC radio show said, 'That was an effective business model. It is actually much cheaper if you sign up people who have no intention of studying'-just an extraordinary attitude and extraordinary behaviour. Prior to the election, the government put out their discussion paper. I was quite critical during the election campaign of the fact that the government did not have any policies in the vocational education and training sector other than the discussion paper and the implication at the time that that would lead to a second paper with detailed proposals. Instead of that, of course, we now have the bill before us. SoI am sure that people will understand why, as an opposition who absolutely care about this sector, we want to make sure that the detail is right this time and that it is well understood and explored across the whole sector. In the context of VET FEE-HELP sitting within the vocational education and training sector, I also make the point very strongly to government-since they have grabbed all Labor's policy proposals on VET FEE-HELP, including the cap which they have now adopted but which they spent all the election campaign rubbishing and scaremongering about-that this sector deserves more attention and more commitment from the government than it has seen since 2013. The sector has had over $2 billion ripped out, programs for workforce development scrapped, programs for language and literacy scrapped and apprenticeship programs gutted. The end result of that is that we have seen massive and significant damage to a critically important sector. We have seen over 120,000 apprenticeships across this country lost under the government's watch. They need not only to deal with the VET FEEHELP issue but to get a strategic approach to vocational education and training and give it a serious commitment. At the election, we put forward a proposal that we would in government have a sector-wide review. We did Gonski for the school sector; we did Bradley for the university sector. It is absolutely time that there was a review of the entire vocational education sector, how it is delivering now and how it will deliver in the future. An important part of that is the fact that within the sector sits our great public provider-our TAFE systems. As a result of what has gone on, they are being brought to their knees in many, many places. We saw the devastation in Victoria, and the Andrews government are now having to rebuild the TAFE sector in that state. In New South Wales, my colleague from the Central Coast and I have seen what is happening to TAFEs in regional and rural areas in particular, where you are seeing courses cut, staff sacked and campuses closed. This is a critically important issue. I know the government do not like to mention public sectors at all and I rarely hear them mention TAFE, but they need to get behind rebuilding and supporting our public TAFE institutes. TAFEs are the backbone of the VET sector-they set the standards, they tell people what quality looks like and they tell people what a reasonable price looks like. So the government need to take real action in supporting TAFE across the country. I would also say that there are some great private sector providers out there, and this scandal has damaged them. There are people who have been around for decades with real expertise in their particular area, with a love of education, who do a sterling job across the not-for-profit and profit based private sectors. They deserve not only for the problems in VET FEE-HELP to be addressed but for the government to take a serious look at how vocational education and training is going to operate into the future. They deserve some certainty and direction so that they can continue to operate as well. We need vocational education and training put on the front foot and on the agenda of this government. Labor have been calling for this since 2013. There should be no more cuts. The government are about to make $7 billion in savings out of these measures. Let's see some of that money reinvested in the vocational education and training sector; let's hear a serious conversation about a new national partnership; and let's see some real action to back TAFEs and apprenticeships. appreciate the opportunity to speak in relation to the Vet Student Loans Bill 2016. BeforeI commence I would like to acknowledge the young people in the gallery this morning and wish them well in their studies. I would also like to recognise the students in Victoria who are approaching their Victorian VCE exams in the coming week-next Wednesday. I wish all the students well, and I am sure all members wish year 12 students around the nation well in this very challenging time in their lives. I offer a little reminder to students that a number, an ATAR score, on a piece of paper will never define them as a person. There are many, many ways of achieving success in their future careers. While the ATAR score is a measurement tool, it is important to remember that there are many pathways to future success. I know from personal experience as someone who never went to university, who went on to do a journalism cadetship, that it has not held me back in my aspirations for the future. I know you, Deputy Speaker, parted company with your high school under mutually agreeable termsthat you went on to become an apprentice shoemaker and have been wearing that shoe leather ever since. It certainly has not held you back in your career aspirations to be a state member of parliament and now the federal member of parliament for McEwen. I guess the lesson in that for all of us is that there are many pathways to success. It can be a very stressful time for students who are approaching their VCE exams, but there is a great deal of support out there for them, whether that be through their own family, their network of friends or their teachers. I also point out that organisations like the digital mental health organisation ReachOut Australia, which is supported by the government and corporate donors, have resources to support year 12 students if they are finding things tough. I encourage young people going through this stressful time in their lives to make sure they reach out for assistance if they need it. Obviously, after their exams some students will go on to university but others will choose other pathways and pursue different options, and that is what today's bill is all about-it is all about protecting the integrity of an important education pathway, that being vocational education. There is no doubt that the VET Student Loans reform which is before us today is well and truly required and, in some instances, is a response to some very inappropriate behaviour",48,Bills

34,Mr Chester,"and were perhaps encouraged to find another career option. I understandthroughout our nation. The government intends to replace the failed VET FEE-HELP scheme with the VET Student Loans program from 1 January 2017. The scheme will include a range of measures to protect students and Australian taxpayers, and to restore some trust in the vocational education sector. This is especially important, Deputy Speaker, for young people from regional areas. You and I know that, at this stage, students in our regional communities do not participate in tertiary education as much as students from metropolitan areas, but young people from regional areas do participate very strongly in apprentice courses and TAFE programs at a higher level. People from our regional communities want the opportunity to access reputable courses in their own community as much as they possibly can and for those courses to offer a pathway into full-time employment. People with honest intentions, who have participated in these courses expecting to land a job with their new qualifications, have been badly let down by the unscrupulous operators this bill seeks to address. The operators who acted in this unscrupulous manner-and I congratulate the Minister for Education and Training for recognising this-have effectively rorted the system. I think it is terribly important to recognise that they preyed on vulnerable students, who were the innocent victims in this process. The businesses of education providers who were doing the right thing were also affected during this time. I sincerely congratulate the minister for recognising the need to put in place new provisions which protect the legitimate operators but particularly crack down on those who were operating in an unscrupulous manner and rorting the previous system. Not only were people ripped-off; the government's budget was blown out and taxpayers had to pick up the tab. The funding for VET loans blew out from a cost of $325 million in 2012 to $1.8 billion in 2014 and $2.9 billion in 2015. We have seen meteoric increases in student numbers in the order of 400 per cent. Fees more than doubled and loans increased by 792 per cent. The Turnbull-Joyce coalition government is taking steps to repair the system, including limiting courses eligible for VET Student Loans to those that align with industry needs and having a clear pathway for the students undertaking those courses. Three bands of loan caps-$5,000, $10,000 and $15,000-will be set for courses, depending on their actual delivery cost. And students will be required to log in to and engage with the VET Student Loans online portal to ensure they are active and legitimate enrolments and participating in that educational opportunity. Another change is a new application process for providers wanting to access VET Student Loans, which includes a much higher bar to entry. So the legitimate education providers will be able to participate but those who have unscrupulous intent will be weeded out. We will also strengthen legislative, compliance and payment conditions, prohibiting approved providers from using brokers or directly soliciting prospective students. That was a fundamental problem under the previous system, so it is a welcome change. The minister has announced 347 courses that are expected to attract funding support under the new affordable, sustainable and student-focused VET Student Loans program. This remains open for consultation, which is an important point to make. I would encourage anyone who thinks a course has been left off the list but should be retained to engage in the consultation process. I know the minister is well and truly open to those suggestions. I refer back to my comments at the outset about student pathways. I would like to raise another issue about student pathways which is directly impacting on my electorate of Gippsland. I have been approached by concerned students and teachers at Federation University, at their Churchill, Gippsland campus, about a pathway to graduate medical studies that now no longer exists for students in my community. Previously, students completing an undergraduate biomedical science degree at Federation University in Churchill were eligible to transfer to the Monash University graduate entry medical program. To give context about why this matters to my community, Federation University's Churchill campus was previously the Monash Gippsland campus. Churchill is also the home of the school of rural health. It is the flagship student medical program for Gippsland and plays an important role in supplying medical professionals to our region. You know and I know-and many regional members have the same experience-that attracting and retaining GPs and health professionals in all forms in our regional communities is an enormous challenge. A very significant part of the answer to this problem is providing access for kids from a regional background to that training, because they are much more likely to return to their home communities in the future, having had that regional experience. The history to this is important. In 2006-so 10 years ago-Commonwealth funding was provided to create the graduate entry program at Monash's Churchill campus in Gippsland. It was known at the time as the Gippsland medical school. Under this model, graduate students would achieve their degree in four years, rather than the five required by direct-entry students. The federal and state governments provided funding of $12 million for infrastructure upgrades at Churchill, creating the medical school base, and the clinical sites of the school. The coalition government at the time-the Howard government-established extra Commonwealth support places in 2006, and there were additional places sourced in 2007 and 2008. Gippsland students were actively encouraged to pursue the graduate pathway to becoming a doctor. In 2007, it was marketed to the local community as a way of retaining doctors in Gippsland, because we knew then, as we know now, that many country-trained doctors will return to those rural areas to provide services to the underserviced populations that still exist today. In early 2011, the Gippsland medical school was disestablished and the first year of the Graduate Entry Program at Churchill became the responsibility of the school of rural health. I am advised that in 2013 a review was conducted by Monash University into the graduate entry program. Monash University made a decision it would only accept students into its graduate entry program from Monash undergraduate courses. So, if you completed your undergraduate subjects at Churchill, the pathway to Monash University's medical program is now closed. This has caused great concern among the staff at Federation University. It has also caused huge concern for students and prospective future students. I believe-and I make no apologies for being as blunt as this-Monash University is failing my community. Monash has closed the door on a pathway to becoming a doctor for students studying at Gippsland's only university campus. With respect to the university, it has provided an explanation to my office, because I did write to them formally on this issue. Its reason was: to produce students with 'the required ability and knowledge to be able to cope with clinical years' of the graduate program. I recognise Monash University will quarantine some spaces for students from Gippsland in their graduate medical program. But these will only be open to Monash undergraduate students, not the students studying at Federation University in Churchill now or in the future. So what does this mean if a student has young children, or if they do not have the financial capacity to move to Melbourne, or if they quite simply would rather stay in their home community and study? We should not be saying to our students who are completing year 12 this year that they have to move to Melbourne to access the Monash graduate medical program when we had an existing pathway in Gippsland. This is an enormous step backwards and, I would say, it is against the spirit of the intention of the original funding from the Commonwealth and state governments to establish the program at Churchill in the first place. I am concerned Monash is effectively forcing talented people away from Gippsland, when they want to study in their own region and later become a doctor in their home region. It is likely now that those students will go onto other universities where they can gain entry to a graduate medical program. Who knows? Having been to Sydney or another university in Victoria, the question is who knows whether they will ever make it back to Gippsland to provide those services which are much needed in my community? While I respect that Monash can make these decisions and that they want to preserve the integrity of their course, I cannot accept the notion that a student studying biomedical science at Federation University in Gippsland who achieves the required marks cannot find a direct pathway to a Monash graduate entry program. SoI respectfully, call on Monash University to reconsider its decision and to consider the consequences of its actions on regional students in the Gippsland Latrobe Valley region. I make the simple point that it is not too late for them to fix this. This graduate medical program is an important pathway for Gippsland students, and I would encourage Monash University to re-engage with my community, a community which is facing some significant economic and social challenges at the moment, and to not forget the people of Gippsland at this time. When we are talking about student pathways, it is important that governments do everything they can to ensure people have access to an education. And that is what the VET Student Loans Bill intends to protect. As the minister has said, we simply need to 'hit the reset button' on this issue. We need to restore trust in vocational education, and I believe this bill goes a long way to achieving that. With these measures, we can continue to protect and strengthen this important student pathway for students. I commend the bill to the House. before the House. This bill will introduce a new VET Student Loans program to replace the VET-HELP scheme from January 2017. Certainly, I agree with the major stakeholders that the existing VET FEE-HELP scheme requires urgent reform. Several improvements have been proposed with these bills: capping student loans, linking funding to student progress and completion, linking publically funded courses to industry need and skills shortages, and requiring providers to re-apply under new standards so only high-quality providers could access the loan system. I particularly welcome the commitment made by the government in the second reading speech to establish a VET loans ombudsman, a proposal that Labor moved in the Senate almost a year ago. Funnily enough, when Labor proposed these very reforms prior to the last election, the Liberals could not criticise them enough. On capping student loans, the Treasurer",53,Bills
35,Mr Hart (Bass) (11:43,"I rise today to speak on the VET Student Loans Bill currentlysaid that it would pull the rug out from under the private education industry, whilst the minister for education stated that the policy was 'an ill-considered flat pack'. At the time, the minister further criticised a price cap, saying it would simply, in effect, establish a government sanctioned price. He is now himself proposing three different price caps: $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000. What we have now is a complete change of direction from the government-another backflip from the Liberals, who are trying to take credit for reforms that have been Labor policy for months. However, I would also suggest that these bills do little, if anything, to provide redress for students who have been the victims of dodgy providers and those who have been left saddled with unfair VET FEE-HELP debts. The vocational education system has fallen into crisis under this Liberal government's watch. With five ministers in three years and a blow-out in the cost of the VET FEE-HELP scheme, it is clear that this government simply does not care about vocational education or, significantly, about TAFE. In 2013, VET FEE-HELP loans were sitting at around $700 million. This has skyrocketed in the last two years to a staggering $2.9 billion in 2015, and it is estimated that up to 40 per cent of VET FEE-HELP loans will never be repaid. We hear that some students have been tricked by unscrupulous providers into racking up massive debts. We also hear that thousands of qualifications in Victoria have been cancelled because they are not worth the paper that they are written on. Where was the government when all this was happening under its watch? How can it possibly justify to taxpayers its failure to do anything about this until now? With these bills before the House, given that the government has finally taken action, what the government faces now is the challenge of implementation. In particular, I look forward to seeing how the establishment of a VET loans ombudsman is to be achieved, given that there is no provision for that important office in these bills. It is absolutely critical that the ombudsman has the resources and the powers it needs to seek redress for students and to protect their interests. I would also hope that the government ensures that students and reputable providers are treated fairly in the transition process. Just last week I received an email from a local vocational education provider who, under this legislation, will be precluded from applying as a VET Student Loan course provider. This particular provider has received several national awards that reflect their high standards of governance and their community contribution. They presently employ 64 staff and have around 1,200 VET FEE-HELP students enrolled in their courses. This legislation requires them-and another 12 training providers, acting as body corporates to a trustee-to almost immediately implement a change to their organisational structure. I certainly understand that it is appropriate for accountability purposes to make such changes so as to restrict the operating entity to ensure that directors are liable for the administration of their operating entity and, hence, that an interposed trust is not an appropriate vehicle for governance purposes. WhilstI understand that some changes to the structure of the industry were raised some time ago, they have advised me that at no stage was this particular reform canvassed in any industry consultation and that such a change will have a detrimental impact upon their ability to continue to deliver quality educational services, or, in the alternative, will require a restructure of the business operating entity, requiring taxation and legal advice, and transfer of staff and assets-not to mention that staff redundancies might occur as current students complete courses, with the provider being unable to take on further students without restructure. It must be of concern to all in this House that industry participants claim inadequate consultation on such a fundamental change in the operation of a business. It speaks to this government's failure to consult-or to inadequate consultation-that participants in this industry are able to complain that changes first proposed some years ago have not been adequately explained to the industry. Labor understands the urgency of these bills. But yet again, as with the backpacker tax backflip, it is an urgency the government has brought on itself. We hope that the Senate inquiry into the bill will give the stakeholders a chance to properly examine these issues, because the government did not consult, or has not consulted adequately, with students or the sector on the details of these changes. I am also particularly concerned that the creative and arts communities are being disadvantaged by the Turnbull government's cuts to the VET Student Loans program. Of over 70 creative arts courses previously eligible for funding through the VET Student Loans program, only 13 are now available, according to the government's new published criteria. In announcing the funding cuts, Minister for Education and Training Simon Birmingham stated that: VET Student Loans will only support legitimate students to undertake worthwhile and value-for-money courses at quality training providers. I would like to question the minister as to why the Liberals are effectively imposing a restriction based upon assumed 'value' or 'worth' of the creative arts in higher education for the community. I am genuinely concerned that the government's neo-liberal ideology is damaging for our community, and that this short-sighted and short-term thinking is indicative of a government that is out of its depth rather than embracing the cultural positives for the community associated with arts funding in all of its forms. The moment you decide that only wealthy people can afford to be trained in the performing arts because certain areas will not be publicly supported, you have effectively decided that merit does not matter or that particular artistic areas are less worthy. The government should not be dictating to the arts community which higher education courses should or should not receive funding on the basis that artistic endeavours are too esoteric to lead to employment. It is creative and artistic endeavours that are crucial for facilitating the innovation and new ideas that drive economic growth and industry achievement. This Prime Minister lauds the idea of Australia as the 'innovation nation', but with policy such as this before us I wonder if he knows what it takes to be truly innovative. The tests that this education minister is using to decide which course are 'worthy' of government support are, I believe, quantitative in measure. This seems certainly true of arts and creative courses. I would like to take a moment to highlight the fact that some of our greatest thinkers and some of the greatest innovators of our time-individuals whose contributions to science, technology, engineering and mathematics have underpinned some of the most important discoveries of our time-were first and foremost creatives whose innovations stemmed from their artistic pursuits. Sir Isaac Newton, for example, regarded as the modern father of what we now know as physics, was set on his path to learning not through science but with a Bachelor of Arts degree, which he earned in 1665. In fact, Newton owned more books on humanistic learning then he did on maths or science. An interesting fact about Albert Einstein, surely one of the greatest thinkers of our age, is that he was an amateur musician. He declared: Life without playing music is inconceivable to me ... I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music. I get most joy in life from music. Futurist Nikola Tesla dedicated his scientific work to finding ways in which the earth's energy sources could be made available to all. He believed that: … we can water the energies, such as positive mental energy. They are in the music of Bach or Mozart, or in the verses of great poets. And of course there is Leonardo Da Vinci, whose pursuits in science, invention, architecture, sculpture, anatomy, geology and engineering are among the greatest examples of the creative spirit driving innovation. It is exactly this type of innovation that the government may stifle with its cuts to the VET student loans program. I recently had the pleasure of attending Junction Arts Festival in my electorate of Bass. Situated in and around Launceston, in public and private spaces throughout the community, this annual five-day event is a mix of performance and visual art. The festival revenue is generated through sponsorship and government funding, with a particular focus on free audience experiences. The positive social impacts of participation in the arts in regional communities are many. Accessibility to the arts has been identified as a key driver for social cohesion in communities such as my electorate of Bass and facilitating the retention of young people in our community. Events such as the Junction Arts Festival provide the spark which engages young people into a career in the arts or other creative and innovative industries. Junction is a perfect example of how investment in the arts and creative industries can facilitate social cohesion, innovation and economic drivers in local communities. But events such as this cannot flourish unless they are appropriately supported by government. The loss of federal government funding for some 60 arts diplomas as the result of these changes to eligibility will be a significant detriment to individuals looking to pursue a career in the artistic or creative industries. The Liberals have deemed a variety of coursessuch as screen acting, art therapy, jewellery making, social media marketing, animation, dance and many others-as lacking employment opportunity and therefore not worthy of subsidising. This is hugely insulting to educational providers, arts festival and arts program coordinators and indeed the wider arts community in Australia as a whole. Talented students with the passion and drive to pursue creative careers, especially those students from disadvantaged backgrounds, will be left without any access to study in their chosen field, limiting their employment opportunities and ability to contribute to their community. I am thinking in particular about the thriving arts community in Northern Tasmania. It has events such as Junction, Ten Days on the Island and the Festival of Voices; professional companies such as TasDance, Stompin and Design Tasmania; exhibition centres such as QVMAG, the Academy Gallery and our many National Trust sites; and myriad niche artists and boutiques that are absolutely unique to the region. Without adequate support in their educational endeavours, the very people whose passions and talents are the driving force behind our artistic achievements will lose the opportunity to share their skills and knowledge with like-minded individuals and the wider community, meaning the creative industries and the arts will inevitably struggle. VET, TAFE and apprenticeships are crucial to jobs and our economy. I would add myself to the list of those are worried about the questions being asked by the Assistant Minister for Skills as to whether the national partnership for skills was even needed in the future and her plans to meet with the states to determine 'whether there are reforms to VET that warrant a new agreement'. Given that the current national partnership expires in the middle of next year, leaving over $500 million a year of government funding essentially up in the air, it is extremely concerning to me that the minister is seemingly unclear on the need for a new agreement to keep supporting TAFE. Labor knows that TAFE is the backbone of our apprenticeship and technical skills education system, which is why we took a TAFE funding guarantee to the last election. There are 28,000 people in Tasmania currently enrolled in TAFE. We need to support our TAFE system. 2016 and the two supporting bills in the package-the VET Student Loans (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2016 and the VET Student Loans (Charges) Bill 2016. Along with many Australians, I understand the importance of vocational education and training and the role that education providers play in ensuring that Australia has the skilled workforce it needs to drive innovation and economic growth. As policy makers of this country we need to be ensuring that there is a better and brighter future for all Australians. Good quality education is a strong part of ensuring our future prosperity. This is particularly important for my electorate of Dunkley, in which around 10 per cent of the population of Frankston city and slightly higher, at around 12 per cent, of the Mornington Peninsula Shire council area have bachelor degrees or qualifications above that-and I hope to grow this further, particularly through local universities and TAFE providers like Monash University Peninsula campus and Chisholm Institute. Several wonderful staff members in my electorate office each undertook courses through higher education providers prior to becoming a part of the office. I am pleased to have a team which has been educated through various means, making up a diverse team that is able to assist me in serving the constituents of Dunkley. Just like my own team, many businesses rely on the skills developed through training and education which are offered through vocational education and training. Last year, around 4.5 million people participated in the Australian vocational education and training system, including around 24,800 people in my own electorate who participated in training and education at great education providers such as the Chisholm Institute of TAFE, which I mentioned before. Fifteen thousand students participate in training at that institution across a number of campuses, including a very substantial campus in Frankston. Pragmatic Training, Nepean Industry Edge Training and SAI Home and Community Care, which have recently moved into a wonderful new building in Frankston, are all doing great work to prepare many in my electorate for their futures and for their participation in the workforce-and there are many others in my electorate and beyond that do a similarly great job.",56,Bills
36,Mr Crewther (Dunkley) (11:58,"I rise today to speak on the VET Student Loans BillParticipants in my electorate undertook training in courses such as management and commerce; engineering and related technologies; architecture and building; society, culture and health-just to mention the top five fields of study. In fact, VET delivers training to more than 24,800 students, as I mentioned before, with 1,000 trade Australian apprenticeships and 494 non-trade Australian apprenticeships in train within Dunkley. The future of our economic prosperity relies upon the quality of our graduates, the outcomes of the training they receive-and by ensuring they are skilled in the way employers need them to be skilled. That is why supporting high-quality vocational education and training is central to the Turnbull government's economic growth and jobs plan. Vocational education and training is key to Australia's economic growth and competitiveness and is central to ensuring innovation and productivity. The role of the VET system in Australia is to provide individuals with the skills and qualifications needed to participate effectively in the labour market and contribute to Australia's economic future. It provides training to cover entry-level jobs through to highly technical occupations. The VET Student Loans Bill 2016 aims to achieve better outcomes for higher education for people studying under vocational education and training providers. Over the past two years, the government has implemented or commenced a number of key reforms designed to strengthen the quality of the system, build connections between VET and industry, streamline governance and regulations and improve the status of the VET system. In Dunkley we have a growing industry sector, with a number of job opportunities, and it is important to link what our education providers are doing with the industries and jobs available in Dunkley and beyond. In early 2015 the government announced the first in a series of reforms to protect students, taxpayers and the reputation of the VET system as a whole. These included: tightening marketing and recruitment practices, including banning inducements for students to enrol in the scheme and constricting what is communicated about the scheme to prospective students; improving the understanding of how VET FEE-HELP operates and students' rights and obligations; prohibiting the charging of withdrawal fees-and many other changes. In December 2015, in the face of continuing growth in enrolments and quality concerns, the government made further changes, including: strengthening the debt remission process for students under the VET FEE-HELP program; ensuring student debt is incurred in line with course delivery; establishing minimum prerequisite and prior education qualifications; introducing new entry requirements for training providers wishing to offer VET FEE-HELP loans; supporting altered payment arrangements in arrears of census dates for certain providers; and freezing the total loan limit for existing providers at 2015 levels. The VET Student Loans Bill 2016, along with the two supporting bills in the package before us today, will ensure the Australian government can hit the reset button on Labor's flawed VET FEE-HELP scheme, so that Australians can start to rebuild their trust in vocational education and so that taxpayers can ensure their money is not rorted. This is a winwin for students and taxpayers that will restore integrity to Australia's vocational education and training sector by placing an emphasis on quality and by holding providers to account. The majority of training providers do the right thing already, but this new program will protect prospective students by banning brokers from acting on behalf of providers or directly soliciting them. Subcontracting training will also be limited. We will end the free-for-all subsidies Labor started that has seen providers burden students with tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt for courses that offer poor employment prospects. The focus will instead be on courses that have a high national priority, align with industry needs, contribute to addressing skills shortages and, importantly, lead to employment outcomes. Courses like, for example, the Diploma of Fashion Styling, Diploma of Veterinary Chinese Herbal Medicine, Advanced Diploma of Therapeutic Arts in Counselling and Diploma of Energy Healing will receive limited attention under this program. VET student loans will protect students and taxpayers and restore integrity to the vocational education sector through tougher barriers to entry for providers, properly considered loan caps on courses, stronger course eligibility criteria aligned to industry needs, mandatory student engagement measures, and a stronger focus on students successfully completing courses. There will be 347 courses receiving funding support and 478 knocked off the list. Those knocked off the list will have the opportunity to be reconsidered if strong employment outcomes can be demonstrated. This is a good thing because it is a clear statement that we will have no place for those who think they can offer courses, particularly to overseas students, under the guise of educational opportunities that will lead to careers. However, many overseas students in particular have wasted their time and investment, and they are now unlikely to have employment opportunities arise from these courses. These courses can diminish the quality of education in Australia, and, as we are aware, education is a very key export for our nation. Of importance to me in my electorate of Dunkley is ensuring that every individual who is undertaking a course, believing that they will be able to improve their own future and employment prospects, will indeed be able to do exactly that. We have seen some impressive economic growth in my electorate. According to a recent report by SGS Economics & Planning, Dunkley topped the state with economic growth of 3.6 per cent-the fastest growing economy of any Victorian federal electorate in the 2014-15 financial year. We have experienced a rapid improvement in unemployment figures, which have recently gone down from 8.3 per cent to around 6.1 per cent. The improvement in local economic growth and better employment figures is what I am looking to support and what I believe these bills will help achieve. Measures that mean providers will need to meet tougher entry criteria to become, and to remain, an approved course provider are obviously encouraged. They include being a 'fit and proper person' to enrol and having to satisfy provider suitability requirements around stronger governance, industry engagement and quality training; these will be specified in the rules. Again, it is over to the 'responsible government', the coalition government led by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to make the decisions and changes which will ensure that instances such as those that have occurred with providers like Phoenix Institute will not be common practice in the future. On3 March 2016, the department revoked the VET FEEHELP approval of Phoenix Institute on the basis of use of prohibited inducements, ASQA's finding that Phoenix failed to demonstrate compliance with the standards for registered training organisations and the VET quality framework, as well as non-compliance with the tuition assurance requirements. My understanding is that the graduation rate for Phoenix was around four per cent, which is a terrible outcome and what we do not want to see. Some of the inducements offered were things like laptops, vouchers, cash or similar things. The government rightly banned this organisation from 1 April last year. It is important to make these changes to support local organisations in Dunkley such as Pragmatic Training and the many other local training providers who are trying to do the right thing. Organisations like Phoenix and others who are not doing the right thing make it harder for those who are doing the right thing to operate and get through the processes set out by ASQA-in particular, there are the delays caused by the regulatory requirements needed to be gone through for organisations to be approved and to remain approved because of shoddy operators. As we know with any regulatory changes, when people are doing the wrong thing it can make it harder for people who are doing the right thing. So it is very important for me and for Dunkley that we make these important changes. Some other notes I would like to add are that inducements like laptops, vouchers, cash or similar things offered by Phoenix led to terrible outcomes, particularly for those overseas students who were trying to do the right thing and who were putting significant time and effort into these courses. I do not want to see this occur again, particularly when we are trying to encourage overseas students to come to places like Dunkley. Last week, I met with Pragmatic Training, who are currently in Dunkley looking to attract overseas students to the area. Pragmatic Training have offices not only in Frankston, which is where their head office is, but in the centre of Melbourne, Brisbane and elsewhere. They have gone through a long process with ASQA to get approval for overseas students. Much of this is related to the difficulties which we have experienced with organisations such as Phoenix, who have made it much more difficult for organisations like Pragmatic Training to operate. In Dunkley, as I have noted throughout my campaign, I am a strong supporter of local education providers such as Chisholm Institute and the Monash University Peninsula campus. I announced some funding recently to expand enrolment in the Monash University Peninsula campus, by extending the Metro Rail services down to Leawarra station. I think this will have a positive outcome for the university, and the university have indicated to me it will result in more than a 20 per cent increase in enrolment. SoI do support these bills today. I am proud to talk about these bills, and I acknowledge the government's work in this regard. Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) (12:13): I rise to speak on the VET Student Loans Bill 2016. The Central Coast is a region with a high stake in vocational education and training. In the electorate of Dobell, on the New South Wales Central Coast, the number of people who leave school to pursue a trade is 10 per cent higher than the national average. In Dobell, 58.6 per cent of students have undertaken vocational education compared to the national average of 46.7 per cent. This is a region where the traditional pathway of leaving school, earning a trade and getting a job is common. Whilst our population is growing and rates of higher education are leading to increased university enrolments, including at the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle, for many people on the Central Coast getting a trade is a ticket to getting a job. Only half of the high school students on the Central Coast complete their studies at school. Not every school leaver wants to go to university and people looking to upskill or return to study need to have practical, affordable and local options to obtain the skills they need. For an area with stubbornly high unemployment rates, particularly for young people, the opportunity to get the training needed in order to enter the workforce is critical. It is unacceptable that regions like ours have been affected by the appalling lack of regulation in the VET sector that has occurred under the coalition government. Combined with the gutting of TAFE at a state level, it is regions like ours that have and will suffer more as a result of the conservative ideology which undermines public education and training. So, whilst Labor support these bills in principle, we are disappointed in the way that this has been handled by the government. We have been raising these issues for too long and the government's delays and failure to act have meant more students are ripped off by dodgy providers. There are too many cases of vocational education providers whose questionable practices have left students with large debts and no qualifications. For some time it was common to see a provider set up a stall in the local shopping centre, approach young people and other prospective students and offer inducements such as a free laptop or an iPad. Worse still, we know that this led to more dubious methods of recruitment, such as fraudulent applications or targeting of vulnerable people to increase sign-up rates. The government knew this was happening and did not take action and, all the while, more students were caught out. Arguably, the largest private provider of vocational education and training courses on the Central Coast, Evocca College, opened with great fanfare in 2013. Its Gosford and Wyong campuses offered local students courses in areas such as business management, leadership, youth work, justice, community services and counselling. According to media reports, Evocca received around $200 million under the VET FEE-HELP scheme last year, making it the second-largest recipient of taxpayer funds under the scheme. However, completion rates through the college have been far too low. Only around a quarter of students finish their courses. As poor as these completion and graduation rates are, they are not the worse performers in this sector. It is clear that this is a sector that needs reform. Too many students are signing up for courses they are either not in a position to complete or are not suitable for, and this must stop. The Australian Financial Review cites costs for Evocca courses: a diploma of community services course costs $16,500; a diploma of beauty therapy course costs $24,750; a diploma of information technology course costs $24,750; a diploma of business course costs $16,500; and a diploma of leadership and management course costs $16,500. In March this year, after entry requirements were amended and Labor released their comprehensive election policy to tackle misuse of VET FEE-HELP loans and restore TAFE as the public provider in the sector, Evocca announced the closure of several campuses, including in Gosford on the Central Coast. At some institutions, graduation rates have plummeted, leaving students with massive debts for courses they may never complete. It is completely unacceptable that dodgy providers are able to pocket the equivalent of $215,000 per graduate, or more than $900 million overall, in federal money. No self-respecting provider could look at graduation rates as low as five per cent and be satisfied with that outcome. To know that you are funded to skill up a willing group of students and are supported to run courses, yet only a small percentage are leaving with qualifications, should be enough to make some providers look at themselves and the models that they run and want to change. Yet that is not the message they are receiving and it is not the message from the government. This government-the government of lifters and leaners; the government punishing lowincome earners and boosting big business-have sat by and let these rorts continue. They have watched as the VET FEE-HELP debt jumped from $700 million in 2013 to $2.9 billion in 2015. That is $2.9 billion in debt, 40 per cent of which will never be repaid, that is hanging over the heads of thousands of people on the Central Coast and potentially hundreds of thousands of Australians across the country. Where were the government when this was happening? How can they possibly justify to taxpayers their failure to do anything about it? The Liberal government, despite the bluff and bluster, cannot be trusted to look after our economy or our communities. We run the risk, without these reforms, of creating a skills crisis. Ten thousand students in Victoria have already had their qualifications cancelled because they were not worth the paper they were written on. That is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue. We have to bring credibility back to the sector for the sake of the economy and the people who rely on sound educational institutions. Labor has long called for regulation. More than a year ago, Labor proposed the establishment of an ombudsman to oversee the sector. The ombudsman would have the power to intervene and resolve disputes, ensuring that students are getting a fair go from their provider. If the government had agreed to this when it was first proposed, many of the failures of the VET FEE-HELP scheme would have been prevented. The New South Wales government has embarked on deregulation of the sector through their so-called 'smart and skilled' reforms, which in reality have left students with massive fees and fewer study options. My brother Eddie is one of the many students caught out by this. He trained as a plumber at Wyong TAFE 20 years ago and now runs a local business. Recently, when he decided to upgrade his qualifications, he learnt that he could not undertake this study locally and instead would need to travel to North Sydney. The course was eight weeks long, with only two contact nights per week, yet this cost Eddie $2,000. Trades people like my brother Eddie must be able to access local and affordable training, and this is not happening under the government. I have heard from Natalie, another small-business owner from the Central Coast, who made the decision to study fashion design as a mature-age student and pursue her dream of dressmaking in the dance industry. She undertook took a cert III course in order to enrol in diploma studies this year, only to be told that the course had been cut as a result of funding cuts to TAFE. Despite their gross failings in the VET sector and a dismal level of support for TAFE, the New South Wales Minister for Skills and Industry has described his federal Liberal colleagues' handling of the sector as 'unbelievable'. He said: I think they have made errors that I would not have ever believed from a government … How have we allowed a private provider in one year to have $300,000 in funding go to a hundred million in funding? If the government had acted when Labor first brought these issues to the forefront, billions could have been saved from going into the pockets of dodgy private providers and invested back into our TAFE and apprenticeships system. There is nothing in this bill to restore the $2.75 billion the Liberals have ripped out of TAFE, skills and apprenticeships; nothing to protect TAFE; nothing to boost apprenticeships. Labor knows how important VET and TAFE are for so many young people-people looking to return to work, upskill or retrain. This is in stark contrast to those opposite, who are not even sure if a new national partnership on skills is needed. The Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, the member for McPherson, said when she was meeting with the states 'to determine whether there are reforms to VET that warrant a new agreement.' With the agreement running out in the middle of next year, that is not comforting news for the thousands of students nationally who rely on the $500 million in federal funding to keep their courses running, keep building their skills, or even keep the lights on in their local TAFE, like that at Wyong. Labor has been absolutely clear: we back public TAFE. That is why we took a TAFE funding guarantee to the last election. All the while, apprentice numbers are in free fall under the Liberals. They are down 30 per cent since this government came to power-130,000 fewer under this government. People on the Central Coast know just how important our TAFE and skills sector is. Locals know they can turn to these trusted educational institutions for the technical skills they need for growing industries and to be job ready. We are now at a point on the Central Coast where a student cannot study for the HSC at either Wyong or Gosford TAFE. Courses have been stripped away from TAFE while the federal government continues to plunge nearly a billion dollars into private providers. At state and federal level the Liberals have an ideological problem with TAFE. TAFE is the backbone of the skills training system, and the government should support it as such. There are registered training organisations in this sector who do a great job, and their reputations should not be damaged by others who seek to exploit students. Organisations like Training Wheels, based in Wyong and at Rutherford in the Hunter, do an amazing job and are industry leaders in high risk work licensing. They offer real world, practical courses for students in topics ranging from forklift driving to working at heights and working in confined spaces, ensuring that their graduates get the tickets they need to get into work and know how to be safe and productive employees. These reforms are long overdue, but they should not be as urgent as they have become. With just over 10 weeks until these changes are set to be introduced, the implementation of these reforms can only be described as rushed. This should have been done sooner, but just because the administration of student loans has been utterly botched by this government, this is no excuse for further failing. It is entirely understandable that stakeholders are concerned. Whilst Labor will support these measures, it is with a very important qualification: students must not be further disadvantaged and access to education opportunities, particularly in low socio-economic areas, must not be limited for those who want to train and learn. Labor has been pushing for these reforms for three years, while the government has been asleep at the wheel. In the last term of government, Labor proposed VET reforms that the government ignored. Now we see that they have copied nearly every single one of them. Stopping the rip-offs by capping loans? That was a Labor idea. Cracking down on brokers? That is another one of ours. Linking courses to skills shortage areas-Labor. Linking funding to completion rates-copied. Deregistering low-quality providers-Labor suggested it. What we see is that Labor is the party of skills and training, and the only party committed to ensuring the strength and future viability of the industry for the betterment of our students and our communities. In May the Liberals were falling over themselves to criticise Labor's policy proposals. Today they are trying to take credit for them. While Labor is trying to improve the sector, the Turnbull government has been sitting on its hands. These reforms are too little too late. Over the last three years the Liberals have shown they simply do not care about technical and vocational education or about TAFE. They have churned through five ministers in three years, and that revolving door is leaving people who want to improve their skills and opportunities suffering through an unfair system. As successive Liberal Prime Ministers have shuffled and reshuffled their ministries to reward supporters and punish detractors, the sector and students just want the government to get on with the job and provide the services and support that the industry needs. Infighting and unrest in government is plastered on the front pages of newspapers nearly every day, yet the issues plaguing our skills and VET industry do not get a mention. This government has one priority-itself-and the vocational education sector has fallen into crisis. I am proud to be a member of a party that is now, and always has been, committed to ensuring that our skills sector is well resourced, well supported, and fair. Generations of Australians know how important a strong skills training industry is when they want to change careers or get back into the workforce. We have a duty to ensure that all Australians are given every opportunity to expand their education and their opportunities. I genuinely hope the government has turned a corner and from here on they will do what is best for students and employers in ensuring that a qualification is more than just a piece of paper, but something that students can be proud of and that will put them in good stead for their careers. Ms MARINO (Forrest-Chief Government Whip) (12:29): I rise to speak on the VET Student Loans Bill. On the back of that last contribution, I think one of the things we need to make very clear at the very start of this process is that the coalition government is actually fixing up a dreadful mess that was designed and implemented by Labor. Let us make no mistake about that it is a disgraceful mess that was designed and implemented by Labor when they were in government. We are actively showing our support for the sector by fixing Labor's unmitigated mess. That is exactly what it was. It was another, just the latest, of Labor's unmitigated messes in portfolio after portfolio that we saw when the coalition came into government. Of course we on this side are very strong supporters of the vocational education and training sector. We see so many intelligent, practical, capable people who are very much part of Australia's economic growth. Business opportunities and employment outcomes are what we want for students. We know that last year about 4.5 million people actually participated in the vocational education training system. Not only does Australia's economic prosperity depend on those great people but it also depends on the quality of graduates and their ability to integrate successfully into the workforce. It is not just about the training part and the education part but about how well have they actually transition into the workforce. But it is not only that; Australia's economic prosperity also depends on the quality of our vocational education institutions and providers. I will just mention South Regional TAFE in Western Australia, which has campuses in my part of the world, and its direct connection to local industry. Providing courses that are relevant in your community, particularly if you live and work in rural and regional Australia, is really important. It is very important that the courses offered reflect regional needs and future needs. I look at the courses available in Bunbury, Busselton, and in Harvey through the South Regional TAFE such as automotive servicing. There is a state-of-the-art service centre that was built by the state Liberal government in Western Australia and it is a fantastic facility. The students get to work in very productive circumstances and their experience is fantastic. The centre reflects the workplace and it is a great opportunity. I look at the great job the TAFE is doing with education, with building and construction, and with nursing-there are so many different courses. South Regional TAFE is doing a great job in providing the people we need to help grow what is one of the diverse electorates in the south-west of Australia. We need diversity and we need quality education. We need links to the business sector and to the industries that will need that capacity. And that is why supporting highquality vocational education and training is central to the Turnbull government's economic growth and jobs plan. I congratulate Minister Birmingham for attempting to sort out the dreadful mess that was left to us. Around 45 per cent of the financial assistance the Commonwealth invested in vocational education and training in 2015 supported income-contingent loans for students undertaking diplomas and above qualifications through the VET FEE-HELP scheme. The government supports income-contingent loans through VET FEE-HELP, which is one part of the Higher Education Loan Program. HELP ensures that students are not faced with access barriers due to up-front costs and that is important for young people, particularly in rural and regional areas. Sometimes they face far greater challenges than those who live next to a facility in a metropolitan area. VET FEE-HELP requires repayments when a student has the capacity to do so. The Commonwealth pays the student's tuition fees directly to their training provider and the student then incurs the debt with the Commonwealth, which is collected via the tax system. For practical purposes, that is how it works. It is available for diplomas, advanced diplomas, graduate certificates and graduate diplomas. The amount the student is required to repay depends on their income and currently commences at $54,126. Without these particular loans, thousands of students and, I would say, so many of our young people in rural and regional Australia would not be able to afford to pay up-front fees-they simply could not-and would miss out on a tertiary qualification. And we in the regions would miss out on their skills, on their knowledge and on their capacity to help grow the region for the future. It is also true that there were students enrolled in courses under the Labor scheme that delivered no benefit. Like some of the other famous failed Labor policies, the disastrous VET FEE-HELP scheme implemented by the previous government was wickedly poorly designed and clearly, from what we have seen, open to rorting. Labor introduced VET FEE-HELP in 2012 in a way that allowed unscrupulous providers and brokers to take advantage of vulnerable students and to rip off taxpayers as well, so it was a double whammy. Of course this was very reminiscent of the Labor pink batts plan. I know of students who were signed up for loans for courses they did not need or could never complete. In fact I am aware that many so-called providers were cold calling and door-to-door selling VET courses that were unsolicited and un-needed. My office reported such incidences to the minister and has been able to have the practice stopped where applicable. But the very fact that telephone marketing and door-to-door sales of the courses were occurring should surely have alarmed and outraged any right-thinking person. As a result of Labor's scheme, the number of students accessing VET FEE-HELP jumped by 5,000 per cent. The average course cost tripled and the value of loans landing as debts to students and as Commonwealth borrowings blew out from $26 million to $2.9 billion. The additional number of providers increased from 46 to 275 and completion rates have remained persistently low for VET FEE-HELP students, with only 22 per cent of students completing their course in 2014-just after Labor had lost government. The sheer scale of the disaster and the corruption became apparent and so the coalition took action. In 2015, the government banned inducements being offered to students to enrol in courses for which they needed a loan and also tightened recruitment and marketing practice to make it clear to students exactly what they were signing up for. On1 January this year, the government brought in a student entry requirement to access loans to ensure that prospective students were academically suited for a higher level of vocational training. We have also required loans to be levied along with the student's progression in the course, rather than up front-practical, you would think-and instituted civil penalties for providers that breach the requirements. We increased protections for students under the age of 18 and introduced a twoday gap to separate a student's enrolment decision from their application for a loan. And we introduced a loan freeze to stop escalating growth while we undertook consultation to design a new student loan arrangement that had students and their training and employment outcomes-all three-at its centre. It is what you get at the end of it and what the employers get at the end of it that really matters. As a result of these actions we expect that the value of loans in 2016 will be hundreds of millions of dollars less than the equivalent in 2015. That is not enough, however. This is another mess we have to fix and keep fixing. We are debating a redesigned program that will give students the best opportunity. That is what it should be about: giving students the best opportunity and give the best quality training at the end of their training itself. Under this bill, VET providers will need to meet far tougher entry criteria to become, and remain, an approved course provider. It is not set and forget. They will be subject to much tougher compliance measures, and on the back of what we have heard that is a very good part of the design of this. There will also be ongoing reporting requirements as provided under the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014. The bill also provides a new power to immediately suspend a provider in urgent circumstances. It also for the first time imposes personal liability on executive officers of providers in relation to contravention of civil penalty provisions or the commission of any offences. The bill also introduces new measures to allow the Commonwealth to cap an individual provider's loan amounts or restrict a provider's scope of delivery in order to control non-genuine growth in enrolments or unreasonable fee increases. These are practical ways of managing this. Most importantly from my perspective, providers will be banned from using brokers or marketing agents to interact or engage with students in relation to VET student loans. This disgraceful process has resulted in the taxpayer funding inappropriate courses for students who neither wanted nor needed them. The bill before us today will ensure that approved providers may subcontract training only to other approved VET student loan providers or higher education providers registered by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. Individual subcontractors engaged to provide specialist expertise for part of a course will be allowed on a case-by-case basis. Importantly, the new VET student loans program will limit courses eligible for a loan, which is really, really important and something we see in rural and regional areas. It will therefore focus on courses that have a high national priority; align with industry needs; contribute to addressing skills shortages-it cannot get simpler than that-and lead to employment outcomes. I spoke about the need to align locally and regionally with industry needs, and that is what we are doing. Everything our people do, from the time they enter kindy through primary school and high school to formal higher education or the VET system, is about their ultimate employment. That is the process. What we are trying to do is get people to a point that will lead to employment outcomes. The bill also provides the power for the minister to set loan caps, to help protect students from rapidly rising course costs and to set a ceiling on the maximum amount the government is willing to lend to a student for a specific course. Three maximum loan caps proposed for the start of the program are $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000 per course. However, the government recognises that there are some courses, such as aviation, which cost more to deliver than the proposed caps. We know that the training of pilots is an expensive business but is essential for regional development, especially in isolated areas and across the vast areas of Western Australia and much of Australia in general. The bill will therefore enable the minister to amend the caps to provide exemptions where needed. However that will be on a considered case-by-case basis; it will not be ad hoc. The government has made clear that this will be the exception rather than the rule. That is another check and balance. The program of VET education proposed by the government in this bill is a massive step forward in accountability, as it should be. It also represents-again, as it should-value for money for taxpayers, while providing a valuable education for the people who not only want it and need it but will use those skills in the workforce. In my part of the world that means helping to build and develop my region and add to my regional economy. Once again it has taken a committed coalition government to repair the damage done by the ALP, something, unfortunately, we have had to get far to used to doing. If only things like budget repair or cleaning up the building industry in Australia could follow suit. I live in hope. Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) (12:43): It must be tough for those on the other side to have the VET student loans bills come before the House as pretty much a carbon copy of many of the policies that we have put forward-sadly not all of our policy but a number of things that need to happen-to stop the rorting of the VET FEE-HELP scheme. Sadly, the fact that the government have had to come to it kicking and screaming means that billions of dollars has been rorted from the system by dodgy private providers. That is billions of dollars that should have been invested in TAFE and apprenticeships-money we just won't see again-and in young people who will have simply missed out on the chance of a good start. What is it like inside these operations? I have seen inside the operations of some of these big providers. They are big marketing machines, actively and aggressively recruiting potential students. And that is not just the bad ones. The good ones do that too. The difference seems to be the level of student support, the integrity of the course material and whether there is a genuine commitment to just getting bums on seats or to graduating students. I think graduation rates are a key indicator of whether a provider is serious or not. In 2014 the graduation rate for the 10 largest private providers was less than five per cent. That means 95 per cent of students who were signed up for a course did not graduate. One of the things that concerns me is that the good private providers are now tarnished by the behaviour of those bad private providers. In my own electorate of Macquarie there are very reputable long-term private providers. I have been speaking with one provider for more than two years about her concerns on the way other operators are working. She knew that flyby-night organisations, new on the scene and with no track record of course delivery, were taking advantage of the government's failure to crack down on the sector by offering high-fee, high-loan courses that gave little or no face-to-face student time and so were operating at a huge profit margin. No doubt the good providers will be very pleased to finally see some action on this. But, at the same time, they themselves will have suffered enormously. Let's look at the measures in this bill. One is on capping student loans to stop rip-offs. That would be our policy. Not one student should be asked to take out a loan for something they are not receiving. It should be fair value. Official data revealed the average tuition fee for a diploma of information technology from some private education course providers has soared from $2,779 in 2011 to more than $18,000 in 2014. Some private education providers are still charging students an average of $15,500 for a diploma of business management that cost $4623 in 2013. So they have clearly seen an opportunity, and that opportunity remained for so many years that they grabbed it. Cracking down on brokers is something else in this bill. That would be our policy, too. We all know the stories of brokers who have unscrupulously signed up elderly people, people with disability and people who do not speak English. Those sorts of brokers should have been out of business a long time ago. Linking publicly funded courses to industry need and skills shortages is contained within this bill. That would be our policy. There is no doubt we should be prioritising public funding to areas where skills are most needed. Business courses, including diplomas in hair salon management and training for 'fitness business professionals', now account for 50 per cent of the $1.7 billion that students borrowed for vocational training courses in 2014. There should have been action sooner. Requiring providers to reapply under new standards so only high-quality providers can access the loan system is a measure in this bill, and that would also be our policy position. It is important that that is in this bill. Our concern, though, is that there is no information yet about how that accreditation process will work in time for 1 January next year. That goes to the heart of this bill-that it is coming so late and there is so little time to see what the implementation will actually look like. How quickly will departmental staff be expected to develop and implement the new standards? Yet again, more pressure has been placed on hard working public servants. They are being asked to do something in an unreasonable amount of time. Linking funding to student progress and completion is something that I think needed to be government policy long before now. The government's failure to act has led to a scheme of charging whatever they can get away with for some dodgy providers. All the dodgy training company has to do is get students to sign up and then keep them hanging around until the first census date and the bulk of money goes straight through to the provider. After that, they do not really care if the students learn anything. We also support a VET loans ombudsman. Again, that was our policy and it is long overdue. There is one area of concern, though, that I hope will be looked into by the other chamber. Private drama, film and performing arts schools around the country are reeling from what I hope are unintended consequences of this legislation. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, of which I am a member, says the next wave of Australian acting talent is being put at risk by the government's decision to axe hundreds of courses. Around the country, only 12 courses in the screen, music, media and design areas look like retaining eligibility unless changes are made. These are highly credible courses that provide professional training for stage, television and film performers and makers. Many students depend on access to fee help to ensure that they can get in. That means we have a diverse pool of talent applying for these very elite courses. But they are elite based on talent, not on bank balances. We do not just want to see rich kids from the north shore and eastern suburbs of Sydney filling these courses. Like everyone, the MEAA supports the need for fee-gouging operators and substandard courses to be brought to account. But let's not lose incredibly talented students because they happen not to be wealthy. The Actors Centre in Leichhardt are one of those who are shocked at the legislation and at the announcement of courses that will not be eligible for fee help. They are concerned that acting courses have been lumped in with dodgy business courses and that this puts at risk the viability of the acting schools. I commend the director of the Actors Centre, Dean Carey, for speaking out on this on behalf of the whole sector. He has said that the whole performing arts centre will potentially be impacted on. With that, of course, go the hopes and dreams and sweat and tears of a whole generation of future performers whose job it will be to keep our Australian cultural independence alive. I note that this legislation allows for exemptions, and I think the performing arts sector's voice needs to be heard. When they are a school with a patron of the calibre of Hugh Jackman, it is great to see they are willing to speak out about this and talk to us. Let's hope that the other side listen. I should also disclose that my own daughter completed the three-year diploma course at the Actors Centre, thanks to VET FEEHELP. Another school that has been in contact with me is the Sydney Film School. Similar concerns exist for them. They have been operating for more than a decade. This film school will have its fees capped. I know a lot of people make movies on their iPhones, but in fact learning to be a filmmaker and how to work in the professional environment of international film and television involves using expensive equipment and a lot of hands-on work. It is not a cheap course to run. These are professional courses run by professional people, with industry standards taught by industry professionals. So capping fees at $10,000 per year, much like with pilots, will make it a prohibitively expensive course for the average budding filmmaker. But let us remember that these are not just your average filmmaker; these are hotly contested courses-you do not just apply and get accepted. They certainly do not offer you a free iPad to sign up. These courses turn people away because the standards have to be high. The Director of Education of the Sydney Film School, Kathryn Milliss, is an award-winning filmmaker, and she tells me that the most impacted students will be Indigenous students and low socioeconomic students. The Blue Mountains Aboriginal film festival was held for the first time this year, and in fact it featured a film by one of the new graduates of the Sydney Film School. These are young people exploring a medium to express not just their culture but who we are as Australians. They deserve a chance, and we as a nation deserve to have this sort of work being done. Let us be clear about the economic benefits of this sector. This is an industry that generates jobs and revenue. The Victorian government has found that creative industries in that state make up eight per cent of the economy, contributing almost $23 billion and 220,000 jobs. And the industry in New South Wales is bigger-some estimates have it at almost twice the size. We know that nearly five per cent of the population works in creative industries. In my electorate, the Blue Mountains Economic Enterprise group has found that 7.6 per cent of the total population is employed in the creative industries. Blue Mountains Economic Enterprise also estimates that they are the third-largest contributor to the Blue Mountains gross regional product. The total output of Blue Mountains creative industries is estimated to be $592 million. And that is just half my electorate. I am sure we would see equal data coming from the other half of my electorate, the Hawkesbury side. So future workers in this industry, the creatives who move the industry and influence our culture, need to be nurtured just like any other profession. All this is fixable. It is not too late. It is not completely locked in by this legislation, but we need the Senate to inquire to make sure there is consultation. The minister can amend the course list so creative industries are not crushed alongside dodgy courses by dodgy providers. The minister can negotiate a national partnership that ensures adequate funding for the creative arts. The big problem with this legislation, and in fact with this government, is procrastination. It is all happening late, at the eleventh hour, after much delay. Right now, kids who are thinking seriously about what they will do next year, who are sitting the HSC and making decisions, are being left in limbo. The government seems determined to undermine the confidence right now of an entire sector. It reminds me of the eleventh-hour decisions that impacted so heavily on the community sector on a Christmas Eve not so long ago-another example of the government failing to talk to people before making announcements. I urge the arts training industries to raise their concerns directly with the minister, but, more importantly, I urge the minister to really listen and make sure the creative future of Australia does not disappear. What consultation has taken place with the arts industry? None that we can ascertain. Does the government understand the need to evaluate the fees that a course charges in relation to the people it employs to deliver those courses? If it did talk to the performing arts sector, it would realise these courses account for a tiny proportion of the spend on training. They are usually courses that might have 300 people audition, with maybe two dozen accepted annually. They go through intense face-to-face training-you cannot learn these things online-and most of the people running these schools are doing it for the love of the industry and for the love of nurturing the next generation, running at a very low profit margin. My concern is that, without consultation, we will be in trouble. The government have redefined the meaning of the word 'consultation'. For them, it means, 'Let's make a decision finally, eventually, and then let's tell people about it.' That is what they think consultation is. All the arts sector is asking for is to have a conversation. We need to make sure that, in our bid to stop the rorting of the private fees and vocational education and training, we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. My concern is that, without decent consultation, the government will oversee a new dynamic, where we do not produce the best actors and performers from a cross-section of our society but we produce the best actors and performers from wealthy families-only those who can afford to pay. Having had the privilege of watching a diverse group of first-year students evolve into an equally diverse and impressive group of final-year graduates, I can only implore the government to consult with this sector. And let us keep in mind that, sure, not all these students will end up as the next Cate Blanchett, but the vast majority of the particular cohort that I have had the privilege to see are working in the industry, or in closely related industries where their skills have been transferable, and they are contributing economically to this society. That is to all our benefit. Let us hope that this legislation stops people from being signed up for courses that they should never be signed up for, that they will never complete, that they are only being signed up for so that someone makes money off them. Let us make sure that we do not lose the essence of what VET student loans are about, and that is helping people access the education they need to make Australia a better place. Student Loans Bill 2016, the VET Student Loans (Charges) Bill 2016 and the VET Student Loans (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2016, which deal with the ballooning cost of providing vocational education and training student loans throughout Australia as a result of shonky and unethical providers pushing courses on potential and active students that are not in their best interests, which they know they will never be able to pay back. These bills will introduce a new VET Student Loans program to replace the current VET FEE-HELP scheme from 1 January 2017. Loan caps will be introduced for eligible courses, with caps initially set at $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000. The minister will have the power to exempt courses with higher delivery costs as well as amend and index the caps. Caps will apply to individual qualifications and are not annual. The Commonwealth will have the ability to spread loan payments for students to providers across the duration of a course, as opposed to the current system, where the whole lump sum has been provided to the vocational education institute on the census date and often up-front. This has resulted in many of these private providers signing up to courses people they know will never be able to complete them, signing them up for a loan paid for by the Commonwealth, and getting the payment once the census date is reached, usually after one year of the course, and then not giving a damn about whether or not the individual completes the rest of the course. To be eligible for loans, a new eligibility criteria will be introduced and students will need to, firstly, be assessed as academically suitable for the course; and, secondly, periodically log in to a portal to confirm that they are active and legitimate students-removing the ability of providers to re-enrol failing or absent students without their knowledge. The Commonwealth will also have the power to immediately suspend a provider or withhold loan payments if it is suspected they are noncompliant. These measures have been made necessary over the past few years as the VET FEE-HELP debacle has gone from bad to downright disastrous. As this coalition government has sat idly by, asleep at the wheel, the sector has been filling with shonky providers who, rather than provide valuable educational experiences and opportunities to students across the country, have been dishing out pain and suffering through massive, crippling debt to thousands of Australians trying to forge a better life for themselves through quality education.",60,Bills
37,Mr Thistlethwaite (Kingsford Smith) (12:58,"I support the passage of the VETStories of deceit and debt have been filling our newspapers and media outlets, revealing the lengths to which private providers will go to secure government subsidies at the expense of often vulnerable people. On7 October, Fairfax media reported on the sad story of Helen Fielding. Ms Fielding, who grew up in foster care and suffers from an intellectual disability, was targeted by the Australian Institute of Professional Education. She says mandatory tests were forged by salespeople from this institution, who signed her up to a $19,600 diploma of human resource management when they came doorknocking on the door of her housing commission flat in Newcastle. In 2014 alone, this particular institution, Australian Institute of Professional Education, took in $110 million in public funding and has since gone into voluntary administration, leaving up to 16,000 students in limbo. Unfortunately, these types of shonky schemes have been allowed to flourish under the coalition government. Aggressive sales tactics have been a common factor in the sector, with stories of salespeople regularly targeting housing commission areas with suitcases full of laptops to act as inducements for people to sign up to courses they do not need and have no realistic prospects of ever completing. Aboriginal communities have also been targeted. In November 2015 Fairfax media again uncovered the story of an Indigenous family in a Queensland public housing estate that had been targeted numerous times by shonky providers looking to get rich. The mother of this family, Lenore Lutanichi, signed up to a course with Melbourne's Phoenix Institute in July last year and received a free laptop. She then encouraged other members of her family to think about courses with this provider, and all of her children and all of their partners did the same thing. They all received their own free laptops. Looking back on her enrolment and subsequent hefty HECS-style debt, Ms Lutanichi said, 'It was the most expensive laptop ever.' People have been targeted in my electorate of Kingsford Smith. Just recently I received an email from a young women named Angela who lives in Coogee, who said that, while searching for a jobs, she had been targeted by shonky course providers bombarding her with emails with what she described as 'private courses being falsely advertised as jobs'. She said course providers had attempted to lure her to pay thousands of dollars for 'self-employment' opportunities or 'careers development' courses that she said were 'not worth the paper they are written on'. These stories are not unique. VET FEE-HELP loans have blown out from about $700 million 2013 to a staggering $2.9 billion in 2015. But, in the face of such wastage and human suffering, this government has done little more than sit back, do nothing and observe the chaos, before belatedly adopting Labor's course of action that we announced in the lead up to the last election. Before the election, Labor proposed VET FEE-HELP reform. The policy that we released was in a form of a number of changes to the current system, including capping student loans to stop rip-offs; cracking down on brokers; linking publically funded courses to industry need and skills shortages; requiring providers to re-apply under new standards so only high-quality providers could access the loan system; linking funding to student progress and completion; and a VET FEE-HELP loans ombudsman. I notice that there is nothing in these bills about a VET FEEHELP loans ombudsman, but I understand it was a deal that the Greens had done with the government to gain their support for this. It will be interesting to see whether or not this VET FEE-HELP loans ombudsman ends up in the eventual legislation. This is something that the Labor Party obviously supports. The Liberals' initial response to measures such as capping student loans was dismissive. They did not want to have a bar of it when Labor proposed this policy at the last election. Some of their senior cabinet ministers were quite dismissive of what Labor and the shadow minister, the member for Cunningham, had proposed. Scott Morrison, the Treasurer, said it would 'pull the rug out from under the private education industry'. Then Minister Senator Scott Ryan called it a 'classist policy' and a 'thought bubble' that 'will lead to up-front fees for VET students'. Simon Birmingham, the current minister, said it was an 'ill-considered flat pack'. That was the view of the government prior to the election when Labor announced this policy. What do you know? They have suddenly done a 180-degree backflip, changed their tune and adopted most of Labor's policies. So the government has come to the party and basically copied all of the measures that Labor proposed prior to the election. The government have thoroughly let down those students who have been ripped off and they have done so partly due to their own debilitating obsession with internal politics rather than what is in the best interests of this industry. Rather than get to the bottom of the issue, determine a course of action to contain the blowout and pursue dodgy providers taking advantage of thousands of young and vulnerable people, the government has been busy chopping and changing the minister who has responsibility for this issue. I note that in the last three years the government has had five ministers for this issue. Meanwhile, the future of TAFE remains in the balance as the national partnership put in place by Labor expires in the middle of next year and the minister is seemingly unsure about whether a new agreement is needed to keep supporting TAFE. I have to say that what this government and state Liberal governments have done to the public vocational training system through TAFE colleges has been nothing short of a disaster and nothing short of outrageous. We are seeing their lack of support for public vocational education and training in this country reflected in the absolute roller-coaster in the number of people taking on apprenticeships in this country. TAFE is the backbone of the adult apprenticeship system. Unfortunately, this fact is not accepted by the coalition government, which has cut almost $2.5 billion from skills and training, including $1 billion from apprenticeship programs and the Tools For Your Trade program since 2013. The $1 billion cut to apprenticeships has seen apprentice numbers across Australia plummet from 417,700 apprentices in September 2013 to 295,300 apprentices in September 2015. That is 122,400 fewer apprentices in training across this country. They talk about alleviating skill shortages and building the infrastructure of the future to boost our economy, but apprenticeships are vitally important to ensure our nation has the skills base to take on this building task. In my electorate of Kingsford Smith apprentice numbers fell from 3,211 in 2014 to 2,137 in March 2015. That is over 1,000 fewer apprentices who are currently in training in the community in my electorate of Kingsford Smith. That is a disaster for the future of the local economy and our national economy when it comes to training people to deliver the skills of the future. The wheels have fallen off the Turnbull government when it comes to education and training and putting people in courses that deliver the skills to provide the workforce of the future. VET, TAFE and apprenticeships are crucial to jobs in our economy. With these bills it is good to see that the government has finally got its act together. It is good to see that the government has listened to the Labor Party and taken on the leadership that Labor has shown in this area. I congratulate the previous shadow minister, the member for Cunningham, Sharon Bird, for crafting this policy. She did a lot of work, consulting throughout the country, to craft this policy that the government has ultimately accepted. With these bills Labor genuinely hopes that the government has seen the light and will manage to do what is in the best interests of students and employers. There is a long way to go and it is incumbent upon this government to get its act together and oversee the successful implementation of these changes. You can bet your life that the opposition, the Labor Party, will hold them to account for these changes and make sure that the proposal is adopted and we do see an improvement in VET student loans in this country and ultimately, hopefully, a boost in the apprenticeship numbers. The government does need to get its act together on TAFE because its approach to TAFE and public vocational education and training has been nothing short of a disgrace. highlighted, it is great that the government have finally caught up and are actually putting forward these VET student loans bills that seek to address the exploitation, the gouging and what is going on in the VET student loan area, VET FEE-HELP. In the last term Labor put together some comprehensive reforms and on several occasions raised this very issue-and it was not just Labor but people within the sector, students, media and concerned people in the community. Alongside the exploitation of temporary workers this is the other issue that got a lot of coverage in the last three years. Labor is asking the government to support our amendment to see an ombudsman introduced in this space. Whilst these reforms will clean up some of the mess, we still have a lot of work to do to make sure it is cleaned up properly, and an ombudsman would assist with that. In highlighting how bad it has got I can go no further than what happened in my own electorate. I wish to share with the House the story of the Karen refugees who have made Bendigo their home. We are very proud to have a large Karen population in Bendigo. They are working hard. They do the jobs that other Australians would not do. They take on cleaning jobs and food-processing jobs. If they arrive in this country at a younger age they do very well at school and are engaged in education. They are volunteers in our CFA and are involved in soccer. They are contributing to our community. We were quite shocked to learn that they had been manipulated and tricked by one of these dodgy colleges into signing up for childcare and disability courses. It was not until they were halfway through the course that they found out via a text message that they would incur a debt of $17,000 for the course that they had been told would be free. It was not until they received this text message that they started to talk to me and to their Neighbourhood House about it. We worked closely with the community and with the department to see these debts waived. They are a group of new Australians-all of them have since become Australians-who were taken advantage of by a college provider and were not aware of the nature of the system. And it was not just one or two people; 52 Karen Australians were tricked into signing up for a course they thought was for free. It was a lot of work to get the debt waived, but we worked hard to make that happen-which is, I guess, another reason why we need to ensure that we have an ombudsman overseeing the reform in this area. The sad thing is that those Karen refugees are not alone. There have been incidents such as this experienced by people with a disability who were signed up to courses that they in no",74,Bills
38,Ms Chesters (Bendigo) (13:12,"As previous speakers on this side of the House haveway had the capability to complete. People were signed up on a 'Get a free iPad and get yourself into debt' basis. It is a demonstration of how, because it did not have the proper safeguards in place, a system became rorted at the expense of vulnerable Australians, who quite often ended up with a debt. We also know now that a number of those people will never pay back the debt. It is bad debt that this government and every government will inherit. It reminds me of the HECS debates that we have about how some women will never pay back their HECS debts because they simply will not earn enough. This is even worse. We are talking about people who are on fixed incomes and will, literally, never pay back the debt that they have incurred through this system. So we need to continue to look at reform in this space. That is why Labor has been speaking about this for quite some time. We know, through talking to people in our communities, what has happened in many states of Australia, including my state. Because state Liberal governments have gutted TAFE, we have seen dodgy providers marching in to try to fill the gap. There are a couple of things that I want to highlight in this contribution. I am disappointed that the money the government will save-and they are big on saving money-is not being reinvested into TAFE. Labor has made a TAFE guarantee. I am concerned that, if that money does not get invested in TAFE and the government does not partner with the states to help rebuild our TAFE system, we are going to leave areas of regional Australia without skilled education providers. To highlight that, another example from my electorate is the Bendigo TAFE. The former Liberal government gutted the Bendigo TAFE. They laid off hundreds of educators and teachers. Lots of courses were closed, including basic, common trade courses like construction. You cannot learn carpentry through a TAFE placement in Bendigo; you have to travel to Shep or Ballarat, and some are travelling as far as Geelong. We lost a number of courses. One young apprentice told me that, because of the cuts in staffing and delivery at the local Bendigo TAFE, they said, 'Look, try to do your welding on the screen. Just touch the screen and that will help you understand welding.' You cannot learn how to weld on a touchscreen computer-that is just madness-but this was the state of TAFE in Victoria. We almost lost our Bendigo TAFE and would have if not for the election of the Labor government, which put some money forward for a rescue package to try and save the TAFE so that they could start rebuilding. In acknowledging that state and federal governments have got the delivery of skills and vocational skills wrong in the past, this is an opportunity for the federal government to reinvest in skills. What we are not seeing from the government is them restoring the $1 billion that they have cut from apprenticeships and TAFE. They are not reinvesting in the apprenticeship scheme. Apprenticeship completion rates at the moment in this country are appalling and there is not enough being done by the government to improve them. We need to start looking at vocational skills and training in a serious way and at how we can rebuild the TAFE sector in this country. I invite and encourage the government, with the money they are saving from these measures, to partner with the states to rebuild our TAFE sectorparticularly in the regions. In the regions, you have smaller numbers of students putting their hands up. At Bendigo, even though they had 15 students on the books for a certain course, because they could not get 20 students the course was not going to break even, so they cancelled the course. Those 15 students had no other option but to go to Melbourne. That makes it very hard on young apprentices and trainees, particularly if they do not have their driver's licences or are driving or travelling on public transport. So we need the government to partner with the states and look at how we deliver trades in the regions. If there is not the volume of students that there is in the city, courses just are not being run-and that is happening currently. Instead, we have these dodgy providers trying to trick people and fill the gap. It is good that we are seeing reform on this, but we need to see much more reform and much more investment. It is the reality of the city versus regional situation. We should subsidise regional TAFEs to deliver quality training services. If we want to have people living in the regions and we want a skill base in the regions, what a great legacy it would be for this government to invest in skill based training in the regions. I am inundated by employers and businesses around the regions who say, 'We just don't have the skills we need.' For example, there is only one provider of pattern making courses left in Victoria, RMIT, but Keech Australia are not looking for pattern makers for dress clothing; they are looking for pattern makers for 3D printing. It is an innovative, exciting business. They are now 3D printing body parts such as hips for surgery and replacement, yet they cannot get people through the trades sector. They are not just looking for engineers; they are looking for people with trade qualifications and are willing to partner with TAFE. Where is the government putting the money on the table to help Keech Australia to do that? The money that we are saving in this area needs to be reinvested in TAFE to help rebuild the TAFE sector. Australians love TAFE for a very good reason: they know it works. Older people are constantly shocked when you tell them: 'The apprentices that you had available just don't exist today.' Take Bendigo Thales, for example. Where it was owned by the Australian government, it was known as the Ordnance Factory. They had 100 apprentices in a workforce of 1,000. There was a team of them-25 in each cohort each year. Granted the business was much bigger back then, today this company is down to four apprentices. Even with the new Hawkei contract that is coming on-and it is great to get that $1.6 billion investment-it has not brought on any new apprentices with that new work. It is a disappointment to our local young people that they cannot follow the pathway of their fathers or mothers into an apprenticeship. But it is also a reflection of the fact that Thales is not quite sure whether there are enough educators locally to be able to partner with its apprentices. It is great to see the government catch up to Labor and the community on this and move these reforms on student loans. But it is disappointing that, with all of the time and the delay that they have had in bringing this in, they have still failed to get the consultation right. I have been contacted by people in the arts sector that feel that they have been targeted by this government. There are some courses in creative industries which the government may call niche, but they actually do generate artists and creatives who go on to have professional careers. It is disappointing that the government has not consulted with that sector properly. Yes, there are rogue people. But, rather than going after the rouges, they have gone after everybody. I want the government to particularly take note of other courses that are delivering higher skills, like for pilots-not just airline pilots but also marine pilots. There are a number of skilled, professional-based training organisations that are currently using this scheme as a way to give opportunity to people within their organisation's businesses and industries to skill up. We do need to make sure that we are consulting with them. It is why I am glad this will be referred to a Senate inquiry-so those industries can say, 'Hey, look, we're legit. We should be quarantined from these reforms.' It is true that a lot are not legit. The Karen example that I had earlier today-of the Karen community from my electorate-is just one of many that I have highlighted. In this space we need to ensure that anybody that is taking out a student loan is getting a great and quality education. We have not seen that so far in the VET sector. We need to ensure that we are doing more to invest in TAFE. We need to ensure that we are doing more to rebuild public education and TAFE skills. It would be great to see some of the money being saved in this area be invested in our schools, whether it be the Gonski, TAFE or our universities, particularly in the regions. If you do not have a decent public provider that is willing and able, and has the resources to deliver the training that is required, we will be left with skills gaps in the regions worse than what they are now. Young people in the regions are looking for those opportunities. Youth unemployment figures are out. It is in our regions where we have some real spikes in youth unemployment. If we are genuine about reform and genuine about delivering skills and making sure that people have a good education, we should see rapid investment into public education-particularly our TAFE sector-to give those young people an opportunity to get the skills to get the jobs that we have in our country. Ms LAMB (Longman) (13:26): I rise today to speak to the importance of a fair and effective VET sector-a sector with sufficient checks and balances and a sector that strikes the right balance between public and private institutions. I concur with the member for Cowan's view that not every Australian needs to complete tertiary studies. Indeed, such an expectation is likely to be counterproductive, placing undue pressure on many young Australians. WhatI strongly believe and what I do expect is that our educational institutions provide value for money and facilitate a well-trained workforce. Unfortunately, though, many VET institutions, including some unscrupulous private providers, have failed to meet this basic threshold. In fact, it is fair to say that the system has fallen into crisis under the Liberals' watch. I will return to the Liberals' maladministration shortly, but before I do I would like to talk about my electorate of Longman and what a reliable, fair and quality VET sector means for the constituents of Longman. The National Centre for Vocational Education Research's most recent data reported that the number of VET students in the Longman region was 10,203. The ABS data shows that, at 17.1 per cent of those student, technicians and trade workers represent the highest occupational category. For these reasons, access to a quality and affordable VET sector is just crucial to my electorate. While Labor supports these bills in principle, it really is a case of too little, too late. This government talks about transparency, but only after thousands of students have accrued significant debt for courses with little hope of leading to a job. The government recognises a need for reform that they should have acted on sooner. Yes, delayed action is better than inaction, but we should not offer unqualified support for these bills simply because they decided to act. I previously mentioned the maladministration that characterises the Liberals' approach to the VET sector. Over the last three years the Liberals have shown they simply do not care about the sector, including TAFE. It has taken three years for this government to recognise the systemic problems within the sector. Although, I might add, these issues were not originally systemic, they were caused by the government's unfair and almost arbitrary funding cuts. Why have there been such delays? How did they justify these cuts to a sector that is already struggling for funding? The reality really is: they did not need to justify anything, because you do not justify action when you just do not care about the issue. Without doubt, reform of the sector is essential. Labor understands this, and that is why the government have essentially copied Labor's policies. If only they had acted sooner so billions could have been invested in apprenticeships and TAFEwith standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. National Disability Insurance Scheme Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (13:30): I recently met with Canberra families living with type 1 diabetes. 'We worry about grades, we worry about bullying-all the normal things a parent worries about,' they told me. 'But we also worry about the call that says, ""Your child is in a coma in an ambulance.""' This is National Carers Week. We have a duty to provide care and support to all those who require it. Labor takes that responsibility seriously. It is why we are proud of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and we are proud to be the party of the biggest social policy reform since Medicare. And it is why I am angry at reports from my community that the NDIA is no longer accepting new plan meetings. Canberrans who are eligible for the NDIS are being turned away, told the program has reached its cap. There is no cap on the NDIS. I repeat: there is no cap on the NDIS. The ACT's NDIS bilateral agreement outlines a target of 5,075 participants. It also makes clear that the full cost for any participants beyond this figure is to be met by the Commonwealth government-the full cost. The Turnbull government is ignoring that obligation. They have betrayed the trust of Canberrans living with disability. A good government supports its most vulnerable citizens. This is far from a good government. National Carers Week make to our nation. I would also like to inform the House of how Bonner will be celebrating its local carers this National Carers Week. National Carers Week is a time to celebrate and honour our unpaid carers. More importantly, it is a time to raise awareness of the work that carers do and the huge difference that they make. There are over 2.8 million unpaid carers in Australia. The unpaid work they put in represents close to two billion hours a year. Carers deserve our appreciation and support. That is why I am pleased to have partnered with FSG Australia to host a carers morning tea in Wynnum this Friday. Carers from the Wynnum-Manly community are invited to attend. This will be a great opportunity for local carers to learn more about the support services available to them. As one of my constituents, Gillian, has put it to me, 'It is important to let carers know they are not alone and that there is help out there for them.' Gillian had to give up her full-time work to care for her father for five years, while also caring for her son who has",77,Bills

After much work, Labor created the scheme, as support services were clearly not meeting the needs of Australians living with disability. In Bass the current demand is 1,300, growing to 2,900 participants under the full scheme. The current workforce is 500 to 600, growing to 850 to 1,050. But, left to a Turnbull Liberal government, real gaps in management and service provision have emerged, and people with disabilities are losing out. People in my electorate have experienced delays and dramas with transitional arrangements for the NDIS. They include families whose approval for the scheme has been delayed up to 18 months, and people who have lost state government subsidies on signing up for the scheme. The Launceston Examiner reported that a teenage boy with severe autism uses taxis to get to school because he cannot use the bus. However, the NDIS will not cover all of the transport that his state taxi concession card would cover. The boy's mother has been back and forth between the Liberal state government and the NDIA to no avail, while state and federal Liberals are both trying to avoid responsibility for cost, despite assurances that no-one will miss out. This is not good enough. The buck stops with the minister, the Minister for Social Services, to end the blame game and restore confidence in the rollout. The government ought not to blame Bruce Bonyhady and the NDIA board. Labor will fight for the NDIS to be delivered in full and in a timely manner. Fallas, Ms Patricia 50 years of service to Meals on Wheels in the Mount Gambier community. Volunteers play a critical role in helping shape our society and build stronger communities, and the dedication of volunteers like Patricia is to be highly commended. Pat's journey with Meals on Wheels began in 1964, when she agreed to fill a shift for another volunteer. She was soon a permanent fixture. When Pat began her journey of volunteerism, she was accompanied by her four-year-old daughter, Karen, as she worked in the kitchen helping to prepare what was then 39 meals a day. Pat has seen many changes over the years, and has always enjoyed the camaraderie of her fellow volunteers on her fortnightly Monday shift. By 1995, Mount Gambier Meals on Wheels had moved to a newer, larger kitchen to help cater to increased demand. Pat has continued to always maintain high standards in preparing meals. As she has said on numerous occasions, she would never serve to a client anything she would not eat herself. In July 2010, the Mount Gambier branch of Meals on Wheels served its one-millionth meal, which Pat had the privilege of preparing and serving. Pat epitomises the values of volunteer. She is passionate, she is dedicated and, notwithstanding her advancing years, she has remained enthusiastic during each and every shift. Pat has been an outstanding contributor to Meals on Wheels and, as such, a great asset to the community of Mount Gambier.",81,Statements By Members

In my state of Queensland, the rollout has commenced in Townsville and Charters Towers for children under 18, and for all eligible residents on Palm Island. It is extraordinary that the Minister for Social Services believes that he does not need to consult widely with the community on changes to the board of the National Disability Insurance Agency. In fact, he thought it was fair to have the board members read in a national newspaper that their jobs were being advertised. Now, more than ever, strong and connected leadership at the NDIA board level is essential. Bruce Bonyhady should not be used by the minister as a scapegoat for the problems he has with his system. We have moved into the full rollout of the NDIS, and this is not the time to make substantial changes to the NDIA board. Bruce Bonyhady's leadership has been second to none. He is highly qualified in his professional expertise and he also brings an additional vital key ingredient to the table-he is the father of two sons with a disability. Once again we see this government putting money before people. The significant transformational change that the NDIS offered people with a disability was a leadership role that was genuine and valued, and people with a disability for the first time have genuine choice and control over their services, and yet we see the minister making decisions about board appointments that seem to be based on financial and business expertise.

If you need any further support for that proposition, look no further than the reports in The Australian today confirming the sackings of the NDIS board, including the father of the NDIS Bruce Bonyhady. What does that tell us? It tells us that this government, under the direction of the Minister for Social Services-a Western Australian, God forbid!-has betrayed Australians all over the country, including from my home state of Western Australia, in relation to those suffering from impairment and their carers. This minister has failed to adequately resource the NDIS. This minister has failed to deliver a meaningful or competent IT system in relation to the let downs of the myplace portal. This minister has failed the basics in meeting deadlines. Contrast that with the Labor Party. The Labor Party had the vision to articulate the need for the NDIS in the first place, as opposed to this mob opposite. It was Labor who was the architect and builder of Medicare. Labor was the architect and builder of superannuation. Labor is the architect and builder of the NDIS. Compare that to this government, who has simply let Australians down.

In Corangamite, we are delivering in spades. I want to talk a bit about our election commitments for the people of Corangamite. One is a $20 million jobs and investment package for our region, which will fund competitive business innovation grants to grow jobs, new or upgraded infrastructure, and training to address skills shortages. Very shortly, we will be announcing a task force which will oversee the planning of this fund. Unlike Labor, which turned its back on Avalon airport when it refused to give consent to an international airline back in 2008, we have designated Avalon airport as a regional airport, opening the door to new international flights, which is a very exciting opportunity for everyone involved at Avalon. Really, what we are hoping is that this will be a precinct which will grow to some 10,000 jobs, and we celebrate the $40 million investment made by Cotton On and Avalon, a huge distribution centre for a wonderful company. We promised: more than $55 million for road upgrades, including another $20 million for the Princes Highway; $5 million for a new Anam Cara palliative care community hospice; and $1 million planning money for a duplicated rail track between South Geelong and Waurn Ponds-all part of our very strong commitment to regional communities and to Corangamite.

This wide ranging, holistic planning project has identified the development of an iconic touring route, to be known as the 'Great River Road', as a key tourism project. The 'Great River Road' project will deliver high quality tourism infrastructure and promote the spectacular nature of the views and experiences available along the 'Great River Road'. This will boost the local economy by increasing tourism and tourism yield, growing jobs in a number of small rural communities including Bellbridge, Walwa, Jingellic, Tintaldra, Towong, Corryong and Khancoban.

This is what she wrote: My story began on 1 September 1973, when my son Mark was finally born at 6:20 pm in the evening, after more than 20 hours trying to be born. He was described as 'blue and slow to breathe'. I don't need to look at the card to remember that day. But Mark was not diagnosed as having Cerebral Palsy until he was 14 months of age, even though I had reported odd behaviour to doctors previously.

I was 'carrying the world on my shoulders.' I persevered-you have to-you just have to. My daughter Allison was born on 18 April, 1977 and then I had 3 'babies'. It seemed ok-I was coping with that. It was people's attitude I wasn't coping with. It was as if they thought they would catch something from us if they got involved. Let me say Ann, I am crying as I write this. My life has been extremely difficult. In more recent years, with my own disabled body, as a result of overwork and carrying the load virtually alone, there were times I wished I could leave this life … (Time expired) National Disability Insurance Scheme Week to speak on the importance of the NDIS to this country. The NDIS is the biggest reform in this country since Medicare, and for the people whose lives it affects it is just as transformative. At its heart is the simple proposition that every Australian, whether or not they suffer a disability, deserves fairness and access. The NDIS is a Labor creation and we are so proud of it. I woke this morning to read with great displeasure that the NDIA board was being sacked and Bruce Bonyhady, the father of the NDIA, was being made the scapegoat for this government's failure to properly resource the NDIS. The NDIS started with great bipartisanship. We had great hopes that we would walk together in the same direction. But what started out as the government's crab walk away from a commitment to the NDIS has become a jog. Pretty soon it will be a sprint away from the principles of the NDIS and equality for people suffering a disability. This carries on with the minister's war on social security. All week we have heard talk about the 'welfare mentality' and the 'welfare addiction' in this country. We have seen the headlines in the tabloid papers. This government is gearing up for a war on the poor, a war on social security and a war on people who rely on social security for their basic needs. Who do we have to thank for that? A minister who is a third-generation Liberal blue blood. (Time expired) East West Link to reaffirm this government's commitment to the desperately needed East West Link project and remind the House that $3 billion in federal funding remains available for its completion. Time and time again, whether the report is from Infrastructure Australia or Infrastructure Victoria, the crucial need for the East West Link continues to be highlighted by transport experts. When surveyed by the RACV last month, Victorians voted the Eastern Freeway junction with Hoddle Street and Alexandra Parade Melbourne's worse traffic bottleneck, a nightmare that only the East West Link can resolve. Earlier this week, though, in Senate estimates, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Don Farrell, questioned the government's continued support for the East West Link and suggested that the $3 billion in federal funding",85,Statements By Members

Is this Labor's new policy: rip money from the East West Link to be spent in another state? Victorians have already had to put up with Dan Andrews and Bill Shorten spending more than $1.2 billion not to build the East West Link. Now we have Labor's Senate deputy leader suggesting that the $3 billion committed to this project should be spent in another state. Victorians know that the East West Link must be built, and I want to reassure residents of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne: we are committed to building the East West Link and we will not allow Labor to rip $3 billion away from Victoria. National Disability Insurance Scheme Ms SWANSON (Paterson) (13:48): This week, Carers Week, we have legislation for an NDIS 'special fund', which is no doubt a euphemism for 'budget cut'. And today we have the social services minister, Christian Porter, seeking to purge the NDIS by sacking the father of it, Bruce Bonyhady. It is a disgrace! Is this government trying to wreck the NDIS? I think so. Labor authored the NDIS and we will not stand by while this mob wreck it. In my electorate of Paterson there have been massive problems with the NDIS rollout stemming from the government's failure to provide resources to cope with demand and its botching of the IT system, resulting in huge delays in participants being signed up and service providers being paid. I have made representations on behalf of disability service providers who have gone for months without being paid and clients whose list of complaints includes the long wait to be signed up, an inability to use the MyPlace portal and terrible communication between the NDIS and clients' own healthcare providers. For example, Mr Allan McCorquodale, from Medowie, has been waiting for months for his wife, Lesley, to be moved onto the NDIS so they can buy a new van and have it modified for their transport needs. My office has been told there are only two caseworkers assessing people for the NDIS across the entire Paterson Hunter region-two! Clearly, that is not enough. Mr Porter, you need to step up! will remind the member for Paterson about the use of props. She is a new member, so I gave her some leniency. I will not do so next time.

It is a truth that Labor builds and the coalition tears down. It is an absolute truth. We see it with Medicare and now we are going to see it with the NDIS. This news is heart breaking. It is heart breaking for the families in my electorate who are patiently waiting, watching their friends and relatives in Barwon, in the first rollout-prepared to wait, to be last cab off the rank. They are shattered today to hear that this government cannot be relied on even to deliver on what was supposedly a bipartisan promise. They have failed my community today. Mr Porter needs to come in here and answer questions today about why he is going to shift the blame to other people. He has got Bruce Bonyhady sacked, the father of the NDIS. I stand here with my colleagues today and I am going to pay tribute to a man called Bill Shorten who built the NDIS. On this side we build things and on that side they tear them down. Again, they are wiping out hope in our community. They kill hope. All they see is money. They never, ever see that they need to care. Huxley, Mr Dane Executive Officer of Mildura Base Hospital. He is a man who recently passed away. His funeral is on Friday. He has been instrumental in the growth and development of the Mildura community. Dane was actively involved in a number of organisations in Mildura. He was a board member of the former Sunraysia Mallee Economic Development Board, Chairman of the Northern Mallee Primary Care Partnership, Chairman of the Mildura Rural City Council Audit Committee, Chairman at the Mildura Development Corporation from 2009-2013 and, more recently, Chairman of the Project Control Group of the Sunraysia Modernisation Project to oversee the successful implementation of this $120 million irrigation modernisation project. Dane was a strong supporter of the arts community in the Mildura region as well, with Ramsay Health Care, supporting the Mildura-Wentworth Arts Festival for a number of years. Dane was a mentor to many in our community and we will sadly miss him. He always gave me a hard time. He told me that as an MP I should always wear a tie. For you, Dane, I have a tie on today; it is a pink one. I know you do not like pink.

Over the next few years the NDIS will help 460,000 people with disability and their families and carers. Despite this, this Minister for Social Services wants to sack Bruce Bonyhady and purge the NDIS board. WhatI fear is that the Minister for Social Services wants to use Bruce Bonyhady as a scapegoat for the problems that exist in the rollout of the NDIS that are this minister's responsibility. This minister wants to corporatise the NDIS, put his mates on the board and get rid of extraordinary people, like Bruce Bonyhady, who have done so much to make the NDIS a reality in this country. Let's be clear. This minister is responsible himself for the problems in the NDIS, the problems with IT. People with disability know what you are up to, and they will hold you responsible. Harness, Mr James 'Jim' War II veteran and long-term resident of Albany, former British Royal Navy Signalman James Harness. Just over two months ago, I joined Mr Harness and his family at the National ANZAC Centre, where he was a recipient of the Chevalier class Legion of Honour medal from the French government, for his gallantry during the D-Day landing. Mr Harness had recently celebrated his 91st birthday, and was the centre of attention, surrounded by his loving family, many of whom had travelled great distances to be with him for this proud occasion. As Jim sat with the vista of Albany's King George Sound before him, I am sure he reflected on the contrasting view when he stood alongside his captain, surveying the carnage on Juno Beach, Normandy, on 6 June 1944. The 18-year-old signalman was part of the first assault wave that morning and came under heavy fire on the beach. He was very lucky to survive. His vessel later carried supplies to the troops and he remained in Normandy until October 1944. Mr Harness served in the Far East Fleet until Japan surrendered, and his prestigious naval career included time in Sumatra, Malta, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaya, Hawaii and the West Indies. In 1966 Mr Harness, his wife, Valerie, and their young family moved to Albany, where he worked at the Albany Woollen Mills and Cooperative Bulk Handling until his retirement in 1983. He lived out his twilight years in Albany, and passed away earlier this week.

I wish I could say the same, however, for the opposition. As this duplicitous opposition leader knows, who stands up, dripping with sanctimony about guns: he is the leader that has twice opposed mandatory sentences for people who smuggle guns.

Will the Prime Minister advise the House on the importance of registered organisations and trade unions being accountable to their members? How does the registered organisations bill support the government's national economic plan? for her question. This morning, I summed up the second piece of vital workplace legislationreintroduced into the House, on that occasion, for the fourth time-this week, the registered organisations bill. The registered organisations bill and our commitment to re-establishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission are critical elements of economic reform. Lawabiding workplaces, law-abiding unions and employer organisations are vital for our economy. We cannot stand idly by while militant unions can continue their thuggery and their bullyboy tactics-continue standing over rank and file members, threatening rank-and-file members of their union and of other unions, and contractors. We saw the obscene threats from the CFMEU at that Gold Coast construction site on the video yesterday. We saw that, and those chilling words: 'I know your phone number. I know where you live.' That is the thuggery that has to come to an end. This is not only disrespecting the law and not only making a mockery of justice; it is driving up the cost of construction of every school, every road, every bridge and every apartment building. And all this at a time when public finances are under pressure. We know that unions play an important role in Australian society. We are not about unionbusting. We are about economy-boosting. We know that unions act, or should act, for their members. We know they should put their members first-and so, in their hearts, do members opposite. And yet they have seen, again and again, the honourable member opposite: he knows Kathy; he knows Craig; he knows Cesar; he knows all of his friends there, and he knows what they did. He knows the way they stole. He knows the way they lied. He knows that they broke every obligation of good corporate governance. And what are we asking the parliament to do?

That was a decision of his government and it was the right decision. And when that ban was coming to its conclusion because the state and territory police ministers had not come to agreement on how to reclassify these lever action shotguns we extended the ban. We did so for precisely the same reasons the Abbott government imposed it, and that was because we are not prepared to see those guns imported into Australia under the current classification which they have under John Howard's gun laws. The reality is that the gun laws must be strengthened as they apply to lever action shotguns. To this date, despite our best efforts, the states and territories have not agreed on the way in which these guns should be reclassified, and until they do they will not be imported. Full stop. That is our position. Turning to national security: what we have is an opposition that has not only refused to support the introduction of mandatory sentences for gun smuggling. Imagine that.

How does small business contribute to Australia's building and construction sector? What is this government doing to tackle the corruption and lawlessness in the building industry that hurts small family businesses and pushes up costs and prices for hard working Australians? question. As a good member from South Australia she knows that there are 20,643 small construction businesses in South Australia. Across the country there are some 340,000 small construction businesses. Small construction businesses account for 70 per cent of employment in the construction industry. There are some 63,000 South Australians employed in the construction industry in that state. Their livelihoods and the businesses they are employed by are all negatively impacted by the lawlessness in the building and construction industry, which can be remedied by the reintroduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission-which is opposed by those opposite. They are affected by the CFMEU and those other unions who seek to run these businesses off site and to run them out of business. That is what the design has been of the CFMEU and their counterparts. The member will be interested to know that, in April this year, the Federal Court issued orders penalising the CFMEU and 15 of its officials with a total of $937,100 in relation to seven cases stemming from unlawful conduct on building sites across Adelaide in 2014. This was initiated by Fair Work Building and Construction because of a spike in unlawful activity on South Australian construction sites that affected 26 projects. Nineteen of those officials affected had flown in from other states to wreak their havoc in South Australia, importing their poison from those states into South Australia. One of the issues raised in this case was at Flinders University, where CFMEU officials were found to have threatened to cause major disruptions unless the CFMEU flag was flown from the crane hook! They were prepared to shut down sites for that level of vanity. Those opposite oppose these laws; they oppose them being reintroduced.

Yesterday in the House the Prime Minister said in relation to the Adler shotgun: It is not a temporary ban. It is permanent. It is set in stone. But this morning, when asked if it was only temporary, the Prime Minister responded: 'It was always.' Does the Prime Minister want the ban to be permanent, or should we just direct the question to the Leader of the National Party? for his question. The position on the import ban is very straightforward: it is there until the police ministers of the states and territories agree on the reclassification of lever-action shotguns and, having agreed on it, implement their measures. Then, the import regulations will be adjusted to conform with the classification so agreed on. That was the case with the ban imposed in 2015; it is the case with the ban that was imposed in 2016. But let's talk about guns at the edge of the issue where it really impacts safety to the utmost. We know that we have the best regulation of guns in the world-thanks to John Howard and Tim Fischer. The leadership of the coalition ensured that we have the best gun laws and, as I have said many times, we are reminded of the value of our gun laws whenever we see events overseas. Mr Morrison interjectingimprisonment of at least five years for gun smuggling and trafficking in illegal weapons. The Leader of the Opposition has written to me-I have received the letter in the House. He said: 'There is no convincing evidence to prove mandatory minimum sentencing acts as an effective deterrent.' All right. Well, that is his view now. Let's look at the member for Gorton back in 2011-he boasted of introducing, in respect of people smuggling, a mandatory minimum sentence of eight years-or, indeed, the member for Parramatta. She said: 'I am proud to stand to support this bill'. Importantly, it extends mandatory minimum penalties for people-smugglingand so it goes onThese amendments demonstrate that the Rudd government is serious about stopping people smugglers. So the reality is that the Labor Party knows that mandatory minimum sentences have a very important deterrent effect. They know that. They supported them in the past when they were in government, but apparently trafficking in illegal firearms is not important enough to warrant them supporting mandatory minimum sentences now. If they are serious about keeping Australians safe-if they are serious about stamping out gun crime-they should support our legislation so that we can stamp out the illegal trafficking in weapons.",93,Questions Without Notice

The Australian Bureau of Statistics forward work program for 2016-17 includes a statement from the Australian Statistician that the ABS will not have the resources necessary to undertake all the activities that fall within its legislative mandate. Significantly, for those of us who live in regional Australia, this program identifies regional economic data as an area the ABS may cease or wind back. Given the growth and development that is happening in regional Australia, including both of our electorates, we clearly need more data not less. Can the minister please give a guarantee to the people in our electorates and the rest of Australia that the ABS will receive the funding and resources it needs to give us people doing planning in rural and regional Australia the information we need? (Time expired) member for Indi for her question. It is an important one. The Australian Bureau of Statistics routinely examines the priorities and the statistical series it will undertake in any given 12month period. This is simply a forward working plan-a planning document. I note that recently the member for Fenner, sitting opposite, created some unnecessary panic about the survey releases and the work of the ABS. Last week the member for Fenner wrongly asserted that the ABS is unable to collect the statistics which it is legally required to and that its users want. This is not the case, Member for Fenner. The reports that the ABS is merely looking at and consulting on, which the member for Indi referred to, are not legally required to be undertaken. That said, the ABS's forward work program published last week is a signal for the upcoming consultation process. The ABS is committed to quality stakeholder engagement. No changes will be made without full consultation with stakeholders, Member for Indi. The regional economic data, which the member for Indi referred to, is classified as tier 3 data, and it will be under review, along with other datasets in tier 3. This data is used to produce a national regional profile on an annual basis, the latest of which was released on 30 June this year. I can understand why the member for Indi is interested in this data set, as it provides information by region. She and I used to share a common border before the New South Wales boundaries were redistributed prior to the last election, and I can assure the member for Indi that no decisions will be made without full consultation with all stakeholders.

The former statistician Brian Pink said in his 2012-13 ABS annual report, reflecting the last full year that Labor was in office: … I remain concerned about the wide range of ageing and fragile business processes and supporting infrastructure used by the ABS, our difficult capital position, which is barely adequate to 'keep the lights on', and the impact these are having on our costs and on our staff.

The last time the Australian Building and Construction Commission existed in Australia it improved productivity in the building and construction industry by 16.8 per cent. It saved consumers $7½ billion. Yet the Leader of the Opposition when he was the minister in the Gillard government abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Given its obvious importance to the economy and to 1.1 million Australians employed in the building and construction industry, one wonders why the Leader of the Opposition abolished it. I may have found a clue buried in the volumes of the evidence provided to the Heydon royal commission, and that was an email sent by Dean Mighell, who will be very familiar to many people in the House for a number of reasons. Dean Mighell, the former long-term secretary of the ETU, the Electoral Trades Union, provided an email to the royal commission that he had sent to other state secretaries in Victoria in midto late-2010. In it he writes: Given that the Federal ALP is desperate for funds, surely we can say that we will help them if and only if, they abolish the ABCC. I can tell you for a fact that unions are donating to Federal labor for outcomes not promises … When he was asked by the royal commissioner what unions were engaging in this process of donating to the ALP for 'outcomes not promises', he said, 'I believe that the CFMEU were again seeking the abolition of the ABCC as a policy outcome.' So there we are, Mr Speaker. And surprise, surprise, it was done by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the minister responsible. The unions gave money on the basis of policy outcomes.",95,Questions Without Notice

So cash for outcomes was the order of the day when the Leader of the Opposition was in charge of this area of policy-$11.1 million from the CFMEU and $4 million from the ETU flowed to the Labor Party, and they got the outcome they wanted. The Leader of the Opposition can prove me wrong. He can prove us all wrong by reversing his position and supporting the ABCC and the ROC. That will prove that he is not the cat's paw of the union. If he does not, unfortunately, he stands condemned. Gun Control Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:25): My question is to the Prime Minister. This morning it is reported that the member for Parkes has backed calls for the importation of the Adler shotgun, saying: I'm hoping we can still get this through because I know of one gun dealer who has hundreds on order waiting for this decision. Prime Minister, if the ban is set in stone, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, why are so many members of his government preparing for the weapon to enter Australia? interjecting. The member for Wakefield will cease interjecting. The Prime Minister has the call. for her question. The honourable member should recognise, and I am sure she does, that there are legitimate views about the way in which different weapons should be classified. And to try to demonise Australian gun owners and shooters because they have a particular view about the appropriate classification of a firearm is outrageous. It is the contempt that people in the Labor Party have for people in regional and rural Australia who need guns in order to sustain their livelihoods in terms of exterminating feral pests on their own properties and in terms of recreation. We have a very good balance in Australia. We have a very well-regulated firearms sector. It is very well regulated. It was set in place by John Howard and Tim Fischer. It is one of the great prides of the coalition. What we are doing here is ensuring that the state and territory police ministers have the opportunity to consider and reclassify lever action shotguns. There is a difference of opinion in the community about the appropriate classification, but can I say, Mr Speaker, I am not aware of anybody that wants to leave the classification as it is. Every argument I have seen involves strengthening the classification, and the debate is as to how far it should go. That is a legitimate point of view on which there are differences of opinion.

That is what is putting our people at risk. We are determined to stop their importation, we are standing up for the safety of Australians and we are demanding that we impose mandatory minimum sentences. For Labor to say they have an in-principle objection is demonstrated to be absurd. Only a few years ago in government, Labor advocated and legislated mandatory minimum sentences for people smuggling. Why? Because they thought it was a horrendous crime that needed to be stamped out and there needed to be a strong measure of deterrence. Gun smuggling is a similarly horrendous crime. We ask Labor to join us in stamping it out.

Immigration Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on the steps the government is taking to make Australian society safer, including through the use of section 501 of the Migration Act? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches? thank the honourable member for his very important question. It is the case that this government has cancelled a record number of visas under section 501 of the Migration Actthat is, people who were visiting our country and committed an offence while they were here. We take a very tough decision and we boot them out. We cancel their visas and we kick them out. In Labor's last year in government, they cancelled 84 visas. In the last 12 months, we have cancelled 1,013 visas. Included in that is well over 100 outlaw motorcycle gang members. When I look at the categories, I think the motorcycle gang members are included in most of these categories, and we are up in all of these categories: armed robbery, 139 cancellations; assault; drug offences; fraud; deception; grievous bodily harm; reckless injury; kidnapping; manslaughter; murder; other violent offences; theft; robbery; use threat with intent. All of these categories are up dramatically because, I suspect, many of the bikies fall into those categories. Not every Australian is supportive of the work that we are doing in cancelling these visas. In May, it is reported, we had paid CFMEU organiser Mick Powell and union delegate Stu-e Corkran attend a Rebels protest against the visa cancellation of a Rebels gang member. He may well be an extortionist or a robber, he may well turn up on building sites and muscle subcontractors and all sorts of people in a shocking way, but he is not too smart, our Stu-e, because he turned up in his Rebels outfit-",97,Questions Without Notice

WhatI can say is this: this is obviously a question that will be discussed by the relevant state ministers, and I look forward to their deliberations. You asked me whether we use firearms on farms for pest control-yes, we do; whether we use them for recreation-yes, we do. You should have asked the question about where most of the illegal firearms come from. They are actually imported illegally, and 97 per cent of crimes, we find, are actually using illegal firearms.

We do actually believe in using firearms for pest control and recreation. What we do know is that overwhelmingly the firearms that are used in crimes are illegally imported. When we tried to get an increase in the sentencing for the people who use those firearms the people who stood against us were the Australian Labor Party. It is incongruous for the Australian Labor Party to come to the dispatch box in this instance. I keep on getting asked questions by the member for Sydney rather than the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for agriculture.

Will the minister update the House on the government's record $50 billion infrastructure investment program, including projects in my electorate of Page? What is the importance of building infrastructure in a timely and cost-efficient manner? the member for Page for his question. He is a great champion of small business in his community, because he knows that this is a government which is getting on with the job. This is a government which is focused on building for the future. The Turnbull-Joyce government is investing in a record $50 billion infrastructure investment program. I know the member for Grayndler likes it. I mentioned the Turnbull-Joyce government. The member for Grayndler is the people's choice after all. It is spring racing time, and he seems to be up and about these last couple of days. He seems to be up and about at the moment. The Leader of the Opposition must feel like that horse that leads on the first leg of the Melbourne Cup. It is a long, long way to go. The member for Grayndler is a stayer. He has been here for 20 years, and I reckon there are plenty over there who are backing him as well. They are backing him to finish over the top, watching him on the second lapdelivering. The member for Page knows the value of good infrastructure right across Australia. He knows that when you invest in good infrastructure you change people's lives in his community, and you can save people's lives. Look at the Pacific Highway project, where he is encouraging local businesses to be involved in the government investment in this outstanding project-$5.6 billion from the federal government is going into this project. I know that the member for Capricornia is a huge supporter of investment in her community. There is $35 million going into the Peak Downs Highway bridges project. Right across Australia, we have the member for Fisher with $743 million invested in the Caloundra Road to Sunshine Motorway; and the member for MacPherson, who has been a great champion of investment in her community. Right across this side of the House we have members who are supporting investing in infrastructure. We are getting on with the job, while Labor is simply getting in the way, refusing to help us get value for money for the Australian taxpayers. It is not just us that are warning about the challenges to our infrastructure program. We have had the Master Builders. Their director of construction policy, Corlia Roos, said early this year: More than 50% of all working days lost in Australia are in the construction sector. This is an extraordinary amount which forces up the cost of building tax-payer funded schools, hospitals and public infrastructure by as much as 30%. One million Australians and 300,000 small business operators are working in the building and construction sector. On this side of the chamber we are on their side. We stand with those small business owners and their employees. Those opposite are standing with union thugs, and they know it. We are getting on with the job. This government is providing funding to thousands of projects which are driving economic growth and productivity right across the nation. We are providing jobs for the future.

Infrastructure Infrastructure and Transport. I refer to the gap between the government's infrastructure rhetoric and its action. In the 2014 budget the government promised to invest over $8 billion on transport infrastructure in the 2015-16 financial year. Is the final outcome for this investment not $8 billion, but $5.5 billion? Was this cut of more than 30 per cent achieved by cutting the Pacific Highway, the Bruce Highway, Gateway North, South Road, black spots, heavy vehicles(Time expired) the member for Grayndler for his question. The short answer is no. As the member well knows, it is not at all unusual for major projects to be rephased into concurrent years as projects that meet their various deadlines for the project. The member for Grayndler did serve in this role, and he well knows that there are occasions where major project funding is moved to the next year for those projects to continue. I appreciate the member's question. It gives me the opportunity to reinforce that this government, the Turnbull-Joyce government, has a $50 billion infrastructure investment. That is a record investment in the future of our nation. In this year alone, as the member for Grayndler knows, there is $9 billion in our infrastructure investment program. That is a record investment in the 2016-17 financial year in the future of our nation. The reason we are so committed to investing in our nation's future and investing in good infrastructure is that we recognise that, when you invest in good infrastructure, you do change people's lives and you can save people's lives. In terms of changing people's lives, it is reducing congestion through major projects in some of our urban environments. There are major projects that the Minister for Urban Infrastructure is delivering right across our nation. It is saving lives through projects like upgrading the Bruce Highway and upgrading the Pacific Highway to two lanes in both directions by 2020. That project alone will save in the order of 1,000 lives by 2040. That is an extraordinary result through investing in good infrastructure. We recognise on this side of the House the importance of investing in good infrastructure. We have a record infrastructure investment program being delivered by the Turnbull-Joyce government. It is not just in our capital city; it is not just on our regional highways; it is in our small country towns as well. It is a program that we are very proud of right across the nation. We would urge those opposite, rather than stand in the way, rather than be obstructionist and rather than be negative about the future of our great nation, to work with us on investing in these extraordinary projects, which are going to provide for improved productivity, are going to reduce congestion and are going to save lives right throughout the nation.",101,Questions Without Notice

127,Mr Chester (Gippsland,"Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:43): I thankBuilding and Construction Industry Innovation and Science. I remind the minister that yesterday the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry executive officer, James Pearson, warned that every Australian is paying up to 30 per cent more for building projects than they need to. Will the minister outline how the rule of law promotes more jobs and better investment? thank the member for Gilmore. It is absolutely clear, after their votes in this House over the last two days, that the Labor Party are deliberately running a parliamentary protection racket for the thugs of the CFMEU. And it is not just our view. What we heard yesterday from ACCI was absolutely clear: a failure to pass the Australian Building and Construction Commission legislation would add 30 per cent to the cost of what would otherwise be construction in Australia-30 per cent, and that means jobs and that means fewer projects and that means that the outcome is that the workers suffer and the community suffers. But it is not just ACCI that says this. We know that the Master Builders has done work in this space. In an article headed 'Nation held to ransom by union thugs' in The Courier-Mail, here is what was said: THE cost of nation-changing projects will fall by 30 per cent if union thugs can be erased from building sites by a powerful new watchdog, according to Master Builders Australia. But it is worse than that. It is the community that actually suffers from Labor's intransigence and protection racket. What did Master Builders go on to say? It is the community that is being cheated, it is the community that is being deprived of the much-needed classrooms, the additional hospital beds, the additional childcare places. So it is clear that Labor are deliberately willing to destroy jobs to protect a union which is thuggish and itself destroys jobs. The one thing that the CFMEU is willing to do is to create some jobs on that side-and right on cueMr Hunt interjectingof order-and he will state the point of order.

(Time expired) Economy that this year's budget was 'an economic plan, not just another budget'. Given the centrepiece of the Treasurer's so-called plan, a $50 billion tax cut for big business, is now dead in the water and will not pass the parliament, Treasurer, what is plan B? Or will it just be more budget chaos? true, at the last election and in the last budget, we outlined a national economic plan to drive jobs and growth in this country. Already in this parliament we have introduced income tax cuts which have passed this parliament. We have been successful in taking through savings to the budget which boost the resilience of the Australian economy and our finances. And we continue to stand absolutely by our commitment to ensure that we can attract investment to this country by ensuring particularly smalland medium-sized businesses, in the short term but over the longer term, have a tax system which attracts investment into this country. What those opposite do not seem to understand is that what we need in this country is more investment, and we need businesses to be reinvesting in their business. WhatI cannot understand is why the member opposite, in all of his treatises, and all of his mentors have said that actually reducing company tax is good for investment, is good for growth and is good for jobs but, when it comes to actually voting for it in the parliament, he runs a million miles away. Perhaps that is why before last election, instead of actually taking to the election an economic plan, what he took to the election was a $16½ billion increase in the deficit. His plan at the last election was to increase the deficit, increase taxes, increase spending and increase debt. That is what the opposition put to the last election. Is it any wonder that the Australian people said, 'No. Won't have a bar of that.' We are not going to go back to the economic management of the Labor Party, which left our finances in such a disaster and which ensured that debt was rising at $3 billion a week when they left office-debt was rising $3 billion a week under those opposite when they sat on these benches. That has been cut by more than half by this government since we were first elected in 2013. So we have plan to arrest the debt. We have a plan to continue to reduce and get expenditure under control to bring the budget back to balance. We have a plan to grow investment, whether it is through our enterprise tax plan, which starts with businesses who those opposite think are multinationals but employ on average just 22 people. Those opposite think that these businesses are the Microsofts and Googles, but they are just smalland medium-sized businesses who want to reinvest into their businesses, create jobs and lift wages. And those opposite say 'no'.

Will the minister outline how the restoration of the rule of law to the construction industry will strengthen Australia's tourism industry? Griffith has already been ejected from the House today. thank the member for Fadden for his question. He, like I, together with the member for McPherson, have a deep passion about Australia's tourism industry. We are very much looking forward to the Commonwealth Games and what we will be able to showcase of the Gold Coast to the world. I also know that, as part of his interest in tourism, the 2016 Tourism Investment Monitor, which was released by Tourism Research Australia, shows that the total value of Australia's tourism investment pipeline is some $60 billion, or thereabouts. They also estimate that hotel transactions were about 4.2 billion last year, with more than half of those transactions on the Gold Coast. In 2018, as I mentioned, the Gold Coast will host the Commonwealth Games. The Games will put our great city on the world stage. It is going to boost tourism in a city that has about 30,000 people reliant on it. That is why the coalition government was pleased to put $156 million into the Commonwealth Games four years early, representing our commitment. But I note that the member for Fadden asks about the rule of law. Members in the chamber may have seen some footage that was recently released in relation to CFMEU officials. They were hurling abuse and intimidating safety officers on the Commonwealth Games site. So what was it that the CFMEU was saying? I have to say, Mr Speaker, I am mindful that often there are children in the gallery and children watching on TV. SoI will be considerate of that in terms of reading it out to the House. The CFMEU said: Beep-'you'-beep. 'I'll'-beep'drive you, eh? Drive you'-beep. 'You know what? You know what? I know your phone number. I know where you live'beep. 'I'm telling you now.

The poor old Leader of the Opposition, the hapless Leader of the Opposition, does not even know what 'representative democracy' is, because he thought the Navy decided whether they would sail their ships within 12 nautical miles of disputed territory, when obviously it is a civilian decision made by a democratically elected government as to whether we would change our policy on the South China Sea.

There are 2,240 small businesses in the construction industry in the member's electorate of Maranoa, making up 10 per cent of the number of small businesses in his seat. I know the member for Maranoa is passionate about jobs and investment in the local construction sector. The coalition government is absolutely committed to creating an environment for these construction small businesses to thrive, not one in which they are concerned for their livelihood. The most critical part of successfully creating this environment is bringing back the Australian Building and Construction Commission to tackle the bullying, the lost productivity and the threats from disgraced union members. The most critical part, absolutely, is doing this. The reinstatement of the ABCC will reward effort, while making the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union heavies accountable for their actions, whether in Millmerran or Maribyrnong. The reinstatement of the ABCC will allow successful people; decent people; good, hard working people running small businesses in the construction industry to employ and mentor good and decent staff, without the CFMEU threatening assault and bullying them off future contracts for not bowing to union demands. The reinstatement of the ABCC will ensure the long-term health of the construction industry, rewarding best practice and encouraging good operators to share their skill with new employees, particularly apprentices. This is the great contrast between the two sides of politics-the great contrast. We on this side of the House want small businesses to excel. We put policies in place to nurture success and drive contribution to GDP. Wilhelm Harnisch, CEO of Master Builders Australia, said recently: The return of the ABCC is fundamental in ridding the construction industry of the building unions ability ply their trade of fear, intimidation and bullying and to impose special deals on contractors and subcontractors where the community is punished by having to pay up to 30% more for schools and hospitals … That is what he said. The registered organisations bill will address this exploitation, ensuring union officials are subjected to the same high standards and laws as company directors-we could expect nothing else-and holding CFMEU officials accountable for their reckless and their lawless activity. Union thugs have no regard for the law. They are detrimental to the entire industry, to the union movement and indeed, I would say, to the entire nation. I speak for small businesses when I say that reinstating the ABCC to hold unions accountable for their actions will be one of the biggest small-business gains that the Malcolm Turnbull and Barnaby Joyce government could offer not only in Maranoa but right across Australia.

Ms LEY: TodayI announced that the government would reduce the cost of thousands of medical devices by $86 million a year to take the pressure off private health insurance premiums. What this indicates is that we are determined to support the 13 million Australians who have private health insurance and we on this side of politics understand that a strong private system matches a strong public system and you cannot have one without the other. The member for Sydney is getting up and she is running away because she knows what I am coming to. As one of my illustrious predecessors in the health portfolio, the member for Sydney was very notable for saying: 'How did I make every saving in health? I cut private health insurance. Every time. I wanted money for my health portfolio, I cut private health insurance.' The key thing is that if we make a strong private health insurance system we have a strong health insurance system in Australia. The announcement that I made today will have a direct result in reducing premiums that millions of Australians pay for private health insurance, and I expect the insurers to send this $86 million straight to the bottom line to relieve the premium pressure on their fund holders, who have the choice, if they want, to move funds and to shop around to get a better deal. It is well known that at the heart of the Leader of the Opposition's 'Mediscare' lie the ugly truth behind it is that there is no Labor health policy. There is no policy to make private health more affordable for Australians-unless perhaps you call ringing elderly Australians late at night and bullying them about 'Mediscare' a health policy.

Economy McMahon proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The collapse of the government's economic plan. I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their placesmembers to turn your minds back to just before the last budget, the 2016 budget. The then new Treasurer-never one to undersell his own abilities, in fairness-breathlessly told the Australian people that this was not just another budget. He said it was an economic plan, completely different to previous budgets, completely different to anything that, say, Paul Keating or Peter Costello might have brought down in their budgets. He was much better than them, he told the Australian people. He actually had an economic plan. It was an economic plan which the Prime Minister and Treasurer then took to the election. What was that plan? What was the innovative plan that they came up with? What was the big idea that they had to put to the Australian people? It was a $50 billion tax cut for big business in Australia. That was the best they could come up with. They defined small business as anything with a turnover of less than $1 billion-that was one part of their planand they told the Australian people: 'We need to return to budget surplus. We need to make tough decisions. We need to get the budget under control. And, by the way, let's give $50 billion away to business.' They told the Australian people that we needed to protect the AAA credit rating but 'let's give $50 billion away to business'. That was the biggest ram raid on the budget presented during the election and of course it was entirely unfunded. Talking of Peter Costello, I see that the former Treasurer has had something to say about that today. He said: I'm not really sure that the BCAthe Business Councilhad a good tax policy. Fair enough! The trouble is, the BCA's tax policy was the government's tax policy. He is a polite man, Peter Costello. He has decided not to directly poor scorn on the government but to do it indirectly. He went on to say: This has got to be funded. Of course, this Prime Minister and this Treasurer took a policy to the election which was not funded. But they said: 'That's okay. It's all about growth. It's going to promote growth,' they told us. There would be jobs and growth, they said, all because of their economic plan. The",110,Personal Explanations

186,Mr Bowen (Mcmahon) (15:15,"Mr Speaker, I would encourage you and all honourableTreasury released analysis which went to that claim and, yes, it is true. The Treasury said that the government's plan would boost the Australian economy. They said it would make the economy one per cent bigger. You might think, 'That is material; that is a reasonable amount, one per cent bigger.' But that was one per cent over a decade, and that decade would begin when the tax cuts were fully implemented-that is, in a decade's time. In 20 years they are going to increase the size of the economy by one per cent, or 0.05 per cent a year. Well done! That is the plan. That is the great dividend of the Liberal plan when it comes to the economy. The Grattan Institute said that that was very optimistic. They said it would not be one per cent; it would be 0.6 per cent. But let's give the government the benefit of the doubt. Let's accept their figures and say it is one per cent. That is the entire dividend from the TurnbullMorrison plan. That is not jobs and growth. That is not even a rounding error when it comes to economic growth over 20 years. You would need a microscope to see the dividend from the Morrison plan for the Australian economy. So the plan delivers nothing. But the plan that delivers nothing has come to nothing, because today we have seen the final confirmation that this plan will not pass the parliament. It is dead in the water. The Morrison agenda is in tatters. At best, the government will be able to pass a tax cut for businesses with a threshold of less than $10 million. Our position is $2 million, but at best-let's give them the benefit of the doubt-they will get through a tax cut for businesses with a turnover of less than $10 million. If the entire package delivered 0.05 per cent a year, I wonder what this tax cut of under $10 million delivers. You would have to get the super powerful microscope out now to see the dividend from the government's plan. If you imagine that the growth dividend is miniscule then all this begs the question: what is the point of the Turnbull government? Why are these people still here? Their agenda lies in tatters. They go to an election with a plan; the plan will not pass the parliament. We asked them in question time-and thankfully we got only three minutes of waffle, not 47 minutes of waffle, because of the time limits-but they do not have an economic agenda. You might remember that the Prime Minister was asked, 'What is the great achievement of the Turnbull government?' He had a cracker of an answer. He said, 'Well, of course you saw it in the budget reforms to superannuation and the reforms to business tax.' How is that working out? Both of them have had to be changed. Both of them are dead in the water. Both mean that the Turnbull government have at this point amounted to absolutely nothing, because at their heart they had a slogan, not a plan. They had a motto and not a program for Australia. They had an election slogan and not a plan for the nation. And they had a reckless, unfunded corporate tax cut, and even that they will fail to deliver. That was at the expense of a real plan to properly fund Australian schools and give young Australians the best possible start in life regardless of their background, their parents' wealth or where they live. That is a real plan for Australia's future. That is what this side of the House would deliver. All the other side of the House could deliver was a slogan which will come to nothing. All this happens at a time when the economy is going through a difficult period. It is 100 days since the election and we have heard nothing from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer about their plan for the Australian economy. What are the results of the Turnbull government so far? We see 50,000 fewer full-time jobs than there were at the end of last year under the Turnbull government. And we saw confirmation in Senate estimates today that underemployment, at 8.7 per cent, is the highest since the series began in 1978. Let's just consider that. We got through the 1981-1982 recession under Treasurer John Howard, we got through the 1990s and we got through the global financial crisis with underemployment below what it is today, and the great contribution of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is to deliver us the highest underemployment on record. That is their contribution to the Australian economy. That is not jobs and that is not growth. That is failure. That is a sign of failure and the sign of a lack of a plan. What we know is also that the participation rate has been falling. That means that people are leaving the labour force because they know that they can look for as many jobs as they like, they can go to as many interviews as they can, they can go up and down the nation looking for work, and they will not get it. We know that if it was not for that fall in participation the unemployment rate would be closer to 6.3 per cent. And what is the government's response to this? It is to say, 'Well, we've still got the plan.' It is the same old one. It is all they have got, despite the fact it would generate miniscule economic growth, despite the fact it would not generate jobs, despite the fact above all that they cannot deliver it. This is a Treasurer who could not deliver a pizza, let alone an economic plan. This is a Treasurer who is just not up to the job. This is a Treasurer who just is not capable of delivering on his commitments to the Australian people. And it is a Prime Minister who is too weak to deal with it. It is a Prime Minister who does not have the authority within his government to take charge of the economic agenda or to replace a Treasurer who is failing daily, to replace a Treasurer who does not have a plan for the Australian economy or for the Australian people. This is a government with no understanding of the challenges in the Australian economy. They have no understanding that, actually, if we are going to keep our quarter of a century of economic growth going-which came about because of difficult decisions and reforms by Labor governments in the 1980s and 90s, Labor governments delivering the sorts of decisions and sorts of plans that this government could only dream about-this government would not have the wit and imagination to come up with. This Treasurer would not have the ability to think about those things. That is what delivered a quarter of a century of economic growth for our country. This government is failing the Australian people, because this Treasurer and this Prime Minister do not understand what brings about economic growth, and what brings about economic growth in terms of productivity and investments in things like the NBN. This government does not understand what brings about economic growth through investment in our people, our most important resource-investment in young Australians so they get the best start in life. All they have got is a slogan, and an empty one at that and one that they cannot deliver. The task is urgent. Unemployment and underemployment are at high levels. We are doing worse than we did in the worse economic and financial crisis in 80 years, on this Prime Minister's watch, on this Treasurer's watch. At the end of the day, we have a Prime Minister and a Treasurer with no understanding, no ideas and, above all, no plan for Australia's future. part of the Turnbull-Joyce-Liberal-Nationals government-and I hear them applauding.

The shadow Treasurer quoted from a speech-a budget speech no less-of a Treasurer from this side of the House. I would like to quote from a Treasurer from the then government benches delivered on 8 May 2012, when the member for Lilley was Treasurer. He started his budget speech on that night, and this is what he said. The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the strength of our economy, resilience of our people, and success of our policies. How did that go? How did that work for the member for Lilley? We all know that Labor would not know a surplus if they fell over one. We all know they have not delivered a surplus for decades. We all know that; it is an absolute fact. The shadow Treasurer opposite knows that. Goodness, gracious-if ever he gets hold of the Treasury benches again, he will continue to produce deficit and debt further than the eye can see. I rise to speak on the member for McMahon's matter of public importance debate and to place on record the proper plan this Turnbull-Joyce government has for the future of Australia's economy, for the future of Australia's jobs, and to ensure that Australia's more than two million small businesses are central to our economic prosperity. There are many facets of Australia which make this country great, and I am sure those opposite would acknowledge that fact. Whether it is our entrepreneurial spirit, our sense of a fair go, our natural ability to produce some of the best and most in-demand agricultural and mining commodities, Australia's economy is one that has led the world for more than two decades. Mr Deputy Speaker, Member for Parkes, I know your patch of Australia, your large patch of New South Wales, has produced much of that agricultural and mining wealth. Well done to the people out in the electorate of Parkes. There are now people in Australian workforces and at university who have never known a period without growth in the Australian economy. Quarter after quarter, Australia's economy grew, and our gross domestic product increased. Quarter after quarter, small businesses took risks. Farmers took risks. Employers took risks. And the dividend we all reap today are benefits of our 25th year of uninterrupted economic growth. Today the Australian economy is the world's 12th-largest. It is versatile, it is highly productive, it is multifaceted and it has got relatively low unemployment and relatively high education compared with our trading partners. That is a good thing. That is why our trading partners in the rest of the world look to Australia. Dr Chalmers: It has the worse underemployment in history.

You might be an enterprising small business owner such as Cooma's Jane Cay or Wagga Wagga's Simone Eyles. They are in fashion and coffee respectively. They are great things. We all know that. I am sure the member for Griffith agrees. They use the internet to develop global businesses from regional towns and communities. You might be an employee enjoying the benefits of Australia's relatively low unemployment-lower under us than under those opposite-and easier movement of labour between industries. No matter your industry or your background, Australians can all take advantage of our economic resilience, our safe low-risk investment paradigm, and see a brighter future for us all. We all want that because, more than anything, enterprise, education and, indeed, enthusiasm are the keys to success in the modern, changing Australian economy. And, as our national economic landscape adapts to changes in the global market, it is clear that there are great opportunities for Australians, but we need a plan to take advantage of this. We need a plan. That is why the central tenet of the coalition's economic planMr Stephen Jones: Here it comes! year enterprise tax plan. It is so clear. It is all about jobs, growth, investment and lowering company tax rates, while those opposite continue to run scare campaigns. They chatter like parrots as I speak about these important things-I could say 'galahs', but I will be respectful! And, speaking of an Australia with a bright future, we know that Australians deserve a government which needs to do so much better. We want to continue our economic success. And that is why we are doing much better than those opposite did in the six sorry years that they were in power. Australians deserve a government which wants to create more jobs and ensure opportunities-something which anyone can take advantage of in the Australia of today. Our economic national plan understands the challenges and opportunities of a modern Australia. We are the nation's leaders. Those in this parliament are the nation's leaders, and that is why we should all get behind our 10-year tax plan, to take advantage of the globalised 21st century. That is why we have got a plan to cut the company tax rate to allow Australia's small and medium enterprises to employ more people and create better opportunities. That is why our 10-year tax plan is so important. It is a plan which will cut small businesses' taxes. It is a plan which will increase by 870,000 the number of small businesses to which that tax cut applies. And it will mean, more than anything, that Australians have a plan from this government which is about backing them-getting behind them; boosting their confidence; boosting their agility.

We want to back real people-real, decent, hard working, good people who want to get behind this nation and boost it. We want to back the farmer who wants to feed and clothe the world, besides our nation. We want to back the business with a turnover of between $2 million and $10 million to get the company tax rate that they need in order to grow. We on this side of the House understand small business. We know that a small business might turn over $2 million but that that does not mean that is their profit. That is what those on that side do not understand. They think that a business with a $5 million turnover is in clover! They think that they are rich. But it takes hard work to run a small business. It takes hard work-the sweat of your brow. You are up at sun-up and going home at sundown and then having to get on with the paperwork. I do not think they understand or quite appreciate just what that means. But I dare say that the shadow Treasurer understands, because in his Hearts& Minds-I borrowed it from the Parliamentary Library; I did not want to actually pay for the thing-he says: …it's a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth. Well, if he wrote that in his book, why does he not get behind our 10-year enterprise tax plan now? Why doesn't he do it? I just cannot understand it. There are 2.1 million small businesses in this country. Between them, they employ nearly five million Australians. And, through championing these small businesses, through being their advocate and making their job just a little bit easier, we will see small business grow. We will see more people employed and see more than two decades of uninterrupted economic growth continue. It is not just the coalition that understands that cuts to the company tax rate are important. Peter Strong, the chief executive of the Council of Small Business said recently: It gives the opportunity for the senators, and others who are opposed, to have a look at the impact of the tax cuts from the ground and make an assessment. Mr Strong knows this change to the company tax rate will open opportunities for small business. He gets it. And those on the other side should follow suit. He knows it will encourage growth and he knows it is something that small business owners themselves want. They need it. They demand it. Get on board! The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Kate Carnell, gets it. She said of our proposed tax cuts: I've spoken to countless small business owners about the tax cuts; they all plan to put the money they save back into their business, not into their back-pockets. She continued: So often, small businesses are described as the engine room of the economy; this is certainly true, and if our politicians are truly serious about getting the engine room firing on all cylinders, they'll unite on this important measure and pass the small business tax cuts into law as soon as possible. That is what Kate Carnell said. I could not agree more. So the leader of the opposition needs to get on board, absolutely. It is important. It is critical for small businesses, for farmers and, indeed, for our nation. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (15:35): There was a moment of hope in the speech of the Minister for Small Business; a moment of hopeAn opposition member: Yeah-when it finished! Ms OWENS: No, earlier than that. Something I have been waiting for, for the nearly 40 months of what is now the Abbott-Turnbull-Joyce government, is: any sense of what this plan is. They keep talking about the plan, and I keep looking for it! And actually, I really genuinely am looking for it. Over the first three years of this government, I would go out and talk to business, and what I heard back from them was this incredible disappointment that we had a government that, in a time of rapid change, when there was so much work for a government to do, really did nothing. It was as if they had pushed a pause button for three years. I have to say: when Tony Abbott was finally rolled as Prime Minister and Malcolm Turnbull became the Prime Minister, the better angels in me said, 'No matter what this means for a future Labor government, even if this means that the Liberals will actually win again, we cannot continue with our finger on pause. We actually need a plan for this nation. Maybe now we can have one. And that is more important than which of us wins.' A plan was desperately needed because we had gone 2½ years without one. SoI had been waiting for it. This is what I heard from the Minister for Small Business: I heard him bag Labor for three minutes-that is the first thing in the 'plan'. He talked about 25 years of growth-which of course is not this government; it is many governments. He talked about the trade agreements-true: there are three trade agreements; there will be winners from those; there will also be losers, which are never mentioned. Then we heard about businesses using the internet-this from a government that scrapped any opportunity to build a decent fibre network in this country by their stuffing of the NBN! Then we heard of a great university student-although a 20 per cent cut to universities is still in their budget. Then we heard the words 'jobs and growth' again. And then, for the last four minutes of the speech, we heard about the tax cut which is now not going to pass the Senate anyway in its full measure. So what did we hear from the person who said 'I'm now going to outline the plan. We have a plan. Here it is'? It was a rote plan on a piece of paper-and I thought: wow, I'm actually going to hear it! What did we hear? Nothing. NBN would be a plan. Funding universities would be a plan. That would matter-actually funding infrastructure. Rather than putting it in the budget and then removing it and then saying it is big again the next year and then removing it and then saying it is big again, an actual plan would help. Even if they have a plan, you would think that when key moments take place in the financial year-such as the release at the end of September of the final budget figures from the preceding financial year-this government, which has been spruiking how they have been reducing deficit and how they have such a great plan, would actually talk about. Instead what happened was really quite interesting. In the last few hours of 30 September, which is the deadline-under cover of the football grand finals, a long weekend and the start of the school holidays-the government released the financial statements for the previous financial year without a press conference and without even a detailed media release. Extraordinary! In all my experience in government, I have never seen a government actually try and hide the outcome of its previous financial year in that way, particularly when it comes into the parliament every day and talks about how well it is doing in reducing 'Labor's' debt and deficit. Let's look at the figures they tried so much to hide. The 2015-16 budget deficit was $39.6 billion, or 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product-up from $17.1 billion in the May 2014 budget, which was Hockey's budget. They tripled the deficit! And then, when the results come out, this government, which has claimed for the last three years to have had this plan, hides the results as much as it can. They are not out there spruiking their great achievement; they are doing everything they can to hide it. And it is not surprising. So when we talk today about the collapse of the Turnbull government's economic plan, the real tragedy is that they never had one in the first place. And we desperately need one. Every single peak body or business that comes into my office talks about the changes in the way the world is operating and the desperate need for a policy response that will stimulate them and allow them to take up the opportunities that exist in the world. We desperately need a plan; we really do. And we do need one that includes something more than a tax cut that you cannot deliver anyway. a gloomy affair. To use the word 'collapse', which the Oxford Dictionary defines as 'to fail suddenly and completely', you really are jumping at shadows in opposition. coalition at the helm. There is no such thing as collapse. Let me walk you through the facts. Fact No. 1: the Australian economy is expanding, not contracting; it is growing. Since Labor lost government in 2013, nearly 500,000 jobs have been grown-180,000 jobs in the last year alone. GDP growth in this country is at 3.3 per cent. As the minister said just a few minutes ago, Australia's economy is the 12th largest economy in the world. The June quarter national accounts confirm 2015-16 was Australia's 25th consecutive year of economic growth. We are growing the fastest we have been growing in the last four years. We are growing faster than every G7 economy-twice the rate of the US and Canada. If you call that a collapse, I do not know what words you would use to describe the experience in the US and Canada; you are breaking the English language with topic choices like this. Fact No. 2: government is investing in future growth. We are enabling economic growth with infrastructure investment. Our efficient delivery of the NBN is one such example. Over 3.2 million Australian premises can now be connected to NBN, with 1.3 million Australian homes or businesses currently connected. This opens up social, economic and educational opportunities for Australians. We are delivering critical telecommunications infrastructure in regional Australia. We are investing $220 million in the mobile black spot program delivering 499 new or improved mobile phone towers covering 3,000 black spots in regional communities. We are delivering a $50 billion land infrastructure package, with $4 billion to public transport alone and $500 million to make roads safer. All these things are very important. Public transport, roads and telecommunications bring our economy to life and continue to enable it to grow.",115,Matters Of Public Importance

This country is going quite well with theOur defence industry plan is growing the economy creating economic and national security into the future with $195 billion over the next 10 years. Fifty four vessels will be builtunlike the zero vessels built in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. Our enterprise tax plan and holiday makers reform package are both excellent tax packages. If you get on with the job of helping us govern and pass these things through both houses, the economy will continue to grow. But if you want to talk about collapse, let me quote a former leader of yours, Paul Keating: 'Modern Labor, like a souffle, has been collapsing over the last 25 years.' To finish his metaphor: a souffle cannot rise twice. That is not a partisan point. I acknowledge that, during the Hawke-Keating years, you reduced the top marginal tax rate, reformed the tariff system, reduced protectionism, floated the dollar and deregulated the financial system. Tough choices-and that was leadership. But since the Rudd-Gillard years, which were definitely years of collapse, you have shown no signs of changing your tune. In six budgets there was $191 billion in accumulated deficits. The carbon tax would have cost this country $1.3 trillion out to 2050 if we had not axed the tax. I am proud of that. That is a good thing we did. If you want to talk about rapid collapse, let's talk about the live cattle trade. You brought that down at rapid speed. You hurt small and large businesses, supply chains, regional communities, family farms. That is collapse. That is collapse, indeed. Now, at the last election you confirmed you would deliver higher debt, higher deficits and higher taxes. You confirmed you would increase our deficit by at least $16.5 billion. According to Saul Eslake, a leading economist, there is a greater risk to our triple-A rating under Labor. If you want collapse, let's hand the reins over to you. Mr Conroy interjectingquiet. I give the call to the member for Cunningham. Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (15:45): Thank you, Deputy Speaker-and can I just say, on your behalf: that was an outrageous list of accusations that the member just made against you, Deputy Speaker. I am sure you did not do any of those things whatsoever, so I am very happy to defend your reputation in this place from those accusations. It is just over a year since that momentous moment when the current Prime Minister marched into a courtyard not far from here and announced that he was calling on the then Prime Minister-who has continued to be nothing but helpful since!-to call a spill in the party room. There were some pretty significant things said by the current Prime Minister on that occasion. In particular, he said: It is clear enough that the government is not successful in providing the economic leadership we need. The Prime Minister set the bar for his leadership and his government. So what has happened in the 12 months since then? I have to say that it reminds me, particularly, of an episode of the Get Smart TV show-I do not know if all members in the House remember it. But you might remember those particular sessions where Smart would be up against the wall, and he would say to the baddies, 'I have got this building surrounded by 100 heavily armed federal police officers', and they would look at him in great disbelief, and he would say, 'Would you believe 50 police officers with a couple of dogs and slingshots?' and they would look at him in disbelief, and he",118,Matters Of Public Importance
194,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Coulton,"Order! The member for Shortland will bewould say, 'Well, what about a couple of dogs who look pretty cranky outside the building?' That is what we have seen over the last 12 months from this Prime Minister. Mr Stephen Jones: Pity they don't have a code of silence! Ms BIRD: They could, indeed, well do with a code of silence-and I have a good suspicion of who the Prime Minister would be putting under the code of silence, given the 7.30 report tonight. I am sure we will be watching that with great interest. What we have seen is exactly that scenario rolled out time and time again by this Prime Minister in the last 12 months: 'We are going to massively restructure the GST. This will be a great answer to resolving the economic challenges of the country.' A few-and I would have to say they were not really on the other side; they were mostly on his side-just looked at him and went, 'Nah, I do not think so.' It did not take long. 'Well, instead of that, we will have a proposal for the states and territories to raise their own income levy; would you believe that?' and along with most of the country they sort of looked at him and went, 'Nah, not so much'-and that disappeared. We ended up with a fairly pathetic claim that the budget itself was going to be an economic strategy, and it would be so exciting and innovative that they would take it to the election. One could forgive us, then, for having reasonably high expectations of the budget-that there was actually going to be a detailed plan for investing in the infrastructure and people of this nation to create new job opportunities, boost existing industries, lay the foundation for new industries that would be competitive into the future in areas, for example, like renewable energy, where we could be a world leader and, in fact, once were. But, no; the keystone, single, only way that they were going to deliver an economic plan for this nation was a massive tax cut for the big end of town. What a disappointment! I have to be honest: I do not even think Maxwell Smart would have tried to run that one by anybody! An opposition member: Missed it by that much! Ms BIRD: As the member quite rightly says: missed it by that much-another of the great statements of the show. So we now see a situation where even that is falling apart. Even those on the crossbenches in this place are looking at that, saying, 'Yeah, nah-I do not think so.' So we do not even have a plan from this government to do what it needs to be doinginvesting in this nation, creating real opportunities and laying out an economic plan that is much more than a failed trickle-down economic theory that, to be honest, has been discredited probably for much longer than most of them have been walking this earth. coming out, that we are having a debate about whether there is a plan or not. I think that most small businesses out there would be horrified at the nature of a Labor government coming up with a plan. What small businesses out there want is government out of their lives, not another plan. They want government out of their lives so that they can employ. They want government out of their lives so that they can get on with business. What they want is a solid and consistent approach to business and not to watch the surpluses accrued by responsible coalition governments frittered away like we saw over the last six years-and that is the great fear. We are not talking about plans; we are talking about a genuine fear of a return of a rat with a gold",119,Matters Of Public Importance
195,Mr Laming (Bowman) (15:50,"It seems a little ironic, when solid economic news istooth saying he has a plan. That is not what they want. They do not want plans. What they want is confidence to employ. Let's accept it: every developed economy has an issue with underemployment and underutilisation-which is unemployment and underemployment added together. But we continue to defy market expectations. That is the big point. When you compare us to the US or to Canada, we are doing exceptionally well. In fact, reported growth rates are double those of the northern American economies. Now, that is not by accident. America and Canada are resource-based economies facing exactly the same challenges that we are, transitioning to a broader-based approach. When you do that you have frictional challenges, with people moving out of where we had high terms of trade and looking for new work. It, by definition, creates high levels of underemployment as people find first small levels and then, later, greater levels of employment. That is a transition. It is precisely what we are doing, but we are doing it better than every other OECD nation. It is a gold star for Australia. Let's not get that wrong. WhatI love about the opposition is when they are in a tight corner. They know that when they go home from Canberra and back to their electorate office there will be one big burly dude sitting in their waiting room, with a CFMEU hi-vis vest on and 'WTF' on their forehead, saying: 'Explain what happened in Canberra. What went wrong? What went so terribly wrong?' They will be able to say: 'Oh no, we threw a really big smelly cat on the table.

You can no longer wreak your havoc on the building site, but we did debate the economy for an hour. Did you hear my speech?' I mean, seriously! We have had unemployment at record lows for the last three years. We have had growth in full-time employment for 11 of the last 18 months-and then we have the leader of this debate from the other side come in here and report a 40,000 drop in full-time employment. He took the July figure and ignored the September figure, when it went up. That is right: just wherever it is convenient. You see this opposition conveniently redefining the debate wherever it can. It was like that with Medicare yesterday. I think the member for Oxley was there for that debate. It is so inconvenient that Medicare bulk-billing rates keep going up in these Labor electorates-so let's redefine bulk-billing rates and not ask how many services are being delivered. Let's ask how many people are getting the services-a figure that has never been calculated in the history of humanity. But they are going to change the figures to suit their own convenience, because bulk-billing rates have gone up. There has never been a better friend of bulk-billing than the coalition government. There has never been a better friend of full-time employment than the coalition government. Ask anyone out there! Don't believe me. Don't believe that mob over there.

What they know over there is that, ultimately, the only people who pay off Labor debt are Liberal voters. So it never really matters, does it?

Can you name a single issue that this Prime Minister has been able to change public opinion on? Certainly not his plans for a $50 billion tax cut to the biggest companies in Australia-a policy that was unpopular on announcement and became even more unpopular with every subsequent cut to Medicare, schools and hospitals. Of course, I am not sure even Tim Shaw could have sold a totally unfunded structural hit on the budget that would cost over $13 billion a year while also talking about 'fiscal repair' and protecting our AAA credit rating. It is like trying to sell a summer holiday to Antarctica-certainly beyond this Prime Minister's pedestrian political abilities. Yet this ruin is the PM's self-proclaimed 'greatest achievement' since becoming PM! It is as good as it gets. That is supposedly the plan for the 'growth' bit of the three-word slogan from the man who promised us no slogans. The other third of the slogan-jobs-is just as dire. While the Prime Minister talks of jobs, there are now 50,000 less full-time jobs than there were at the end of last year. We have record under-employment. The participation rate is plummeting. The proportion of Australians either underemployed or unemployed is now higher than it was during the depths of the global financial crisis. And that is 30 per cent of the government's three-word economic policy slogan. He has nothing to say about wages growth in Australia being the lowest on record. He has nothing to say about rewarding the hard work of workingand middle-class Australian families. The Prime Minister's inability to lead, either in the electorate or in the Parliament, has left him hostage to the lowest common denominator of existing opinion. As a result, he has been forced into regularly drinking the bathwater of his own backbench-the tepid, scungy policy run-off that lingers in the corners of the coalition party room. He has had to take dictation on superannuation policy from the Monkey Pod Generals and then suffer the indignity of having the member for Dawson come out and publicly mark his homework in a live, nationally broadcast press conference. I am not sure that is how the member for Wentworth imagined being Prime Minister in all those decades of coveting the job. He was also given his marching orders by the party room on changes to negative gearing. While the Prime Minister talks about growth, he has nothing to say about the distortionary loopholes in our tax system that are channelling torrents of Australian capital into relatively unproductive property speculation and away from Australian businesses-the generators of growth-while also costing the budget more than $10 billion a year. The Murray inquiry in financial systems expressed high levels of concern that negative gearing and capital gains concessions are 'major tax distortions' that 'encourage leveraged and speculative investment'. The Grattan Institute have pointed out: ... the greater leverage encouraged by negative gearing arrangements also reduces the stability of the Australian financial system. Labor believes in real economic growth that benefits all Australians, not just the lucky few at the top. We believe in budget repair that is fair. That means a tax policy that does not give a tax incentive to people buying their second, third, fourth or fifth investment property but gives a leg-up to Australians trying to buy their first home. Inclusive economic growth requires investment in infrastructure and investment in education and training-investments that allow everyone to participate in the Australian economy and thrive in the new economy that Australia moves into. We are up for the challenge of providing this economic leadership, even if the Prime Minister is not. economic growth and improve Australia's competitiveness on the world stage. Why? Because only through ensuring our nation has a stable and well-regulated business environment can we provide jobs and career opportunities for Australians. It is for these reasons that the government remains committed to pursuing policies and reforms that improve productivity and grow our national economy. Two of those reforms include issues that are near and dear to my heart: changes to the way registered organisations operate and the reinstatement of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. There are currently 110 registered organisations that represent more than two million members. Between them they have annual revenue of $1.3 billion and they own or control $2.2 billion in assets. The majority of these registered organisations are not-for-profit and operate to supposedly serve the interests of their members. In many cases, registered organisations and their branches command significant financial resources. As is the case with any corporation in Australia, it makes sense that the registered organisations act requires a high level of financial oversight by officers to ensure that funds are used legally, responsibly and to benefit their members. It is also reasonable to accept that members and the broader community have high expectations regarding conduct of officers in charge of financial matters. In other words, it is expected that they act in the best interests of their membership at all times and conduct their business in an open and transparent manner. Let's not forget that registered organisations in Australia are given special privileges, like being income tax exempt. So it is reasonable that they should be accountable. Unfortunately, there is evidence that some registered organisations do not meet their financial disclosure obligations. The recent royal commission into trade union governance and corruption uncovered numerous cases of misuse of member funds-for example, the National Union of Workers official who spent more than $100,000 of members' money on holidays, toys, dating service subscriptions and even a tattoo. It is clear that existing laws have done nothing to prevent thousands of Australia's lowest paid workers from being ripped off. The only way to ensure this does not continue to happen is to apply proper standards of governance to registered organisations-the same rules that apply to Australian corporations. As part of the coalition's commitment to improving productivity and strengthening Australia's economy, reform must also come to the building and construction industry because it is one of the largest industries and employers in our nation. It employs one in 10 Australians and represents eight per cent of our GDP. The ABCC will return the rule of law to the industry and that will be music to the ears of the many thousands of workers who have been forced to submit to the will of those in the union movement who believe that they are above the law. There are in excess of 100 CFMEU officials before the courts. So far, the courts have imposed more than $8 million in fines for those in the CFMEU who are breaking the law. Large building contractors are currently free to lock out smaller contractors in the industry by discriminating against those who do not have a particular type of EBA favoured by them and/or the unions. Since the ABCC was abolished by the Leader of the Opposition in 2012, the rate of disputes in the construction sector has increased by 40 per cent. It is clear that reform is",122,Matters Of Public Importance

He was committed to giving that ABCC and registered organisations speech and he gave it, even though the Leader of the House gagged him.

However, he is a new member of parliament who came in on the double dissolution trigger, which was the registered organisations bill and the ABCC legislationsomething not mentioned in any of the campaign material in the lead-up to the election. I saw around my electorate's booths on polling day that those opposite had the big sign saying: 'Plan. That's what we have. We've got a plan. We're going to give $50 billion, unfunded, to big business.' That was the pivotal point of the LNP plan in Queensland and rolled outunfunded. Even though we know that about $9 billion of those tax concessions would go overseas to foreign shareholders, they were still committed to it. Obviously the Labor Party understands that small business plays a pivotal role, and we are happy to concede that businesses with a turnover of $2 million-that is what we call a small business; we do not call Coles a small business and we do not call Westpac a small business-do need a fair break. We were prepared to do that. As I said, congratulations to the member for Fisher for delivering his speech. He would not be gagged by the Leader of the House. I remember the election campaign. I heard it over and over again: 'jobs and growth'. Remember that? And what was the platform for jobs and growth? This plan, based on fiscal recklessness. It was based on the idea of giving $50 billion to big business and that would somehow stimulate the economy. Well, we heard today from the Nick Xenophon team that they are going to reject this. Labor will reject it in the Senate and the Greens will reject it in the Senate, so we will not have their centrepiece plan coming to fruition. This glorious plan is dead in the water. Their plan is up the creek without the proverbial paddle-I will not name the creek. All that we have left is this slogan 'jobs and growth'. I remember what the Labor Party was about in the election. We were prepared to invest in children's education. That is where we were prepared to put taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.

Instead, we have this hillbilly-harbourside alliance over there that is producing nothing but no direction for the government and no direction for the nation. We see an unemployment rate of 6.1 per cent, even higher than the 5.1 per cent under the Labor government.

The fact that you have even raised false advertising is an absolute and utter joke. Frankly, the member for Moreton should hang his head in shame at the way Labor scared our older Australians. I know that so many people on election day and leading up to election day just shook their heads in horror. Today we have had some wonderful incitement from the members opposite. We have parallels with one of my favourite programs, Get Smart. In relation to Get Smart, I think I can say that Kevin Rudd was no Maxwell Smart.

The member for Lilley's former chief of staff, who is now sitting on the other side of this chamber, should hang his head in shame at the appalling way in which Australians were misled.

Ms HENDERSON: We are very proud of our strong economic plan, which is laid out in this particular document in the 2016-17 budget papers.

They are all in this document. Clearly those opposite have not quite managed to get their hands on it. We are very proud of the many ways in which we are working to grow the economy with our strong economic plan, which is delivering record economic growth and low unemployment. One of the very important platforms of our plan is lower taxes for middleincome earners and also incredibly important tax cuts for small and medium businesses. These were tax cuts that were previously supported by the Leader of the Opposition, and in another unprincipled backflip the Leader of the Opposition is now fighting against those small business tax cuts, which is very disappointing. We have delivered a fairer and more sustainable superannuation system. we are investing record dollars in health and education and we are investing in regional communications infrastructure-an issue that has been blatantly ignored by members opposite. We are doing wonderful work under our mobile communications-fixing blackspots right across Australia. We know how important that is for rural and regional's families, for students and for businesses.

209,The Deputy Speaker,"The discussion is concluded.Ms LAMB (Longman) (16:16): Without doubt, reform of the sector is essential. Labor understands this and this is why the government has essentially copied Labor's policies. If only it had acted so much sooner, billions could have been invested in apprenticeships and TAFEs, instead of being wasted on dodgy private providers. If this government had acted sooner, thousands of students would not have paid tens of thousands of dollars for a meaningless qualification. Many private providers have acted unconscionably in pursuing greater profits without regard to the massive debts incurred by each student. Evocca College is just one example of a private institution that has demonstrated appalling behaviour and a complete lack of responsibility towards its students. Figures obtained in 2015 through an ABC report showed the college had a graduation rate of just 10 per cent despite claiming more than $290 million in government funding via the VET FEE-HELP student loan scheme. Even more concerning are the allegations that came to light after the report was aired. More than 20 former employees reported that the college enrolled students ill-equipped for diploma level courses without enough support, that it enrolled students who did not pass the required literacy test and that it backdated tutor qualification forms to pass federal government audits. Former staff claimed the college actively sought to hamper students who wanted to leave the college and cease adding to their government training debt. Now while I do not seek to traverse the appalling behaviour of many providers, the behaviour of Evocca College is symptomatic of the government's inaction and cuts to funding. In essence, they sat on their hands while dodgy private providers ran rampant and students were ripped off, and left them saddled with massive debts. The fact remains that, just like the rest of this government's policies, its response to problems in the VET sector has been shambolic and lacking leadership. In fact, it has had five ministers covering this portfolio in three years. There is nothing in this bill to restore the $2.75 billion the Liberals have ripped out TAFE, skills and apprenticeships. There is nothing to protect TAFE, nothing to boost apprenticeships. The government has failed to consult properly on these changes. Labor supports them in-principle but looks forward to the Senate inquiry into the bills and will work with stakeholders to identify any issues through that process. As I mentioned previously, Labor proposed a comprehensive suite of VET reforms at the last election. Labor did this because we know there are issues and we had a plan to address these problems. They say imitation is the strongest form of flattery so, on face value, Labor might be a little flattered that the Turnbull government has copied our package. I will not go through every amendment but particular important features of our response to problems in the VET sector include: the capping student loans to stop rip-offs-copied; cracking down on brokerscopied; linking publically funded courses to industry need and skills shortages-copied; requiring providers to re-apply under new standards so only high quality providers could access the loan system-tick, copied; linking funding to student progress and completioncopied; and of course, a VET loans ombudsman-guess what, copied. Yet again, this is another case of Labor leading the debate while the minister sat on his hands for two years with rorts going on under his nose. I find this lack of imagination and indeed, leadership, extremely disturbing because it was the Liberals who were falling over themselves to criticise Labor's policy proposals and today they are trying to take credit for them. When Labor announced a policy of capping student loans, Scott Morrison said it would 'pull the rug out from under the private education industry'. Then Minister Scott Ryan called it a 'classist policy' and a 'thought bubble' that 'will lead to up-front fees for VET students'. Scott Ryan also called it 'impulsive, ill thought through, ill-considered' and a 'sound bite'. Simon Birmingham said it was an 'ill-considered flat pack'. Before the election, Simon Birmingham said a price cap 'would simply, in effect, establish a government sanctioned price'. He said: 'When you set a price cap, everybody simply shifts to the price cap.' Guess what? He is now proposing three different price caps-$5,000, $10,000 and $15,000-and this is deeply concerning. The current national partnership, put in by Labor, expires in the middle of next year. Over $500 million a year in Commonwealth support for TAFE and skills is on the line. And the minister does not even seem to know whether a new agreement is needed to keep supporting TAFE. Labor has been absolutely clear-we back public TAFE. That is why we took a TAFE funding agreement to the last election. TAFE is where people like my constituents in Longman get the technical and semi-professional skills they need for growing industries, the skills that are being demanded by industry and the skills Australia needs to be competitive with other countries. TAFE is the backbone of our apprenticeship system. Generations of Australians know just how important TAFE is for our economy. They know the first-class skills and opportunities that going to TAFE can provide. But the Liberals just don't get it. At a state and federal level, the Liberals have an ideological problem with TAFE. Apprentice numbers are in freefall under the Liberals. They are down 30 per cent since they came to government-that is 130,000 fewer under the Liberals. They have copied Labor's VET FEE-HELP reforms, and if they would join us in backing TAFE they would copy our TAFE policies too. We welcome the government's commitment, made in the second reading speech on this bill, that they will establish a VET loans ombudsman. Labor moved in the Senate almost a year ago to establish such an ombudsman. We look forward to seeing how the government plans to make good on their commitment, because it is not yet in the bills before the House. It is absolutely crucial that the ombudsman has the resources and the powers it needs to seek redress for students and to protect their interests. Labor has concerns also about the implementation of these changes. These are concerns that are shared by the sector. We will be keeping up the pressure on the government to make sure students are treated fairly in the transition process; hold dodgy providers to account where they have ripped off students, and get loans refunded; make sure the government gets right the assessment of providers and the approved courses list; and improve governance, accountability and transparency in the sector. We understand the urgency of these bills; it is an urgency the government has brought on itself. We hope the Senate inquiry into the bill will give stakeholders a chance to examine these issues properly, because the government did not consult properly with students or the sector on the details of these changes. It should not have come to this, of course, but now, after a billion-dollar blow-out, the government seems to have woken up to itself. VET, TAFE and apprenticeships are crucial to jobs and our economy. We genuinely hope that the government has turned a corner and that from here on it will do what is best for students and for employers. We on this side of the House genuinely hope it works to get right the implementation of these changes. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (16:25): Last year Michael Douglas, the esteemed actor, 70 years old, made a comment about the fact that there were too many Australian actors taking key roles in American movies. The comment was made in response to an article that appeared in The Atlantic entitled 'The decline of the American actor'. The article asked why so many good roles have been going to actors from Australia, England and Canada. The Daily Telegraph said: Of the top five TV series set to air on NBC this yearthat is last yearthree are headlined by Aussie actors, while no fewer than 15 different series across both commercial and cable networks also star actors from Down Under. They talked about Melissa George, Damon Herriman, Matt Passmore, Clare Bowen, Luke Mitchell, Dichen Lachman, Caitlin Stasey and Adelaide Kane. They talked about a whole range of others, in addition to the ones we already know such as Cate Blanchett, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Geoffrey Rush, Chris Hemsworth, Mel Gibson and Anthony LaPaglia. So many Australian actors are making their name overseas and taking roles from American actors, as lamented by Michael Douglas. These actors have been dubbed the Gumleaf Mafia, because they are taking all of these key roles that have traditionally gone to American actors. Why is that happening? Why are these plumb roles going to Australian actors rather than to American actors? A number of reasons have been cited, particularly about the men, but one of the key reasons cited by both Michael Douglas and the Daily Telegraph article is that most of the Australian actors are trained. They have honed their art. Although in Los Angeles there are lots of models who think that they can jump into acting roles just because they are good looking, Australian actors get roles because they have been trained. They have been trained through NIDA, the National Institute of Dramatic Art; through WAAPA, the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts; and through the performing arts school in Victoria. They have also been trained through a number of vocational education institutions right throughout this country. One of those institutions is the Canberra Academy of Dramatic Art, with whom I met this morning. It was a very interesting meeting, hearing about the impact that the government's views on VET are having on this fantastic institution that has been going for years and years and about the impact that the government's changes, including the delisting of the performing arts courses, could have on the future careers of a number of Canberrans. Before going into the discussion I had today with the CADA people and some of its students, I will mention the impact that the creative industries have not just on the Australian economy but also on the Canberra economy. The figures I have for the Canberra economy are quite outdated-they are from 2012-13-and have been boosted by a number of events that have taken place as a result of the significant investment and effort by ScreenACT in recent years. I will quote from a document that was sent to me by CADA. It mentions the fact that creative industries contribute $90 billion per year to the Australian economy and that 5.3 per cent of Australia's workforce work in the creative industries. It is one of the fastest growing sectors in the Australian economy. Here in Canberra, for 2012-13: … the direct output of the arts and the cultural sector in the ACT was estimated to be $974 million, of which arts was responsible for $361 million. As I said, these figures are really outdated, because there has been so much activity here in the ACT in recent years. We have had The Code. There have now been two series of The Code that have been filmed here in the ACT. Another miniseries-and one of my colleagues is now smiling at me!-that has been filmed here in CanberraDr Chalmers: A very good one. Ms BRODTMANN: Yes, it is a very good miniseries that has been filmed here in Canberra. I have quite intimate knowledge of the provenance of this miniseries. This other miniseries that hopefully will see a second series created is Secret City, which showcased our beautiful national capital and also created a degree of intrigue and excitement around the ACT and Canberra. Those two miniseries are in addition to the fact that there are countless documentaries that have been filmed here. There have been countless short films filmed here, a number of them award-winning. It is a growth industry for the ACT. I understand from conversations with the ACT government and also CADA today that there are many more documentaries and short films booked for the near future-for the next 12 months to two years. So our nation's capital is becoming a bit of a film hub. It has fantastic scenery, of course, and it has some really interesting buildings. There is a lot of local homegrown talent here that can take part in those films, documentaries and short films. Canberra is reaching a critical mass of creativity and innovation and we now have this homegrown talent being produced, and I am concerned that as a result of the government not including a number of the creative industries in the VET list it could potentially spike the careers of these young people, and it could potentially spike our creative industries here in the ACT. People tend to think that vocational education is just purely about addressing the skills shortage in trades. Yes, we need more electricians. Yes, we need more carpenters. Yes, we need more plumbers. Yes, we need more motor mechanics. We need more skills in this country, particularly in the trades. If you try to find a plumber here in the ACT on the weekend it can be a very difficult exercise. I speak from experience here. When my dear husband put a hole in one of the pipes in our front yard when he was doing a bit of gardening, we had to get a plumber on a Sunday and it cost quite a sum of money. That is because we have a significant skills shortage here in the ACT. It also exists nationally. I have both praised my husband and also shared his ability with a pick. We are keeping him away from that as well as gardening generally because it always ends up in 'armagarden'! We have a significant skills shortage here in the ACT, which is why we need to be investing in skills in the trades, particularly for electricians, plumbers, mechanics and others. That said, we should not ignore the need to develop skills in the creative industries. As I said when I mentioned those figures before, creative industries contribute $90 billion per year to the Australian economy and make up 5.3 per cent of Australia's workforce. We are looking at about $1 billion here in the ACT, and that is an old figure. That is from two or three years ago. So this is a significant growth industry and we need to develop our creative skills as well as those trade skills. It is vitally important for us as a nation. It is vitally important to our economy. It is not just important to the economy. It is also important because of the fact that these vocational education creative industry courses create a pathway for many young Canberrans. I have a friend whose daughter has been having some mental health issues. She was in and out of year 12. She has had some real challenges. She decided to enrol in CIT to do a pathway course. She finished that pathway course and is now studying law at ANU. So vocational education provides a pathway-an opportunity for people to work out what they want to do with their lives and the direction they want to pursue and then possibly go into higher education. Vocational education provides skills in trades so that people can get employed, but it also develops their self-esteem. Again, I know from the conversations I had with these young people today-and I will explore those in more detail shortly-who have had these challenges and have used CIT or vocational education as a pathway that vocational education has boosted their self-esteem. It has boosted their confidence. It has boosted their sense of self and their ability to go on and pursue new directions in higher education or go off and get a job. It provides a range of skills, and they are not just all about trade skills or job related skills. It also provides a great deal of interpersonal development. That is why it is so important. As I said, this morning I met with Elizabeth Scott from CADA, as well as two young Canberrans-Becky and Rod. It was fascinating talking to them and listening to them about the changes that have taken place as a result of their CADA courses. They are planning to do the Advanced Diploma of Performance out at CADA. Becky is 18 years of age and she comes from a family with a single mum. Her mum works full time and will do any overtime she can to help Becky get through. Becky works 38 hours to 48 hours a week in her job to put herself through, and she is also studying full time. She said that she gets a great deal of support not just from her mother but also from CADA. She said of CADA and the experience of getting involved in the cert IV in performing arts-and her intention is to do the advanced diplomathat, 'It makes me want to get somewhere in my life.' That is what this course has done for her. She said, 'It gives me the skills so I don't feel bad about myself. It gives me more confidence.' I also met Rod, who is 20 years of age. He has done a Diploma of Musical Theatre and he is planning to do an Advanced Diploma of Performance. He is an exceptional young man. Again, he has three jobs to work his way through this degree. He does parties and events for kids and teaches kids at CADA. He said that he is not involved in the performing arts to get famous. He does it because it is what he loves. He does not see it as a lifestyle choice, which is what those opposite have said so often about these creative industry courses that are being deregistered or taken off the list. He does not see it as a lifestyle choice; it is what he loves to do. It is like Becky said: 'It gives me a sense of purpose. It makes me want to get somewhere in my life. It gives me the skills so I don't feel bad about myself.' These courses are vital, as vital for self-esteem and job opportunities as the courses taken by those who are studying a trade, studying to be a plumber, an electrician or a carpenter. They are as vital for these young individuals like Becky and Rod as they are for those studying other courses down at Fyshwick here, doing trades. I am looking at the list of courses that have been deemed ineligible for funding. It includes the Diploma of Musical Theatre which is taught at CADA, as well as the Advanced Diploma of Performance. I am very concerned about the fact that these courses will not be deemed eligible for funding. I am concerned about the impact it is going to have on those students who are already going through the system. I understand, from the conversations with Elizabeth today, that students who are in the system now can go right through to the end of 2017, but her view is that, if they are just at the early stage of their course, they should be given the opportunity to be taught out for their degree or their diploma, that we should not just leave these young people hanging there with half a diploma or half an advanced diploma finished. SoI am calling on the minister to review the list of creative industries that are deemed ineligible. I am calling on the minister to consider their value not just to the economy-as I mentioned before, they are worth $90 billion to the Australian economy and employ 5.3 per cent of the workforce. I am calling on the minister not just to look at the economic benefit of the creative industries but also to look at the personal benefit that they deliver for the young Australians who are studying these courses, in terms of boosting their self-esteem, boosting their ability to feel confident in speaking, boosting their love and understanding of literature and the arts, boosting their confidence. I am calling on the minister to revisit the list of ineligible courses and to consider the important contribution that the creative industries make to our economy and to Australia's future. confirms once again the financial and administrative mismanagement and incompetence of the Turnbull government. This legislation seeks to rectify widespread rorting and unethical practices within the vocational education and training sector and the VET student loans program. Responsibility for the mess rests fairly and squarely with the government. This government has been in office for three years. Claims by members opposite that they are simply fixing up Labor's mess do not stand up to scrutiny. This government has been in office for over three years now, and it is because of this government's mismanagement that we are dealing with this legislation. The VET framework was poorly administered, poorly audited and left unregulated by this government. The government had the ability to deal with it properly. It had the tools to do so but it was asleep at the wheel. The alarm bells should have sounded much, much earlier. They should have sounded when enrolment numbers in certain courses skyrocketed, when hundreds of VET providers appeared out of nowhere, when payments to private registered training organisations, particularly new registered training organisations, also reached ridiculous levels. It is beyond comprehension that the system failed so badly. Australian Careers Network is one particular case. Its 30 June financial report boasted that its student numbers had increased by 417 per cent, from 4,990 students in 2014 to 25,784 students in 2015. In just one year they went up fivefold. The organisation also boasted about having an average revenue yield per student of $3,303. Careers Australia had payments increase from $3.5 million in 2011 to $108 million in 2014. Evocca College, trading as ACTE Pty Ltd, grew from $24.9 million in 2012 to $131 million in 2014. The number of students accessing VET FEE-HELP loans was projected to increase from 100,000 in 2013 to 225,000 students in 2014-15 by the Department of Education and Training. Those figures alone should have set the alarm bells ringing, and yet they did not. It took a Senate inquiry to expose the rorting and for the government to in turn act. Indeed, one has only to ask: given the multitude of shonky practices since exposed, just what advice did the",127,Bills
210,Mr Zappia (Makin) (16:40,"This legislation, the VET Student Loans Bill 2016,government receive about the rorting from its own departments or any other sources? When did it receive such information, if any, and what was the government's response to those warnings? Indeed, why did it take the government so long to act? Nobody will believe that the warning signs and the incidents of rorting were not being reported to the government or to government members, as they were to so many members on this side of the House. I have listened to government members who have spoken in this debate, and they are clearly in denial about their government's incompetence. Perhaps members opposite were also in denial about the failure of their free market ideology-an ideology that not only failed this government but also failed the students and failed the community. Members opposite are also in denial that the state-run TAFEs and the long standing industry training organisations are the most trusted and most reliable to deliver vocational education and training. Perhaps members opposite were hoping to see the demise of the TAFE sector. Unlike the Turnbull government, Labor will always back TAFE. Regrettably, ethical registered training organisations have had to suffer the upheavals caused. Thousands of VET students have been left with VET FEE-HELP debts of thousands of dollars that they were, in many cases, totally unaware of and that they are unlikely to ever repay. I understand that it is estimated that some 40 per cent of the VET debts will never be repaid. The country has been left with billions of dollars of lost revenue that could have gone to much, much more needy causes. This money could have been used to support our health and education services in this country. We have also seen money wasted on courses and degrees that were not fit for purpose, leaving graduates underqualified and with absolutely no job prospects. And, of course, the costs of many of these course were, in many cases, well over market rates. Worst of all, thousands and thousands of students have been left in limbo. The government is in denial about all of this and is also in denial about the fact that it took a Senate inquiry to publicly expose the rorts. The government's dissenting Senate report-a dissenting report; not the majority report-attempted to lay the blame on the previous Labor government, again trying to point the finger at the Labor government that set up the process many years ago. It was not that the process was at fault; it was the oversight of it. This legislation is now attempting to ensure that there will be proper oversight in the future. Labor put forward an election policy-a policy which underpins this whole legislationarticulating the way forward by capping student loans; cracking down on brokers; linking publicly funded courses to industry need and skills shortages; linking funding to student progress and completion; and requiring VET providers to re-apply under new standards, so that only high-quality providers could access the loan systems. Government ministers and government MPs ridiculed Labor's proposals and now they find themselves adopting the Labor way forward. Again, it is Labor leading the policy in this area and the government is following-again, another backflip by a government that, if nothing else, has excelled at backflips. Given that this legislation is largely based on Labor proposals, Labor has indicated some support for it-albeit that we have also moved an amendment, which I will be supporting, for a change to some of the wording. Whilst we support the legislation in principle, we are also very critical of the government's management of this whole process to date. I also understand that there may be another Senate inquiry into the legislation, and it will be interesting to see what comes out of that. Vocational education and training is essential to Australia's economic future. We need skills and trades; nor does every person want a university degree. Indeed, in today's labour market, it is often easier to get employment with a trade or a skill than with a university degree. But the skills training paid for must be affordable and must properly qualify the person for the work they are employed to do. Over the years, no providers have done that better than the nation's TAFE, other public education institutions and the many industry-led not-for-profit training organisations. They know the needs of the industry, know what the skills shortages are and understand the skills required by the various industry sectors. Their futures are now also uncertain. All of those credible and reputable training organisations that have been doing the training for years and years have been caught up in this mess and, for many of them, their futures are uncertain, as the member for Canberra outlined just a moment ago. I have a TAFE in my electorate. Only last week I was speaking to an employee of that TAFE. The employee asked me, 'Do you know what my future is and what the future is of the TAFE in our region?' This is a TAFE that has served the region well for decades; a TAFE that provides training opportunities to thousands of young people in my state and, in particular, in my area; a TAFE that has provided career pathways to people who did not want to go to university. They no longer know what the future holds for them, because of the undermining of the TAFE system by this government. I said a moment ago that this legislation essentially picks up on proposals put forward by Labor, and for that reason we will be supporting it in principle. As I also said, I understand that there might be a Senate inquiry. It will be interesting to see what comes out of that Senate inquiry if it proceeds. I have no doubt that, if we consult further on this matter, there will be other issues and other matters that are specifically related to this legislation that might arise and may need to be addressed. One of those matters is the appointment of an ombudsman. I note that in this legislation there is no provision for the appointment of an ombudsman in this sector. Perhaps some of the problems that we have had to date might not have occurred an ombudsman had been appointed. More importantly, if an ombudsman were appointed, it would provide an office for young people to go to if they run into difficulties with respect to their course. But, of course, that all depends on what powers and what authority the ombudsman has. It would be of little purpose to appoint someone you could take your concerns to if that person had no ability to do anything about those concerns other than perhaps to provide an annual report. So, if an ombudsman is to be appointed to oversee this sector, let us ensure that that person at least has the appropriate powers to deal with the problems that have arisen-the problems that have been exposed over the last three yearswhich government did nothing about. It is time we put back on track the skills training authorities of this country, because they are important to the country's future. They provide career paths for many people and they are essential to ensuring that we are a country that is still able to make things, do things and fix things. (16:52): I start by thanking the honourable members who have contributed to the debate on these very important VET student loans bills. BeforeI turn to some of the specific issues raised, I want to remind the House of the purpose of these bills. They are to establish a strong,",133,Bills
211,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson,"Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills)robust and sustainable program that provides important financial support to students to enable them to get the skills that they need for a job or to get a better job. They set the bar higher for training providers to be able to offer courses covered by the loans. They align loans to skills needs in the economy, so students and taxpayers are not left with debts for courses that have no prospect of being paid off. They require students to actually progress in a course before they have further debt levied. Under Labor's arrangements providers were enrolling a student on the same day as they applied for a loan and tried to claim the whole tuition fee in one hit, regardless of whether the student ever attended a class or logged into an online course. The VET student loans bills introduce loan caps that send a strong signal to students about the amount it costs to deliver a course and limit what the Commonwealth is willing to pay, to stop the exorbitant fee increases we have seen under Labor's scheme. They ban brokers from engaging with or recruiting students in relation to VET student loans. They require training that is being paid for by a VET student loan to be delivered by a provider who has met the high bar set by either this new program or the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. Under Labor's scheme providers could sign up students for VET FEE-HELP loans for thousands of dollars but deliver little, if any, of it, thereby selling access to VET FEEHELP and its inflated prices to training organisations who would not otherwise qualify. These new bills strengthen compliance and ensure that, where a student has been wrongly signed up for a loan, the government can remit that debt and recoup the costs from the provider. Under Labor's scheme students were signed up for thousands of dollars in loans for courses they did not need or could never complete or which had no link to employer or skills needs in the economy. We have heard examples from the members for Hinkler, Berowra, Durack, Forrest, Dunkley and Gippsland of how their constituents had, unfortunately, been targeted by these unscrupulous providers or brokers and why action was needed. The member for Cowper, the former Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, outlined the strong actions he and the government have taken to date to stop these rorts and to stop the growth in the scheme while the government consulted on a complete redesign for VET FEEHELP. He outlined some of the 20 measures the government has already introduced, which have already had an impact on improving Labor's failed scheme. The Department of Education and Training has advised that student enrolment numbers and loan amounts for 2016 will be significantly lower than in 2015 as a result of the changes the government has already made. This is already saving students and taxpayers millions of dollars in debt that would otherwise have gone out the door under Labor's arrangements. These bills establish a program that will restore integrity to Australia's vocational education system and confidence in Australia's high-quality training organisations. This is what Labor should have done when it established VET FEE-HELP and this is what Labor should have done before it opened up access to the rorters and the shonks. Those opposite want to shirk responsibility for their failed schemes, but Australians know that while Labor creates problems, like the failed home insulation scheme and school hall blowouts, it is the coalition that actually steps in to fix things. That is why, in providing support for these bills, the government is investing a further $45 million over the forward estimates to boost the department's capacity to manage the new program, including to monitor, investigate and take action against providers found to be doing the wrong thing. The department has been given the resources it needs to deal with the tight transition period and with the establishment and ongoing administration of the new scheme. Members have raised issues about the courses that will be eligible for a VET student loan. These bills provide the power for the minister to approve a course list. That list is not part of this bill; it will be a separate disallowable instrument. As announced by the Minister for Education and Training last week, the proposed list has been released for public feedback, with submissions invited by 23 October. The list assesses courses on the basis that they are included on at least two state or territory skills needs lists or are a national priority in terms of science, technology, engineering, maths and agriculture. The courses included on the list include around 95 per cent of students who are currently enrolled in VET FEE-HELP courses. I encourage stakeholders with concerns to have their say during this feedback period, but I would like to address some specific concerns raised in this place. Some members and stakeholders have raised concerns about arts courses. The proposed eligible course list includes 13 arts related courses: the Diploma of Graphic Design, the Advanced Diploma of Graphic Design, the Diploma of Screen and Media, the Advanced Diploma of Screen and Media, the Diploma of Visual Arts, the Advanced Diploma of Visual Arts, the Diploma of Live Production and Technical Services, the Advanced Diploma of Live Production and Management Services, the Advanced Diploma of Creative Product Development, the Diploma of Furniture Design and Technology, the Diploma of Photography and Photo Imaging, the Diploma of Music Industry and the Advanced Diploma of Music Industry. The member for Mayo raised a number of courses which are not on the proposed eligibility list, including courses relating to community health, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education, oral medicine, home economics education, building design, building surveying and dementia care. I can confirm that not a single one of these courses is subsidised by more than one state or territory and, of the eight, six had no enrolments in 2015. The government is unapologetic about aligning loans for VET, which is after all about vocational training, with workplace requirements. If there is a course that is not covered, members and other stakeholders should be asking the states and territories why it is not considered a high enough priority to be on their skills needs list. They can also provide their feedback through the consultation that is currently open. There will also be opportunities each year for stakeholders to provide their views on the eligible course list, which can then be adjusted to meet emerging and changing workplace and economic needs. As members have highlighted, the VET Student Loans (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill provides for current VET FEE-HELP students to opt in to be grandfathered under their current arrangements, with their current provider, until the end of 2017. The Department of Education and Training will seek to contact all students with a VET FEE-HELP loan who have not completed their course to advise them on the changes and invite them to opt in, should they wish to do so. Students will have until early next year to do so, after which time the department will have more accurate information about which students are genuine and when they are likely to finish. It is expected most students will have completed their studies before the end of 2017. Where courses have been included on the course list, continuing students will be able to continue their studies using a VET student loan. Their previous access to VET FEE-HELP will not preclude their access to a loan under the new program. It is not the government's intention to penalise genuine students who, as a result of unforeseen circumstances or illness, will not be able to complete by the end of 2017. However, VET FEE-HELP needs to close and, as the minister has stated publicly, the department will help students who have not completed by the end of 2017 to make the transition to the new program and is taking those situations on a case-by-case basis. On the issue of trusts, the government changed the VET FEE-HELP legislation last year to require all new approved providers to not be a trust. This was to reduce financial risk to the Commonwealth and increase financial transparency. Although this requirement was not applied to existing VET FEE-HELP providers that had already been approved, some have already sought information on how to address this requirement, no doubt expecting the change in the redesigned program. Where it is clear that the same entity continues but no longer acts in the trustee capacity, it will not change the department's ability to assess the entity's track record as a training provider. The department has briefed the stakeholder bodies TAFE Directors Australia and the Australian Council for Private Education and Training on this issue and will provide this advice to any organisation requesting information. I encourage any concerned provider to contact ACPET, TDA or the department to discuss their individual situation. The opposition has raised questions about banning brokers and what this means for the broader sector. Labor allowed brokers into the scheme in the first place by opening it up in 2012 without putting in place any dedicated compliance arrangements and with insufficient oversight or regulation. This government has taken all the steps to tighten arrangements for brokers, first by making training providers responsible for the actions of their brokers through the VET FEE-HELP scheme, and also by strengthening the Standards for Registered Training Organisations, and now by banning brokers relating to VET student loans. Labor did nothing in its years in government to address the issue of broker behaviour other than incentivise them to get into the VET FEE-HELP scheme in the first place. The member for Bruce mentioned agents in other parts of the VET sector, including international education. The member has previously served as an official in the Victorian department responsible for international education and I acknowledge his strong support for Australia's reputation for high-quality international education. SoI remind him that it was the coalition government again, under the Leader of the House when he had the education portfolio, which provided funding to enable the International Education Association of Australia to develop an industry led quality assurance framework to help institutions manage their international education agents. Labor did nothing for Australia's reputation in international education except smash $3 billion from the value of Australia's largest services export. It is clear that doing nothing is precisely what those opposite have in mind across the board for VET. During the high and mighty rhetoric from those opposite, the Labor Party did not provide a cent in their so-called fiscal plan for a new national partnership agreement on skills. It is quite interesting to look at a document, the Labor Party's pre-election fiscal plan, and what they actually promised on the matter of TAFE. We have heard those members opposite talk for a very long time about their guarantees and their support for TAFE, but I had a look at Labor's fiscal plan, which was released before the election. On page 22, headed 'Education and skills', dealing with costing issues, we see the point 'Provide guaranteed TAFE funding'. That is the first column. The second column gives the 2016-17 figure, and that figure is zero. I looked at 2017-18, and that figure is zero. I looked at 2018-19, and that figure is zero. I looked at 2019-20, and that figure is zero. So there were four years, 2016-17, 2017-18, 201819 and 2019-20, with no money under 'Provide guaranteed TAFE funding'-absolutely zero. Labor do not have a plan for apprenticeships. They do not have a plan for TAFE. They have no plan for the future of work. They have no plan for meeting the skills shortages of this country. Instead, they want a review. Those opposite also have an appalling record on apprenticeships. When the member for Blaxland addressed this House in 2009, he talked of the 35 per cent drop in apprenticeships on Labor's watch during the 'recession we had to have', which most people remember vividly. It was left to the Howard government to rebuild apprenticeships, as the member acknowledged in his speech. When back in government in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, Labor cut employer incentives nine times between 2011 and 2013, a total cut of $1.2 billion. Due to Labor's cuts, 25 per cent fewer apprentices took up training between 2012 and 2013. This huge drop continues to affect the numbers of apprentices in training today. The coalition government, by contrast, has a proud record on vocational education and training. We understand it and, as this bill demonstrates, we intend to back our beliefs with action. I commend the bill to the House. The House divided. [17:11] (The Speaker-Hon.

Unfortunately, it is not only taxpayers who have had to pay the price of this government's incompetence when it comes to this scheme. It is students, far too many students, who have been the real victims-students who have had their time completely wasted; students who now have unfair debt associated with them; students whom this government, time and time again, has left to fend for themselves. Labor have long argued that we want to be on the side of standing up for these students, and that is why we have been calling for a VET Ombudsman for a very long time now. A year ago, in the Senate, Labor moved to establish an ombudsman, and at that time the minister said that he would look into it. He promised to progress the idea. Well, a year has come and gone, and still there has been no action from this government, which has so often been the case when it comes to this particular case. Again, Labor moved first, and the government sat back, dillydallied, did absolutely nothing. But then last week, when these bills were introduced into the House, the Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills, who is at the table now, said in her second reading speech that the government would finally agree and would establish a VET Ombudsman. 'Finally, some action,' we thought. Finally, the students would have someone to help stand up for them. The funny thing is, when you take a look closer look at the legislation which is before the House, when you really have a look at the bills, it reveals that there is nothing in them at all that would create this ombudsman. So, a year after looking into it, after issuing a discussion paper, seeking feedback from the sector on the idea of an ombudsman, we are left with nothing from this government. That is despite the risk of these very bills declaring the idea of an ombudsman to be the most popular idea put forward by the government in their discussion paper. That is despite students, providers and consumer advocates all calling for an ombudsman. More than anything else, this amendment today is about protecting the innocent victims of this government's incompetence when it comes to overseeing the VET FEE-HELP scheme. It is about protecting those who have suffered the greatest as a result of their mismanagement. This is a practical way to help those students who have been ripped off, who have been left with huge debts, with nothing to show for them. That is why these amendments before the House now create an ombudsman and give them the power to both resolve disputes and represent students. Ultimately, the point of these amendments are to help students with unfair debts and to get redress for the exploitation that they have suffered as a result of those opposite. We cannot give students their time or their hopes and dreams back, but the least we can do is make sure that there is help at hand so that they have some way of trying to progress getting their money back. It is essential that such an ombudsman have the powers and the resources needed to protect students past, present and future. We note that the government is proposing to flick this idea off to a Senate committee inquiry. I stand here today and say that there is not a single member of this chamber or of this parliament now who says that they disagree with the need for a VET Ombudsman. We cannot let this legislation pass without it including such an ombudsman. I commend the amendments to the House. (17:21): I thank the opposition for proposing the amendments. I understand the opposition spokesperson, the member for Adelaide, discussed these with the Minister for Education and Training before they were circulated. As I noted in my second reading speech on this bill, the government intends to establish an ombudsman. This will increase student protections and provide a further avenue for dispute resolution. I note that Labor never provided an ombudsman when it established or expanded the VET FEE-HELP scheme. Stakeholders have raised a number of different models for an ombudsman, which the government is currently considering. So, whilst it supports the principle of an ombudsman, it will not support the opposition's amendment. The House divided. [17:26] (The Speaker-Hon.

Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (17:30): I move amendment (3) circulated in my name: (3) Page 73 (after line 12), after clause 103, insert: 103A Secretary must publish information relating to operation of the VET Student Loan scheme (1) The Secretary must publish the following information within 14 days after the end of the period of 6 months beginning on 1 January and 1 July in each year (the reporting period): (a) the number of approved course providers operating during the reporting period; (b) for each approved course provider, identified by name: (i) the number and value of loans approved by the Secretary during the reporting period for students for courses of study offered by the provider; and (ii) the number of students undertaking courses offered by the provider during the reporting period for which a loan is approved; and (iii) the number of students undertaking courses offered by the provider for which a loan is approved who have completed those courses during the reporting period; and (iv) the amount of the tuition fees charged by the provider during the reporting period; and (v) the amount of those tuition fees that were covered by VET student loans; (c) any other information in relation to VET student loans prescribed under the rules. If there is one thing that we have learnt from this debacle, it is that you can never, ever underestimate the incompetence of this government when it comes to this scheme. Let's be very clear: we have seen five ministers in three years sit back and do absolutely nothing as the rorting was allowed to grow, as $3 billion was allowed to be wasted. Mr Fletcher: You wanted us to introduce the scheme; you wanted us to introduce the scheme. Ms KATE ELLIS: Those sitting behind me are saying, 'It was your scheme; it was your scheme.' Let's have a look at the facts. This was something that was created under the Howard government, and in 2012, when the Labor government expanded the scheme, this mob supported it. This mob actually supported it in 2012, but then they sat back and did absolutely nothing when they were in government. The problem here is one of maladministration and a terrible lack of oversight and accountability. Five ministers over three years sat there, enjoyed having their new title, but did not do any work and clearly had absolutely no idea what was happening on their watch. This amendment makes sure that what happened on their watch can never happen again. It ensures that the government have to publicly release the data on the number of students, on the courses that are in, on how much the loans have grown and on the amount of the fees. They have to release this data every six months, because we know that, whilst we cannot trust this Liberal government to do their job and provide adequate oversight, if it is publicly available we will stand up and do it ourselves. When it comes to supporting vocational education it is Labor who will stand up and fight for a strong sector and a strong TAFE system. We know that the sector, academics and the parliament will be able to keep a close eye on the job that five liberal ministers have shown they are too incompetent to do if this amendment is supported. I commend it to the House. (17:33): In relation to the proposed amendment regarding six-monthly reports to parliament, this is also not inconsistent with the government's approach, which has been to increase the data that is publicly available about VET FEE-HELP and vocational education and training to benefit students. This includes requiring VET FEE-HELP providers to publish their maximum fees on the My Skills website and increasing the level of detail available in the annual VET FEE-HELP statistical reports. In light of this, the government believes it is worth examining whether there are further transparency measures that could be incorporated into the new program. That is why, as the member for Adelaide knows, the minister has written to the Chair of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, Senator McKenzie, to ask that the committee's inquiry into these bills give consideration to the opposition's amendments as well as alternative models for a VET Student Loans Ombudsman, additional levels of transparency for reporting and any administrative issues related to both the ombudsman and reporting arrangements. The government therefore opposes the amendment. The House divided. [17:38] (The Speaker-Hon.

As I said in my previous contribution before we were interrupted, I do not understand why we are having this debate. We put this question to the Australian public at the last election. This was an issue that was debated thoroughly in the lead-up to the election. There were two crystal clear positions. One was that of the coalition-that, if the coalition were successful and formed government, we would have a plebiscite as soon as possible during this term of government. The other was that put by Labor and the Greens-that, if they formed government, they would introduce a bill to the House which would be binding upon Labor members. I know that many Labor members do not get it, but they lost the election. The coalition formed government. We have a crystal clear mandate for the plebiscite to go ahead. Otherwise, what is the point of even having elections? Why go through all the processes of having debates and policy platforms if, after the election, whichever side comes to power and forms government is not allowed to introduce that legislation? Firstly, it is very disappointing that we see members of Labor and the Greens, and also some of the Independents in the Senate, giving an indication that they will not support what the public voted for. And one of the red herring arguments that they put forward is that somehow the results of the plebiscite are not binding.",156,Bills
220,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson,Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills),157,Bills
221,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (17:45,"I am pleased to speak in continuation in theThis emphasises a fundamental difference between those in the Liberal Party and the Nationals and those in the Labor Party. We know that, on the Labor side of politics, independent thought is not allowed. For every single bill, they are frogmarched in here and told by the caucus how they will vote. And if any of them on the backbench decides to show a skerrick of independent thought, we know what the punishment is: it is execution at dawntheir preselection will be taken away from them. In contrast, on this side of the parliament, for the Liberal Party and the National Party, on the backbench we have the opportunity to look at every single piece of legislation that comes to the House and make a decision on our conscience if we will support it or if we will not. That is a fundamental difference. It has been very clear, on our side, that, if the plebiscite goes ahead and if the plebiscite is successful, that bill will be introduced into the House. AndI make a commitment that, should that plebiscite go ahead, I will support whatever way the vote goes. The other issue to note is: there are often demands made from the media and from Labor members of parliament that members of the coalition should support the way the electorate votes, should the plebiscite go ahead. I would ask: how will members of the Labor Party vote? Will they support and respect the decision of the Australian public at the plebiscite? Should the plebiscite go ahead and should it be passed by the Senate, will members of the Labor Party respect the wishes of the Australian people? That is the question. I see many Labor names on the list of those to speak in this debate, and I would like to hear every single one of them make a commitment that, if the plebiscite goes ahead, they will support the wishes of the Australian people. And perhaps that is why those in Labor oppose the plebiscite: because, at their heart, they do not think that the Australian people should have a say in this matter. At their heart, they want to shut the debate down. They want to say, 'We are right,' and to deny the Australian public the chance to have their say. Mr Neumann interjectingopportunity-there are provisions in this House for members of the opposition to stand up and put their position. What will your position be if the plebiscite goes ahead? Will you respect the wishes of the Australian public? Dead silence. It is very simple. The answer is either yes or no. On this side, we say that we will respect the wishes of the Australian public. If the vote is yes, to change the Marriage Act to include same-sex marriage, the bill will be introduced, and this side of the House will support it. The opportunity is there. I leave it for members of the opposition. The other thing that has come about during this debate is the disdain that we have seen from the Labor Party for our democracy-complete disdain. We have seen them unable to make a commitment, unable to respect the vote of the Australian people at the last election, unable to even make a commitment that they would respect the vote of the plebiscite. It is very alarming that we see it over and over in this nation. We even see it in this debate: they are simply saying that there should not be a debate. They are saying we can no longer have debates in this nation because it may offend or upset people. This is against every principle of Western civilisation. There are many debates on many subjects that we have in parliament",157,Bills
222,Mr Craig Kelly,"I hear some interjections from over there, and I give them thethat will cause offence or insult for one group or another in society. But that is the fundamental basis that our democracy is built on. And yet, time and time again, we see the Labor Party, those on the left, against the opportunity of free speech. We also see that in the recent debate with the Human Rights Commission: in this country today, they are coming after the cartoonists To think that they want to close the debate down! They want to shut the debate down. They simply do not want to allow free speech and allow democracy to flourish. We have seen it time and time again. We saw it during the 2010 election and the 2013 election. The Labor government went to the 2010 election with the simple promise that there would be no carbon tax should they win government. And what happened? They completely reversed their position after the election. This is why the public cannot trust the Labor Party. We also saw it with the shameful 'Mediscare' campaign. It was not just a matter of Labor members saying one thing and that being rebutted by the coalition; what we saw with that 'Mediscare' campaign was Labor sending out millions of text messages that created a false impression that it was an official message from Medicare. This was a disgrace. You would think that members of the opposition, having been part of an attempt to hoodwink Australian voters, would come into this parliament and be embarrassed. Instead, they laugh and joke about it. Supporting this bill is about supporting the democratic result of the last election. Ms RYAN (Lalor-Opposition Whip) (17:55): It is a great privilege to follow the member for Hughes. He has just confirmed to the House that privilege rarely sees itself. If a plebiscite is 'the new black', then I want one on a national education funding model. I want one on live exports. I have got a lot of emails about live exports. Can we have a plebiscite on that? Can we have a plebiscite on the pension age? I think the public would like a plebiscite on the pension age! As the members opposite can attest, it is a core liberal principle that we are all equal before the law. This is an uncompromising statement-there are no conditions, no ifs or buts: all are equal. Well, it is a sad day for liberalism in this country when those opposite, purporting to be Liberals, want to have a plebiscite to test whether people believe we are all equal under the law-or should be all equal under the law. It is surprising to see those opposite seek to reinforce an inequality that exists within our system of laws. Moreover, they are now asking us to spend $200 million to ask the Australian people something we already know the answer to: should we all be equal before the law? That is a pretty simple question. And those in this chamber are elected not only to answer it but to enact laws to ensure it. This is a government that argues daily for savings and cuts that will hurt the most disadvantaged in our community. And yet they have found $200 million down the back of the couch-small change if you have a spare $2 million to put into your own election campaign-that they want to use to conduct an opinion poll to answer a question we already know the answer to. Not only are we asked to conduct an expensive and divisive opinion poll, but we are told that the result will not be binding in the parliament. The member for Hughes can say as often as he likes that he would be bound by the plebiscite, but we know that there are others in his caucus who have clearly said they would not be. So this brings into question the purpose of the plebiscite. Is it an exercise in direct democracy or is it a political football that has been kicked around by the right wing of the Liberal and National parties at the expense of the LGBTI community, a community that we have all been elected to represent? It is a $200 million straw poll to argue the toss about whether all are equal before the law. It is a simple premise. The Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, talks about a mandate, about representing the will of the Australian people, yet polls continually show that the majority of Australians do not support a plebiscite; they do not support this straw poll. A national survey, conducted by Galaxy, shows that, when informed that the plebiscite is non-binding and at a cost exceeding $175 million, 55 per cent of respondents support a vote by politicians in the parliament. It is unsurprising that practical natured Australians suggest: 'We just had a very expensive election. Why don't the people we elected take a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, take a vote in the Senate and make a decision.' The Australian public know that this plebiscite is not about making a decision. This plebiscite is about a non-decision. This plebiscite is about putting off a decision. I oppose the plebiscite for lots of reasons, some of which I have outlined. But mostly I oppose this plebiscite because it would get in the way of a referendum that this country has already said it will have. It would get in the way of a referendum to take us further down the road of reconciliation with Australia's first people. Coming back to this plebiscite, in my own electorate I have received hundreds of emails from my constituents pleading with me not to support the plebiscite for fear of the harm it will do to the LGBTI community. Across all of those emails I have received one email from a constituent in Lalor asking me to vote for a plebiscite. We did the maths in the officehundreds asking me not to vote for it and one asking me to vote for it. We are in an interesting time in Australia. Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister, says he wants to represent the will of the Australian people, but he continues to kick this can down the road. He needs to stop and listen to what the people are already saying and do his job and allow a free vote in the parliament. I note in a recent report that 49 per cent of people support a Trump-style ban on Muslim immigration but that this view was only shared by 24 per cent of young people. What this tells us, other than that kids are right on this one, is that hate and racism are not innate; they are learnt. Discrimination is learnt. If we embark on this national campaign and if we fund a 'no' campaign for this plebiscite, we will be sending young people a strong message that they have the right to discriminate against others. As someone who spent many, many years in classrooms I can tell you that when things happen in this place those conversations get echoed around kitchen tables in homes around this country and get repeated in classrooms and in schoolyards around this country. When those conversations are purporting that some people are more equal than others they get carried into school grounds and playgrounds, and young people get hurt by that. If we have this plebiscite and if we fund a 'no' campaign, we will be telling young people that under the law it is okay to discriminate. In schools, when these things happen-when young people get hurt by name-calling, by bullying, by being ostracised because of difference-schools put down tools and get to work on solving a social issue, because without doing that classrooms cannot run properly. Learning time gets lost in this process. Kids get hurt in this process. Some kids get so hurt that they stop attending school. When the schools are trying to sort these issues out, I can tell you, from long experience, that when you say to children, 'You know, there are laws in this country against you bullying someone else for being different', it works. It works. It undoes some of the harm done in some of our homes at kitchen tables where people think it is okay to be bigots. When young people hear that we have laws that say that we are all equal it makes a difference. They stop. They listen. They learn about respect-because one thing is for sure about young people, and that is that they like to fit in. The biggest fear I have for this plebiscite is that it is going to tell a group of our young people that they do not fit in, that they are not equal before the law, that their parents, if they are in a same-sex relationship, are not equal-are not the same-as the neighbours down the road in terms of the law. That is why I oppose this plebiscite. We would be undoing all of the work we have done over many years in schools and communities to get people to understand that in this country-in our great egalitarian Australia-we believe that all people should be equal under the law. This plebiscite would get in the way of, and push further down the road, us having a free vote here in the people's house to say to all Australians that we are all equal under the law and that we will act whenever we find a place in our laws that says different. That is what we should be doing at this time. We should be having a free vote on the floor of this chamber and then taking it to the Senate. Now there are some opposite who want to talk about tradition. Some time ago we had laws that clearly said that some of us were not equal before the law. I have worked with female teachers who went against tradition and continued to teach after they got married. It is hard to imagine, in this day and age, that communities frowned upon women working after marriage, isn't it? Tradition has changed. The law has changed. The danger of this plebiscite is that we will be sending a message to LGBTI people that they are not equal before the law. We will be sending a message to the whole community that some people think they are not equal before the law-and the worse thing is that we will not be changing the law to ensure that all are equal before it. When the Labor caucus took its decision unanimously to oppose the plebiscite I received a text message from a same-sex couple in my electorate. It was a simple message. It came quickly, as soon as our decision hit the wires. It said: thanks Joanne for your and Labor's stand today and not falling for the harmful plebiscite and state funded hate. If this means waiting, then we know how to wait. That is what I am hearing from the LGBTI community in my electorate. That is what I am hearing in my community. I think that is really important. To decide that we are going to approach this change in the law in a different way is to do a disservice to our communities and to the LGBTI communities. This chamber and the will of the Australian people have been hijacked by a minority who seek to stall progress to satisfy their own views and to appease the right-wing of their party. We cannot afford that as a country. We need to move on, and we need to fix this. The argument around tradition holds no weight, because we have acted to change laws in the past. In fact, we have changed the Marriage Act so many times that people are having difficulty counting them. A lot has been made of the Irish experience and the Irish plebiscite. Recent studies suggest that it was not such a positive experience for the people at the centre of that debate around the plebiscite. Those opposite often want to look to New Zealand and what they are doing there. In fact, Minister Porter talks all the time about New Zealand and the successful strategies over there. Recently, I had the privilege of spending some time with a few of our New Zealand colleagues. In New Zealand, they passed marriage equality legislation; it was put to a free vote in 2013. They passed the legislation without spending $200 million of taxpayers' dollars and without subjecting a large portion of the country to a campaign of division, with no guarantee that the vote would be binding. They did that three years ago. While they have moved on, we are still debating whether to pass this legislation. We could be voting on this issue right now on the floor of the chamber. We could make marriage equality a reality today. We could say to every young person that we are all equal before the law in this country. I would think that the Liberals opposite would want to hold to that principle. I would think that they would reject this plebiscite because they would recognise it is not the way forward on this issue. I note that, in New Zealand, they have also moved a lot more quickly and a lot further down the road in recognition of their first peoples. Perhaps in this case, in getting rid of this notion of a plebiscite, having a free vote in the House and delivering equality before the law for same-sex couples, we could then move into the space where there has been bipartisan support for a referendum on the recognition of our first peoples in our Constitution. Last week, the Prime Minister said that it was everyone's business. It feels like we are going backwards and that we are going to police people's bedrooms. I would like us to finish this. I would like us to move forward and have a free vote in the parliament as soon as we can. there will be no policing of bedrooms under my watch. I rise as a proud, long-term and committed supporter of marriage for same-sex couples-not like the Johnny-come-latelies on the other side of the chamber. I support the Plebiscite (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill 2016 to enable it. As the member for Brisbane said recently in this place: 'We will both enjoy an unblemished history in voting for pathways for change.' If only the Senate opposition leader or the member for Sydney could say the same thing. To be frank, listening to those in opposition, who parade around with false piety on this issue, is becoming tiresome. I am not going to try and pretend this debate about a plebiscite has been easy, because it hasn't been. It is rare in this place that you debate something so intimate and personal as your own relationship, let alone consider putting it up for a public vote. Many people have written to me and said: 'In light of my personal circumstances, why I would vote for the plebiscite?' The answer is simple: I am the federal Liberal member for Goldstein. I have a responsibility to discharge my duties to the people of my electorate and my party, not just myself. Many Goldstein residents came up to me during the election and asked my view on the matter. My answer has been consistent: the coalition would hold a plebiscite, and I would vote for change so long as there was a sensible respect for religious",158,Bills
223,Mr Tim Wilson (Goldstein) (18:10,"To kick off from where the last speaker finished:liberty. When the issue arises at the appropriate time, I will act consistent with my commitment, because, to quote former Prime Minister Abbott: … the last thing you should do is dud the people who voted for you. It is true that I have always said that a plebiscite is not my first preference to change this law. Plebiscites may not be preferable, but it is not that they are an illegitimate tool. Many have been used around the world on this issue to resolve it. Of course, Ireland did require it by constitution. It is true that the debate was, at times, offensive. There were people who supported the change who disrespected other people's world view and faith on the purpose of marriage. Similarly, there were people who opposed change who dismissed the value of same-sex couples and their families. No-one would voluntarily go through the experience again. But if people were asked whether they would go through it again for the outcome then the answer would almost most assuredly be 'yes', because this outcome is worth fighting for. The overwhelming 'yes' vote in Ireland was a moment of national unity. It disappoints me that our country is being robbed of that moment of national unity by the opposition. Those who opposed change had to accept the outcome, unless they wanted to renounce support for democracy. It became a watershed moment. Debate about equality before the law was overpermanently. The plebiscite will call on Australians to show mutual respect. That can be achieved. I have great faith in the Australian people to argue this issue respectfully and to stand up against those who do not. Offensive conduct is the exception; it is not the rule. I am proud to say that, despite the deeply personal nature of the debate, at all times I have sought to be as respectful as possible in this discussion, and particularly toward those I disagree with. More importantly, I am proud to be a member of a party and a government where so many people have engaged in this debate with incredible respect. The Prime Minister has set an important example, as, might I add, has the member for Canning. I commend both of them for their contributions, and I have no doubt that others will follow in their footsteps. I do not believe the case for change can win in Australia. I believe it will win. Convincing Australians for a change in the law is the fulfilment of our values as a nation. Arguing for that is a winning strategy. That is why the opposition leader's divisive approach is so appalling. Parliamentarians should always be mindful that their words have a special influence in setting the tone of public debates. The opposition leader's demeanour is truly extraordinary. Australians are apparently capable of deliberations to elect him to the highest political office in this country but not to discuss one of his policies. There are legitimate critiques of the plebiscite, not least of which is that Western liberal democratic tradition is that parliament is charged with the primary role of protecting people's rights, but it is blindingly obvious that Labor's approach is not driven by some sort of philosophical principle but purely politics. People are being put second. While Aboriginal Australians are desperately fighting to get on the ballot paper, they are trying to con LGBTI Australians to get off it. The opposition leader has used the debate around the plebiscite to call anyone who he disagrees with as promoting homophobia, bigotry and hate speech. It does nothing to bring the Australian community together for a respectful debate. It is also deeply irresponsible and inaccurate. Around a third of Australians have a different view from the position that I take, based on things such as tradition or faith. That is nearly the same number who, strangely, give Labor their primary vote, and yet we somehow manage to let them govern the country from time to time. Disrespecting them does nothing to advance the case for change. Perhaps the opposition leader's worse contribution is to say that we cannot win a plebiscite. In doing so, he shows a lack of faith in the cause and also in himself. You cannot have it both ways. Arguing that a plebiscite is unnecessary because public opinion polls show Australians support a change and concurrently suggesting the plebiscite will lose is an embarrassing logical fallacy. For years advocates have argued marriage equality should be supported because the majority of Australians support it. Over six years of the last Labor government, politicians could not pass this change. In this parliament there is a pathway forward. No party has enough MPs or senators to get a bill passed through either house. The plebiscite represents a workable solution to an issue that does not deserve to be delayed any longer. Sitting back and waiting is not cost-free. People do say hurtful things-we acknowledge that. They have before, they will now and they will again in the future. And none of that will change based on whether we have a plebiscite, even after there is a change in the law. The absurdity of the opposition leader's approach is that he argues that publicly debating the issue through will be tough. Yes, in part he is right. But, if that is reason enough, then we should never have advocated change in the first place, because the price will always be too high. I guess that is the cowardice when your sole interest in the debate is political and not principle. Implicit in the opposition leader's comments are that LGBTI Australians are weak. I am going to make this crystal clear: we are not victims, and I take exception to him implying we are. Worse, the opposition leader and his shadow Attorney-General have validated the idea that those who seek change should just sit back and wait. It is not the right of others who have never had to wait to decide for those who have. My good friend Paul Ritchie got me to reflect on this point deeper when he recently sent me a section of Martin Luther King Jr's Letter from a Birmingham Jail dated 16 April 1963. While some of the language is stronger than I would apply in this situation, the sentiment is appropriate. King Jr said: We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was “well timed” in the view of those who have not suffered unduly ... That is why now is our time. We must seize it. This is worth fighting for. Choosing the false comfort to wait for change rather than fight for it is deeply irresponsible. That is not what those who have fought for change before us have done to make a more just world, a more just community and, importantly, a more just Australia. In that time, couples will have partners who die and will never be able to experience the full legal recognition of their relationship. Such an attitude comes from the hubris of thinking change is inevitable. Change is never inevitable and attitudes change. Sadly, Labor have succeeded in conning people into thinking that they can just sit back and wait. Labor are not saying it because they think it will deliver a better outcome; they are saying it for deeply selfish reasons. For six years they failed to change the law as people like me, who advocated for it, had to sit through it. We watched Kevin Rudd oppose change because it offended his culture and religion, and then Julia Gillard opposed it on cultural grounds, and then we had Kevin Rudd who came back, changed his mind and did nothing. Then, as soon as they were in opposition, Labor said, 'We've all waited too long.' As my grandmother would say, quite rightly, 'What cheek!' If Labor only finds their social conscience in opposition, I say: keep you there. We have waited long enough. The only reason Labor do not want a plebiscite is that they want to change the law one day in the far-off future when they are in government, and I hope it is a long time in the future. It is not about people who want to get married; it is about them and their selfishness. Deep down Labor do not want a change under a Liberal government and a coalition government because they know it is a thoroughly liberal reform. It embodies the cultural and institutional conservatism of forward-looking liberalism by recognising the primacy and importance of marriage and seeking to ensure its enduring relevance for the 21st century, and it appeals to our belief that government should not dictate the terms of people's lives if they do no harm to others. It also appeals to one of the most basest liberal principles: all people are equal before the law and should enjoy the equal protection of the law. Australians who advocate for change are arguing for inclusiveness and a society built on responsibility and mutual respect. When the law changes it will be great day for our country. We will be a more perfect Commonwealth where everyone has an equal investment in Australian society. Many people have raised the concern about the anxiety that a plebiscite might cause-I note that it has come up periodically in the speeches by those on the opposition benchesespecially amongst young people. Somebody who contacted me went so far as to ask me what my younger self would feel watching his life being debated across the airwaves. Well, I can tell you a couple of things. Firstly, a younger me probably would not imagine that he would he standing here. Secondly, he would not imagine that he would have a number of colleagues who would be in similar circumstances standing up for a change in the law; or that he would have turned recently to the member for North Sydney, a few weeks ago, and asked genuinely, 'Did you ever imagine that on the floor of the House of Representatives you would watch the Prime Minister and opposition leader fight over who is more in favour of marriage for samesex couples?' I remember the time that I was coming to terms with my own sexuality in my teenage years. I spoke about it proudly in my first speech. I wrote recently in a column for The Sydney Morning Herald that the announcement of the plebiscite was emotional for me. It was true-it was. It took me back to that place when I was coming to terms with my sexuality and the silence and isolation made me doubt my legitimate place in this world. I know that many people in Australia have relived that pain. But in doing so, we lose sight of where it comes from. Yes, there were negative comments in those years, and bullying came from others. But, to be frank, I do not really remember those things or what others said, because in practice they are just background noise. That is part of the resilience, tragic though may be, of people growing up and learning how to deal with the world around them. Often it actually makes them stronger. In my case, I knew those comments were wrong. This is where I think perhaps members of the opposition do not have a full appreciation of what that experience is like. The worse bullying never came from others-it came from within. The opposition leader clearly does not understand that experience. Young LGBTI Australians have no one to turn to for support. The people they most fear talking to are those they traditionally turn to for support-parents, siblings and friends-because those are the people you fear rejection from. It is this silence that feeds anxiety and doubt-left alone, isolated and often trapped and locked in a dungeon of negative thoughts that swirl within your own mind; alone and with no-one to talk to or relate to. That is what the opposition has got wrong. A plebiscite is not a call to silence. It is an opportunity. It is a call for all of us to stand up for the type of county we want to be. I am always ready for that fight. The opposition sees defeat. That is why they have chosen silence. and I welcome him back to the parliament. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro) (18:25): Thank you, Deputy Speaker Vasta. It is good to see you in the chair, as well. In speaking on the Plebiscite (Same-Sex Marriage) BillI do want to acknowledge the previous speaker for his courage on this issue over the years, but I have to say that, acknowledging his voice as a stakeholder, it is not representative of the majority of stakeholder voices that I hear in my own electorate. I am here to represent those voices. We have to be frank about this. This is not an exercise on behalf of the government to deliver the rational, reasonable outcome here. This is an exercise in neutralising internal political dynamics within the parliamentary coalition. In that sense, it is irresponsible. I will come to the details of why I feel that way. I am entirely on a unity ticket with just about the rest of the nation at the moment in being disappointed with this Prime Minister. There is pretty much no principle or cause that we felt this Prime Minister believed in that he has not betrayed up until this point. His transition into a carbon copy of the previous Prime Minister has been completed and we have been watching it unfold this week. It is a great shame, because we all felt that he would come to that office seeking to advance causes that he had previously advocated and that he would come to this parliament with an agenda. He simply has not and he has betrayed the faith of so many in our community. This is not about the best way to get consensus on this issue, as the government claims. This is about a vehicle for the opponents of marriage equality trying to delay the inevitable defeat of this reform by the use of emotive, disingenuous and misleading campaigns. When we hear about claims by the Prime Minister that the plebiscite will be a reasonable exercise in democracy and it will be a civil discourse-we have already seen material that has been out there even before any process of a plebiscite has begun. Who can forget the meme with the rainbow-coloured nooses around a woman's neck? This is only a foretaste of what we could expect in the context of such a campaign. That meme was retweeted by the Marriage Alliance, as well, though they later withdrew it. So there are a number of key reasons why this is a bad way to go. In particular, if the Prime Minister was serious about this, if the coalition was serious about it, then why not make this a binding commitment? Why not nail to this plebiscite the legislative outcome? In effect, that is not happening and it demonstrates the lack of seriousness. The PM could have ensured that outcome in this process and chose not do so, thus belling the cat on the fact that this is not a plebiscite as such, but an expensive opinion poll, as we have been describing it-and a very expensive one at that. So no matter what will happen in this plebiscite, if it ever took place, which now looks unlikely, the outcome would be that many members of the coalition would consider themselves not bound by that plebiscite and would continue to vote in accordance with their consciences. So we will get back to the situation that we could have in this House",162,Bills
224,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Vasta,"I call the honourable member for Eden-Monarotomorrow-have a vote, allowing people to vote their consciences, having a free vote-we could get that result tomorrow without spending $200 billion. That waste of money particularly grates with me. We hear a lot of talk about budget responsibility and budget repair. We have seen the government proposing $50 billion tax giveaways to multinational corporations and big banks, but $200 million is not an insignificant amount either when we are talking about budget repair. I think in terms of the Southeast Regional Hospital that Labor was able to achieve in Bega in my electorate, based on the Health and Hospitals Fund, which was torn up and destroyed by the government. That hospital was about the same amount as what this plebiscite would cost. So we are talking about a regional hospital's worth of pointless exercise. In addition to that, the experience we are now having with that regional hospital is that the services that we had hoped to establish there are not being fleshed out because the coalition's cuts to health have forced the state to triage its services. So much is being done in cities to try to keep services going there, at the expense of rural and regional hospitals. Now we are seeing the New South Wales government exploring the possibilities of privatising some of our rural hospitals to try to tackle this problem. When I see that sort of thing going on, it really upsets me when we talk about wasting $200 million on this exercise. What we are talking about here is a powerplay within the coalition playing out through an unnecessary imposition and impact on people. This is an issue that brings many strands together and this country of ours and our society have evolved over many years on this issue. People did ask me, after I voted in favour of marriage equality in 2012, coming from a rural-regional seat like mine, why I did it. There were a number of reasons, but one particularly simple and poignant reason was that I served with many gay and lesbian men and women in the Australian Defence Force, and my view was: if they were willing to die for you, then this was the least thing we could agree to do for them. I think that is a fairly powerful point to get across. But I also came to appreciate that denying marriage equality is the last hook that those who seek to demonise, to diminish and to discriminate against gay and lesbian men and women have in their armoury. That is why they are hanging onto it so hard-because it enables them to turn to gay and lesbian men and women and say, 'Look, you are different.' This is the last point of difference. When we were in government, we removed, I think, 87 different legislative impediments to equalising that situation, and this really is the last thing left to do. Therefore, we need to remove it to prevent people being able to rely on it as their last hook to discriminate against and to demonise gay and lesbian men and women. Also, I bring to this discussion the perspective of an MP from regional Australia. I have concerns about the stress that this proposed plebiscite would cause to people in our regions. We know that it can be difficult being a gay or lesbian person in small rural communities. We had the example of young Eddie Blewett, from Tathra in my electorate, being mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in question time. She put the question to the Prime Minister on behalf of Eddie: 'Why should people who barely know us make an assumption on our families and vote on how we can live?' That is Eddie and his family from my electorate in a rural and regional area. What was interesting about that, of course, was that the Prime Minister did not directly answer that question. Afterwards, the media approached Eddie and his family, and Eddie said: 'It upset me that the PM did not answer me in parliament. I thought that was pretty hurtful, not just to me but to those families that were waiting for an answer.' This is a constituent of mine, a rural and regional person, who is not satisfied with the approach that the government is taking and is concerned about the judgements that are being made about his family. I also had young women and transgender people visit me from the local Queanbeyan headspace facility. They were people using that facility from all around our region and, to a person, they requested that I take up the position of opposing this plebiscite option. They feel very vulnerable and very sensitive to the sorts of issues and debates that would be raised in the context of a plebiscite. We have seen too many suicides in rural and regional communities when adolescent gay and lesbian citizens of this country feel the pressure of being isolated, alone, victimised, marginalised and treated differently. I do not want to see that situation amplified in this context. We obviously have issues around how that situation needs to be continuously managed, and we know that this is not going to aid that cause. From a personal perspective, I have to say that I had a strict Christian upbringing-stricter than probably anybody else in this chamber, I would imagine. I pretty much know, back to front, what is in the book. I know pretty much every line of the teachings, and I will say they have formed a big part of the values that have guided me in my professional life and involvement in politics, but I am aware, from having been brought up in that tradition, of the various evolutions of relationships and marriage that exist, even as spelt out in the Bible. To me, it defies belief that people can get up and say that marriage has always been the way it is now and between a man and a woman. If we look back at the Good Book and the children of Adam and Eve, the brother and sister unions that must have existed are one evolution of the relationships that are spelt out in that book. Also, as it unfolds, the book goes into detail about many polygamous relationships. King David had many wives and also had many concubines. There were no moral judgements passed on King David for those relationships and those arrangements. We have seen, in more recent times, the 19th century common-law types of marriage that were not subject to ceremonies but acquired status in the law. We have seen traditions of arranged marriages-some in our own society, of course, but in other ethnic communities as well. And we have seen, of course, throughout the centuries, until very recently, the fact that women had very little choice in these arrangements and almost no rights. It was only in the seventies in this country that we saw reform to the marriage relationship that created the rights that women needed and had been seeking for so many centuries, in fact. So we have seen quite a degree of diversity and evolution in the history of relationships, and certainly same-sex relationships have been around right from the very beginning. So let's not get tied up in ridiculous claims about confining ourselves to one particular type of relationship as being legitimate. The other thing that disturbs me about this discussion has been the focusing on children. The truth of the matter is-as I mentioned, legislative changes were made by our Labor government and other previous governments-same-sex couples having children is not illegal now. It is not beyond the ability of the system to accommodate at this point in time. For those who are opposed to the same-sex marriage ceremonies, and believe that that will prevent same-sex couples from having children, then it is too late. This debate is not about that. Forget that issue; it is dead. So we are talking now simply about a ceremony, not about the issues of children or the issues of the legitimacy of those relationships. The other thing that I would like to mention, too, is the issue of local representation that I am required to make in this House. I think it was put very succinctly and eloquently by Mr Iain Dawson, the director of the Bega Valley Regional Gallery, who wrote a great piece in the paper. He is a local boy-locally born and raised. In his letter, he said: The support for marriage equality is not disputed by either the Prime Minister or the Opposition Leader, yet we find ourselves with a $200 million plebiscite to decide the issue. We live in a democracy that elects its representatives to lead and make hard decisions on behalf of their constituents. Why is it that this particular moral/social issue needs any more than that? Add to that the suggestion that this wasteful and potentially harmful popularity contest will not be binding and still be subject to a vote in parliament, is just insulting to LGBTIQ people and the wider Australian population. My concern is not for me or the man I love, but for the kids who grow up feeling ashamed of who they are while we still debate this issue. Living regionally, those differences can be more pronounced, more isolating and potentially more harmful. I'd like the teenager me, who grew up here on the South Coast of NSW, to feel as accepted and valued as I do, as a member of this amazing community now. Marriage equality – let's get it done in parliament now! I would also like to finish by pointing out that the previous plebiscites we have done have been about things like conscription in war and the discussion around what adult males will do, and them being part of that discussion. What we are asking in this debate is to throw our children on the wire, along with vulnerable adolescents to this discussion, heedless of the impact on them of how they are viewed and the impact of the judgements that are made by the community about the relationships in which they grow up. Let's not go there while there is an easy alternative. Water Resources) (18:40): I rise to speak in this debate on the Plebiscite (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill 2016. I think it is vitally important. I would also like to reflect on the way it is being conducted. I believe that the way that it is being conducted now with the sense of decorum and respect is something that, obviously, can be transferred across the nation. I think that, from the very start, people should know my position and the reason I hold that position. I believe in the current definition of marriage-the traditional definition of marriage. I see marriage as a fundamental institution that existed long before this parliament. I am a realist. There will come a day when this parliament and this form of government does not exist. I believe that the institution of marriage will still exist then. It has been tested by time, through multiple cultures and multiple faiths who have no connection with one another and live in different corners of the world, as being overwhelmingly the union between a man and a woman. More importantly, as part of that-and I recognise that this issue is now passed on-I believe that every child has a right to know their biological mother and biological father. I think that is absolutely imperative for the formation of a person. We have all taken to this debate with the people we have met and the people it affects. I have certainly met children from same-sex couples. The concern that they expressed to me was precisely that. They do",166,Bills
225,Mr Joyce (New England,"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture andnot actually have a view on support of gay rights. They are in support of everything that their mothers and partners who brought them up. They respect that but they say, 'I have a right to know and I have been denied that right. Other people have made a statement that precluded my right.' Now, I think that it is only fair that, if you want to stand up for rights, then stand up for their rights to know what it is that is the fundamental essence of who they are and how that person was made. I suppose that affects my carriage in this debate because I see changing the definition of marriage as extenuating those problems and not actually dealing with those problems. I believe that over time these problems will become more manifest in other people as they come forward and say, 'Not only do I have the right to express my view that I should be able to know my biological mother and my father, and noting that they didn't act in that position as I grew up', and as they also demand the respect that their story be heard without them being pilloried or held up as some form of recalcitrant. These are my views. Whether they are Australia's views is an entirely different subject. It is for determination what Australia's views are. I also recognise that I come to this place not as a priest nor a pastor; I am far from that. I have all my flaws like everybody else around this place. I come here as a politician. Therefore, I must respect the view of the Australian people. If it is the view of the Australian people that they have a different view to me, then it is my job to respect that view. That is precisely what I will do. Not to be a spiv, but I want to reflect on how we deal with the challenge of presenting ourselves for a debate which I believe will be conducted in the same way that political debates are conducted in Australia at every election on every issue. We are so lucky to live in a nation where people are not assassinated for their political views. In fact, I think we are very pallid in how we accept the outcome of the adjudicator-the Australian people. Even so, with the concerns people have brought up, I reflect on Herodotus. In his discussions, 400 years before Christ, he said: It is better by a noble boldness to run the risk of being subject to half of the evils we anticipate, than to remain in cowardly listlessness for fear of what may happen. I think that is an instruction that offers an avenue. I am also a realist. My realistic view is that a plebiscite would pass, and therefore, early next year, you would have a change in the Marriage Act. From my discussions with my colleagues, you would have two choices. I do not even know how the House would divide on this, because I do not know who would say they wanted a division. You would have to get the call-no, I do not know who would say that. Nonetheless, I think it is obligatory, after the will of the Australian people is known, that you have two choices: you can abstain or you can vote for it. They are your two choices. This is an issue on which people say, 'I am constant in my view, and it has never changed,' or that other people do not change their views, or that somehow the view of the parliament is a constant and an appropriate reflection of the Australian people. That is not right. It is not even an appropriate reflection of the view of the Labor Party. I know Shorten had a different view in 2013, when he clearly said, and it is on the record, that it should not be the decision of 150 people. It was not the view of former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Whether it is now, I do not know. Who could determine that? I think in an earlier manifestation it was not the view of Kevin Rudd. So we know it is a view that changes. Therefore, why should the Australian people be bound to the views of people who by their own actions have shown they change their views? If we believe that this is purely a vote of the parliament and only a vote of the parliament, then of course it has to be the case that at a future stage we can change it back by a vote of the parliament. I do not think anyone wants that. I do not think that is something that we would be encouraging-that we would move it back. I am really skeptical, to be honest-because it is turning into a political tactic-when people say, 'We do not want to cause an incendiary atmosphere by talking about the pros and cons of the plebiscite.' In so doing, they are talking about the pros and cons of the plebiscite. That is precisely what is happening now. I do not believe that we are seeing wild riots on the street. People are dealing with it in a very respectful manner. By its very nature, the debate is happening right now. It is happening in this parliament right now. It is happening in the streets and in the papers right now. If you truly believe that the debate is so incendiary that it 'cannot mention its name', then stop talking about it. Just stop, from this night forward. Never mention it again. Of course, that is not going to happen either. Why? Because we trust the Australian people, we trust the decency of the Australian people and we trust that they will be able to conduct themselves in a manner that does not cost those who may have a different position. Do we honestly believe that the conditions and the qualities of the people in this room are beyond compare. beyond those out there in the public? They are not. We have the same mechanism, with good and bad politicians, with all their faults and all their failings. And we can find them on both sides; I am not denying that. But I do not think people are going to be saying that Sam Dastyari is more deserving of a vote than someone out in the street. And you can pick out for yourself a person on our side that you wish to mention-same deal. I think that the person on the street has their own common sense and they will approach this in a common sense way. An issue that the member for Eden-Monaro brought up was that it should be binding. I think that, as we speak, George Brandis, the Attorney-General, has basically brought forward what the changes to the Marriage Act would be. I do not think anybody is equivocating about what the changes would be, and I am sure the Attorney-General would be only too happy to have that discussion at the table in the other place about exactly what the intended changes to the Marriage Act would be. I do not think anybody is seriously saying that a vote determined by the Australian people would somehow not be carried through both houses of this parliament. It is no secret that in the Nationals the majority view, but not the exclusive view, is that we believe in the current definition of marriage. But I have always, always strongly believed that those who have a different view-and the member for Gippsland has a different view-are to be totally respected and given the space to express their views, which we do. There is no-one held out as an example, and everyone is allowed that space. And there are other people as well, and that is completely and utterly their right. Within the National Party, more than any other party, we say, 'If you really wish to cross the floor, you can; if you really wish to express a different view, you can; you just have to put some cogency into your reasons as to why.' That is why I have some skepticism when I hear that there is a unanimous view in the Labor caucus. Really? Not one person? Not one person with a different view? Not one person who has a view that they want to remain with the current definition of marriage? Were they given that space? Were they given that respect? Were they given that place to clearly express their views? Is it really the case that we cannot find one person? I will not call them out now, but I think I could quickly suggest quite a few who might have a different view. But their view has been corralled. That builds on the cynicism that we on this side of the House have about how we are actually going to conduct the debate. If you believe that the debate would be incendiary, then let your own people clearly state their own case, where they have a different view. We know they are there. We know they exist, and you know they exist, as well. I think it is an incredible indictment of this nation if we say that it cannot have a civil debate. Then, where do we go on other issues? I brought up before that I support Indigenous recognition, and I want to see that happen. What are we saying-we are not capable of that either? That one will have to go to a referendum, and I suggest that there will be people with different views from mine. I will not support those views, but there will be different views. I do not think they will win the debate and I do not think that will cause any form of riot on the street, either. If we make it a precedent that there are certain times when the Australian people are of a different ilk to what they have proven themselves to be over such a long period of time-all the way back to the 1967 referendum, to note but one major change in policy-then I think that is an insult to the Australian people. WhatI can say is there is the opportunity. Believe you me: people who believe in the current definition of marriage, of which I am one, have moved to this position. We have given ground. We have put forward a case and we have moved. The previous coalition speaker gave a very good and powerful speech on this bill, and I respect his views. I believe that they are completely and utterly genuine and different to mine. But both have moved to find themselves in this position where there can be a resolution to this issue. If we are really honest, we know what the path will be. If we go back to a realistic approach, the plebiscite would pass through both houses of parliament, a vote would be conducted in early February and a change of the Marriage Act would happen almost immediately after that. That is the path, but it needs people out there to say, like Herodotus, if you only have to live with half the ills that you suspect then it is worth the fight. It is worth the fight to then move forward and say, 'We will do that.' Believe you me: this is absolutely a level 1, class 1 major decision. We are talking about changing the definition of an institution that is vastly, vastly older than this parliament andas it is vastly, vastly older than this parliament-it does live in a different realm to other decisions that are made. If that is what you wish to do, then there must be some respect for those who have a different view. That is achieved by making an equivalence between the vote of every person in this chamber and every other person outside this chamber-every other person in regional Australia and every other person in the metropolitan capitals. I doubt very much whether there is a person in this place who does not have people affected by this, whether it is gay people in their office, which I have, or close relations or people in their family who are gay, which I have. Everybody says that and let us just get the palaver over and done with. But to think that they are all precious petals, as was stated in an article I saw in the paper, and that they cannot be part of a debate is also an insult to them. Also, to think that they all have exactly the same view is ridiculous; they do not. There are many and varied views in the lesbian and gay community as there are in any other community. SoI think it would be best for our nation to vote for this plebiscite, to have this issue dealt with and to move on. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (18:55): This is a very important opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Plebiscite (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill 2016, and I come to the dispatch box with a very different view to the Deputy Prime Minister. I am a very long-time supporter of marriage equality in Australia. I voted in favour of marriage equality when the matter was debated in the parliament in 2012 and I certainly hope at some point in the future I will be able to vote on such a bill in the parliament, so that we will see marriage equality. I remember during earlier debates on this issue receiving a very moving email from a local constituent of mine, Tiffany Tullberg. She wrote: I may or may not want to marry a partner in the future but that doesn't mean I should be denied the option of marrying the one I love. To me, these words really sum up the desire of LGBTI Australians for marriage equality. Just recently I received a letter from a young girl, her name is Samantha and she is a student at Ivanhoe East Primary School. She wrote: It is unfair that gay people can't get married at all in Australia yet man and woman couples can get married at any time of the day. Samantha says: Imagine if someone in your family were gay or lesbian and they couldn't get married. I think that is a statement that we all need to reflect on as we debate this bill. It is long past time for us to legalise gay marriage in Australia. That is why Labor went to the last election promising to legislate for marriage equality within 100 days. Since the election-as the debate has continued about whether there will be a parliamentary vote or a plebiscite and which is the best mechanism for achieving marriage equality in this country-like everyone, I am sure, in this parliament I have been contacted by many, many people, some in my electorate but also by many people right round the country. It is the case, certainly, in my electorate that a lot of people do want to see marriage equality. Equally, I have had a number of families, particularly mothers and fathers, come to me to say that they are deeply worried about a plebiscite. They do not take the view that the Deputy Prime Minister has just shared with us. These mothers and fathers are worried that a plebiscite would unleash hatred against gay and lesbian Australians and their families. It has been particularly emphasised to me that the impact on young people and on children would be very serious. It is especially the case that people are worried about the mental health of many young people in the LGBTI community, who are still realising their identity. People are worried about the mental health of young people who are yet to come out to their family or yet to come out to their friends. I recall one constituent, in particular, coming to see me in my office. She is in a loving relationship with her partner, also a woman, and a mother of two beautiful children. She loves her partner deeply and they love their children very much. One day they do want the right to express their love and commitment to one another in the same way that other Australians can choose to do it, and that is through marriage, but she made very clear to me that she is prepared to wait. She would rather wait for marriage equality delivered through a vote in the parliament than have a plebiscite, which she believes, as many others do, would be dangerous and divisive. Another very influential person who has put the argument very plainly is, of course, Justice Michael Kirby. He made the case that the plebiscite is in itself a discriminatory step driven by hostility. This has been a very important argument for me. We know that other human rights are not dealt with in this way. Michael Kirby has set that out in great detail, and I want to particularly acknowledge the way in which he has, I think, assisted all of us in thinking about the importance of this very significant issue that is before us. We know that for some in the coalition the whole idea of a plebiscite on same-sex marriage is a way of stalling and trying to defeat progress on marriage equality. I think many of those people hope that this will end in marriage equality being at least held up, if not opposed. I want say to those opposite that one of the great concerns I have is that the plebiscite would set a dangerous precedent. I do not think we want to have a precedent that says the best way to make sure people's basic rights, especially those of minority groups in our society, are pursued is to have a popular vote. We have never, in the history of our country, had a plebiscite to determine whether we should legislate the basic rights of a particular group of Australians. We are members of parliament in a representative democracy and we have been elected to this place to make decisions about the future of this country. That is why we are here. I do not think we can call ourselves leaders if we shirk responsibility for making these very significant decisions and spend such a large amount of money, anything upwards of $160 million, on what effectively is an opinion poll. Of course, after the plebiscite there will still need to be a vote in the parliament. We will still need to come in and make our voices heard on this issue. We have heard members of both the Liberal and National parties indicate that they may not vote in favour of marriage equality even if it is supported by a majority of voters. So it is not surprising that people are saying: 'What's the point? What is this really all about?' I think that is why many, many Australians have now come to the view that it really is time for us to address this issue in the parliament and get it done. The Deputy Prime Minister talked about other countries in the world. I want to remind him that in fact the people of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, Spain, Netherlands, Denmark, Brazil, Argentina-all of these countries-have worked together to achieve marriage equality. We are by no means at the front of this change. I accept that there are people of faith, good and genuine people, who do not want to change the Marriage Act and I do respect their views. But one thing we do not want to see is the respectful views of those people being drowned out by the voices of hate. We have to face up to the fact that that is already happening in our community, and I for one do not want to see that continue. I am concerned that LGBTI Australians will be subjected to a campaign of prejudice that demeans their relationships and attacks their families. Their families are as loved as any family in this place. I think that marriage equality will certainly come sooner than the Deputy Prime Minister expects and I hope it will be very soon. When it does, it will be a great day for Australia. It is up to us as members of parliament to do the right thing: to show leadership, to take seriously our responsibility to help improve the lives of LGBTI Australians, and to afford LGBTI Australians the same right to love and marriage as anybody else. A plebiscite will not do that; a vote in this parliament to amend the Marriage Act will. this government's Plebiscite (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill 2016, prepared by the Attorney General, Senator the Hon. George Brandis. The introduction of this bill is a historic moment for our nation and our parliament, because never before in its history has a federal government introduced legislation of this nature. No bill on same-sex marriage has ever progressed past the second reading stage and, consequently, no bill has been debated by the second chamber. All 22 bills have been private members' bills, introduced by members of parliament from across the political spectrum. More importantly, the bill fulfils the government's commitment, as part of its re-election platform, to offer the Australian people a plebiscite to determine this important question. As politicians, we are often criticised for ignoring the solemn commitments we make during the process of getting ourselves elected, and it is for this reason that I am proud to support this bill and fulfil this commitment to the Australian people. This parliament, as with all those that have come before it, is made up of people who have a diverse range of backgrounds, professions and values. It is for that reason I appeal to those of all political persuasions both here and in the Senate to look deep inside themselves and to deliver what is just and fair to those we represent on this important issue. Above all, we as elected representatives of this country must lead. We must lead our nation and ensure that, no matter the difference in our opinions, we demonstrate that this debate can be conducted in a respectful and dignified manner. We should look within our own conscience and vote on what would be the best for this nation, not our parties. I believe the determination of this bill should not be predicated on whether you support the concept of same-sex marriage or not but rather what is the best mechanism that will ultimately deliver and reflect the values of the Australian people. The institution of marriage is one that has been in existence for hundreds of years and has been the bedrock of Australia's fabric since Australia's existence. It has therefore been an integral and important part of the way our nation society has been shaped and grown for over 200 years. It is one that has lasted the test of time and it is one that no doubt will continue for generations to come. Therefore, the decision we will make on this bill is one that should be undertaken with care and respect. For this reason, it is my strong belief that to make such a significant change to our society's social structure is one that should be determined by the Australian people and by not the individual consciences of our nation's 226 politicians. If we as a nation revere the institution of marriage, no matter our sexuality, then surely any change to the fundamentals of this institution should be left to the ultimate democratic body in this country to determine its course, the Australian people. The bill will establish the legislative framework for a vote in a national plebiscite that would ask Australians: should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry? It is a simple question that is unequivocal in its meaning, and it is one that provides clarity to every Australian about what they are determining.",169,Bills
226,Mr Littleproud (Maranoa) (19:05,"I am proud to stand today to speak in support ofI acknowledge the cost of this plebiscite and acknowledge the financial constraints we as a nation find ourselves in currently. But our democracy, like the institution of marriage, is something we should fiercely protect and rightfully refer to, to provide the Australian people with the power to make the ultimate determination on something that would be a significant change to the social make-up of this nation. I also want to acknowledge the inherent concerns recently identified by Professor Patrick McGorry in regard to a plebiscite and the mental health of the LGBTI community. He fears they may endure mental health concerns during this process. Professor McGorry is truly a great Australian, whose work with this country's young is something this nation continues to, and will forever be grateful for. His concern about the detrimental effects a plebiscite could cause to the LGBTI community from his own professional perspective is acknowledged. But what Professor McGorry has failed to take into account in determining his professional assessment on this matter is the maturity of the Australian people. He assumes, in determining his opinion, that, effectively, he does not believe the Australian people can have a respectful and informed debate in a dignified manner on such an important issue, which I believe is an assumption no academic could accurately determine. I believe we live in a country that is tolerant and mature and one that can be entrusted with determining its own future. To say that the extremes from both sides of this debate will not try to bring vitriol into it, I understand would be naive, but it is incumbent on each one of us, as this country's representatives, to lead our nation through this important discussion and to bring our nation with us, with dignity and respect, and to destroy any social licence of extremities of this debate as they appear. We have been entrusted to lead our nation, and now is our time to repay that trust in our actions and our words, to galvanise the nation and reinforce that it is okay to disagree. I believe in the Australian people and I believe in each and every one of us as our nation's representatives to lead our nation in being able to make this determination without harm. In my electorate of MaranoaI get to witness this every day. The acceptance and inclusion of those across the electorate from the LGBTI community is one that exemplifies a truly tolerant society and, I think, reflects the Australian people's maturity and ability to undertake a decision through a plebiscite in a fair and respectful manner. people and are, therefore, prominent in their minority in those communities. However, the acceptance of LGBTI members in Maranoa as respected and valued contributors to their communities-has achieved acceptance and tolerance that our nation should be proud of. And, while my electorate has recently been marginalised because of a 2013 'Vote Compass' survey, as being the only electorate in the country to have a clear majority to vote against same-sex marriage, I have never witnessed nor been advised of any vitriol or disrespect towards the LGBTI community in Maranoa. This is because they are accepted for who they are, and for the contribution to their communities, and not by their sexuality. While this survey indicates that the people of Maranoa's view may not be in line with current polling on this issue, I still believe the voices of Maranoa are just as precious as those of any other parts of this country, and each one of them should be heard. The people of Maranoa are not loud or pretentious in expressing their views, but instead prefer to express their views and their consciences through the privacy of the ballot box. It is for this reason that I believe the best mechanism for the voices of Australia to be heard in a respectful and dignified way is through a plebiscite. In Maranoa we have proved you can have a contrary view and still treat those around you with dignity and respect and I believe our country can deliver that too. There is also a valuable precedent to the effective use of a plebiscite, in taking the community along together on this important issue. Ireland proved to themselves and the world that a respectful and dignified debate could be achieved and a nation could move forward on what the nation determined. Australia and Ireland share similarities. Both countries have deep religious and traditional perspectives on the institution of marriage. There was no reported breakdown in its society or any widespread individual harm caused to members of the LGBTI community by this process and for academics to determine that the Australian people could not conduct themselves with the same dignity is condescending and flawed. I am not standing here today challenging the validity of any same-sex couples' love for one another, but I am standing here saying that their desire to have that recognised through the institution of marriage is one that the nation should make collectively. Allowing the Australian people to make this determination above all will provide the validity any result deserves. Allowing 226 politicians to determine this matter based on their own conscience will only open up to conjecture the way members and senators voted, rather than provide the entire nation with clarity so that they can live their lives with the knowledge that the Australian people support this decision. I fear that, no matter what impassioned plea any of us make in this chamber or the other, partisan politics will prevail, and the leadership this country so richly deserves and yearns for will not materialise. For this reason, I fear that, instead of each of us leading our nation and bringing our nation with us on this journey, we will only serve to marginalise and divide our nation, and a great opportunity for each and every one of us to prove that we can lead this country will be lost. about marriage. And this is fundamentally why I am so vehemently opposed to this legislation. It demonstrates also-contrary to the view just expressed by the previous speaker, the member for Maranoa-a profound failure of leadership on the part of Australia's Prime Minister. It is a failure of politics. The member for Wentworth's, our Prime Minister's, weakness cannot and should not be allowed to bind this parliament. The question of marriage is a matter for this parliament. We should not shirk our responsibility to deal with it. SoI rise in opposition to the Plebiscite (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill 2016. In the chamber the other day, I stood here and listened to the remarks of my friend the member for Grayndler when he said that this debate is not just a debate about laws; it is about how people conduct themselves. And one thing we, law-makers, should not be doing in this place is to open the judgement of peers to millions of Australians as to how they live their lives. We should not force our fellow citizens to justify their personal circumstances-their love. Rather, we should support its equality through the ordinary law-making process. In this debate, the Prime Minister has generally been unconvincing, because I think all of us in this place and most of us across the Australian community well understand that he is not doing what he would want to do but rather continuing to do the bidding of his predecessor, the",175,Bills
227,Mr Giles (Scullin) (19:15,"This is a debate about equality much more than it is a debatemember for Warringah. So he is often unconvincing as Prime Minister, particularly when it comes to this question of marriage, because we should recognise in this place that he has been, generally, a strong and consistent supporter of rights for the LGBTIQ community. He is particularly unconvincing when he attempts to spruik the alleged democratic credentials of his plebiscite. And that is perhaps unsurprising because those credentials are very, very thin. Today, as we stand here, there are 226 people in Australia who have the capacity to change the law on marriage. Should this legislation, and then the subsequent legislation, the substantive bill, pass, we would still be in a position where 226 Australians would have the capacity to change the law. This is a fudge, and it is walking away from our responsibility to stand up for representative democracy. I say to the House that I was impressed by the contribution in Fairfax newspapers of Senator Dean Smith from Western Australia-not someone with whom I generally agreewhen he set out the reasons for which he would be opposed to this legislation. They were persuasive-notwithstanding the fact that he set them out from his perspective as a constitutional conservative. I am far from a constitutional conservative, but I am a strong supporter of a representative system of government. I think it is something we should be standing up for, particularly at this time when our democracy is in need of severe refurbishment. What we should be doing to effect that refurbishment is to stand up for these institutions, to make them work and to make them be seen to work, rather than fudging. We should not be passing on difficult decisions to the public at large. Certainly I have gone to the last two elections making it very clear to my constituents that I will support marriage equality, and I will do so in this parliament in the ordinary course. I think one matter that needs to be drawn to the close attention of the House is the process through which the Australian Labor Party, the opposition in this place, have arrived at this position of opposing the plebiscite, which has been a matter of much public debate. Personally, I have spoken to many LGBTIQ Australians; none have asked me to support this bill or the proposition it supports-none. I know that that has been a very common experience of colleagues on this side of the House. So it is very telling that it is only the opponents of marriage equality who are advocates of this proposal, not those directly affected. While government members have been listening to the concerns of those who are determined to delay marriage equality in Australia, we have been listening, and seeking, through this process, to give voice to the concerns of those most affected-LGBTIQ Australians and their families. This bill, very clearly, speaks to the concerns of those who are opposed to equality. One of the clues is in its name. It talks of 'same-sex marriage', which is not a term that I would use. What we are talking about here, if I can return to the start of my contribution, is not so much about marriage as about ending discrimination-about ensuring that all societal institutions governed by law are open to all. Through this process, we have seen real leadership from the Labor team: from the Leader of the Opposition; from the deputy leader, the member for Sydney; from the shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus; from the member for Griffith; from Senator Wong; from Senator Pratt and from the member for Bruce-real leadership. It has been a study in contrast to the vacillation and weakness of the Prime Minister. Their work has brought to the fore of this debate the personal experience, the harm and the prospect of joy. I have been privileged to hear from so many rainbow families: to hear people-often children-share with me very personal stories. I have often reflected on how hard it must have been for these people to tell their stories to a stranger-a strange man in a suit-and ask me and all of us to be respectful of their stories, of their experience, of their lives and not subject their lives to the cruel and uncertain scrutiny of this plebiscite process. Deputy Speaker, like me and my great friend the member for Shortland, you have had the great privilege of hearing many speeches at Australian Labor Party conferences-and the minister at the table cannot share that. The speech I heard at a Labor Party conference that affected me the most was one made many years ago by a very brave young woman, Sarah Cole. She stood up to argue the case for the Australian Labor Party in Victoria to support marriage equality. She began her speech by saying how hard and strange it felt to be talking about love at a Labor Party conference! Often Labor Party conferences are places of great love, but I was struck by what she said. Really, for most of us, there is nothing more important to our lives than our family relationships, the decision that those of us who are married, as I am, make to share our life with someone else. That there has so long been a legislative impediment to that status, something that I value very dearly, struck me then as being particularly cruel and particularly wrong. It struck me also that it was particularly unfair that this brave young woman had to share such a personal story in such an impersonal arena, when really we should have just gotten on with the job. In particular, we should not have changed the Marriage Act in 2004. That decision, like the other 21 occasions on which the marriage act has been amended, was made in this place, as any amendment to a law within the constitutional competence of the Commonwealth should be made, not through a process at large in the community designed not to advance the stated object. I have been in the chamber for many contributions by government members in this debate, and I will reflect briefly upon them. The member for Maranoa, at the end of his contribution, touched briefly on the experience in Ireland and asserted that there was no evidence of harm there. Of course, the expert evidence is to the contrary and the view of the affected community is to the contrary-that lives were harmed, that people suffered because of having their lives, their love, their sense of being equal participants in civil society placed under the microscope. He also talked about leadership. Well, real leadership is about doing your job. It is also about doing what you believe in and being prepared to lead. And that is not what we have seen from the Prime Minister of Australia through this debate. We have seen deflection, disingenuousness and hiding behind the reactionary rump of the coalition. When it comes to harm, that is one thing that the Labor Party have taken very seriously. The Leader of the Opposition has convened a series of roundtables to explore these issues with directly affected families and leading mental health experts. We have been guided by the views of people like Patrick McGorry in taking the decision not to subject Australians, including some vulnerable young Australians, to this cruel, unnecessary, unequal and hurtful process. There has been a lot of talk about a respectful process. Well, even in this chamber we have seen some pointers to a lack of respect. We have not seen respect given to the concerns that have been consistently expressed by the LGBTIQ community on this issue-again, those most affected. And in my meetings with them. I made it very clear that I would stand up for two things that I hold very dear: firstly, the guiding principle that we are all equal and we should strive to put in place a legal framework that gives effect to that without singling out vulnerable members of the community or indeed any members of the community; and, secondly, that we should stand up for the great institutions of our representative democracy. Where would Edmund Burke be watching today's Liberal Party! He would be profoundly disappointed. AndI wonder whether a couple of government members may be looking back on their first speeches regretting looking to that conservative icon as a touchstone in this place. It is important to touch briefly on the provisions of the bill itself. The bill, as I mentioned earlier, refers to same-sex marriage; it should of course be a bill to introduce equality when it comes to the laws of marriage. It is also important that mention is made of the timing of the circulation of the substantive bill that would accompany this. Really, at one minute to midnight before this bill came through, it appears that there are many provisions within that substantive piece of legislation that would be problematic. I refer in particular to a range of provisions that seem to have the very clear effect of seeking to entrench discrimination rather than eliminate it-which one would imagine is the purpose of achieving this end. Again, it is certainly the purpose that I am intending to achieve through my advocacy for marriage equality. There are some novel provisions in the bill before us that require some careful consideration. I refer to matters going to authorisation of certain campaigning materials, which in my view deserve proper consideration such as the process the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is about to undertake on those very significant issues. And, of course, the bill makes it clear that this is not a cost-free exercise. More than $200 million will be spent to change nothing at best. As I said earlier, I do not think anyone can look to the 'at best' scenario. We have clear evidence of harm to vulnerable Australians and I think a more generalised harm of diminishing our sense of being an equal community which is respectful of the interests of all. In this parliament we have made great process towards equality for LGBTIQ Australians. In this House we have made great progress through the ordinary process. We have removed discrimination across the statute books. We can do that when it comes to marriage; we will do that when it comes to marriage. The fight for marriage equality will not end when this bill is defeated in the other place as it should be. We will go on to give respect to all Australians by making the institution of marriage available to all Australians through this parliament. I am proud to put on the record my opposition to this unnecessary, hurtful and divisive bill. Debate interrupted. That the House do now adjourn. Mental Health Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (19:30): Last week we celebrated Mental Health Week and this week we celebrate National Carers Week. In 2016 the World Mental Health Day theme is 'Dignity in mental health-psychological and mental health first aid for all', which provides an opportunity to focus on an area that continues to provide challenges for people with mental",177,Lgbti People In My Electorate Often Live In Small Communities Of Only A Couple Hundred
228,The Speaker (19:30,"It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question:ill health and their families and carers-getting the right help at the right time and in the right place. According to the World Health Organization, mental health is: … a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community. Nearly half of all Australians will experience some form of mental illness during their lifetime, and those who do not will most likely know someone that does. Carers make an enormous contribution to our communities as well as our national economy. Should all carers decide to stop performing their caring role, it would cost the country $60.3 billion per yearthat is over $1 billion per week. I have worked for 15 years in the community-managed mental health sector, where the aim is to work with people to live a life of purpose, choice, meaning and citizenship and to support their families and carers. I would like to talk about the perspective of living with mental ill health from a person with lived experience. When talking about mental health and potential support services it is essential to engage with people with a lived experience. In this instance I will draw on the words of Helen Glover, who is a qualified teacher and social worker with a wealth of lived experience of mental illness. She very eloquently states: My experience of mental illness has given me far more than it has dared to take away. In essence, my journey has given me an opportunity to learn and thrive. I lost my way for some time during the years of seeking help. Despite good intention, I was inadvertently invited to ultimately believe that 'others', whether they were family, friends or mental health professionals, were my experts and that they were the only people who could get my life back on track. I have learnt since, that it is nearly impossible to reclaim a sense of citizenship and personal recovery from the position of seeing 'others' as being the 'expert' of your own life. Now, as a mental health professional, the wisdom of lived experience challenges me to be ever mindful of the fact that: We cannot recover people-but we can get in the way of people in their own efforts of recovery. We cannot empower people-but we can utilise our power to dis-empower others. We cannot create a person’s sense of citizenship but we can offer programs and services that reinforce a person's sense of 'illness-ship'. We cannot teach people to have hope or rediscover themselves, but we can inadvertently inhibit a person's sense of discovery and learning. Our responsibility is not to assess, manage, monitor, teach and rehabilitate, but to create environments where a person can recognise their own mastery, and continue to learn and thrive beyond the limitations invited by the experience of mental illness or distress. There is a real need for governments at all levels to develop policy that is deeply grounded in the perspective of people with lived experience. The electorate of Herbert is home to the largest army base in the nation and also home to a large number of veterans, ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen and their families-and the mental health of our Defence community is in need of desperate attention. As such, we welcome the Prime Minister's announcement to engage the National Mental Health Commission to undertake a review into suicide prevention for veterans and their families. However, the Defence community has also identified the fact that there does not appear to be any family representation included on the review panel, and this must be addressed. We would also like to see the timeline for this very important review re-assessed, given that the report is due in February 2017 and that it will be interrupted by the Christmas season. The life expectancy of people with a severe mental illness is estimated, in some international studies, to be as much as 25 years lower than the general population. Such a reduction in life span is unacceptable by any standard. This is a major social and public health issue that warrants urgent and sustained attention by all levels of government. Many causes of death and illness which contribute to this reduction in life expectancy can be treated or prevented through timely access to targeted health promotion effort, preventative physical health care and effective chronic disease management care. The level of physical health inequality experienced by people with severe mental illness is also driven by complex, interrelated factors, including poverty, homelessness and poor living conditions. The proposed cuts to Medicare, especially in relation to pathology testing and reductions in GP bulk-billing do nothing to support these people live longer and healthier lives. Some of us wore wristbands last week that said, 'mental health begins with me'. This most definitely includes the government and particularly the policy decisions made in this place. (Time expired) Capricornia Electorate: Rookwood Weir Ms LANDRY (Capricornia-Deputy Nationals Whip) (19:35): Families and small businesses are doing it tough in the Central Queensland city of Rockhampton. Capricornia faces a major jobs crisis due to the coal mining downturn. Resources will never be the same again. That is why we need to kickstart alternative industries to drive our future economy. We can create thousands of jobs around Rockhampton within two years, but the Labor Party once again is holding back this opportunity. Rookwood Weir, near Rockhampton, is a key economic driver. But Queensland's Labor government and Rockhampton state Labor MPs like Bill Byrne are sitting on their hands delaying the project-and, along with it, stalling 2,100 new jobs. This is in contrast to the Turnbull-Joyce coalition government, which has put $130 million on the table to pay for 50 per cent of Rookwood Weir. Further to this, we gave Queensland an extra $2 million to get on with the job of completing the state's business case required for Rookwood-and this is the point of contention: while we say it can be done now, they say a business case will not be ready until late 2017. This week in The Morning Bulletin, state Labor MPs rolled under the skirt of Building Queensland-a group that carries out economic evaluations on behalf of their state government. Let me quote them: The business case is being developed in accordance with Building Queensland's best practice Business Case Development Framework and is investigating the need for water security in the region and potential economic development opportunities. Consultation with key local stakeholders has already commenced. Building Queensland anticipates presenting the completed business case to government for their consideration in Quarter 3, 2017. What on earth is wrong with Building Queensland and the state government? Perhaps they need to check the filing cabinet. They should have this material at hand by now. Why? Because, way back in 2006, then Labor Premier Peter Beattie made the commitment to build Rookwood by 2011. The year he made that commitment is also the year Annastacia Palaszczuk-now the current Labor Premier-was elected to parliament. Essentially, she was elected to parliament on a Labor promise to all Queenslanders to have Rookwood Weir built by 2011. Ten years after promising the weir and five years after Labor promised it would be finished, they now come out saying the Rookwood business case must not be rushed and will now take until the end of 2017. This is unacceptable. Get on with it Queensland! You already agreed to have it built by 2011. Let me quote the promise made by Pieter Beattie, just to remind Queensland Labor MPs, Annastacia Palaszczuk, Bill Byrne and Brittany Lauga of their Labor Party failings. In 2006, Peter Beattie said: My government recently announced funding to accelerate the raising of the Eden Bann Weir and the building of the new Rockwood Weir by 2011. These will be key infrastructure components in assisting the development of this region. Tonight, I ask the Labor Party: where is it? Where is Rookwood Weir? If Peter Beattie can promise Rookwood Weir to be finished by 2011, surely there must have been enough studies and consultations conducted to satisfy the Premier of the same party, today. I ask the question again: why is the Queensland government stalling? Why are they hiding behind the bureaucrats at Building Queensland? Every day they stall on the Rookwood business case, they stall on creating thousands of new jobs. Here is a newsflash: the Commonwealth government of Australia is already satisfied with the case for Rookwood. The Prime Minister of Australia has already committed $132 million to Rookwood. And at the height of hypocrisy, when it comes to major projects like the Brisbane Cross River Rail or Townsville's stadium, Queensland Labor asked for Commonwealth money, without a business case even having been started! I join the Deputy Prime Minister in saying again: get on with it Queensland. Rockhampton is waiting for our jobs and our weir. Veterans Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (19:40): I rise tonight to raise a number of issues in my shadow portfolio area of veterans affairs. It has been my absolute privilege and pleasure since taking over this portfolio in July to have met with many ex-service organisations as well as individual veterans to discuss the issues that are important to them. A number of common themes have been raised with me, which I will speak about tonight. Firstly, I would like to raise the issue of transitioning from the ADF into civilian life. This is an issue where I think it is clear that we can do better. It has been described to me that, once serving personnel reach the gate, they do feel that they are alone. Civilian life is very different from life in the ADF, and for some service personnel the ADF is the only life they know. It is not uncommon for an individual to have joined the ADF at 17 years of age, straight out of school. They serve their country, with operational and/or non-operational service, are equipped with a broad range of skills and can be exposed to situations and events which can change them for life. A time may come when they may want to leave or, for medical reasons, have no choice but to leave the ADF. When that time comes they will leave with a wealth of experience, but they may need support in transitioning to areas of civilian life. Things that we take for granted they may never have had support in doing, whether that is obtaining private housing, finding their own GP or putting in place, most importantly, a plan for employment. The face of our veterans is changing. They are not necessarily leaving the ADF after a lifelong career, looking to settle down or retire. It has been reported that the average length of service is less than 10 years. So, for men and women leaving the ADF, one of the most important parts of their transition is finding meaningful employment. They have many more years in front of them to participate in the workforce; however, the skills they have, while highly desirable, may not be obviously recognised by the wider business community. Our ex-service personnel have a lot to offer but may lack the skills in applying for work or, indeed, selling themselves to prospective employers or identifying opportunities in the wider labour market. Support for them to find employment is an area in which I think we can work in a bipartisan way to improve. As we know, the intrinsic value of participating in the workforce has many flow-on effects for individuals and their families. However, it is not just about preparing the veterans or ex-ADF members but about encouraging employers to recognise and appreciate the skills and abilities that these individuals bring. I recognise Minister Tehan at the table. Both of us were at a Soldier On and ServiceNow launch of their employment program, which is about working with business. Mr Tehan: I launched it. Ms RISHWORTH: Sorry. I will recognise the minister's active role in launching it. Mr Conroy: You're very generous. Ms RISHWORTH: That's right. I think this is a really important area where we can work together. Transition is something we must do better. If we do not support the transition itself then that could cause distress, not just for the veteran but for their family as well. An individual's inability to find work and the isolation experienced as a result of that can lead to or exacerbate mental illness-and this does not account for those whose service has had a great impact upon them and who have been medically discharged. As we know, wounds are not just physical; they can be psychological as well. Psychological wounds are just as incapacitating as physical wounds and can lead to complex social problems, including homelessness and ongoing mental health problems. Mental health is a really important area that we must all address. I recognise the minister and the government for getting the Mental Health Commission to do work in this area, and I look forward to seeing the recommendations. One thing that has been raised with me is ensuring that there is equal access across the country in terms of mental health services for our veteran community. This is something that I will continue to pursue to ensure that, no matter where veterans live, they can access highquality mental health services that support their needs. Together we can do better. I look forward to working in this term of parliament to do just that. Berowra Electorate: NorthConnex by the Turnbull government in building the NorthConnex road project in my electorate of Berowra. The NRMA says Pennant Hills Road is one of the worse roads in Australia. Berowra locals do not need the NRMA to tell us that. After he came back from the war, my grandfather built his first home on Pennant Hills Road. Back then, it was a quiet suburban byway. My",180,Adjournment
229,Mr Leeser (Berowra) (19:45,"I rise to draw attention to the excellent work being donewife's grandfather set up his dental practice on the same road and could play cricket across the road with the shopkeepers on the other side. Now Pennant Hills Road is an eight-lane nightmare festooned with semitrailers and B-double trucks. Living in Pennant Hills and driving the road every day, I know just how bad it is. For too long, the people of Berowra have suffered from the total failure of successive state and federal Labor governments to invest in much needed road infrastructure in Sydney. The pressure that this has placed on local communities and local roads is incredible. But now Liberal state and federal governments are working together, along with Transurban, to fix this problem. NorthConnex is an outstanding example of the coalition's commitment to building infrastructure across Australia. NorthConnex is a critical project for Berowra. Our community can see the real benefits it will deliver every day. The project has been developed with an unprecedented level of community engagement and consultation. During the election campaign, I was constantly approached by people expressing their support for NorthConnex. They are sick of the traffic delays, sick of the exhaust fumes and sick of the noise, the accidents and the congestion. They are sick of Labor and the Greens forgetting about the interests of the hard working people in Northern Sydney. In fact, my Green opponent at the election campaign actually said she was opposed to NorthConnex. The scale of the NorthConnex project is immense. The project is budgeted at $3 billion and, at nine kilometres, NorthConnex is the longest tunnel project in Australia. It will take 5,000 trucks off Pennant Hills Road every day. This will have a huge effect on amenity for the local community as we reclaim our local streets for local residents and local businesses. It will significantly reduce air and noise pollution. There are around 360 traffic incidents on Pennant Hills Road each year. That is almost one every day. NorthConnex will play a vital role in reducing these daily traffic incidents and delays, often related to truck breakdowns. It will also contribute to greater road safety in our area. One of the most widely anticipated benefits of NorthConnex in our local community is the rehabilitation and revitalisation of Hornsby Quarry. I want to acknowledge the outstanding work of my state colleague, Matt Kean MP, the member for Hornsby, who has advocated tirelessly for this project funded by the Commonwealth, the state and the local council. Hornsby Quarry has been a blight on our local landscape for years. Matt's plan will see the old quarry filled with around a million cubic metres of spoil from the NorthConnex construction and then landscaped to become the centennial parklands of our area. Work is due to commence on this particular aspect of the project this month. Construction on NorthConnex started last year and it is due to be opened to traffic in 2019. Tunnelling is well underway with seven roadheaders working in three locations. The innovation of new modern and safe technology in the form of controlled blasting to excavate shafts leading to the tunnels has been particularly noteworthy. This method brings considerable benefits to local residents, including significant noise reduction and accelerated construction time for tunnel shaft excavation. The final tunnel will include new safety measures for motorists not seen on any project in our state's history. This includes a visibility standard that has not been reached in New South Wales before. Air quality levels will be reported live and publicly available. NorthConnex will bring the world's best standards of infrastructure. By linking the M1 and the M2, NorthConnex delivers the missing link in Sydney's motorway system. It connects Sydney's orbital network, the M5 and the M7, with the M1. The benefits will be felt far beyond the boundaries of Berowra. NorthConnex creates more efficient movement of state and national freight. It will offer motorists up to 15 minutes in saved travel time and allow them to bypass 21 traffic lights. I want to acknowledge the work of Transurban on this project, particularly the project manager, Steve Cornish, whose consultative efforts have been much appreciated. Like my hard working colleague, the Minister for Urban Infrastructure, I am absolutely delighted to see the construction of NorthConnex coming along so well. It is one of the most important pieces of infrastructure ever built in Berowra. I am delighted that to date the project is being delivered on time and on budget. I would be happy to be known as the member for NorthConnex! Lindsay Electorate: Nepean Hospital Ms HUSAR (Lindsay) (19:50): I rise to draw attention to the impact of recent health and hospital cuts on ordinary Australians, particularly those in my electorate of Lindsay. Since the Liberal government came to power, we have seen billions of dollars ripped out of hospitals right across this country. The Liberals opposite try to dodge responsibility on this issue by saying the cuts are made up and the money was never there. That is nonsense that completely ignores Labor's historical and deeply-held connection to universal health care. The hospital spending plan under the last Labor government reflected the need within local communities. This government's cuts, which represent $57 billion less for health and hospitals around the country, are a direct attack on the healthcare needs of our nation. The Liberal Party is obsessed with cutting money from health care because they simply do not understand or appreciate the value and importance of universal access to health care. The fact is that decisions by the government mean hospitals right around the country will receive $57 billion less, had those decisions not been made, and that is from a government handing $50 billion to big businesses via the company tax. It is not hard to see where the priorities of the Prime Minister and his government lie. Of course, this is not a one-off. It has been a recurring theme with Liberal governments since Medibank was established by Gough Whitlam in 1975. Not long after that, a Liberal government dismantled it by slashing funding and reducing rebates to doctors and hospitals under Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Luckily, Medicare as we know it today was brought back by the mighty Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke in 1984. We have seen those opposite trying to dismantle it ever since. We saw the member for Warringah, when he was health minister in the Howard government, slash $1 billion from hospitals and cut the Medicare safety net. We saw the member for Warringah, as Prime Minister, cut $57 billion dollars from hospitals-a cut that has been carried forward in the Turnbull government. At a state level, we have seen the New South Wales Liberal government cut $3 billion from their health and hospital budget. It does not change: everywhere you look, Liberals are taking a knife to the health services Australians, particularly in my electorate, rely on. In my electorate of Lindsay, Nepean Hospital is the most under-pressure hospital in the state. I have mentioned this a couple of times and everybody is going to get sore ears from listening. It has the worse emergency department wait times in New South Wales and the worse elective surgery wait times. At the last election, Labor promised to spend at least $88 million to immediately address the building and create the new cancer centre and more clinical and operating beds to relieve the pressure. The Liberals promised nothing. It is a similar story in the New South Wales state government. So far, in the five years they have been in power, the out-of-touch Baird Liberal government has only just recently commissioned a study into the need for a hospital upgrade, and only $1 million has been committed by the member for Penrith. Historically, it has only been Labor governments who have invested in Nepean Hospital and the community it serves. In 2010 the federal Labor government built six more operating theatres at Nepean Hospital. It replaced the old surgical wards with 60 new and upgraded beds; it built a new surgical outpatient clinic; it added extra day-only beds; it built a new renal dialysis unit for inpatients; it built a 64-bed mental health unit; it added an oral health building; and it built a 12-bed intensive care unit. Then, in 2012, Labor built a new medical school building offering bulk-billing for specialists and GP services, and spent a further $96.4 million redeveloping other parts of the hospital. So Labor has a track record of investing in Nepean Hospital. Sadly, the Liberals have completely ignored the hospital in recent times, and the effects of that are showing up in the dangerous waiting times we are now seeing. I should note that the state Liberal government did spend $20 million on a car park at Nepean Hospital, which is now being operated as a paid parking lot by a private provider. Nepean Hospital is at breaking point, and those Liberals opposite know that the current crisis was a significant issue at the previous election. The people of Lindsay made it very clear that they want their hospital properly funded, and they want a local member who will fight until this is delivered. My community deserves a hospital that is able to treat them within clinically recommended timeframes, not when it suits this government to pay for the hospital upgrades that it needs. We have Stuart Ayres, the member for Penrith, currently offering our residents a phony petition that is not even able to be tabled in the state parliament. It is a data mining exercise. My community deserves this hospital upgrade. So, yet again, I am calling on the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Aged Care to reverse their budget cuts and fund the Nepean Hospital upgrade immediately. Maranoa Electorate: Infrastructure commitment to building infrastructure, particularly in regional and rural Australia. There is no better example of that than my electorate of Maranoa. Maranoa is a diverse electorate, but primarily it is driven by agriculture. Agriculture is a common thread that links together every community right across Maranoa. We have what the world wants. Our story of Maranoa at the moment is just add rain. Add rain, because of the trade agreements that this government has put in place with China, South Korea and Japan. They are putting real dollars into the pockets of producers and people right across Maranoa, not only the primary producers but the small businesses that live right across my vast electorate. To do that, and to ensure that those returns continue to get through to the bottom line, it is imperative for every government to ensure that the infrastructure is there to complement those trade agreements-to build the conductivity of the 21st century. We are doing that with the NBN-68,000 households and premises right across Maranoa will have the NBN connected",184,Adjournment
230,Mr Littleproud (Maranoa) (19:55,"I rise to speak tonight on the government'sby the end of 2019. Couple that with the Mobile Black Spot Program and we are allowing our producers to connect with the global economy. We are global players and we now need to act like that, have the language to embrace the world and have the tools to undertake it. Another piece of that is the key infrastructure to deliver the products to the world. This government is doing that. It is doing that through the $1.6 billion for the Second Range Crossing, which my friend and colleague the member for Groom, who is here today-along with the considerable sum of $600 million that is being put into the Warrego and connecting highways throughout Maranoa, and along with the Wellcamp Airport, a private investment by a private company that saw the investment that our government is making in our part of the world and has the confidence to make further investment. This government will take one step further. We will build the inland rail. We will build rail from Melbourne to Brisbane. Within 24 hours we will be able to get the product from Melbourne to Brisbane to connect it to an international agricultural export hub in Toowoomba, to connect the airport, the Second Range Crossing and now the inland rail. I have to commend the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Darren Chester, for the leadership that he has shown throughout this whole program to ensure that there is clarity and transparency; to ensure that the $894 million that we have spent to date on building the inland rail, making sure that it will happen, and the commitment that this government has made to ensure that the connectivity for the people of Maranoa and Groom and throughout regional Queensland and right throughout southern Australia will be delivered; to ensure that we are able to put money back into those businesses that employ people. When we talk about the mantras of jobs and growth, this is the real delivery. This is the nuts and bolts of jobs and growth at a real and tangible level for the people of Maranoa and regional and rural Australia. This is real delivery by our government. This is what jobs and growth mean to regional Australia. This is delivery by the Australian government right here, right now. We have had conjecture about what those corridors may look like. It is a good thing that we can have clarity and transparency in a process that will give everybody confidence that we are taking a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get this infrastructure right. I am confident that the minister, along with other federal representatives like John McVeigh and Mark Coulton, will ensure that we get that corridor right, that it will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to connect Australia to the world. This is an enormous opportunity, as in the next month the Wagner Airport in Toowoomba will have weekly flights connecting our product to Asia. It is absolutely visionary that a family of local prominence in Toowoomba will do this. It will not be just Toowoomba that will benefit from that. My learned friend the member for Groom will know that it is my electorate that will complement that as well. I am forever grateful to the Wagner family. But it needs to be complemented by the inland rail. I am confident that the minister will now see that we will put in place the structure and process to ensure that that happens, to ensure that Australia is connected to the world. That is the only way in which we will pay down the deficit we have. That is the only way that we will ensure that we are here and we will be able to sustain the infrastructure that continues to drive our part of the world. I can honestly say that our contribution to GDP per capita, in Maranoa, is greater than the Gold Coast or Townsville or many other metropolitan areas, because of what we produce. Now is the time to deliver that infrastructure to ensure that the money that we are investing gets delivery to the Australian economy.

Wednesday, 19 October 2016 Jobsupport 1986, initially as a demonstration project under the Disability Services Act, to prove that people with moderate intellectual disabilities can successfully transition to employment in the regular workforce. Jobsupport was a pilot for the Transition to Work program now being rolled out in the NDIS as the School Leaver Employment Supports initiative. Led by its dedicated CEO, Phil Tuckerman, in over 30 years of successful operation, Jobsupport has supported over 700 people in regular employment, in jobs of their choice, throughout Sydney and Melbourne. Jobsupport has partnered with Inclusion Australia, the peak body for people with intellectual disability, so that they can offer online courses on how to transition individuals facing an intellectual disability into open employment services across the country. The Moderate Intellectual Disability Loading evaluation found that Jobsupport was responsible for over 60 per cent of all open employment placements for people with moderate intellectual disabilities across the country. McDonald's is one of Jobsupport's top 10 employers and has employed Jobsupport clients continually over the last 30 years. McDonald's currently employs over 70 Jobsupport clients. RecentlyI met with Lee McGillivray, who is one of 35 Jobsupport clients residing in my electorate and who has been working at McDonald's Moorebank for over the last 14 years. During his school life, Lee was quite reserved and had difficulty talking to people. He had difficulty with spoken as well as written communication. All that changed once he started working at McDonald's. Since his commencement in the job, he has made many friends, and not just with co-workers but with many of the customers as well. He is regarded as a star performer, particularly among his customer service team, and as a very dedicated employee. Initially Lee started working in the Australian Disability Enterprises system, in what we would have called at the time a sheltered workshop. At one point, his productivity was calculated at a speed of 18 per cent. With the right training and support through Jobsupport, Lee has proven he can consistently work in open employment at a rate of 70 per cent. I would like to thank Peter Meadows, the franchise owner of McDonald's locally, and all his team at McDonald's for being the principal supporters of this great initiative, empowering people like Lee and allowing them to reach their full potential. McDonald's cops many brickbats, but at this time. I would like to give them a bouquet. They have made a change for the better within our community. Taxation… for a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle.

233,Mr Howarth (Petrie) (10:03,"It was Winston Churchill who said:increased electricity prices for small and medium business, Australian families and pensioners; and a multitude of other taxes and regulations. What did this achieve? It achieved a slump in employment, reduced economic growth and a bucketload of debt. It also increased youth unemployment in the Petrie electorate close to 20 per cent in 2013. There is so much debt that we are currently paying $300 million a week on the interest of this debt. It has been tough cleaning up Labor's mess, but we are getting there because, on this side of the House, our priority is to grow the economy, generate jobs and secure the future for all Australians. We understand that we cannot do any of these things if businesses and people cannot function effectively, because they are bogged down in taxes and red tape. So what have we done? We have scrapped the mining and carbon taxes. We have cut more than $4.8 billion worth of red tape and just last week we delivered income tax relief for hard working Australians. We have extended to 32½ per cent the marginal tax rate from $80,000 to $87,000 from 1 July this year, benefiting more than three million Australian taxpayers. So those families who are on $75,000 net per year and perhaps earn $12,000 a year in bonuses, commissions and so forth will now see some $315 a year extra in their hands rather than the government's. Also our Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016 has been introduced into the House. What we are doing here is reducing the corporate tax rate for small and medium businesses with an annual turnover of less than $10 million to 27½ per cent for this financial year. We will extend this lower rate to all corporate tax entities by the 2023-24 financial year and we will keep reducing this rate in stages so that, in 10 years from now, it will be 25 per cent for all entities. Since 2001, Australia has gone from having one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the world to having one of the highest. By doing this, we will see more jobs growth locally in all our electorates, particularly amongst medium businesses. Thank you. Lalor Electorate: Werribee Irrigation District Ms RYAN (Lalor-Opposition Whip) (10:06): I have risen and spoken on numerous occasions about the need to prioritise water security in the south-west of Victoria. I have done this specifically calling on the federal government to make a contribution to the modernisation of the Werribee Irrigation District to ensure the environment remains resilient in the face of climate change, to ensure that our farmers, our growers, can continue to make the contribution that they are making by producing the fresh produce that Victorians' tables are reliant on. I urge this on the government for several reasons-the first of which is the health of the Werribee River. Our irrigators in Werribee South use fresh river water. They also access groundwater from the Deutgam aquifer and because of the last drought began to use recycled water provided by Melbourne Water. I ask that, given that Victoria is not receiving its share in the general infrastructure space, perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister might have a look at this situation and decide that the federal government can make a contribution to water infrastructure for the growers in my electorate of Lalor. Over 40 years, the Werribee River has had historically low environmental flows. It has put considerable pressure on the Werribee Irrigation District with water flow allocations for agriculture only hitting capacity five times over the last 15 years. Today that allocation hits as low as 15 per cent of capacity, requiring new sources of water to meet demand. Traditionally, they have used the two sources of water and have now moved to a shandy using recycled water. This is admirable. It shows their agility. It shows their innovation. Our growers are producing four crop rotations a year. It is a fabulous area with very resilient soils, but what we need is a secure, sustainable water source. Southern Rural Water and the state government have stepped up to the plate on this issue, both making commitments to redoing the irrigation system, which of course is ancient. It is dilapidated. It has concrete channels that are leaking, losing up to 40 per cent of the fresh water flowing through them. It needs to be modernised urgently. I call on the member for New England, the Deputy Prime Minister, who I listen to every day in question time talk about water infrastructure spending and yet I have been calling for a commitment from this government. I call on them to match the state government funding of $11 million to upgrade both the Werribee Irrigation District and the Bacchus Marsh Irrigation District and secure water for the growers of vegetables in my electorate. Capricornia Electorate: Rookwood Weir Ms LANDRY (Capricornia-Deputy Nationals Whip) (10:09): Families and small businesses are doing it tough in the central Queensland city of Rockhampton. Capricornia faces a major jobs crisis due to the coal mining downturn. Resources will never be the same again. That is why we need to kickstart alternative industries to drive our future economy. We can create thousands of jobs around Rockhampton within two years, but the Labor Party, once again, is holding back this opportunity. Rookwood weir near Rockhampton is a key economic driver, but Queensland's state Labor government and Labor MPs like Bill Byrne are sitting on their hands delaying the project and, along with it, stalling up to 2,100 new jobs. This is in contrast to the Turnbull-Joyce coalition government, which has put $130 million on the table to pay for 50 per cent of Rookwood weir. Further to this, we gave Queensland an extra $2 million to get on with the job of completing the state's business case that is required for Rookwood. The construction of Rookwood weir would boost agricultural production in the Fitzroy basin by $1 billion, effectively doubling production; create an additional 2,100 jobs; boost additional services and secondary industries by a multiplier of three; and guarantee future water security for urban and industrial use in Gladstone, Rockhampton and Livingstone shires. Broke and lacking economic leadership, the go-slow Queensland Labor government say they will not have their business case ready until maybe 2018. Labor's state member for Rockhampton is part of this delay. Instead of getting up and having a go for the people of Rockhampton, Bill Byrne is part of this go-slow on Rookwood. This is a disgrace because Byrne was the previous minister for agriculture in Queensland. State member for Keppel, Brittany Lauga, is also as silent as a lamb on this topic. Like their federal Labor counterparts in Canberra, both state Labor MPs have failed Rockhampton and failed to back job creation. Jobs created by Rookwood are a lay-down misere. The Labor Party in Queensland just needs to get on with it. TodayI join the Deputy Prime Minister in condemning Queensland for their go-slow. Our expert advice suggests Queensland's business case could, in fact, be completed this year, with the project starting in 2017. But Labor would rather see that nothing goes ahead in Rockhampton than give our federal government credit for a project that would create thousands more jobs and turned the city around. Taxation Singaporean tax shield. On 17 October, Matthew Stevens in the Australian Financial Review made the comment that because BHP was a large Australian taxpayer it was entitled to evade tax on some of its earnings. Mr Stevens apparently thinks it is okay for BHP to seek to avoid paying tax on all the profits of $5.7 billion held in their Singaporean tax shield. In my view, it was their duty to pay this tax, as it is of any taxpayer, corporate or individual. Given BHP's aggressive transfer pricing, it is little wonder that the government of Western Australia is considering imposing a new royalty levy, given BHP has evaded taxes of in excess of $300 million in royalties in Queensland and an unknown amount in Western Australia. It is now clear that for over a decade there has been a culture of tax avoidance in BHP, so I asked the question: why have they been using aggressive transfer pricing to evade their legal responsibilities to the people of Queensland and Western Australia and, if they are so confident of their legal position, why have they increased their provisions for taxation disputes and added US$570 million in expenses to their accounts to repay the federal government for income taxes and the state governments for royalties which they should have paid in the first place? The governments of Western Australia and Queensland have been treated very, very poorly by BHP. BHP cannot claim to be transparent, given their failure to clearly outline numerous back payments to the Australian Taxation Office as a result of tax audits over a decade. BHP are like that guest at the hotel. They have rented the penthouse, they have had full room service, but then they run off and leave a bill because they only paid for a standard room. BHP has always presented itself as a model corporate citizen. Its behaviour, and this behaviour, destroys the morale of people who paid tax, who then come to believe that the government treats them with contempt by penalising them whilst sparing the powerful and the wealthy. The dummy spit by BHP executives in London last night is yet another example of how out of touch corporates are with ordinary people and why, around the world, many corporates are held in such low regard. This sort of behaviour more than anything is why people have lost trust in politicians and business leaders. This loss of trust is fuelling political polarisation and instability. The board of BHP should provide a full and frank explanation of its role in approving this aggressive transfer pricing. As I said in this House last year, I speak not to bury corporations but to beseech them. Their exposure provides an opportunity for redemption and they should give a full and frank explanation.

Happy Diwali to all my friends. CanI also acknowledge Gurdeep Singh and Jaspal Rekhraj who, while they are not celebrating Diwali, as Indian Australians made a wonderful contribution to my campaign. Diwali celebrates the victory of good over evil, light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance. While there are several stories related to Diwali, the Hindu celebrations centre on the story of Ramayana. Diwali marks the return of Lord Rama, his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana from exile of 14 years after Rama defeated Ravana. To honour the return of Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshmana from Lanka and to illuminate their path, villagers light diyas to celebrate the triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time of joy and a time of reflection. It is a celebration of family, friends, life and prosperity in the wake of great struggles. It is a five day festival, marked by the coming together of friends and family. People take the time to clean their homes and reflect on their lives. They buy new clothes and jewellery and decorate their homes and shops. On the third evening of Diwali, people often open their doors and windows to welcome Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity. They light diyas and set off fireworks in celebration. Diwali is a time of hospitality and story-telling for people across India and across the Indian diaspora. Diwali is becoming a significant event in the Australian calendar and is an opportunity for all Australians to experience the rich cultural heritage of Indian Australians. I wish all the people in the Indian Australian community a very happy Diwali.

The remarks that he made are appalling, and I ask that he withdraw them and apologise to the thousands of people I represent in my electorate who are 50 and over who are extremely good workers, extremely good people and have paid their taxes all their lives and have worked extremely hard. Those comments are reported in an article by Primrose Riordan in today's Fin Review. What is it about privileged people who are intent on hurting pensioners and those who do not earn as much as they do, or people close to retirement? The new assets test is due to strip cash from seniors who have invested for their retirement. It is good thing that the family home will be exempt, but 700,000 pensioners can be affected by these changes. These changes have been on the cards for 18 months and we want to know why the Prime Minister cannot be up front with Australian pensioners and let them know what is happening early on so that they can make the changes they have to make in their lives. These people have worked hard, they have planned their retirement, they have made investment decisions based on current rules and now some may get a rude shock at Christmas. Labor voted against these Liberal government changes to the pension assets test. We opposed them in the parliament, but unfortunately the Greens and Liberals did a deal to cut the pension. Labor opposed this cut because we believe the policy is flawed. Pensioners in Hindmarsh are crying out for relief from this government. This government has failed to adjust things like the deeming rates for more than 18 months. Pensioners and retirees deserve better than what this government is offering them. It is about time this government took heed and listened to what people in these electorates-pensioners who have worked all their lives-are saying. To attack these people who have worked and paid their taxes-and some have fought in wars on our behalf-is a deplorable way to treat them. These rates will be determined at the discretion of the Minister for Social Services. I ask the government to rethink its stance on this topic. Maranoa Electorate: Wild Dogs wild dogs in my electorate of Maranoa and the important role our federal government is playing in tackling this scourge that is affecting many primary producers right across Maranoa and impacting the $58 billion agriculture industry in this country. Wild dogs and weed pests are costing $4 billion to the agricultural sector every year. This federal government, through the agricultural white paper, has committed $25.8 million to tackling this issue. An opposition member interjectingdollars has gone to my electorate of Maranoa. My electorate takes up 43 per cent of Queensland-10 per cent of the landmass of this country. We are actually the economic drivers in terms of agriculture in this country. This $10 million has given economic advantage to those who are coming out of drought, those who have been impacted by four or five years of drought and have been unable to diversity away from cattle into sheep or goats. This has allowed them to build the resilience in their businesses to move forward, to be able to provide a future and to be able to diversify and take advantage of the trade agreements that this government has achieved. We are now putting real dollars in each and every producer's pocket because of the trade agreements that this government has undertaken.",194,Constituency Statements
238,Mr Littleproud (Maranoa) (10:40,I rise today to speak on the important issue of,195,Constituency Statements
239,Mr Littleproud,"I will talk about what is not enough in a moment. Ten millionI have to acknowledge that the state government in Queensland, during the Queensland state election campaign, committed $5 million to the wild dog and pest management program. Then on Labour Day, in Barcaldine-the home of the Labor Party-in my electorate, I might add-in a National Party seat, they were proud to announce in front of Bob Hawke another $5 million. Five months later the state government are still wondering how they are going to do that. Only last Friday, after I called them out and said that they were too slow, they came up with the same mechanism that is already in place. They put $4½ million into the wild dog program-an established program that has science predicated behind it to achieve real outcomes for regional and rural Australia-and $500,000 on a research program. It is shameful to think that it has taken five months for a state government to get off their backside and actually deliver to the people of Maranoa. It is a disgrace. The reality is that my Deputy Prime Minister has been able to deliver a further $2 million to wild dog and pest management in this state. I challenge the state government to come forward and match the further $2 million and to come on this journey, because of the resilience it will build in rural and regional economies right across Australia, but particularly in Queensland. I am proud, because we have delivered. The state Labor government have been frozen to the wheel and have done nothing. As usual, they have done nothing-like with dams, fences and the whole way through. The Queensland Labor government are like the previous federal Labor government. They have done nothing. They achieve nothing. They just talk. Victorian Regional Cities Delegation Visit to China Ms McGOWAN (Indi) (10:43): I would like to acknowledge the Minister for Foreign Affairs. My constituency statement today is about the sister relationship between my town of Wangaratta and China. A delegation consisting of the Chair of Administrators, Ailsa Fox, and the acting CEO from Wangaratta, Alan Clark, visited China as part of Victoria's Regional Cities Delegation between 18 and 23 September 2016, and six of Victoria's 10 regional cities were part of that program. Our sister city relationship is with Jiangsu province. Its capital is Nanjing and it adjoins to the west and north of Shanghai. Wangaratta's sister city relationship is with Suzhou, which is the second largest city in Jiangsu province and abuts Shanghai. It has a population of 14.5 million and an urban population of 4.5 million. It is growing at rate of 6.5 per cent per annum-it is a very significant region. Due to the many historic canals, stone bridges and pagodas, Suzhou is often referred to as the 'Venice of the East'. I would particularly like to express my thanks today to the hosts-the people who looked after the Wangaratta delegation so well-and to give my commitment and that of my community to growing the relationship and doing what we can to improve not only people-topeople relationships but economic ties, education ties and growing our knowledge of each other's countries. To all the people who took part in the delegation from the Chinese side, thank you very much. To the Vice Mayor, to the Director and Vice Director of the Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and to our interpreter. The Wangaratta deputation was hugely impressed by the planning, the growth, the public transport and the emphasis on good environmental outcomes, and just how well the Chinese are doing in their city. All of this creates opportunities-opportunities for all types of businesses, big and small-but with the very clear message that we can grow these opportunities if we work together. So thank you very much to the people who made this possible, and to the Victorian government for doing the infrastructure work-to the Victorian government, which recognises the importance of our regional cities and which recognises that opportunities for us to travel to China, for rural people to actually see how China is working, is really important. I would say to the foreign minister: please know that Wangaratta and Suzhou are very keen to grow the relationship. And if there are chances that we can work with you and your department, please know that we are very happy to do so. Groom Electorate: Oakey Army Aviation Centre Dr McVEIGH (Groom) (10:46): I take this opportunity to comment on the beautiful township of Oakey in my electorate of Groom. It is a place where I spent a good part of my early childhood: as a boy from a local farm, it is where my family attended church and did business, and it is where I learnt to swim--although not very well! As has been well documented, Oakey has been gripped by the challenge of water contamination with what is known as PFAS firefighting foams, previously used at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre. These foams have not been used at the base for over 10 years, but the legacy of environmental and health concerns linger on. This is causing tremendous concern for locals, particularly those inside or close to the base's neighbouring investigation area for this contamination. They are frustrated and anxiously awaiting further advice from the federal government, and rightly so. Just yesterday I met for another lengthy briefing with the defence minister, Senator Payne, and, whilst time drags on, I thank her for her ongoing overview of this issue. We have completed an environmental site assessment and a human health risk assessment, and an ecological assessment will be released in the coming weeks. The federal government is liaising with various Queensland state authorities, the Toowoomba Regional Council and other bodies on issues such as health services, alternative reticulated water supplies to affected properties and potential property valuation impacts. Given the tremendous complexity of these issues, and the fact that similar issues are still being considered around the world, I recognise the process towards a resolution is taking longer than any of us would like. Importantly though, health risks are judged to be low and acceptable, and the township is fighting back. I have dedicated myself to work through with all those who are concerned, irrespective of their views. I note that just last week Senator Cameron appeared to make derogatory remarks about one of Oakey's leading citizens-the very well-respected Dr Eric Donaldson. I accept that the senator may have been confused, as Dr Donaldson is a medical doctor, a person who was a long-time medical professional on the base itself and a neighbouring affected retired landholder and grazier. To set the record straight, Dr Donaldson is a very level-headed and intelligent commentator on this issue. I applaud him on his balanced approach, probing questions and leadership with others in the Oakey campaign. AndI express significant regret that he has been slated incorrectly by Senator Cameron in the Senate just last week. for members' constituency statements has concluded. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2016-2017 Consideration in Detail Debate resumed. Foreign Affairs and Trade Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $3,775,608,000 Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (10:50): I will make a brief opening statement. I am accompanied by my colleague the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Australia is currently confronted by an uncertain and complex international environment. Challenges include international terrorism, conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Ukraine, relative shifts in global economic and military power to Asia, and a growing protectionist sentiment that risks undermining global prosperity. The 2016-17 budget is part of the Australian government's plan to strengthen Australia's national security, promote prosperity and advance our interests as a liberal democracy and an open, export led economy. The Australian government is investing more than $9 million to continue the people smuggling and human trafficking task force, which is playing a key role in support of Operation Sovereign Borders and has restored the integrity of Australia's border protection system after the six years of abject policy failure by the then Rudd-Gillard Labor government. We are also investing over $6 million to establish Australia's first cyber ambassador and a cybersecurity program to fight cybercrime, one of the new frontiers of security challenges we face. The government have committed nearly $40 million to open two new diplomatic missions in China and Papua New Guinea to strengthen bilateral ties, increase market access for Australian businesses and enhance our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians travelling and working overseas. Since the budget was handed down, the government has announced a further $58 million over four years to expand Australia's overseas diplomatic presence. The government is committed to ensuring that Australia's diplomatic network matches our standing as one of the world's top 20 countries with global interests. We have strengthened our ability to respond to emerging overseas events, such as terror attacks and natural disasters, by establishing a Global Watch Office within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to monitor and respond to developments on a 24-hour basis. The government will continue to deliver an aid program that is effective and affordable. In 2016-17 Australia will invest $3.8 billion on official development assistance, making us the 12th largest donor among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development comparable economies. We have committed an additional $220 million over three years to address humanitarian needs in Syria and surrounding countries and $100 million for gender equality programs and the innovation exchange that is developing new, exciting solutions to intractable developments problems in our region. The budget continues our commitments to other key",195,Constituency Statements
240,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Vasta,"In accordance with standing order 193 the timegovernment priorities, including the new Colombo Plan, which is supporting Australian undergraduates to undertake shortand long-term studies, internships and work placements in 40 countries across the Indo-Pacific. By the end of 2017, more than 17,500 students will have lived, studied and worked in our region under the new Colombo Plan that was only established in 2014 after we came to office. Trade, tourism and investment have played a key role in Australia's 25 years of consecutive, uninterrupted economic growth. We have delivered a trifecta of free trade agreements with the North Asia powerhouse economies. Just last week, the amended Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement was signed. In the first year of operation, our agreements with Korea and Japan have delivered real benefits for our economy, including the agriculture sector. The value of Australian exports of fresh beef to Japan increased by 22 per cent to just over $1 billion. Exports of bottled wine to Korea increased 53 per cent. China's imports of fresh Australian lobster between January and March were triple those of 12 months ago. The 2016-17 budget is part of the Australian government's plan to provide Australian businesses with preferential market access and encourage utilisation of the agreements we have secured. As the minister at the table knows, the government has committed $16.6 million to continue to drive jobs and economic growth through trade and investment. Through the government's ambitious trade agenda, led by the Minister for Trade, Investment and Tourism, the government is ensuring that Australian businesses will have a significant advantage in capturing gains from the growth in Asia's middle-class. The government is connecting businesses with export markets through the online portal seminar series, training provider grants and professional services mutual recognition. The 2016-17 budget supports the government's ongoing efforts to advance Australia's national interests in an uncertain and complex global environment. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (10:54): It is terrific that we have the opportunity today to talk about the foreign affairs portfolio, trade, tourism and so on. There is a lot of agreement across the aisle on issues around foreign policy-the importance of alliance relationships, the place of Australia in our region, the importance of the Indo Pacific region to Australia's future, and of course our support for international institutions like the United Nations and international laws and norms. Another area where there has been great support and bipartisanship over these last few years has been the support for the role that our defence forces are playing in Iraq and in Syria. I am sure all of us will be watching very closely during these next few days what happens in Mosul. But one of the questions that Labor have consistently put to the minister is: when will we have the opportunity in the Australian parliament to have a more detailed debate and discussion about what happens next? We have heard very concerning reports of the very brave Kurdish fighters, the Peshmerga, approaching from one side, Iraqi state forces approaching Mosul from another side. There are international concerns about what will happen between these two forces after the battle for Mosul. SoI would like to ask the minister first of all: when will she lead a debate in our federal parliament about Australia's role in this conflict overseas? Particularly, when will we have the opportunity to address the 'day after' scenario for Iraq? And also, when will we have the opportunity to have a discussion about the role the larger powers-Iran, Russia and others-are playing in the region and what significance that has for Australia? When will we have that debate in the parliament? There are important differences between the government and the opposition, and the minister has alluded to one of them-our aid program. Labor committed at the last election that we would invest $800 million more than the Liberals over the forward estimates in the aid program. We would like the minister to address the fact that aid organisations, including the Australian Council for International Development, have said that this aid program under this minister has no vision, that this budget marks the Turnbull government as the least generous in Australian history. I would like to know whether the minister is proud of that achievement and whether she argued for those massive aid cuts or whether in fact she was rolled in the cabinet on those issues. We on this side have a similar position to the government-that the international laws and norms are absolutely critical to Australia's future. We do best in a world that abides by the rules. We have seen the minister urging China and other parties in disputes in the South China Sea and the East China sea to abide by those international laws and norms and by the decisions that are made in respect of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. How does the minister continue to make that case publicly when Australia itself is being criticised globally for our refusal to come to a final arrangement with Timor-Leste on the seabed boundary dispute that has indeed been dragging on for so long? So could the minister also comment on how difficult it must be for her to be lecturing other countries on the importance of following the rules when Australia is not prepared to be judged by the same set of rules that we are urging others to follow. I have one final question. The minister mentioned the extra $9 million, I think it was, on issues around people smuggling and border control. I would like the minister to tell us whether she still abides by the decision she made to vote against an arrangement with Malaysia for Malaysia to accept asylum seekers from Australia or whether, like the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, she now admits that was the wrong decision to make. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (10:59): I am so delighted that the shadow minister for health has now shown an interest in Foreign Affairs, because when she was the shadow minister for foreign affairs not once did she come to the consideration in detail, not once did the shadow minister for foreign affairs-now healthattend this important chamber to discuss the foreign affairs and trade budget; not once. So this newfound interest is quite a novelty for us all-she is in the chamber. The shadow minister for health, the former shadow minister for foreign affairs, who never attended this chamber in that capacity, raised a whole raft of issues. First she asked when there would be an opportunity to discuss our involvement in Iraq. Obviously, she was not taking notice yesterday when the Prime Minister made a speech specifically on the Mosul offensive, on our military commitment in Iraq, and on the work that we are doing in training, advising and supporting the Iraqi security forces. Yesterday the Prime Minister spoke in the House about the humanitarian effort that the Australian government was providing, and indeed it is incumbent upon the opposition to ask questions in question time. Not once have I had a question from the opposition about the Mosul offensive, about what we are doing in Iraq. If the shadow minister for health, formerly the shadow minister for foreign affairs, was so interested in what is happening in Syria and Iraq, ask a question in question time. But of course she overlooks the fact that the Leader of the Opposition did have an opportunity to put Labor's position in relation to the Mosul offensive, our involvement in Iraq and indeed our involvement in Syria yesterday. He was given that opportunity, so I do not know where the member for Sydney was during that. Then she raised the issue of aid-yes, the aid budget is constrained by the budget legacy that we received from the Labor government, and Labor's now shadow minister for foreign affairs was indeed the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. When Labor's Senator Wong was the minister for finance-listen to this-she took a $1.5 billion forecast surplus in 201213, the member for Lilley's famous surplus, and turned it into a $19 million deficit. She then took a $23 billion forecast deficit toA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11:02 to 11:18 which we have only just begun and of which we had only had 10 minutes for consideration in detail before we were interrupted by a division. Acting on the advice of the Deputy Clerk, who advises us that it is up to the chamber to make a decision about how long we proceed here, I think that we should be able to have, at the very least, half an hour for the important issue of foreign affairs and trade. The fact that this government now wants to run away after 10 minutes of dealing with the issue of foreign affairs and trade and tourism tells you that this government is afraid of being accountable for the decisions that it has made in this budget. If the foreign minister and the trade minister do not come back to this chamber now for 20 minutes to answer questions, then it tells us that they are not prepared to be answerable for the decisions they have made. The question is that the proposed expenditure for the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio be agreed to. Mr Albanese: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The fact is that 30 minutes was allocated for the entire portfolio of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Tourism. All we have had is one question from the representative of the shadow minister for foreign affairs to the minister. The minister responded, but we have had nothing about trade, nothing about tourism, nothing about any other issues before this House. That is entirely inappropriate. At the least we should be allowed to have the shadow minister for trade and me, as the shadow minister for tourism, put on the record the questions we would like answered and, if need be, the government can take them on notice and come back to us. time allocations for each of the portfolios. The time for this one has expired. Mr Albanese: That is not right. Mr Clare: That is not correct. It is at the discretion of the chamber. then you would do that at the vote.",198,Bills

What we wish to challenge is the process here, and we can do that in a number of ways. We could do that through a dissent motion if need be, but we would ask that we be allowed to make a contribution and that it be put on the record. The member for Blaxland is about to put on the record his questions about trade, and I would like the opportunity to put on the record questions regarding tourism. Then we can move on, and you can put that resolution re the appropriation. That is a reasonable compromise to put forward on our behalf, which it is up to this chamber to determine. The minister opposite can be reasonable from time to time, and I would ask that this be one of those occasions, rather than our having a belligerent debate about procedures that will waste the time of this chamber. standing orders in the Federation Chamber are not as definitive as we would like, the reality is that the minister has taken a different determination regarding the questions that you are askingto take your questions so, in all fairness, I would prefer to stick with the agenda. If it is something that we need to refer to the Procedure Committee, which I know the good member has done in the past, with other members, with reference to consideration in detail-you are a regular here, my good sir-then we can do that but allow me, please, to forge on with the agenda that I have in front of me for the benefit of those members and ministers who are trying to keep to a schedule in this place. I am quite happy to utilise other provisions of the House for members to be heard. Question agreed to. Environment and Energy Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $901,853,000 my pleasure to speak on the environment portfolio and the energy portfolio-two very important areas of government attention. Let me start by saying that the coalition has a very strong and proud track record in relation to environmental matters. Go back to the time of Malcolm Fraser and the work that he did to protect Fraser Island and Uluru National Park. Go back to the time of John Howard, who came up with the first renewable energy target in the year 2000. He was also instrumental in establishing-with, I note, the member next to methe Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which is now in force. Prime Minister Abbott, during his time in office, included the banning of dredge disposal in the marine park of the Great Barrier Reef. Of course, the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has been a strong proponent of effective and efficient action in emissions reduction, including going to Paris with a very significant target of a 26 to 28 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, which is going to place us in the upper echelon of the G20 in terms of targets. In terms of the budget overview, I would like to make a few comments. Firstly, in terms of the Great Barrier Reef this budget strengthens the government's commitment with a $171 million boost. This includes a $70 million additional injection to the Reef Trust, which brings the government's total investment in the Reef Trust to $210 million. Obviously, this will be",201,Bills

248,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong,"Minister for the Environment and Energy) (11:24): It isimportant for water quality projects and the like. There is also an extra $101 million for the National Landcare Program, which will help us implement the Reef 2050 Plan. In terms of Antarctica, this government is making a very significant financial and resources commitment to research in that area. The centrepiece is the new icebreaker, and of course there is more than $200 million over 10 years from 2016-17. So that is a more than $2 billion commitment. In terms of this portfolio, one of the most significant changes was the Prime Minister's decision to bring the portfolios of energy and environment together. That is important because climate change and energy policy are effectively two sides of the one coin. We are working to reduce our emissions. I am advised that we are on track to meet our 2020 targets by 78 million tonnes, having already beaten our first Kyoto target by 128 million tonnes of abatement. We have a number of policies, whether it is the Emissions Reduction Fund, with more than 600 projects, or whether it is what we are doing in terms of our energy efficiency program to try to get a 40 per cent boost in productivity and energy efficiency by 2030. I had the pleasure recently of going to Brunei for the Asia-Pacific Rainforest Summit, which was an initiative of my distinguished predecessor, Greg Hunt, the member for Flinders. This meeting brought together representatives from 42 countries, including 600 different stakeholders. We talked about trying to reduce the amount of deforestation across the world as a way of boosting the environment and local communities and, of course, also reducing global emissions. Between 1990 and 2010, forests contracted in size by 3.3 million hectares, which is greater than the size of Vietnam. This government is doing a lot of positive things. In fact, just the other day I was able to place the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme as 107th on the National Heritage List, which is very significant. We were able to announce $5 million for a new conservatory at the botanical gardens here in Canberra. Of course, we were a leading part of the recent announcement of the phasing out of hydrofluorocarbons under the Montreal protocol by 85 per cent, which will be very significant in the future. (Time expired) Australia's actual emissions in 2020 will be 577 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is actually eight per cent above the minimum target of minus five per cent. In fact, the only way we will get to the cumulative abatement target is through projection improvements, which I will return to, carry over of credits from Kyoto period 1 and a hopeless Emissions Reduction Fund that only today has been reported that the Clean Energy Regulator has confirmed was not tested for additionality. Just imagine this for a moment: the Emissions Reduction Fund, the centrepiece of that Direct Action dog, has not been tested adequately for additionality when it is paying for supposed abated emissions. In fact, regarding the Emissions Reduction Fund, the Prime Minister has said that it was a 'fig leaf' over doing nothing and, worse, 'fiscal recklessness on a grand scale'. Returning to the improvement in the projections of Australia's emissions, which really is the heart of our abatement improvement, the minister's own department has stated that projections have fallen due to lower electricity demand, worse than expected agricultural conditions due to drought, lower manufacturing output due to industrial closures and weaker growth expectations from local coal production due to the fall in international coal prices.",202,Bills
249,Mr Conroy (Shortland) (11:29,"According to official government documents,So, in fact, this government is claiming credit for a revision in our abatement task because they have killed manufacturing, particularly in the automotive industry, we have a drought that has reduced agricultural production, consumers are responding to higher electricity prices by reducing electricity demand and coal production was not as strong as expected because of lower coal prices. So we will probably achieve the minus-five per cent target, but we will have an economic structure of plus eight per cent which will make reaching for the 2030 target so much harder. I have five questions for the minister. I ask that if he does not know the answers he take them on notice. Firstly, has any country or the UN questioned the additionality of the Emissions Reduction Fund and therefore the legitimacy of the abatement claim? Secondly, doesn't the latest revelation from the Clean Energy Regulator demonstrate that the Emissions Reduction Fund is a gigantic fraud? Thirdly, what happens if the coal price rebound is sustained and emissions projections have to be revised upwards? Fourthly, would this cause a blow-out in the cost of the Emissions Reduction Fund or simply allow the target not to be reached? Fifthly, how can the government be proud of reaching the minus-five target, if we do in fact reach it, through the deindustrialisation of Australia and the drought? I will turn briefly to renewable energy. The renewable energy industry has faced relentless attacks from this government. The most recent example was the Prime Minister following his fossil of a Deputy Prime Minister in claiming renewable energy caused the South Australian blackout. Again, that was disproven today by the AEMO report. I ask again: what is this government's policy to support the development of renewable energy projects after 2020? The minister-and the Prime Minister-failed to answer this in the House of Representatives chamber. If he fails again to answer it now, I ask that he take it on notice. Also, can the minister answer the question regarding the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. What is the total dollar value of all concessional loans issued by the CEFC? What is the estimated return above equity in dollar terms that the CEFC has booked in its operations? Furthermore, given that there is very little additional cost to the taxpayer in maintaining the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, will the government consider retaining the Clean Energy Innovation Fund to complement ARENA and the broader CEFC? thought that was a Dorothy Dixer, because those questions are exactly the ones I want to answer. The member asked me about the Emissions Reduction Fund. The cost of abatement has been $12.10 a tonne. Do you know how much it was under the carbon tax? It was $1,200 a tonne! The member asked about meeting our emissions target. When Labor were in government in 2012, they modelled how they were going to get to their own 2020 target. They were going to miss their target by a whopping 755 million tonnes. We are going to beat that target by 78 million tonnes. They were going to miss their target by 755 million tonnes, on their own modelling. I just want to say that I would love to get into this and further answers. Those opposite have the hide to come into this chamber and talk about renewable energy when they had a 50 per cent target by 2030 with no road map to get there and which has been condemned by people on their own side, such as Graham Richardson and Keith De Lacy-",203,Bills

This is a disgrace! Mr Clare interjectingwill take his seat! I am trying to give a ruling. It is a fair comment that you make. There are 30 minutes allocated for the debate; the commencement time has expired. I understand the point that you make in and around the shortening of the time available and I can understand, completely, your frustration. However, there is a schedule. Mr Conroy interjectingare provisions within the House, for when this chamber suspends to go down for a division and that has played havoc. I suspect that it is something that the Procedure Committee needs to adopt into the future. Unfortunately, we have ministers now rolling in for their allocated timeslots. I do sympathise with the member, but I have made a ruling on this. The standing orders in the Federation Chamber are ambiguous and they do need attention, and I do take the frustrations on board. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Agriculture and Water Resources Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $560,766,000 Water Resources) (11:36): I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the great things that we are doing in the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. I note the previous speaker: I always thought he came from a coal-producing area. I thought he believed in his working colleagues in the Hunter Valley, but obviously not. He is swinging with his Green mates. That is good; we will tell them all about it at the next election. It is very important that we understand exactly where we started with agriculture and water resources back in 2013: the department that was basically on its knees. Its funding had been cut by more than half. We had just come off the back of some catastrophic issues in the agricultural economy, especially in the live cattle trade, and we in the coalition wanted to make sure that we rebuilt this portfolio-that we rebuilt it and then maintained the respect that it deserves as one of the pillars of our economy. We went into the white paper process and got a substantial funding injection, especially into the crucial areas of biosecurity. We brought forward accelerated depreciation for water reticulation, fencing and fodder storage of 100 per cent over three years. We got the Farm Management Deposits, which formerly John Anderson had fought a torrid battle for and got through to $400,000. We doubled them to $800,000 and allowed them to be",204,Bills

255,Mr Joyce (New England,"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture andoffset against loans on your place-basically giving you a tax deduction to pay off your loan on a place. We know that the best way you can survive on the land is to have strong equity in your business. This was to encourage people, especially young farmers, when they get onto a place-and I can say, as a person whose previous life was as an accountant, 'Pay off your loan; you will survive.' It is the same thing with everything. When you get a good season, jam it against your loan and get a farm management deposit. We also made sure that we made access to concessional loans--$250 million per year for drought concessional loans. And now, between that and the Dairy Support Package, we have loaned out well in excess of half a billion dollars to close to 1,000 people. We built on that through the last election by announcing the Regional Investment Corporation, which is going to be a facility to assist this-to make it more fluid and to make it work quicker-so that when an issue comes up, and it is for our government or any other government in the future, the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources can act quickly. We have better country-of-origin labelling that truly identifies where the product is made and what proportion of what is in the packet comes from our nation, because this is what not only the Australian people but also people overseas were asking for. They want to pay a premium for an Australian product but they want to make sure that it is bona fides-that what is in the package is from our nation. With an ACCC commissioner in place, we put $25.8 million towards pest and weed control. Now when we go out we can actually start to see this tactile delivery. We can go out to Cunnamulla and say, 'These are the dog fences for which we have provided money. We now can bring sheep and shearers back into the area and bring commerce back into the area-making people's lives better.' What is really important is the $2½ billion we put aside for the Water Infrastructure package. I am very frustrated at the moment with one state in particular, Queensland, which has been completely recalcitrant and not playing the game. You give them the money-in excess of $90 million-for feasibility studies but do not see one started. You put $130 million on the table for the Rookwood Weir-it could bring in an extra $1 billion the year and an extra 2300 jobs-and it is something that should be supported. People should get in behind it. Where has the vision that existed with people like Curtin, Chifley and Menzies gone? Why are we so scared of our own shadow? Why don't we get in there and make these things happen? We have record prices in cattle and in sheep; we are turning around the wool market; the grow contracts are turning around. Pork is at record prices. Our protein grains-chickpeasare at record prices, but people say, 'What about your wheat market?' I understand that, but that is why we are making sure there is investment in such things as the inland rail to allow intermodal movement. The other thing that I know the member for Hunter will bring up is the process of decentralisation. We want to create centres of excellence. Just as when the minerals department was moved to Maitland, we are moving RIRDC down to Wagga. At estimates yesterday we saw a $1.2 billion a year saving through this form of decentralisation. The FRDC is going to Adelaide; a section of GRDC is going up to Toowoomba. These are things we want to do because we believe in decentralisation. I look forward to this opportunity to tell the Australian people about the great work we are doing-(Time expired) questions about relocations. He stood behind cabinet in confidence provisions yesterday, and I note that today he is going to have all the time taken up by bringing so many of his backbench along. He can run but he cannot hide. and carefully and I challenge him to answer each and every one of them. Last night in estimates Senator Ruston, representing him, seemed to suggest that CropLife supports the relocation of the APVMA. I asked the minister: does he stand by that assertion? I ask him: how many staff have been lost to the APVMA since he first socialised his determination to relocate that body to his own electorate? Has he revisited the cost of the relocation? I think originally it was $24 million or so. Has he revisited that budget allocation and what is the revision? He is now hiding behind cabinet processes, but will he commit to releasing the costbenefit analysis of the relocation to Armidale, once the cabinet has completed its deliberations? Water Resources) (11:43): I was going to wait until the end of the day, but just to show that we do not hide behind any of this, I think it is important to deal with this issue. What frustrates me so much is that the member for Hunter, who knows full well that Premier Bob Carr moved the department of minerals to Maitland because of the economic development it would bring to that region. I commend former Premier Bob Carr for doing that. He was a person of vision, but now the Labor Party has become so insular and so myopic that the only thing they can think about developing is developing Canberra further. Canberra is a wonderful city-God bless Canberra! We are going to spend $100 million on this building, but the largesse of government deserves to be spread further and wider than just Canberra. This is why we want to create these centres of excellence so people in the rural science department of CSIRO, which is in Armidale, have the line of sight and interaction for a better outcome. We have been having discussions with Matthew Cossey from CropLife, and he has related to me that he has become supportive of the process. He wants to be part of the process and he has become supportive of the process. This is what we do with our negotiations. We are not going to be completely militaristic about this. We are not trying to just send people out to the country. We work with people, and we are working with the department and with the peak industry bodies to make sure that this lands properly. I do not know what Senator Anne Ruston said, but it would have been a reflection of the fact that we are in discussions with CropLife and that Matthew Cossey has shown me that he is now supportive of the process and wants to be part of the process, and I hope that gives the member for Hunter the answer to his question. In regard to socialising the move and who is left, I have been informed that the turnover is no different from what has been happening at any other time. In 2015-16, 48 people left From the people who provided a reason for departure, six of the 48-12.5 per cent-said relocation was an issue. Unless you say 12.5 per cent of the people who have actually moved on is somehow a disastrous number, you do not really have an argument. When you talk about revisiting the costs, we are going to make sure that we do this in the most effective way.",205,Bills

You would already have seen as-I think there was one in the Financial Review-to get this process moving. It is just like we will be doing with the movement of the Rural Industry Research and Development Corporation to Wagga and the FRDC down to Adelaide, where they actually have fish-there are not many fish in Lake Burley Griffin, apart from some carp, but we are going to deal with them as well later on. These are the sorts of things that an effective government does. It is such a great place to be, in a coalition government surrounded by colleagues who have an absolute passion-even those from Hunters Hill-for making sure that they are part of this nation's second largest export after iron ore, which is agricultural exports. The honourable member went through the cost-benefit analysis. They always grab these things as if they are a smoking gun-'It's Watergate!' Basically, the result of the cost-benefit analysis is neither massively for it nor massively against it-it is basically impartial but there is a slight benefit. There you go. I imagine it would have been the same result when New South Wales moved the minerals department to Maitland. Of course, Premier Bob Carr was a substantive person, a person of vision. He had the capacity to deal with issues such as that. That is what we will be doing here, because we are people of vision. We are the same people of vision who want to build dams, who believe in decentralisation, who believe in inland rail, who have put money on the table to seal the road from Laverton to Winton-we are the sort of people who have that vision to make our nation a stronger place. In the past Labor have had the vote in Armidale but, by gosh, they have lost it now. Armidale, can the minister succinctly, and with some rigor, explain to the House what are the benefits of the relocation of the APVMA to the agriculture sector? Mr Joyce: Jobs. Mr Joyce: It was an interjection. Speaker. I thank the minister for his answer. He just told the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament that the relocation of the APVMA is going to create jobs outside Armidale. I will now ask him, when he next gets to his feet, to expand on that. How is it that the relocation of a regulatory agency to Armidale-an agency which does not interface with farmers but an agency which interfaces with the chemical companies, is going to create benefits for Australian agriculture-remembering that those farm chemicals and veterinary medicines are critical to productivity in ourGovernment members interjectingapproves crop protection, for example.

265,Mr Fitzgibbon,"Listen to the ignorance of these people on the other side! This agencycompanies which come here to Canberra hoping to have their new products registered, approved or re-approved in a timely manner. Already they have difficulty doing so, largely because of under-resourcing at the APVMA and workforce issues. When that workforce walks away from the APVMA-when those very highly-trained professionals walk away because they have their children in schools in Canberra, rather than go to Armidale-that workforce will be destroyed, and the minister knows it. Only this week I spoke to a proponent of a chemical to do with rodents on farms, who wants his organic chemical approved. Usually, that is a 10-week process. He has been told he will have to wait until April, Minister, because your workforce is already in decline. So the minister says that the relocation of this regulatory authority from Canberra to Armidale is going to create jobs in the agriculture sector. To save time, I will sit down and simply ask him again: where are those jobs in the agriculture sector? How is this relocation going to benefit the agriculture sector? Are you going to have approvals more quickly as a result of this move to Armidale? BeforeI call the question, which is that the proposed expenditure be agreed to, for the benefit of the HouseI will put the question at around midday, when the time for the debate has matured. government is delivering measures to support farmers-in particular, farmers experiencing hardship. There are concessional loans and the farm household allowance, where $1.1 million a week is being paid out on average, and there is the Rural Financial Counselling ServiceMr Brian Mitchell interjectingWe had better get that on the record! But I want to refer specifically, if I could, to the concessional loan products. In the 2015-16 financial year the government made available $250 million in drought concessional loans and drought recovery concessional loans. Due to the election caretaker period, we extended those loans to 31 October so that a new scheme could be established on 1 November 2016. These loans are currently being delivered on behalf of the Commonwealth by the states and territories. Mr Champion interjectingis being delivered by PIRSA and by his good friend Leon Bignell. I know there is a factional divide between them, but he is still his good friend. He has been an abject failure in this regard! He has been allocatedMr Champion interjectingand he is not! Sadly, he is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries in South Australia. But let's just focus on why he is no friend of farmers in hardship in South Australia, and this is the so-called minister for agriculture in South Australia.

270,Mr Pasin,"Well, that is true-he is no friend of mine, because I am a friend of farmersdrought recovery concessional loans. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have heard that his agency, Now, these are loans where farmers get access to a concessional 2.66 per cent interest rate for 10 years, with interest only for the first five years and P&I for the second five years. Loans are available for up to 50 per cent of total eligible debt, or $1 million-whichever is the lesser. You would have thought that, if the minister for agriculture in South Australia was a fierce advocate for farmers in South Australia, particularly those suffering hardship, he would have ensured all of that $20 million was made available to them. But, sadly, Minister, I can report to you, and you know well, that a paltry $2 million was made available to farmers in South Australia in hardship-a paltry $2 million. The sad thing in South Australia is that farmers have been deterred from making these applications, because of the actions of the South Australian minister and his ineffectual agency PIRSA. We now have a situation where only three farmers have accessed these drought concessional loans but, more disturbingly, under the new dairy loans, farmers have further concerns in South Australian. One of these concerns is with PIRSA and the way they are approaching this. Whereas water entitlements are accepted as security in other jurisdictions on a case-by-case approach, PIRSA have told the industry that they will not accept water as security for loans. This is nonsensical with respect. Every banker I know in the agrispace understands that these entitlements are tradeable and are a security for a loan. So my question is to the minister for agriculture here federally: what is our government doing to make concessional loans available in my state of South Australia so that we ensure farmers get the assistance they need? Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (11:56): Firstly, I would like to say, with respect to the shadow minister's questioning, I note that the minister did not commit to the release of the CBA after the cabinet had completed its deliberating in relation to the APVMA. I would also like to talk about the dairy industry. In my electorate of Mayo, I have many dairy farmers who do not sell to Fonterra and Murray Goulburn. These farmers do not currently have access to loans under the Dairy Recovery Concessional Loans scheme, despite being just as heavily affected by the recent drop in farmgate milk prices. Will the minister be extending the Dairy Recovery Concessional Loans scheme to farmers who to not sell to Fonterra and Murray Goulburn? Many farmers have told me they are hurting even though they do not sell to those two providers. Furthermore, I understand that, for the purpose of the loan schemes in South Australia, security valuations are only based on land and not the full value of farm assets such as lands, livestock and water. I met with the state minister for agriculture who said to me that he needed greater clarity in relation to this from the federal minister. So my question to the minister is: can you provide some greater clarity so that we can have a national position in relation to this? Minister, I would also like to talk to you about my own electorate of Mayo. We are growers of apples, pears and cherries and, as you know, the backpacker tax has significantly affected my community. My question to the minister is-",209,Apvma Seven Resigned 19 Transferred Seven Retired And 15 Completed Their Contract
271,Honourable Members Interjecting,"please. Whilst we do encourage robust debate, and I have let debate run, it is starting to get a little unruly, so if I could just remind members of the standing orders and I ask the member for Mayo to resume her contribution. Ms SHARKIE: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Fitzgibbon: Because they are boofheads! Ms SHARKIE: As I was saying, I was talking aboutHouse if the shadow minister would withdraw. Mr Fitzgibbon: I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Mayo please. Ms SHARKIE: Thank you. In relation to the backpacker tax, as you know, my party wrote to you in relation to our idea of a seasonal employment program that would assist locals who are unemployed to have incentives and jobactive providers to be involved in the seasonal work so that the farmers in my region are best able to be supported and can find employees who are active and ready to go. Would the minister please advise what his considerations have been with respect to the letter that I wrote to him some weeks ago? Also, Minister, I would be most appreciative if you could give me an update on the pest-free area designed for the Adelaide Hills and Fleurieu region. What decisions will the minister take to actively support this? This will bring thousands of jobs to my region. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Finance Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $422, 269,000 contortions in shipbuilding policy that this government has held. When the previous Prime Minister was around they were going to build submarines in Japan and of course we had a defence minister who said that ASC could not build a canoe. They have down a reverse double backflip and are now claiming to be utterly committed to shipbuilding in Australia and naval shipbuilding in South Australia. I have a number of questions about the ASC reform implementation-in particular, the separation of ASC into three companies based around shipbuilding, submarine maintenance and support and infrastructure. I would like to know who has been consulted as part of the review; what the terms of reference of it were; whether any consideration was given to the possible privatisation of ASC; whether the government has received any advice regarding the privatisation of ASC either in whole or in part; and whether the government has been approached by any organisations or private sector entities, businesses, sections of industry or others-middlemen or whoever else-interested in purchasing any part of ASC. Could the minister also advise how long their commitment not to privatise ASC is good for? Is this a time based thing? Is it good for this election or is it a standing bit of government policy?

275,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (12:01,"The minister would be aware of the variouswould be most interested to hear the minister's views on the contortions that are this government's shipbuilding policy. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins-Minister for Revenue and Financial Services) (12:03): I would like to very much thank the member for Wakefield for his question and I would like to use this opportunity to congratulate him on the arrival of his brand new baby daughter. The member for Wakefield of course has a strong interest in this matter, as does every South Australian. The government has in fact made very significant commitments to naval shipbuilding in Australia, and the government's commitments are backed by real funding. We will ensure that 21 Pacific patrol boats, 12 offshore patrol vessels, nine Future frigates and 12 Future submarines are built in Australia. The member for Wakefield asked about the ASC and the structure. That is going to be 54 vessels that we have committed to from Australian yards, which compares of course to zero vessels that were built by Labor in the six years that Labor was in government. The finance minister is the shareholder minister for the ASC, which is of course constructing the air warfare destroyers for the Navy and conducting the full-cycle docking in South Australia for Collins submarines. To ensure that the ASC has the best possible structure to pursue future shipbuilding opportunities and to support the government's naval shipbuilding objectives, the government announced on 11 October that the ASC will be structurally separated into individual shipbuilding, submarine sustainment and infrastructure businesses. The infrastructure company will hold and manage significant upgrades of shipbuilding and infrastructure assets to support future shipbuilding and submarine programs, and the shipbuilding company will employ the skilled shipbuilding workforce and complete the air warfare destroyer project, while the submarine sustainment company will employ the submarine sustainment workforce and sustain the Collins class submarines. These structural changes will not have an impact on the ASC employee terms and conditions, which, I am sure, is also of interest to the member opposite. The structural separation is, in fact, designed to ensure that the ASC is in the best possible position to pursue future shipbuilding opportunities and to support the government's long-term plans for the Australian naval shipbuilding industry. It will deliver a more efficient and flexible approach. It will facilitate the necessary investment in infrastructure and in workforce capability and facilitate the significant ramp-up in shipbuilding related jobs as required to better support multiple build programs under our naval shipbuilding plan. Our intention is for the ASC structural separation to be completed in 2017. It has been noted in the press release about the separation that they have, in fact, effectively been operating separate submarine and shipbuilding businesses for the last two years. The chair, Bruce Carter, commented that this operating model: … has been a major contributing factor in the company's turnaround in the Collins Class submarine and Hobart Class air warfare destroyer programs … The structural separation of the ASC demonstrates the significant value that this government places on our skilled naval shipbuilding workforce, and the government fully expects that the Collins sustainment and AWD programs will be able to continue their strong performance within their standalone entities and deliver world-class capability to the Australian Defence Force. On this side, we believe it is very important to make investments in our defence capability. Those opposite cut our investment in defence to the core. It cut to the core to levels that we have not seen since about 1938, I think it was. So it is no wonder that those opposite were not actually able to build anything during their time in government. It is no wonder that those opposite are quite ashamed of their record. Not only have we announced an investment plan, we are also delivering it with funding. Ms BUTLER (Griffith) (12:07): I appreciate the opportunity to ask some questions of the Minister representing the Minister for Finance in relation to the proposed sale or other commercialisation of the ASIC registry business. The terms of reference for the scoping study that was undertaken into the ASIC registry business included a requirement that the report for the study address, among other things, identification of any national security issues and mitigation strategies. SoI ask the minister: which national security agencies and which national security oversight agencies or entities have been consulted in relation to the possible sale, lease or other commercialisation of the ASIC registry business? On a related note, the government obviously has a public data policy, released in December 2015, as part of its National Innovation and Science Agenda. This proposal appears to be somewhat at odds with that policy. It is also at odds with a comment from the Prime Minister previously that it was 'regrettable that ASIC's data is behind a paywall'. Accordingly, I ask: has the Digital Transformation Office been consulted in relation to the possible sale or other commercialisation of the ASIC registry business? Has the public data branch of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet been consulted about the possible sale, lease or other commercialisation of the ASIC registry business? If the ASIC registry business is sold, leased or otherwise commercialised, is it anticipated that price regulation would apply to new products? If the ASIC registry business is sold to a corporation, leased to a corporation or otherwise commercialised by agreement with a corporation, will there be any requirement that that corporation be and remain majority Australian owned? If the ASIC registry business is sold to a corporation, leased to a corporation or otherwise commercialised by agreement with a corporation, to what extent will it be possible for the government to ensure the security of the data held by the corporation? Finally, to what extent does the minister believe a new, nongovernment operator of the ASIC registry will be able to increase search volumes? Has any modelling or prediction work been undertaken to assess the possible additional revenue that could realistically be generated by increasing search volumes for currently existing searches, or is it, instead, intended to be the case that the additional revenue would primarily be generated from the creation of new products under a monopoly arrangement? Ms PRICE (Durack) (12:09): The electorate of Durack produces significant wealth that the rest of Australia relies on, and growth in my electorate means growth for the rest of Australia. Durack is one of the regions that has propelled Australia forward in recent years, and I am very proud to represent an electorate that is full of such hard working and diligent people. Whether it is iron ore, gas, wheat, beef, horticulture or even rock lobster, Durack constituents are well and truly pulling their weight when it comes to contributing in a positive way to the economy. That is why it makes the record deficit left to this government by those opposite in 2013 even more disappointing and heart breaking. I would like to take the time to remind those opposite of the record deficit that Labor managed to rack up in their time in office. Labor exploded our national debt levels and put us into an incredible budget black hole of $310 billionMs PRICE: something that those on the other side really do not want to hear; I can sense that-with an upward trajectory of another $123 billion forecast for the next four years. This economic performance was so bad in 2013 that the Labor government were voted out of office with their lowest primary vote since 1931. They are not so noisy now! While Labor were busy destroying our economy, under their watch at least 1,200 people died at sea and, of course, we have all heard about the pink batts disaster. And we only debated yesterday the VET FEE-HELP program, which blew out by 792 per cent-extraordinary and an impressive display of incompetence by any measure. This is the record that the Turnbull government has been committed to bettering, because the taxpayer of Australia deserved better governance than what has been served up by those opposite. We are focused on growing our economy outside of a resource based, bulk-tonnage economy and are placing an emphasis on instead growing a diverse economy reliant upon the skills and resourcefulness of our people. Infrastructure and education are means that are proven to promote growth in the economy and they are measures this government is very proud to fund. This government is delivering on commitments to increase education infrastructure funding in regional centres such as the capital grants scheme, which is committed to a new $800,000 funding package for the Geraldton Grammar School, which is my electorate. Since 2015, the capital grants scheme has committed over $3 million to funding school infrastructure projects in Durack. This is indicative of the hard work being done to increase not just the gross amount of students studying but the quality and employability of the graduates who are coming out at the other side. This clearly demonstrates our commitment to building a new economy based on an educated and intelligent workforce. In fact, this government is committed to improving northern Australia through a wide variety of infrastructure projects which aim to improve the economic performance of the region. This is fantastic news for the electorate of Durack, which includes the entirety of the north-west of Western Australia. This government has committed $600 million for the improvement of roads throughout northern Australia, a much needed injection of capital that will improve accessibility to remote communities and foster regional growth even further. There is also an extra $200 million available for water infrastructure throughout northern Australia-much of which will come to the west, I am pleased to say. This government has demonstrated an effective and energetic response to the mining downturn, and I am sure the members present will be aware that my electorate was one of the hardest hit with respect to the downturn in the mining industry. But we are resilient and we progress. This government is committed to remaining financially responsible and managing this deficit with the care and consideration that is expected by us, by the taxpayers of Australia. These are the actions of a government that understands how a national economy functions and that encourages enterprises and entrepreneurs that demonstrate a forward-thinking and hard working attitude. In fact, one of the election commitments the Turnbull government made was a commitment to Indigenous entrepreneurship, and this government has tabled a $90",211,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
276,Opposition Members Interjecting,"million fund for Indigenous entrepreneurs seeking to give an equal opportunity to those innovative people in the Indigenous business sector. I thank Minister O'Dwyer for her hard work in developing regional infrastructure and future-proofing the economic stability of regional Australia, especially in my electorate of Durack. I ask the minister: what further action is the government taking to reduce spending growth and get the budget back to surplus? What real-world impact will this have on families and businesses in my electorate of Durack? What other progress is the government making(Time expired) Dr CHALMERS (Rankin) (12:15): Even this minister would appreciate that Australia has an underemployment problem, and that flows through to the budget. Minister, what is the current underemployment rate, and how does that compare historically? Ms O'DWYER (Higgins-Minister for Revenue and Financial Services) (12:15): I thank the members for their questions. Let me start by addressing the member for Griffith's question about the ASIC register. She has asked about the process that has been put in place and about the evaluation of the potential sale of the ASIC register-how that has been conducted and who has been consulted. Let me say that the government announced in the 2015-16 budget, following consideration of a scoping study, that it would undertake a competitive tender process to market test the capacity of a private operator to upgrade and operate the ASIC registry and to develop valueadded products. The government have always said that we would maintain ownership of ASIC's registry data. The government have also said that we are absolutely committed to open data in this government-absolutely committed. Before any decision is made about the sale of the ASIC register-and that decision would need to be made by cabinet-we would need to be completely sure that it met those very high standards we have set and that it would be in the national interest to do so. It is going through the evaluation process, and all relevant stakeholders have, in fact, been contacted for their views. Going to the member for Durack's question about spending, debt and deficits, she makes a very excellent point. She knows that, when the last coalition government-the HowardCostello government-was elected and came into government, they inherited a $96 billion black hole from the Labor Party. There was no money in the bank but, certainly, money needed to be paid back, and so that is what they did. They steadily worked away at repaying the $96 billion. answer to the question. Ms O'DWYER: They put money in the bank. They created the Future Fund, and more than $45 billion was put into that. It was not only that; they also had a Higher Education Endowment Fund, which, when those opposite came into government, they actually destroyed; they spent the money. So we have not been able to maintain the Higher Education Endowment Fund that was going to fund our universities well into the future. So what did we inherit from those opposite when we came into government? We inherited cumulative deficits of around $123 billion from those opposite, when in fact they had money",214,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

We have inherited cumulative deficits from them and a debt trajectory heading upwards to 122 per cent of GDP, which is very significant. Since coming into governmentDr Chalmers: It is embarrassing, even by your standards. answers. I ask members to be quiet while the minister is responding. Ms O'DWYER: It is always hard hearing the truth. I know that the member for Rankin feels very sensitive about this particular topic, because of course he was the former principal adviser to Wayne Swan, the former Treasurer. He was the brains trust behind these enormous budget deficits. He does not like the fact that, since coming into government in 2013, we have announced over 500 measures that improve the budget bottom line. These measures have improved the budget bottom line over the relevant forward estimates period by almost $100 billion. But our biggest challenge in government, in reining in spending, is those opposite. It is those opposite who believe that you can tax your way to prosperity. Of course, there is noone who would actually support this view. Our budget has been about focusing on better targeting and strengthening the integrity of our welfare system and making sure that the savings from those measures could actually go to the sustainability of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which I note those opposite had not actually funded. It is very easy to announce something, but it is actually very difficult to fund it. So we have taken the difficult decisions to ensure that it is not simply a cruel hoax on some of the most vulnerable people in our society. We have taken those decisions so that those people can be confident that the National Disability Insurance Scheme will be able to be delivered and delivered in full. It is only through our savings measures that we are able to ensure that that can occur. We have also been investing in roads, in rail and in other infrastructure which is very important. I do not have enough time now to go through all of the other measures. I look forward to the questions from those opposite. Dr CHALMERS (Rankin) (12:20): It is disappointing, but not entirely surprising, that when the minister is asked about underemployment in our society and in our community she has absolutely no idea. She does not know that in estimates this morning her own department was asked the same question. Her own department-the macrodivision of Treasury-said, 'The underemployment result in the August 2016 quarter is 8.7 per cent.' That is the highest result since the start of the series in 1978. We have the worse underemployment in Australian history on this statistical series, and this minister does not have a clue about it, despite the fact that her own department stood up a couple of hours ago and said this was a fact. As I said, this is disappointing, but not entirely surprising. This is a minister who is singlehandedly responsible for the biggest parliamentary gaffe since Federation. We should not be surprised. We should not be surprised when this minister, who struggles with even basic details like the underemployment rate, cannot do some of the more important things in her job. The first time this government were elected in 2013, they said their main task was to improve the budget bottom line. When they were re-elected in 2016 they said their main task was to give this $50 billion ram raid on the budget to big multinational corporations. Both of",215,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
279,Honourable Members Interjecting,,216,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
280,The Deputy Speaker,"Members have asked very good questions. I cannot hear thethose policy objectives, whether you agree with them or not, are now in tatters. When it comes to improving the bottom line, it has not dawned on those opposite yet, after three years in government, that the deficit and the debt have blown out substantially. It is disappointing, but, again, not entirely surprising that it has not dawned on those opposite. A couple of Fridays ago the government put out what is called the final budget outcome for the financial year just finished. They put it out on a Friday afternoon. There was no press conference from the Treasurer. There was not a word about it-just a sneaky little press release on a Friday afternoon, so ashamed were they of that outcome. Let me tell the chamber what that outcome was: the final budget outcome for the year just finished was $39.6 billion. That is a blowout eight times bigger than what was inherited. They stand up and they have the gall to talk about debt and deficit. The deficit has blown out substantially on their watch. This was supposed to be their reason for being, yet they have blown out the deficit substantially. They want to talk about debt. In the same final budget outcome net debt is blown out to $296 billion-$77 billion more than they inherited. They stand up and they talk about debt and deficit. I want to know from the minister: what will be the impact if this ineptitude leads to a downgrade in Australia's credit rating? What work has been done by the Treasury to understand the impacts of any downgrade? What would that mean for the people that we collectively represent? The second policy failure is, of course, the company tax cuts. The minister likes to raise my former employer-someone I am deeply, deeply proud of, having served us through the global financial crisis. You can say it over and over again. I am so proud to have worked for a Treasurer who did such a great job for Australia during the global financial crisis. Let's talk about former employers. I do not know if the minister has yet had the opportunity to check out The Financial Review. She raises former employers in this place on the day when her former employer Peter Costello, the former Treasurer, has torpedoed the centrepiece of their economic plan, which is the $50 billion ram raid on the budget-the $50 billion gift to big corporations in this country. Phil Coorey says in the paper: His determination came as former Liberal treasurer Peter Costello launched a broadside at the policy … saying the policy lacked funding, balance and coherence. I quote from Peter Costello: 'Well, company tax, whoopee do. Good luck to you. What else is there?' The problem for Australia is that there is nothing else whatsoever. You can say what you like about the finance minister, but he has a lot more credibility in this space than the minister opposite. When he was asked whether the company tax cut was the centrepiece of the government's so-called economic plan, Minister Cormann said: 'Just to remind ourselves, you are quite right, it is our centrepiece, not just of our budget but the centrepiece of our national economic plan, our plan for growth and jobs.' We know now that this plan is in tatters; Peter Costello is bagging it; the Senate looks likely to knock it over. SoI want to know: if this was the centrepiece of the government's jobs and growth plan and it is now in tatters-and if the other centrepiece was supposed to be budget repair and that it is tatters with these big budget blowouts-what now with the company tax cuts? Will you enact a humiliating backdown or will you stick to a policy which will hollow out schools and hospitals to give a big tax cut-a $50 billion ramraid-to the biggest multinational companies in this country? Ms O'DWYER (Higgins-Minister for Revenue and Financial Services) (12:25): I thank the member for Rankin for his question and I note that the member for Rankin wants to talk about former employers and that he is very proud of his. I also note that his former employer was not able once to deliver a surplus despite declaring that they had delivered surpluses. He was the apprentice to Wayne Swan the master; he is the boy wonder of budget deficits. I think his credibility on deficits is somewhat difficult. His record when he was chief of staff and principal adviser to Wayne Swan was the biggest deficit in cash terms in modern Australian history-$54.5 billion. That is the record of those opposite. He, of course, did say and those opposite have said many times over that they delivered surplusesRankin to resume his seat. The member for Rankin was heard in relative quiet. I literally cannot hear the minister's answer. I ask everyone to be a bit quieter so that we can hear the minister. Ms O'DWYER: I welcome the opportunity to talk about company tax cuts because I think it is important to also record that around 15 years ago we had a corporate tax rate which was the ninth lowest amongst advanced economies. Today it is the sixth highest out of 35 OECD countries. We know that in the global fight for capital and investment, we need to be globally competitive. That is why we have announced our Enterprise Tax Plan, which will put us on a globally competitive scale with all of the other advanced economies around the world and will allow us to continue to attract investment to this country. The member for Rankin asks why we would be doing this? I can tell you why. We would be doing this because we have received modelling that tells us-as he would know, because he is not as ignorant as he seems-it will deliver an increase in our level of GDP on a sustained basis. He knows that corporate tax cuts are expected to return a business investment of around 2.6 per cent in the long term. He also knows that two-thirds of the benefits of a lower corporate tax rate in Australia accrue to Australian households through higher real wages. You do not need to take my word for it-Ken Henry himself did say that, if the company income tax were to be cut, the principal beneficiaries would be workers. They say they care for workers and they say they are going to stand up for workers, and I would ask them to support our company tax cuts, if they truly believe what they say. The member opposite has also asked me about underemployment. I find it very curious that he neglected to mention the unemployment rate-the fact that the unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage point to be 5.6 per cent in August, which was better than the medium market expectation for the rate to remain steady at around 5.7 per cent. This is the lowest unemployment rate since September 2013, almost three years ago. It is very, very important that, since the election of this government, almost half a million jobs-about 490,000 jobs-have been created. Around 180,000 of those jobs have been created in the last 12 months. This is a government that believes it is important to create jobs. We believe it is important to encourage investment and we believe it is important to do that through our tax plan. In particular, we are encouraging small businesses, through the way that our tax plan operates, to make increased investments in their businesses. Through the cut to the company tax rate and through the equivalent tax discount that will be provided to unincorporated entities, they will be able to invest more in their business, to grow their",216,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
281,Honourable Members Interjecting,,218,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
282,The Deputy Speaker,"The minister will resume her seat. I ask the member forbusiness and to create more jobs in this country. Because, at the end of the day, that is what it is all about. Dr CHALMERS (Rankin) (12:30): I have two points. It speaks volumes about those opposite that one member-I hate to single people out-considers the steepest and sharpest synchronised downturn in the global economy since the global depression in the 1930s, the biggest downturn in eight decades, to be an excuse-some piece of trivia to be ignored. That is why they have a credibility problem over there. The second point I would like to make is to highlight, for the purposes of Hansard, the minister's big claim about the unemployment rate. Because she had not read her note before she started speaking, she said 'Look, we have gone so well that the unemployment rate is currently what we inherited from Labor in September 2013.' So her grand claim is: 'Look how well we have done; we have done as well as we inherited from Labor.' She really should read her stuff before she reads it out publicly. How embarrassing that the minister does not have a sense in her own mind-from her own community or from around the country-that we have a substantial underemployment problem in this country. Her Treasury officials understand this. They said at estimates, two hours ago, that the underemployment rate is the highest it has ever been-in my lifetime-since 1978. Since 1978, it has never been lower. It speaks volumes that the minister does not understand or appreciate this not just in a numerical sense but in a community sense. She does not understand that people are struggling to get the hours that they want. She then stands up and says, 'Hey, but our big defence is'-wait for it!-'the unemployment rate is so good, it's what Labor handed to us'. What a fizzer. We have spent a lot of time in the last week-not as much time as her colleagueslaughing about a minister who cannot vote for the right team in the parliament. That is one thing, and we have all had our fun-her own colleagues have had more fun with it than we have, frankly, with the whispered conversations on her side of the parliament. That is one thing, and people make mistakes. But it is another thing to really not understand the underemployment challenge and to quote back at us as if it were some great big policy achievement, with all the slogans about jobs and growth, that the unemployment rate-her chosen stat-is around the level that it was in the immediate aftermath of the GFC. That just speaks volumes. For a Treasury minister to not understand these basic things, to not have even a skerrick of a clue about underemployment or unemployment in this country-it is very troubling. If you take the politics out of it, I think most people on the street would like their cabinet ministers to have some understanding of the pressures that are in the labour market. That is my first set of points. My second point was ignored before-and I really am seeking information here, because this is a very important challenge for the country. If these blowouts in deficit and debt, which are in the government's own budget papers-they are not my opinion; they are the facts in the final budget outcome which were released. They are the facts in the budget papers that the Treasurer and the finance minister released. We know that at least one of the ratings agencies has said that they are concerned about the trajectory of the budget. In July, Standard& Poor's warned the government that there was a one-in-three chance our rating would be downgraded. Moody's said that, without revenue measures to help fix the budget, there would be a credit negative for Australia. There are a whole range of alarm bells ringing from the ratings agencies. I do not want to make a political point about this; there is an actual issue here with the ratings agencies because, as the minister would understand, I am sure, there are corresponding impacts. If the sovereign rating is downgraded then, in all likelihood, the banks will get downgraded as well. There are implications for borrowing costs. There are big implications, of course, for confidence in the economy. There are a range of implications. If one of those triple A credit ratings, which were won for the first time in our history from all three agencies under Labor-not under Peter Costello but actually under Wayne Swan-is downgraded, I would be very interested to know, as are the Australian people, what the consequences would be for our economy. Do you agree with the Treasury secretary, who said that there is no chance of a downgrade in the next 12 months? because the 2016-17 budget was one focused on supporting job creation and growing our economy. This is incredibly important when you look at electorates like mine of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast where we have more than 30,000 people who commute every day to jobs in Sydney and Newcastle. That is around a four-hour round trip each day. Around one in four adults in the workforce on the Central Coast leave their families early in the morning and return home late at night because they have to go where their jobs are. That means they need to juggle the demands of work, commuting and families. To help address these issues, I believe that we need a clear plan that works in close collaboration with the federal government, the New South Wales government, the council and the community to help address this. This was certainly highlighted last week in the Baird government's 20-year regional plan for the Central Coast which set out the state government's priorities for action and is a great blueprint for a vibrant sustainable region. One of the primary statistics used to drive this plan is the significant population growth. The document revealed that there will be more than 75,000 more people on the Central Coast by 2036, taking the population to well over 415,000. But the number of total jobs will rise from around 116,000 to 141,000, an increase of only 25,000. This underlines the need for more local jobs for local people on the Central Coast so that our region becomes not only the most beautiful place to work, live and visit but also a thriving hub of business and innovation that is driven by economic growth. This is particularly vital after six years of Labor which ended in 2013 when the then Labor government failed to deliver a clear plan for the Central Coast that could lay the economic foundation that our local families and businesses so desperately need. Under the coalition and the budgets that have been presented under this government, we are finally starting to see some projects delivered, business precincts established and Australian-first initiatives taking shape right in the heart of Gosford. For example, in the coalition's growth plan for the Central Coast in 2013 we committed to delivering 250 to 300 new government jobs in a Commonwealth agency building in Gosford. Then we doubled that to 600 jobs. We know that will boost the local economy, particularly for Gosford. Sadly, Labor and Labor aligned advocates on the Central Coast have, in a further determination that Gosford be held back, attacked this initiative. There has been a petition posted online in support of our initiative, to make sure that we see our region thrive, with community figures now determined to see our city transformed at last, while major business people are speaking up in local media about the need to bring our city into the 21st century.",218,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
283,Mrs Wicks (Robertson) (12:35,"I, too, want to ask a question about employment,I believe that this government is a central part of this invigoration, including the recent announcement of the Central Coast medical precinct task force, which builds on the $32.5 million commitment to a Central Coast medical school and medical research institute. The project is being delivered in partnership with all levels of government, the University of Newcastle, the Central Coast Local Health District and key stakeholder groups. With the key policy and determination from this government in the recent budget, we can build on this plan for our region. That is why I was so pleased to see some key initiatives announced in the budget, to be considered in detail here. Part of this is the Turnbull government's legislation to provide personal income tax relief which has passed the parliament, confirming 500,000 average full time wage earners across Australia will have more money in their pockets. This tax relief increases the middle-income tax bracket from $80,000 to $87,000, providing tax relief of up to $315 per year. To make it easier for businesses to expand and create more jobs, the budget proposes that the company tax rate be cut, with small and medium businesses benefiting first. It calls for small and medium businesses with annual turnover of less than $10 million to have their company tax rate cut to 27.5 per cent. This will reduce the tax rate for more than 5,000 companies in my electorate of Robertson. Since many small businesses are not companies, the government will also increase the unincorporated small business tax discount to eight per cent and extend the threshold from a turnover of $2 million to $5 million. This will enable more than 15,000 businesses in Robertson to access these concessions. But these changes must be part of a wider economic plan built on strong budget management, so my question to the minister is this: how does the 2016-17 budget, through these bills, promote jobs and growth? If the government's priority to repair the budget was not being pursued, what would be the alternative? Dr CHALMERS (Rankin) (12:40): I am conscious of time. If the company tax cuts are defeated in the Senate, will the government stick to them or will they abandon them? Ms O'DWYER (Higgins-Minister for Revenue and Financial Services) (12:40): I thank the member for his question and I thank the member for Robertson for her question as well. I know how committed she is to her electorate, to being a champion for her electorate and making sure that she can advocate particularly on behalf of those more than 5,000 small businesses that will be beneficiaries of our company tax cuts as well as the unincorporated businesses. Ninety-seven per cent of small businesses in this country are unincorporated, but they too will get the benefit through tax discounts. She has asked if there are any alternatives. Those opposite, of course, do not support our threshold change to the definition of small business. It has not been changed in a great number of years. They would keep it to less than $2 million in turnover; we are raising it to $10 million. Why would we do that? Because we do not want to put a handbrake on aspiration. We want people to be able to do well. Those opposite would like to penalise them. We think it is a good thing when people do well, because when they do well they can grow more. When they grow more, they can encourage even more employment. The member for Robertson has seen that in her own electorate; in fact, I had the opportunity to visit a number of small businesses in her electorate not so long ago. She also talks about the benefit of personal income tax cuts and stopping people from going into a higher tax bracket. Again, that is because we believe it is important not to penalise people for doing well. We believe it is important to give them a hand up and we think it is completely ridiculous to think that, in the next 10 years, the majority of Australians will be in the top two tax brackets, unless we do something about it. So it is our down payment on how we can reduce the personal income tax rates for those people. The member opposite wants to talk about embarrassing moments, speaking about personal income tax rates. When Chris Bowen was the shadow Treasurer, he was asked about personal income tax rates-something that affects absolutely every single Australian in this country. He could not name the tax-free threshold when he was asked by Alan Jones whether or not he could nominate the next tax rate. He took a guess at 15 per cent and, of course, had to be put out of his misery and be told that it was, in fact, 19 per cent. Those opposite have no credibility on these issues and they should not stand in the way of company tax cuts that will benefit small business in this country. He asks me whether or not we are going to proceed with these changes. I would say instead to him: why is it that the Labor Party is so committed to blockingDr Chalmers interjectingMs O'DWYER: It is only dead if you block it. Dr Chalmers interjectingMs O'DWYER: It is only dead if you block it, and you need to be able to look the Australian people in the face and say to them why it is that you stand in the way of small business, why you stand in the way of prosperity for the Australian people and why it is that you will block their aspiration, because it is Labor that is doing that. This side of the House believes it is very important to encourage small business. Those opposite want to put a handbrake on small business and they think the answer to every question is simply to further and further increase taxes. We say it is importantDr Chalmers interjectingMs O'DWYER: Ratings agencies? I am very happy to speak about ratings agencies. Those opposite would be very, very well aware that we need to get our spending under control in order to satisfy the ratings agencies, and the biggest blocker to getting spending under control, again, is those opposite. While we did have some assistance with the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill, frankly, that was not enough. Because of the debt trajectory that we were left with and because of the baked-in spending from those opposite, it was critically important that we address and arrest the spending, and those opposite have been complete blockers. expired.

It was a very high profile trip and a notable announcement, and you got to spend time with the President of the United States, no doubt. Only this week during Senate estimates representatives from your very own department confirmed that it was the lead agency in the refugee deal and it was 'very involved' in the process, to quote them. Yet when it came to the details of the refugee deal, your department was unable to answer a single question on the basics of the agreement between the Australian government and the United States government. Minister, given your department was not able to answer basic questions, can you please shed light on the following. What was your personal involvement and role in the development of the refugee deal? When did the negotiations start for this agreement? When was the deal actually reached by the Australian government with the American government? When will refugees start to arrive in Australia? By when will they all have arrived? The department said there will be a small number of refugees, but precisely how many refugees will arrive in Australia? When did the department brief you on the deal? How long will the deal actually last? Tell us about the duration of the deal. What will be the cost to the Australian taxpayer? Will this impact on the overall intake, or is it included in the 18,750 commitment you reannounced in the United States of America? Do you have any other pay-to-play deals in the offing? Minister, unlike the department, do you know the answers to these questions and will you give them today? see you here. I know how busy you are and what an effective job you are doing in your portfolio. The Immigration and Border Protection portfolio has a direct influence on things that happen in my electorate, and the coalition's success in stopping the boats has definitely had successful flow-on effects in my electorate of Swan. The success of the Operation Sovereign Borders means that the Perth Immigration Residential Housing, which was based in Redcliffe in my electorate in Western Australia can now be closed. This is on track to happen by the end of this year. This facility was first opened in April 2007. As part of the federal budget, the Turnbull government announced that the Redcliffe housing would be one of the four detention facilities in Australia to close, saving $39.1 million over four years, which enhances the budget, of course. This is just one of the many success stories that show how stopping the boats has had dividends for the nation's finances. It is also a reminder of the importance of border security to this country. Our border security is one of the finest in the world, protecting Australia not just against illegal arrivals but also from numerous other threats such as drugs, weapons and fire arms. I have had the good fortune to go out to Perth airport and see the massive amount of illegal weapons, drugs and other things that have been taken by customs agents during their processing of packages coming into Australia. Two days ago we received news that the Australian Border Force in Western Australia had actually intercepted an international mail package from China. Contained in this package were 335 vials of performanceand image-enhancing drugs. The Border Force investigators",222,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

Minister, this highlights the Border Force's commitment to protecting Australia from all types of threats. This government's ability to close the Perth Immigration Residential Housing at Redcliffe is also a reminder of the unthinkable chaos that occurred when the previous Labor government weakened Australia's borders, leading to 50,000 illegal arrivals on 800 boats and to over 1,200 deaths at sea. Minister, under Labor, 10,000 people, including 2,000 children, entered detention. In the September update of Operation Sovereign Borders, no illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to Australian immigration authorities and no illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to the regional processing centres. Stopping the people smugglers has been a key part of our border security. Indonesian authorities recently arrested one person for their alleged facilitator involvement in people-smuggling activities. The coalition works with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to continue the delivery of counter-people-smuggling efforts with counterpart agencies in Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. We also have Australian Border Force officers posted to these places to coordinate efforts to keep people smugglers at bay-and people smugglers they are. In 2008, when I first came into parliament, I attended a citizenship ceremony and met with one of the refugees from Afghanistan. His particular story was as follows. When I asked him how he got to Australia, he said he had arrived by boat during the Howard years. It was one of the three boats that arrived after the policy on turning the boats back was implemented. I asked him, 'How did you find the people smugglers?' He said: 'I didn't find the people smugglers. They actually came to our village and promised that they could get us into Australia.' I said, 'What did that cost you?' He said, 'It cost US$10,000.' I said, 'Did you weigh up the risks?' He said, 'Yeah, it was quite risky, but the people smugglers assured us they could get us into Australia.' So he paid the $10,000 and eventually arrived in Australia on one of the three boats that actually got into Australia. At the end, I said, 'So you found a way to beat the system.' He agreed, 'Yes, we did find a way to beat the system.' That is a story from one of the refugees who came in at that time, actually confirming that it is the people smugglers' trade and nothing more than that. Minister, by stopping these boats and the people smugglers, this coalition has stopped the flow of illegal arrivals into detention centres. There is broad support for a strong immigration program in this country, as long as it is through legal means. I know we still have a few people in Nauru and on Manus, but we have reduced those numbers. There are only 873 people in the Manus Regional Processing Centre and even fewer people in the Nauru Regional Processing Centre-well below the 10,000 people whom Labor put in detention. Minister, if you get a chance, I would like you to comment on the article today in The Australian regarding the ABC and the havoc they are causing on Nauru by making false allegations. Also, how has the government been able, in our budget, to close more detention centres? high-performance vessels would be delivered to Cairns in September 2016. We have seen September come and go, and, clearly, no vessels have been delivered-another broken promise. It was recently revealed that the delivery of those vessels would be delayed till mid-",223,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
288,Mr Neumann (Blair) (12:52,"Minister, in December 2015, you announced two new2017. The federal member for Leichhardt was quoted in a WIN News Cairns interview as saying, concerning these vessels: 'I've checked on it to find there have been some production glitches.' The role of the Australian Border Force is significant in the region, particularly in Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait, ensuring the border is protected and that illegal fishers cannot exploit our waters-not to mention the other roles the Australia Border Force play. Minister, I am keen for you to explain to the people of Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait: what were those production glitches, will those glitches impact on the effectiveness of the vessels, what was the cost of these vessels and will the delays result in additional expenses? The two vessels are being produced in the United States of America. Has the department purchased other vessels from the company in the United States before? What operations were those two vessels to undertake, precisely? Has the delay in delivering these two vessels resulted in any gaps in the Australian Border Force network in Far North Queensland, North Queensland or the Torres Strait? If so, how is that gap being managed? Thank you for the opportunity to be here in the Federation Chamber. I want to say thank you to other colleagues, including the shadow minister, here today. There are a number of issues that have been raised. To go to the first directly: it is true that the Prime Minister and I had a very productive trip to the United States only a few weeks ago. There, we were able to talk about the success that Australia had enjoyed over the course of the last several years in stopping deaths at sea. One of the proudest achievements of this government is that we have been able to clean up a mess of Labor's making: 50,000 people arrived in 800 boats. Labor has apologised for that, and we welcome that apology, but it seems that they have not learned from the lesson, because their policy, ultimately, has not changed. If they were elected tomorrow, the difficulty for Labor is that the boats would recommence, because the people smugglers can sniff out a weak Labor leader 10,000 miles away. They did it with Rudd, they did it with Gillard and they are doing it again with Mr Shorten. The poisoned chalice has been handed to the member for Blair. Mr Neumann presides, along with the Leader of the Opposition, over an opposition which is squarely divided when it comes to this important issue. We can go through each of the contributions of members on the backbench who would add to the failure which they would again preside over, if they were to come back into government. It is a very important point to make because, when we went the United States, we were able to talk about the successes-and there are many European nations who have a lot of interest in the success that Australia has been able to achieve. My department has worked with some of those agencies and some of those countries to work through not just the success that we have had in Operation Sovereign Borders but also the intelligence picture that sits beneath that. There are 16 agencies that are involved in Operation Sovereign Borders, and they work together and they work well. We have diplomatic engagement with a number of countries, which has resulted in significant success. The point of that is that we have had, as part of that success, interaction with countries, including the United States. It is why we took a decision to support the United States in relation to the settlement of a limited number of people under the program that the honourable member opposite spoke of in his contribution.",224,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
289,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (12:54):To answer his question directly, I was advised of and approved the arrangement in August of this year. It was well thought through because, in the end, regardless of what referrals are made to us by the United Nations through the UNHCR process or any other process in terms of the humanitarian and refugee program, we will conduct our own health checks and our own security and intelligence checks in relation to individuals before people arrive in this country. It is the case that, in July of this year, the government of Costa Rica announced that it had agreed to enter into a protection transfer arrangement, a PTA, with the UNHCR and IOMboth very important partners for our country. They wanted to help address a regional migration challenge. It is the case that the US, in coordination with the UNHCR and IOM, committed to prescreening protection applicants from the region. Those applicants determined to be most in need will be transferred from Costa Rica for processing. They include refugees from Central America who are seeking international protection from kidnappings, human trafficking, family violence and targeted killings against their communities by known gangs. We have received a lot of assistance from the United States-particularly, I might say, and it is worth noting, in relation to the intake of refugees from Syria. We have relied necessarily on the United States and that partnership to deal with the security checks that we asked to be undertaken so that we did not end up with the sorts of problems that we have seen in Europe. We have scrutinised every application to the best of our ability. We have done that with the support of the United States and with the support of our Five Eyes partners. We have been able to go through a process which, I think, has resulted in a better intake in terms of the Syrian refugees. For all of these reasons, because we have a very close working relationship with IOM and with the UNHCR, we did take a decision in relation to the Costa Rica scenario-and it is within the existing program, so there is no additional cost-that I think would enjoy bipartisan support. There is no secret to the process, there is no secret to the detail. Costa Rica, the United States and Australia have been very transparent about the process, and it was an important summit that President Obama put together. Prime Minister Turnbull was able to talk about the success in not only stopping boats but also bringing in a record number of refugees. I am happy to add to that, if necessary. about asylum seekers and refugees, but I want to switch the topic to another area of your portfolio, in relation to temporary workers and temporary work visas. I am talking about backpacker 417 and 462 visas, about skilled migration and skilled temporary worker 457 visas; and about international students. There are about 1.3 million people in this country on temporary work visa arrangements. That is a lot of people to have in our country. Do we know at this moment where they are and where they are working? Do we know where every one of these 1.3 million people is working? Leaving aside the favourite topic of the government, do we really have control of our borders when it comes to temporary workers who are in this country? There are about 200,000 people in Australia on a 417 visa at the moment. I bring to the minister's attention a report into the 417 visa working holiday program, which was released by the Fair Work Ombudsman on the weekend. Some of the findings in the report were quite damning. I would like to know the minister's comments on how the",225,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
290,Ms Chesters (Bendigo) (12:59,"Minster, I know the government likes to talk a lotgovernment is going to follow up those findings, particularly those in relation to the 417 visa and the treatment of people here on this visa. The report says: As a consequence, the Inquiry found the 417 visa program created an environment where:  unreasonable and unlawful requirements are being imposed on visa holders by unscrupulous businesses  exploitative workforce cultures / behaviours are occurring in isolated and remote workplaces  employers are making unlawful deductions from visa holders’ wages, or are unlawfully requiring employees to spend part or all of their wages in an unreasonable manner. This is treatment of people who are here on a visa. Minister, I want to know specifically whether you believe that this could be a case of visa fraud, where 14 per cent of people surveyed had to pay to secure regional work and six per cent had to pay their employee to sign-off on regional work. How does this interact with your department? Specifically, do we have a case of unscrupulous businesses requiring backpackers to pay for visas in terms of employment? The report highlights that visa holders from Asian countries are more likely to have a low awareness of workplace rights, are more likely to have money deducted from their pay without verbal or written consent, are more likely to have paid to obtain a second-year visa and are more likely to paid an agent to secure regional work to meet the eligibility requirements. Is the department going to provide information to such workers when they enter this country to let them know what their rights are? Such behaviours are grossly undermining this visa program if people have to pay for it in an unscrupulous way. This report is damning on the 88-day regional requirements that we have with this visa. The report's findings are damning and it paints the visa program as exploitative. Minister, what is the plan to clean this up? Why has there been such a delay about in previous years? This is not the first report on the problems with this class of visa. There have been media reports and government reports-time and time again. The Fair Work Ombudsman in its report said it has a problem with this class of visa. When will the government clean up this visa and make sure that it is fixed? I have further questions that I want to put to the minister, in relation not just to the 417 visa but to all visa holders. There was the tragic death of a backpacker last Monday. She was working on a workplace and she fell to her death. There was also a tragedy, 12 months earlier, when two other backpackers died at their workplace. Minister, there have already been, sadly, 132 fatalities in Australian workplaces. Just how many of those were visa holders? How many of them are visa holders working here in unsafe working conditions? My final question relates to 457 visas, and the companies and the people responsible-the assessing authorities. How much money are they making from assessing people on these visas. I am talking about the AMA and Engineers Australia. Just how much money are they making from people applying for 457 visas? Is there a conflict of interest between these organisations, the department and the people applying? (Time expired) address a couple of the issues that the member for Bendigo has raised. In relation to 457 visas, it was a great script from which she read-it would have been great had she attributed it to the union boss that sent it to her; nonetheless, I am happy to do my best to respond to it. The 457",226,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
291,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (13:04): I willvisas are quite an interesting study, because the point missed out in the script from the union, honourably read by the member for Bendigo, is that we have seen a dramatic reduction in the number of 457s under this government compared to Labor's period in government. It is a point that the Labor Party continues to brush over. The same arrangements that applied under the Labor Party apply under this government. If there is a problem with the system I would be happy to hear from the honourable member, but the reality is that the number of 457 visas has dropped dramatically. If the honourable member has questions of particular organisations in relation to their own private affairs, then I suggest she go back to the union and asks them to make those inquiries specifically with those organisations themselves. Similarly, in relation to 417 visas, working holiday visas, we are happy to act on information that honourable members can provide. There is a considerable amount of work being undertaken, including in relation to Taskforce Cadena. It is telling that the member for Bendigo, having delivered her script, done her work, done her bidding on behalf of the union bosses, now leaves the chamber. The issue of vessels in North Queensland has been raised. The ABF is currently acquiring two fast response boats from SAFE Boats International through a foreign military sale arrangement with the United States Coast Guard-and that speaks to the reliability of this particular provider and the background to this provider. They are a world-class provider of these sorts of vessels. The vessels will give the ABF access to highly specialised vessels of a proven design suitable for border protection, and they will build on the assets both on the water and aerial that we have at the moment in the Torres Strait, which is an incredibly important zone for us in relation not just to boats but to illegal fishers as well. I acknowledge the incredible work done by the member for Leichhardt and his continuing advocacy. It is very pleasing to see that he continues to push in these important areas. I come back to the contribution of my good friend Mr Irons. He has an impressive interest in these areas, and it is the case, as we have documented before, that Labor opened 17 detention centres and this government is closing 17 detention centres. When we came into government Labor had had 2,000 children in detention, and we have got those children out of detention. We have been able to reduce the numbers of IMAs in detention dramatically. We have been able to continue that success because we have not had new arrivals. It is very clear that, had Labor been successful at the last election, by now the boats would already have recommenced. There is no doubt about that, because they see Labor as weak and divided. They saw it during the election, and that is the reason the Leader of the Opposition sought not to speak about this at all. The reality is that we have not had new arrivals-it has been well over 800 days since we have had a successful people-smuggling venture-and that means we can keep people out of detention. We are as a government, as I have said on numerous occasions, working with a number of third countries because we do want, as a priority, to get women and children and family units off Nauru. We want to do that because people have been there too long, and it is the case that we have built up success in stopping people smugglers, in breaking their business model, in convincing would be passengers that it is not worth paying their money, and because of that success we can enter into discussions about implementing this in a way that will not result in new arrivals. There is a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes but, to go to the member's question directly, we have been able to close a number of centres. I will make some other points shortly when I have a little more time. Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (13:09): Minister, my first question relates to the extra 12,000 places that were promised to refugees fleeing the conflict in Iraq and Syria, and I commend the government for their decision in relation to that. Today, reports indicate that around 4,000 people have actually arrived in Australia. Canada, during the same time period, has resettled more than 30,000 Syrian refugees. Effectively, they have done that in the same period that we have resettled 4,000 refugees. Why is it taking the Australian government so long to meet their commitment, and what instructions have responsible ministers issued to the department which bear on the rate in which Syrian refugees are being processed to meet the target? I would like to ask the minister: will your government be considering a one-off amnesty for people who have been found to be genuine refugees on Manus and Nauru, and will you consider some sort of program for them to settle in New Zealand or Canada which, I understand, are two countries that are welcome to take refugees, as in refugees that we have responsibility for? My understanding is that Canada has a scheme that will allow families in Canada to billet, to sponsor, refugee families, particularly families from Syria. Will our government consider the option of a similar program for families here in Australia? That would assist refugee families to more easily connect with the Australian community and would, I am sure, considerably reduce the cost of resettlement. Minister, I would like to ask you: in relation to the children and young people on Nauru, could you give some details in relation to the engagement of those children in education? My understanding, from certain reports that I have read, is that there are lower rates of engagement for children who are studying, children who have since moved from studying within the detention centre to out in the community, and that they are not going to school for a number of reasons. Will your government commit to ending the long-term detention of the children on Nauru? We understand that the gates are open in the detention centre; however, these children are in a camp. They are not in homes-homes that your children, that my children, live in. They are not in an environment that is conducive to learning, to having a good quality of life; an environment that is conducive to good well-being and the kinds of opportunities that our children in Australia have-to go to university, to study further. I would like to ask what the plans are to get those children off Nauru. Finally, Minister, I would like to ask you about transparency. My party is very focused on transparency, so my question relates to the freedom of the press. My understanding is that, thus far, only A Current Affair and journalist Chris Kenny have had the opportunity to attend Manus Island and Nauru, so I would like to ask: have Fairfax, Huffington, The Guardian, the ABC or any other media outlets made contact with your department to seek to go to Nauru and/or Manus Island, and what were the answers from you in relation to that-did you approve such requests? wishes to, he can respond after batches of two or three speakers. is a fair amount of content in the honourable member's question, and I want to do justice to the reply. The honourable member first raised the issue of the Syrian intake. As a general comment, let me say that, as the United Nations has pointed out, there are 65 million people",227,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
292,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Georganas,"CanI remind the minister that, if he",229,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
293,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (13:14): Therein the world who are displaced and would seek to come to start a better life in our country tomorrow. That is understandable for a number of reasons. In Syria, for example, there are 6½ million people who are displaced, and the thought that a country like Australia-or even the United States, the United Kingdom or France-could take all of those people is just not realistic. So Australia has announced that we would take 12,000 people as part of an international effort, which put us-even in real terms, but certainly on a per capita basispretty close to the top of the tree. Each year, along with the United States and Canada, we settle more people-again, in real terms and on a per capita basis-than almost any other country in the world. So there is a lot for us to be very proud of. The first charge for me as the minister responsible for immigration and border protection is to make sure that I protect our own people. As we have seen in Belgium, as we have seen in Germany only in the last fortnight and as we have seen in France and elsewhere, people are passing themselves off as refugees when really that is not their background and it is not who they are. They are going to cause disruption and we are not going to allow that to happen in our program. I am not making any other comment about other countries' screening processes or the way in which they have conducted their intake, but it is the case that because we have been scrupulous about each of the applications that have been made we have discovered people of national security interest and risk. I think, had we not conducted the thoroughness of the process, we would have ended up with some of those people here. The difficulty for all of us in the modern age, and this will be with us for our lifetimes, is that it just takes one person who has crossed our border with ill intent to go into a shopping centre or public place or-speaking of our children-playground or school or somewhere else. We have seen this overseas. The tragedy of such circumstances carried out would not only disrupt and destroy lives but also undermine the confidence the Australian people have in the intake of migrants into this country. What all of the longitudinal work shows is that the Australian public's confidence in an increased number of migrants coming into this country each year tracks very closely to the government of the day's competence in maintaining control of our borders. So we have been meticulous in the process and we have been able to bring people in. I am advised that between 1 July 2015 and 7 October this year 14,047 visas have been granted. There are the 12,000 within the program, but within the 13,750 base program we already have 4,850 who come from Syria and Iraq-8,313 of those go towards the additional 12,000 places, and there are 884 under the 2016-17 humanitarian program. In this time, 10,244 people have arrived in Australia-5,235 as part of the additional 12,000 places and 1,816 arrivals in 2016-17. As at 7 October, a further 6,126 people have been interviewed and assessed as meeting the threshold requirements for a visa and are awaiting the outcomes of health, character and/or security checks. So the program is going well, but we are not going to rush it. We were encouraged by the Labor Party early on to push through this program and get these people here. We have been very clear-I was very clear to our people in the posts as I have been to the officers within the department here-that we are not going to compromise, (a) because we have the potential of bringing a security risk in and (b) because we would displace somebody who was actually a refugee and deserving of that place and would be left to languish. In relation to the matters on Nauru, as I have said before, we are absolutely determinednow that we have stopped boats, we have the situation under control and we have the assets and the political determination to deal with this threat ongoing-to get women, children and family units off Nauru. It is the absolute priority of me, the Prime Minister and the government. We have no control over who Nauru issues visas to, as the honourable member would well know. I do not accept advice from the New Zealand minister or from the PNG minister about who I should issue visas to, and this is entirely an issue for the government of Nauru. I would mention that of course the arrangement was set up in 2012 under Prime Minister Gillard. We have tidied up that mess. We have stopped the 1,000 people a week arriving on boats and we have presided over a much more humane arrangement than Labor set up in the first place. (Time expired) with us today to answer questions. The global political economy is amidst a period of heightened volatility as major conflicts are causing upheaval the world over. As I speak today, there are about 10 major wars raging around the world, with the Syrian civil war alone causing over 1,000 deaths every single week. Due to such conflicts and the persecutions, the violence and the human rights abuses they create, we have about-and the minister said it-65 million displaced people around the world today: 65 million people!-of which, according to UNHCR, over 15 million are refugees and 10 million are stateless. That is the largest number ever, even larger than postWorld War II. This is a sad and miserable fact, and a symptom, if you like, of those major conflicts that are causing upheaval. Now, Australia, as we know, is one of the few countries in the world that has a planned resettlement program that proactively goes out and selects the most vulnerable people in the world and resettles them here in Australia. No matter how much media noise or activist politics from the Left surround our immigration regime, the fact remains that Australia's record is something we should all be very proud of. Australians are an open, tolerant and generous people. We know our history, and that all of us, except our Indigenous peoples-our first peoples-are relatively newcomers. That includes me, with a mix of convict blood and free settler blood. As a nation and as a people, we naturally want to help those who are more vulnerable than ourselves. But we are also a pragmatic lot; I have never heard any Australian suggest that we should invite all 21 million refugees to settle here in Australia, nor that we should invite all 65 million displaced people here to take refuge. While we want to do all that we can, there will always be a limit to the resources that we can commit to and how many people can emigrate. A social compact has emerged over time, and it is a simple one that reflects a correlation between how well the government manages our borders and the people's appetite for new immigrants. This is where Labor got it so drastically wrong in losing control of our borders. They oversaw a humanitarian disaster that resulted from Australia's greatest public policy bungle, certainly in my lifetime, with 50,000 people arriving on 800 boats and over 1,200-at least, those we know about-who lost their lives at sea. Restoring integrity in the system has fallen to the coalition government, and it has done so. It has restored integrity with a range of measures, and none more important than stopping the boats. Restoring control to our borders requires (1) Labor's mess to be fixed and, (2) building",229,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
294,Mr Ted O'brien (Fairfax) (13:19,"I am delighted to have the minister in the roomnew capacity so that our humanitarian intake may increase. These two challenges are not mutually exclusive. Rather, that they are sequential and interdependent-one is a prerequisite for the other, if you like. Only by fixing Labor's mess and stopping the boats can confidence and trust in the system be rebuilt, for the greater our control over our sovereign borders the greater our capacity as a nation to extend compassion to those in the world who are indeed the most needy. And it is within this context that I wish to ask the minister the following question: Minister, how has stopping the boats helped restore integrity to our humanitarian intake? thank the honourable member very much. He is doing a fine job as the new member for Fairfax, and he is making an enormous contribution to this debate because, like all Australians, he wants to make sure that we continue the generosity and that we continue the support to new families who come to our country, in many cases from very difficult circumstances. As a government, we do have a lot to be very proud of and as a country we have a lot to be very proud of. We have been able to stand up, along with world leaders, and point out the number of people who we do take through the refugee and humanitarian program. And there are a lot of Australians who are very interested in this topic, from both sides of the debate. There are people who argue that we should take fewer and there are people who argue that we should take more. I would point all of those people to the information which details, country by country, the number of refugees taken in by Australia and those taken in by countries like France, Germany and many others I think Australians would be surprised at how far up that list we sit. And, in addition to the 13,750 people we will take through the humanitarian and refugee program this year-and we have committed to the 12,000 Syrians, as the honourable member noted in his contributionwe will take 16,250 next year and 18,750 in 2018-19. Between1 July 2015 and 7 October 2016, as I have pointed out before, 14,000 visas were granted to people displaced by conflict in Syria and Iraq alone. Our country has a very significant relationship with IOM and UNHCR, as I pointed out before, but we also have a very important relationship with many communities here in our country. Many communities have established themselves through the contribution of a number of families who, over one or two or more generations, have been able to contribute philanthropically to the betterment of their own communities. They are now in a position to sponsor people coming to our country through the refugee and humanitarian program. We are very proud to be able to work with those communities, and it is part of the success that we have had in settling almost 850,000 people as refugees since the end of the Second World War. It is a considerable part of the fabric of today's Australian society, and we have the ability to contribute more to that. As the member for Fairfax rightly points out, the Australian public will only support generosity where they see a competent government in control of the process and not being dictated to by people smugglers. One of the most shameful periods of our country's history was during Labor's period in government when we lost control of our borders and 1,200 people tragically drowned at sea. I am very proud that we have not had one person drown at sea since the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders. We have been able to get",231,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
295,Mr Dutton (Dickson,"Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (13:23): Ichildren out of detention and we have been able to bring in a record number of people through the refugee and humanitarian programs-and long may that be the case. Labor's policy disaster was evidenced by the fact that they reached into the Humanitarian Program to use places which would otherwise have provided support to people out of wartorn countries to settle people who had arrived by boat-economic refugees. It demonstrated the corruptness of Labor's process and it demonstrated why, in this debate even today, they do not have the credibility to talk about what they might do tomorrow. They are completely and utterly divided. The people smugglers have this worked out. We saw it reported in the run-up to the election that people smugglers were rubbing their hands together, anticipating the return of a Labor government and a weak Prime Minister in Shorten following weak prime ministers in Gillard and Rudd. That is the reality. Labor's inability to accept this underscores that they still have not learnt the lesson. The member for Blair has been passed the poison chalice, and I think Mr Marles was happy to run from this portfolio at a thousand miles an hour. It is only the coalition government that can maintain the integrity we have within the humanitarian and refugee programs. We will continue to work with other countries and organisations to make sure that we deliver the best possible outcomes for those most deserving, so that they can restart their lives in this great country. asylum seekers on Manus and Nauru have been there too long. I agree with him on that. But you have been in power for three years and you have failed to find a durable third-party resettlement option. Minister, yesterday you said: We have been working around the world with third countries to try and find options … every day we get closer to it. I note you have not done it in the last three years you have been in power. There has been three years of doing nothing. Where are the negotiations up to? Who are you negotiating with? Which countries? Have you been working with the UNHCR? You have given us no details about that today. If you have been negotiating, in what manner? When will you tell the public what you are actually doing and when will we get these people into durable third-party countries? is such an important issue to the honourable member opposite that, in fact, he has never asked me a question in question time.

Why do we need these arrangements? Because Labor undid the arrangements when they came into government in 2007. There were four people in detention, including no children, when John Howard left office in 2007 and then there were 50,000 who arrived on 800 boats. It is unbelievable.

He admitted that there was an undoing of the successful Howard government arrangements and he at least had the ability, which is not demonstrated here at all and is reinforced again today by the shadow minister, that he could ask questions and conduct himself in a way that was not a threat to these prospective arrangements. This shadow minister today has demonstrated that he is clearly a threat to prospective arrangements. Asking us today to publicly talk about where sensitive negotiations might be at at this point in time, asking us to disclose who it is we are talking to-having no regard to the interests of whoever that particular partner might be-demonstrates that he does not have the ability to carry out this portfolio in government.

Half of Labor's backbench demonstrate that this Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, has no ability to show the leadership required to send a purposeful and definite and clear message to people smugglers that if there was a Labor government in this country that somehow they would not allow the boats to restart. Because if you allow a crushing of one of the successful legs of Operation Sovereign Borders-that is, the operation of regional processing centres-and if you allow people smugglers, as Labor would, to say to people, 'We have again cracked the code to get people to Australia,' you would end up with deaths at sea again. You would end up with 2,000 kids in jail and those opposite should be ashamed of their track record. Proposed expenditure agreed to.

There was of course an independent assessment of his conduct by a former Federal Court judge, appointed by the Minister for Employment, to look into whether in fact he had been in breach of his duties as vice president over the most recent years. I will just remind the House that of course Vice President Lawler was appointed to the Fair Work Commission at the time when the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, was the Minister for Employment in the Howard government. So Mr Lawler was a long standing commissioner of the Fair Work Commission and there were some questions around his performance and him discharging his responsibilities as a vice president of the Fair Work Commission. We are seeking to have the information about his entitlements disclosed publicly. We do know, of course, that the former Federal Court judge found that he was in breach of his duties as a vice president in his report, commissioned by the Minister for Employment. Then the vice president subsequently made a decision to resign, so no action had to be taken either by the parliament or by some other means. However, on 16 March, on behalf of the federal opposition I sought to have information about the entitlements that Mr Lawler will be afforded, given his resignation. I asked then that the minister immediately disclose such matters in the public interest. We said at the time that the public has a right to know the difference in the entitlements Mr Lawler will receive as a result of his resignation, rather than being dismissed. I sought at the time, and it is enclosed within the letter, that the Minister for Employment responded to the matters raised in the report that relate to the application for leave and termination proceedings in order to prevent a matter of this nature rising again. We have not",234,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
311,Mr Brendan O'connor (Gorton) (16:01,"I just want to refer to a letter I sent to thereally been provided with such information and we thought it was an opportunity today for the government to provide that information. We think it is in the public interest that a most senior officer of the Fair Work Commission-in fact, arguably, the second-most senior officer of the Fair Work Commission-who was found to be in breach or in dereliction of his obligations as an officer who has subsequently resigned, be required to publicly disclose his entitlements upon that resignation. We believe that the minister would be aware of the details of such entitlements afforded to Mr Lawler and yet, despite the letter of 16 March from me to the minister, we have not been in receipt of any information and would ask the minister at the table, the minister acting on behalf of the Minister for Employment, to provide answers to this question-namely, what are the details of the entitlements afforded to Mr Lawler upon his resignation? thank the member for acknowledging that my portfolio of course is Defence Industry, not employment, but I do represent the Minister for Employment here. The member asked a serious question, and I am prepared to give him a serious answer. He most recently on 21 September issued a press release asking for the details of Mr Lawler's entitlements to be disclosed. I can tell him that the Department of Finance has confirmed that Mr Lawler's application for a judicial pension is under consideration, and that is a question better put to the Minister for Finance or his representative in this place. We understand that, following Mr Lawler's resignation, the Fair Work Commission paid him the amounts to which he was legally entitled in accordance with the terms of his appointment-in other words, a prorataed, pro-rated remuneration amount and payment in lieu of long service leave. more substantial matter in so far as public policy is concerned: today the House passed the registered organisation legislation, or proposed legislation, and the opposition moved some significant amendments to that bill. In December last year, the Labor leader and I announced a suite of reforms in relation to registered organisations, and those announcements informed the amendments that we foreshadowed today. Unfortunately, given the procedural motion supported by the government, there was not an opportunity for many members to contribute and there was no opportunity for me, in consideration in detail, to ask the government the questions in relation to the amendments that we were looking to move. So, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, I just want to touch on them, if I could go through the more important amendments proposed. Firstly, the federal opposition believe that we can support a new way of regulating registered organisations in so far as serious breaches are concerned. We have suggested that, rather than establish a separate commission to regulate registered organisations, we believe that ASIC, a mature and significant regulator, would be better charged with the responsibility to regulate the conduct of officers of registered organisations. For that reason, we propose that rather than the so called ROC being established, we would rather see ASIC be the regulator. We believe it is likely a mature regulator that is highly respected in the community that currently regulates and examines whether in fact there is misconduct by companies is better placed to also regulate employer bodies and unions. For many years now, the government have been saying-rhetorically, at least-that they want the same set of laws and forms of regulations that apply to companies to apply to",235,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

313,Mr Brendan O'connor (Gorton) (16:07,"I thank the minister. Just turning to aregistered organisations. In fact, I have heard many government members rhetorically argue that that should be the case. How could there be a better way of ensuring equality before the law, if you like, than having the same regulator regulate registered organisations that regulates companies? We also believe that it is far less likely that any government-this one or any future government-would interfere with the running of ASIC in the way in which they may interfere with this smaller body that is being proposed by the government. So we would like to hear from the government as to whether they are seriously entertaining that amendment and whether, in fact, they can see the merits in allowing that an existing regulator that has been around for a very long time and that has a corporate memory in dealing with such matters could be the better regulator, as opposed to setting up an entirely new bureaucracy to deal with the regulation of registered organisations. That is one point. I also ask the minister about some of the proposed amendments that we will be making when the Senate next sits. We ask whether the government would consider the whistleblower protections that we have proposed? We believe that there should be greater levels of support for whistleblowers in registered organisations. If we are going to reduce the likelihood of corruption occurring, we should enshrine the principle of protection and it should be afforded to whistleblowers. We ask the government to seriously entertain that proposition. We would like at least a preliminary response by the minister, if at all possible. We would also like to see auditors held to a higher level of accountability in relation to their conduct. We want to make sure that they are reporting any misconduct and they are not in any way complicit. We would ask the minister to consider that. Finally, we would like to know whether the government would seriously entertain reducing the disclosure threshold for donations, not only for registered organisation candidates but for candidates for federal elections. thank the shadow minister for his questions, and I will deal with them. It is good to see that the opposition is constructively engaging on the registered organisations commission bill and proposing amendments in the Senate. Obviously, today the House passed the registered organisations commission bills, and we did so with a debate management motion. It did not afford the opposition-particularly new members of the opposition, including the member for Bruce-the opportunity to speak on this bill. But, as I pointed out to the House today, this was the fourth time that the House had considered the registered organisations commission bill. It has been through an exhaustive committee process in both the Senate and in the House of Representatives. The bill that was presented and has now been passed by the House today is in exactly the same form as it was on the other three times it was passed by the House of Representatives. So there is nothing new under the sun in relation to this particular bill. SoI do congratulate the opposition on at least being prepared, when this bill goes to the Senate, to move amendments and to be part of the negotiation process. Of course, the nature of the 45th Parliament is that the coalition has a majority in the House of Representativeswhich has been proven time and time again this week-but not in the Senate. ThereforeMr Brendan O'Connor interjectingconfident that we might have learnt that lesson, shadow minister. In the Senate, negotiation is",236,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
314,Mr Pyne (Sturt,Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (16:12): I,237,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
315,Mr Pyne,"Yes, there is still another day to go-that is absolutely right! But I am prettythe name of the game, so I am glad that the opposition is prepared to put forward constructive suggestions. The government has a very firm view that the proposed registered organisations commission is the best means of delivering honest unions and honest union leaders. The coalition does not have a history of being anti-union-we have a history of being anti crooked union boss and bad union. That is exactly where we should be. I am sure that most members of the ALP-I cannot speak for them all, of course-also abhor dishonest union leaders, because they give honest union leaders a very bad name. Of course, as almost everybody in the Labor Party caucus is a former union leader, I am sure many of them feel very badly about the fact that dishonest union leaders give the rest of them a bad name. Of course it is worth remembering that the ROC bill was born out of the appalling behaviour of the former member for Dobell, Mr Craig Thomson, who was the secretary of the Health Services Union. The government did not propose these measures because there was not a problem to be solved-there was a problem. The problem was dishonest union leaders ripping off their members-in the Health Services Union's case amongst the poorest workers in the work force such as cleaners in aged care homes and hospitals all around Australia. None of them could be accused of earning expansive incomes, and they were ripped off by Craig Thomson in a heinous way, and also by Mr Williamson before him. The government introduced the registered organisations commissions bill and we think it is the best mechanism to solve the issues. I doubt very much that the Labor Party's amendments will make it a better bill but I am sure that Senator Cash, when she deals with these matters, will deal with them in an even-handed way and give the Labor Party their fair due. We all know why the Labor Party wants to reduce the thresholds for the disclosure of donations. We all know what happened last time. When the Hawke government introduced the disclosure thresholds, businesses that had previously given to the coalition were visited by union bosses all around Australia and told, 'You don't have to give us the same as you give the coalition, we know you support the coalition, but you must at least give us half.' Businesses that had never dreamt of giving money to the Labor Party to campaign against the coalition were forced, essentially by extortion, into funding a political party that they had had absolutely no intention of ever supporting. As a consequence, that has skewed the system. We do not get the same out of the unions, obviously, and as a consequence we will not be considering the Labor Party 's amendments to the disclosure requirements. minister that the government will not entertain reducing the disclosure thresholds for candidates. The government commissioned a royal commission, one of the recommendations of which was to create a threshold of $1,000 for candidates in elections of registered organisations. Whilst the government has been praising the work of its former royal commissioner and has continually referred to the royal commission's work in dealing with corruption and other potential offences within registered organisations, it would appear the government wants to apply one set of laws for candidates in some elections and another set of laws for candidates in federal elections. How can there possibly be a higher standard for candidates of registered organisations when, say, someone wants to run a union compared with candidates of federal elections when they want to run the country? It would appear inconsistent at best, if not hypocritical, to argue",237,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
316,Mr Brendan O'connor (Gorton) (16:17,"It is disappointing to hear from thethat we want to tighten threshold disclosures for those candidates under this bill for registered organisations and yet not apply such a principle to candidates. WhilstI have heard the comments of the minister, we would implore him and his government to reconsider that position. We know that the crossbench understands the merits behind the proposition and I think the government might find that many crossbench senators would support the view that if we are to have a law about threshold disclosure for registered organisations it should also apply to candidates in federal elections. Let's make sure that all elections conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission do have similar laws. Let's not pretend that somehow there should be a different standard-a lower standard-for candidates who want to be in this place, if they are successful at an election, than for those who are seeking to be officers of registered organisations and go through an election to do so. We think that is highly inconsistent and unfair and, I would argue, hypocritical in relation to the government's current position. We are happy to negotiate the amendments. We have seriously considered this bill. In fact, I would contend that we have announced policies that, if you look at the amendments in combination, would strengthen the bill. I think there is an opportunity here for the government and for the opposition to come together on a set of changes to the current bill which will match the rhetoric of the government. It would mean that companies and registered organisations would be regulated by the same regulator. It would mean that whistleblowers would be protected, that auditors would have to comply with a higher standard and that transparency in elections would be improved. How could that possibly be a worse situation? I think the government should reconsider their position in relation to the disclosures. I certainly believe that the crossbench senators like what they hear in relation to the opposition's recommendations. I will not give up. I think the minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Industry, the most senior Defence minister in the government, acting on behalf of the Minister for Employment, should reconsider his earlier answer in relation to that. We think it is important that we get these regulations right. We will never be apologists for corrupt unions officials. We are ashamed when we see a corrupt union official. We should be ashamed when we seek corrupt corporate people too. That is why there has been hypocrisy in relation to the banks and the unions-they are not looking at misconduct in the banks in the same way they are looking at any misconduct in unions. These are important amendments. I am glad I have had some opportunity to question the minister in relation to them, given that we were gagged in the parliament earlier today. I can assure the minister and this place that we will continue to pursue them with the crossbenchers. think that I have answered the question. I am happy to make the point that I think the shadow minister's five-minute contribution did not ask me any new question. I feel like I have answered the question in my previous contribution, and I really want to hear the contributions of the members for Chifley and Moreton, who I know are very keen to ask me questions. Employment particular questions in reference to Work for the Dole. I wanted to draw his attention to the performance of the program which, according to the government's own figures tabled in response to questions on notice, shows that roughly 90 per cent of the young participants in that program fail to be in full-time employment three months after exiting the",238,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

318,Mr Husic (Chifley) (16:23,"I want to ask the Minister representing the Minister forprogram. I also refer the minister to the statement today by Renee Leon, the secretary of the department, who told estimates 'the purpose of Work for the Dole is not necessarily to lead directly to a full-time job'. I ask the minister: does he believe that a roughly 90 per cent failure rate for the Work for the Dole program is an acceptable outcome for the government and young Australians? Can the minister outline what plans the government has to ensure that Work for the Dole will not just get young people ready for work but actually get them work? Or does the minister acknowledge the Turnbull government has given up on the ability of the Work for the Dole program to help young Australians get jobs? And while we are talking about that program, can I also ask some questions relating in particular to the terrible fatality of a young Work for the Dole participant in Toowoomba, in April this year. I understand that the department has undertaken an internal review of the matter as it relates to the operation of the deed with respect to the maintenance of appropriate workplace health and safety standards for both the providers and the hosts. I note that the government has acknowledged today that this internal review has been completed and that the minister has seen the report. Also, if I may through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and through the minister, I thank Minister Cash for two in-depth briefings-verbal briefings-that I received into that internal review and its findings. I have previously asked for copies of that report, which I am waiting to receive. I ask the minister when that report will be made public? Does he accept that the release of the report will help build confidence that the Work for the Dole program is maintaining appropriate workplace health and safety standards? And can the minister advise why an internal departmental review that concentrates on the application of the deed, without in-depth reference to the particulars of the incident and the fatality itself cannot be released ahead of the issue of the Queensland workplace health and safety regulator releasing its report? might deal with the second question first. Obviously, the government agrees with your concern about the accident involving the Work for the Dole program in Toowoomba on 19 April 2016. It was a tragic accident, taking the life of a young jobseeker, Mr Joshua ParkFing, who was a participant. Any workplace accident is a tragedy. Unfortunately, they usually occur entirely through accident and through no fault of any particular person. I think in the case of this accident, it was a situation that could easily have been avoided. But it was not avoided on this occasion and this man's life has been taken, which is a great tragedy for him and for his family and friends. The matter was reported to the police immediately-as the member for Chifley knows because he has been kept very well informed, I think, by the department-and to workplace health and safety in Queensland, which is the relevant regulatory authority at the state level. WorkSafe Queensland is still currently conducting its investigation into the accident, and the Department of Employment is cooperating in that investigation, as much as it possibly can. Of its own, the Department of Employment has investigated the matters that fall within its responsibilities as the program owner, including compliance with the deed requirements by the jobactive provider.",239,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
319,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (16:26): IIn terms of the member for Chifley's specific question about releasing the government's own report: my understanding is that consideration will be given to that when the Queensland government has completed its inquiry, and then there will be a coordinated discussion between the various ministers, state and federal, about how that might be achieved. Any of the findings from the Department of Employment's review and the outcomes of the formal investigation will be considered to determine future policy, contractual requirements and operational processes that it has been advised might need to be revised. Obviously, the government takes all health and safety concerns very seriously. On this occasion the Work for the Dole activity at the Toowoomba Showground was suspended immediately. The activity was never reactivated and has now ceased. The Department of Employment has advised me that the participants who were present or in the vicinity of the incident were offered counselling. Does the member for Chifley want to ask me a further question about that matter? Mr Husic: Yes. the wider question you asked. with your colleagues-or your advisers, I should say-and you may have missed one element of my question. It was that my understanding is that the internal review-without giving anything away of the internal review, and respecting the confidentiality of the briefings I have received-focused very much on the particulars of the application of the deed. It does not necessarily, as I am led to believe through the verbal briefings-because I have not been afforded the benefit of the written brief or the report-refer to the particulars of the incident per se, which as you have rightly advised the House is being managed by the Queensland regulator. I am just trying to appreciate why a report into the deed itself and the application of the arrangements relating to the provider and the host cannot be made public. I would certainly welcome any advice you can provide on that. Can the minister also indicate whether the review-this is the internal review, not the Queensland regulator's report-references the findings of the Royal Commission into the Home Insulation Program and whether it demonstrates that the review has recommended changes to any internal processes that conform with the commission findings? must admit to the member for Chifley that I did not hear that part of his question, because I was conferring with my advisers. Common sense suggests to me that the Commonwealth's area of responsibility, being the program, was quite properly the subject of our internal investigation. The Minister for Employment will make a decision about whether that will be made public at the appropriate time. I am confident that she will offer the member for Chifley a briefing on that matter at the appropriate time, but I understand it has only just been received by the Minister for Employment, so she probably has not formed a view about that at this stage. In terms of the investigation into the accident itself, it is the jurisdiction of the state-the WorkCover Queensland commission or authority. They may well release their findings-in",240,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

321,Mr Husic (Chifley) (16:28,I just have one follow-up question. You were conferring,241,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
322,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (16:30): Ifact, they usually do in these sorts of situations where there has been a workplace accident. They will do that, I assume, when they finish their investigation and make that decision. In terms of the Home Insulation Program and the royal commission into those matters, I am simply not aware of whether they form the basis of the program investigation. I am sure that the Minister for Employment will correspond separately with the member for Chifley on that matter as is appropriate. I do not have the answer to that in my briefings, so I will let her deal directly with you. Mr Husic: Are you able to take it on notice? directly to the member for Chifley on that matter. and I share an interest on-specifically, the impact on employment and jobs of automation and technology. I wanted to ask, in reference to the Department of Employment, particular questions in this regard. Firstly, can I ask: has the department undertaken any assessment of the impact of automation and technology on the Australian workforce and the labour market in coming years? How many jobs does the department believe will be made obsolete by automation in the next 15 years? Also, what advice has the department provided the Turnbull government about how to manage the impact of automation and technological change on Australian jobs? What funding in the department is dedicated to finding out what kinds of jobs will disappear due to automation, what jobs may replace them and what can be done to assist people in transition? If the minister does not have those answers present-I understand they are very specific-I would welcome it if he could take them on notice. I am also well aware that he is a person very much across this issue, given previous portfolio areas he has occupied. I would certainly welcome any input he may have on those matters. very good question, and a lot of people want to know the answer as to the future of manufacturing and automation in Australia and the impact, effectively, of change on our workforce. I would direct the member for Chifley to the voluminous number of reports that exist from the excellent think tanks in Australia that we have around the job impacts of automation and high-tech, advanced manufacturing versus old-fashioned manufacturing. I have left the portfolio, but I can tell him that the first two quarters of this year were the two best quarters for manufacturing since December 2004. That was in terms of new jobs, new businesses, export opportunities and investment. In those areas, in 2016 manufacturing had the two best quarters that it has had since 2004. So the economy is transitioning and there is no doubt that, for many Australian workers and their families, automation and manufacturing technology represents a threat to their livelihoods. The responsibility of this government-and it would be his responsibility and his government's responsibility if they had won the election-is to move our economy in a direction that provides new work opportunities for those workers in industries that are shrinking-in terms of old-fashioned manufacturing industries-whether it is Ford, Toyota, Holden or others. For that reason, the creation of the defence industry part of the Defence portfolio is a very genuine attempt by the Turnbull-Joyce government-as I understand we call it these days-to address some of those",241,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
323,Mr Pyne,"I have taken it on notice, and the Minister for Employment will correspond",242,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
324,Mr Husic (Chifley) (16:32,"IfI can, I will ask the minister about matters that I think he",242,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
325,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (16:33): It is aconcerns. We have $195 billion of Defence spending heft in Australia in the next 10 years to create a domestic defence industry that employs tens of thousands of Australians in high-tech, advanced manufacturing for both our own needs and also for export. And that is particularly my task as the Minister for Defence Industry. Any facts or evidence that we can provide the member for Chifley to respond to his specific questions, I have no doubt that the advisers from the Minister for Employment's office has made a note and we will get them to him. In terms of the general issue, we are, as a government, very focused on recognising that there are particular pockets of unemployment and disadvantage in areas of our economy where old-fashioned manufacturing was a significant employer. And, obviously, coming from Adelaide, that is very much the case in northern Adelaide and, to a lesser extent, southern Adelaide. But, of course, in areas of Western Sydney-which the member for Chifley represents-and parts of Tasmania, Geelong, northern Melbourne, Bendigo and parts of Brisbane this is obviously a particular problem. As a consequence, we need to use the resources that are at our disposal to get the Australian defence industry to a capability level where we can confidently spend as much of that Defence dollar here in Australia and drive the defence industry as a very significant pillar of our economy. I think as that happens-and it is already happening as that industry continues to grow and kick more goals, if you likethose people who are concerned about where their jobs will be in the future, for themselves and for their children, will see that the opportunities are there in high-tech, advanced manufacturing. One of the tremendous things about the defence industry is that it is very valuable; it requires high skills; and we have very skilled workforce in this country. We can compete because, even though the labour costs are high, it is in very high-tech, advanced manufacturing and it is not making T-shirts in other parts of the world where labour costs mean Australian cannot compete. It is in making products-whether they are submarines, future frigates, offshore patrol vessels, pacific patrol vessels, parts for the Joint Strike Fighter program or whatever it might be-that we are best in the world and it will create a very significant industry for our economy. referring to, for example, defence industries and manufacturing which, obviously, in those sectors, particular pressures relate to them. It is good to know. As I indicated in my question, it would be great if some of those answers could be taken on notice. I would like to move on to another area within the portfolio area: in particular, a program that was announced during the federal budget this year relating to the establishment of the PaTH internship program, which the opposition has indicated some concerns with. I will keep my question as short as I possibly can, given the time constraints we have. Six months after the program was announced, and even today through estimates hearings being conducted for the other place, there is no definition of what an intern will be. There is no outline of guarantees to ensure interns will not displace jobs; there is no outline of guarantees to ensure interns will not be used to cut wages; there is no outline of guarantees to ensure that PaTH will not experience the same outcomes as Work for the Dole that I referred to earlier, and whether or not the bulk of interns will fail to get full-time work. I would like to get an indication from the minister as to whether or not he is able to provide the chamber with some assurances in relation to those matters I have raised.",242,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
326,Mr Husic (Chifley) (16:38,"I thank the minister for his response and, in particular,I would also like to ask if the minister is aware of findings of overseas reviews into similar schemes. For example, in Ireland, which has a similar program, the National Youth Council of Ireland found that only 27 per cent of interns were placed in full-time jobs after their internships. I would be interested to know if the Australian scheme will have a higher hiring rate, and what the government's hiring target is for this new program. Can the minister also remind the House of the total amount of public funds dedicated to PaTH over the forward estimates? And has the minister seen or been made aware of a line of questioning that was enthusiastically pursued by Senator James Paterson in estimates today? He was very interested to know whether a potential advantage for this new program is that if an intern does not work out, a business would not be subject to any unfair dismissal claims or costs in that respect. He seemed to indicate that this would be an advantage of the program, that it would sidestep unfair dismissal laws. Can the minister advise whether or not he shares that same enthusiasm, and if this is actually a program to get people to work or to get people out of work? It seems to be at odds. SoI would be interested to get some more details on this, given that the opposition has had some concerns with program designs to date. think the member for Chifley is trying to be anti-something and negative about something which is obviously an unadulteratedly good idea. The concept of getting young people into jobs through pathways that they might not previously have considered is a very sensible program, a very sensible policy. It was wildly popular in the election, as Deputy Speaker Buchholz will remember-certainly in my electorate and, I assume, in his as well. Under the internship element of the Youth Jobs PaTH, eligible young jobseekers will be given the opportunity to undertake work experience by participating in internships. This will give the young jobseekers a chance to show what they can do in the real workplace. Both businesses and eligible young jobseekers will be able to choose whether to participate in an internship and, to encourage eligible young jobseekers to undertake such an internship, participants will receive a fortnightly incentive payment from the Department of Human Services of $200. The fortnightly incentive payment will be paid in addition to the young jobseeker's social security payments and will not be counted as remuneration for work. So we are making every effort to ensure that young jobseekers will want to take part in these internships, because they will not lose any money-in fact, they will gain money. The bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 so that fortnightly incentive payments to eligible young jobseekers placed in internships under the Youth Jobs PaTH are not deemed as income for social security purposes. An equivalent amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 is also necessary to ensure that the incentive payments are not counted as income for veterans' entitlements purposes. This is a program being administered by the Minister for Employment, and I have absolutely no doubt that it will be a great success that will lead to real jobs. In terms of Senator Paterson's remarks in estimates, Senator Paterson is a fine senator from Victoria, and I am sure that whatever he has said is perfectly sensible. But as this is the first that I have heard of it, I would be unwise to comment on it. employment portfolio now be agreed to.",243,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

328,The Deputy Speaker,"The question is that the proposed expenditure for theProposed expenditure agreed to. Defence Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $8,047,727,000 saying that, when it comes to the area of defence industry and indeed defence, what has characterised this government since it came to government in 2013 has been total confusion. Let us start with the number of ministers: we are now onto the third Defence minister. We had Minister Johnson, Minister Andrews and now Minister Payne-although, we will get to this a bit later, it does seem as though we have now got two ministers for Defence; although exactly what the order of seniority in respect of those two appears to be unclear, however, with the Minister for Defence Industry here, he may be able to answer that question. We have had a number of assistant ministers-Assistant Minister McCormack, Assistant Minister Chester and Assistant Minister Robert-go through the portfolio. We now have Minister Tehan operating in the space. This has been a merry-go-round in terms of who has been representing the government in this space. The confusion goes beyond that. What characterised again in respect of the question of procurement is a complete failure of a strategy around exactly where this government wanted to take procurement. If you look at the question of submarines-and there are a number of questions that need to be answered here by the government-we had Minister Johnston referring to Australian shipbuilders as unable to build a canoe. We had, in the course of the leadership contest with the former Prime Minister Abbott, the single largest procurement in Australian history being tossed around the government party room as a matter of collecting votes to save Mr Abbott. Out of that came the competitive evaluation process, which was a process unknown to Defence at that point in time and still cannot really be explained as to what it was about. We indeed saw this procurement ostensibly be a part of the clinching of the Japan free trade agreement as it seemed that the government was destined to put this particular procurement in the hands of the Japanese. Then we ended up where we are now with the design being done by DCNS from France. We have seen in relation to supply ships-this was going to be the most important procurement in terms of maintaining Australian shipyards so that they could survive the valley of death; however, rather than this being done within Australia, because the government at the time was saying that Australian capability was not such that this could be done within Australia, we see tenderers for this work being exclusively outside of Australia, and now that work is being done in Spain. The serious point of all of this of course is the loss of jobs-1500 shipbuilding jobs have been lost as a result of these decisions that have been made since the Abbott-Turnbull government came to power. I think the other point to make is that, in the context of a significant increase in procurement, we have been over the last few years something in the order of 10 per cent of US foreign military sales and something like the 7th largest defence importer in the world . That speaks to the significant expenditure which is occurring in this area and yet, despite that, there has been precious little effort on the part of this government to leverage that expenditure to build a domestic defence industry. That would appear to be the",244,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
329,Mr Marles (Corio) (16:44,"Thank you, Minister, for the correction. Let me start byreason why the minister was called in to save the day, and we now have two Defence ministers-a Minister for Defence and a Minister for Defence Industry. There are a number of questions which need to be answered in respect of the procurement space. The number of shipbuilding workers in Australia has gone down to a critical level. The OPVs are scheduled to be steel cut in 2018, the Future Frigates in 2019. I guess the first question that I ask the minister is: has a preferred design partner been chosen for both of the those projects? And, if it has not, when is it intended to be so and can there be certainty that the dates in respect of cutting steel will be met? answer specifically the question from the member for Corio: I would have thought he was aware that there is a competitive evaluation process for the offshore patrol vessels designer and for the future frigates designer. That is in the midst of its operations right now-it is being done right now. There are three bidders for both the OPVs and the future frigates, which I think he would also know. The decision about that will be made at the appropriate time. One of the critical responsibilities that I have as Minister for Defence Industry is to keep the schedule on track. As a consequence, much of my effort on a daily basis goes into ensuring that the decisions are being made in a timely way by the Minister for Defence Industry-being me, obviously. It's not good to talk about oneself in the third person; it sounds slightly crazy! But obviously the decisions that I need to make will ensure that Defence does not face any delays from this place and in fact can get on with the schedule, and that is exactly what is happening. Those decisions are being made, and I am surprised that the member for Corio would venture into this particular part of public policy. Marise Payne and I as the Minister for Defence and Minister for Defence Industry have made more decisions in 100 days than the Labor Party made in six years when they were in office. That was the Rip van Winkle period of defence policy in Australia's history, and the only saving grace for the member for Corio is that he was not given responsibility for that area of government policy when he was on the front bench in the Gillard government. It is one of the great failures of those six years. I am glad that the member for Menzies is here in the Federation Chamber-although he may not be-because, when he and I taking over in 2013 as part of a new government, he as the Minister for Defence had to try and get these decisions back on track after six years of absolute inertia in the period of the Gillard and Rudd governments. You do not need to hear very much about how bad it was to be convinced. In the six years of the Rudd and Gillard governments they made not one decision to build a naval vessel here in Australia-zero in six years. In the three years that we have been in government we have decided to build 54 vessels over the coming decades: 12 submarines, nine future frigates 12 offshore patrol vessels and 21 Pacific patrol vessels-54 vessels. We are investing $195 billion over the next 10 years in building defence capability-not all, of course in naval shipbuilding. About $90 billion of it is in naval shipbuilding. This entirely transforms our defence capability, and it is a decision that this government has made. The previous government created the valley of death, which is leading to real people, not numbers on papers, losing their jobs at Osborne, at Williamstown, at Henderson and, for that matter, at Newcastle-across the naval shipbuilding industry-because the government that the member for Corio was a part of did not have the gumption, the capacity or the desire to make the",245,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
330,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (16:49): Todecisions necessary in these projects, which are long-lead-time projects, to keep the workforce intact. But we are not shirking this major task. This is a major challenge. The member at the table, the member for Menzies, initiated the Defence white paper process. That was handed down in February this year. With it was the integrated investment program and the defence industry policy statement. These three documents are the basis for the government's plans for building defence capability, the strategy behind it and the purpose of it over the next several decades. One day, potentially, the opposition may well be in government, and I hope that they will recognise that this foundation the current government has put in place is worthy of being supported into the future. The record is not good. Each time the Labor Party gets into office, they cut defence spending. It is the first thing they do. The last government's record was to get it down to 1.38 per cent of GDP, the lowest level since the appeasement era in the 1930s. We are repairing that extraordinary damage that they did to the Defence portfolio, and I look forward to the member for Corio's next attempt to try and hide his shame. ruse-it is a stat that the minister likes to quote. Mr Pyne interjectingapproach the level of two per cent, a rate that for much of that time was higher than what was being spent during the Howard era. The reality is that what we have seen since this government came to power is a wholesale loss of jobs in the Australian shipbuilding industry. The shipbuilding yards in Williamstown and the Forgacs shipbuilding yards are now bereft of work. As the minister absolutely correctly said, 1,500 real people, with real families, are no longer working in this industry. A key part of this was the consistent approach by this government that there is not the capability in this country to perform indigenous defence work, which is absolutely incorrect. That is what has led to a situation where supply ships are now being built in Spain that could have been built here, and in fact it is quite clear that there would be the capacity for that to occur. I want to ask the minister about submarines. This is the single biggest procurement in Australian defence history. It is a critically important procurement for Australia's future capability and it is one that has been treated with scant regard by this government since they came to power. The idea that a procurement of $50 billion up front and many tens of billions more in maintenance through the life of the project gets tossed around a party room over a leadership contest is absolutely astonishing. It is very much to this government's shame that they treated a procurement of that significance, both in terms of the amount of money which goes into it but also in terms of our nation's defence, with such disrespect by not considering it strictly in terms of what was the best public policy in the national interest but making it a matter of internal politics within the government party room. The process which has now been put in place saw the announcement of the DCNS as the preferred design partner. That of course is not a contract to build the submarines as such-it is a contract to provide a design for the future submarine. We have very long time lines in place in relation to the procurement of the submarines-we will not be seeing steel being cut until",246,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
331,Mr Marles (Corio) (16:54,Of course the question of defence spending is a complete,247,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
332,Mr Marles,"It is also true that during the Rudd-Gillard era we saw defence spending2021, and we will not see the first submarine in the water engaging in activity until 2032. The implication of that is the requirement for a significant upgrade of the Collins class submarine, given that we are talking about a 16-year horizon between where we are today and the first occasion on which the future submarines will be in the water. There are a whole lot of issues that need to be addressed and risk that needs to be managed between now and then. Given that we are talking about the continued operation of the Collins class through until that time, inevitably there will be significant expense at the back end of that period in maintaining the Collins class. That leads to me these questions. Can the minister absolutely guarantee that all the future submarines will be built in Australia-not just the first off the line, but that none of them will be built in France? Will the timelines, as lengthy as they are, be able to be maintained on the basis of all of these submarines being built in Australia? The minister has said that 90 per cent of the submarines will have Australian content in them. That appears to be a figure which has not been backed up by either the Minister for Defence or the secretary of Defence in Senate estimates, so how can the minister assure us that 90 per cent of this build will be done in Australia? member for Corio says that the current government has not got the confidence in Australian defence industry capability, and yet we are the government that has made all the decisions in the last three years to build Australian defence industry capability. When his party was in government, they had so little confidence in the Australian industry they made not one decision to build anything here in Australia-not one decision to build a navy ship here in Australia. So if any political party has no confidence in Australian defence industry, it is obviously the Labor Party. If the Labor Party believed that the Australian industry had the capability to deliver, they would have made those decisions. Obviously, the member for Corio's position does not stack up. This is the government that in three years has taken Australian defence industry from the very sad state it was under the Labor Party into having an incredibly bright future, where we are putting behind that the push of $195 billion of spending to build defence industry capability over the next 10 years. The member for Corio asked me the most extraordinary question about the submarines, as though the Labor Party has any credibility at all on submarine policy in this country. Apart from the Beazley Defence ministry and the Hawke government making the initial decision to build the Collins class submarines, ever since then the Labor Party's record on submarine building in Australia has been worse than woeful. It has done vandalism to the Australian shipbuilding industry. If they seriously believed that they had any credibility on submarine building, why didn't they make a decision in that six-year period of government under Rudd and Gillard to sustain a shipbuilding industry-a submarine building industryinto the future? They totally neglected to do so. So that is why we when we came to office-first David Johnson and then Kevin Andrews and now Marise Payne and I-have had to put back the pieces to build a submarine industry in this country. We have signed the DCNS contract to design the Australianised version of the Shortfin Barracuda-something that the Labor Party never even tried to do. It was this government that initiated the competitive evaluation process; the Labor Party never even considered doing so. That is why 12 submarines will be built in Adelaide at Osborne North.",247,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
333,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (16:59): TheThat is an absolute commitment that we have made which will deliver jobs, investment and growth in the economy, not just in South Australia but across Australia, because, of course, many Australian businesses will take part in that project. It will be a real boon to our economy. I am sure the Labor Party supports it-a $50 billion program on just the building part of the program will make a tremendous difference to the Australian economy. So, yes, I can absolutely guarantee that all 12 submarines will be built at Osborne North in Adelaide in the great state of South Australia. The member for Corio also asked me about a 90 per cent figure. I have never said that 90 per cent of the submarine build would be done in Adelaide. That was a statement made by Sean Costello, the chief executive officer of DCNS in Australia. He made that statement on the radio, and I think you will find, if you return to any of my comments that I have made on this subject, that every time. I have referenced that figure I have said the DCNS themselves say 90 per cent will be done in Australia. Therefore it is not my figure; it is DCNS's figure and Sean Costello's figure. I think that answers your questions. I thought you were going to ask me about the life cycle of the Collins class submarine and an assurance that there is no capability gap. You did not ask me that, but I will answer it anyway. It would have been an interesting question for you to have asked. Of course, the government is taking the measures necessary to ensure that there is no capability gap between the Collins class submarine and the Australianised Shortfin Barracuda and we will be monitoring all the time to ensure that the schedule remains on track for DCNS. That is why we have already announced that Lockheed Martin will be the combat system integrator-they won that process. We announced that about two or three weeks ago. We are getting on with the job. If it ever appears at any point that that will not be the case, the government will take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that there is no capability gap. minister and I have been doing too much together-he is predicting what I am about to ask him. I thank the minister for answering the question about the capability gap. I will make a point in relation to competitive evaluation processes and what occurred under the previous Labor government. The competitive evaluation process is not something that is understood by Defence and the military, because it was a new process imagined out of, essentially, a leadership dispute within the government party room in order to deal with certain circumstances. The reality is that the procurement process for the submarines has left a lot to be desired, and a feature of this government's procurement has been delay. We have consistently seen key procurement decisions delayed under this government. The integrated investment plan, which the minister speaks of, is far less detailed than the Defence Capability Plan, which was in place under Labor. Under this government, the time lines in the DCP for a number of key procurements have slipped. I want to ask some further questions about the submarines. The minister has indicated that 90 per cent is not his figure. I am keen to understand exactly what his figure is, then, in relation to the expected percentage of Australian build in the submarines. This is a critical matter for building Australian capability and, indeed, building an Australian defence industry. The supply chains that are put in place for the submarines will provide significant opportunity in Australia, or at least they have the potential to do that if there is a significant component of Australian build within the submarines. Obviously that is good in terms of jobs; it is also",248,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
334,Mr Marles (Corio) (17:05,"That was going to be my next question. It shows that theimportant in the strategic sense of building sovereign capacity. I am keen to understand that, and it is critical that the first submarines are built in Australia. I hear the minister's answer to the questionA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 17:08 to 17:46 Veterans' Affairs segment of the Defence Portfolio, in accordance with the agreed order of consideration. Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) (17:46): I rise today to ask the minister questions around the 2016-17 portfolio budget statement for the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which states: DVA recognises that our client base is unique and crosses the age spectrum, from those in their later years of life such as widows of First World War veterans, to infants of contemporary servicemen and women. We aim to be a responsive and flexible organisation, and to efficiently deliver high quality, connected services to all generations of veterans and the wider veteran community. Part of the critical services which DVA is responsible for delivering is around the Veterans' Access Network offices, or the VAN offices, which provide frontline services for veterans and their families. Minister, can you advise how many Veterans' Access Network offices have closed since September 2013? What happened to the staff of these offices? Are they still employed by DVA? Have any staff moved into the co-located DHS-Centrelink offices? Can the minister also advise whether there is a dedicated support officer for veterans at those offices where VANS have been co-located to DHS-Centrelink? Is there a DVA or DHS staff member and, if so, does the minister believe that DHS have the targeted skills to help veterans? Can the minister advise if those men and women who have served our country should have to stand in line at Centrelink to seek veterans' services? Can the minister advise if there are any plans to close down any more Veterans' Access Network offices? Does the minister have any more plans to move veterans' services to DHS? More specifically, can the minister provide further reassurance to the veterans and families of Newcastle, in my electorate, that their office will not close down? Can the minister provide a detailed breakdown of the cost per annum of each open, standalone Veterans' Access Network office? The costs that I am seeking are the costs per annum to keep open, including the rent per annum for each office, staff numbers and full-time equivalents, stationery costs and other miscellaneous items. The minister will appreciate that this is a very topical issue in my community of Newcastle. For a number of months now there have been rumours that the VAN office is about to close when the lease terminates next year, in 2017. There are very strong views around the colocation of these offices in Centrelink. Indeed, veterans who have come to see me, particularly those from the Vietnam veterans community, have some grave concerns. There is a co-located Vietnam veterans counselling service with the VAN office in Newcastle and there are a number of shared facilities, including the boardroom and kitchen facilities. There are grave concerns about what will happen to those veterans who rely on the counselling services there and to groups, like the Men's Health Peer Education, which are running important mental health and counselling services from those offices. Members of the TPI",249,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
335,The Deputy Speaker ( Mrs Wicks,"The Federation Chamber will now consider theAssociation and many other ex-service organisations in my electorate have come to me deeply worried about the stories they keep hearing about the closure of the VAN office in Newcastle. In my area I have the Williamtown RAAF Base, with some 3½ thousand personnel to the north, and I have some 29 ex-service organisations in my electorate. It is a very active community. This group of people fought very hard to get services into those communities of need in the first place and they are deeply worried about any potential for closure of the VAN office in Newcastle. I seek your assurance on all of those questions I have just asked, Minister. the country, and it is a privilege and a great responsibility to be asked to give voice to those concerns. A recurring theme of representations from these veterans includes the level of access and funding for mental health care. I have heard multiple cases where a veteran has attempted to receive white card status for mental health treatment only to be denied or delayed because a link was required between their condition and their service. One ex-serviceman from Canning recently approached my office because the DVA would not provide financial assistance for his mental health treatment. Other ex-diggers have lobbied because they have seen their mates who have not received adequate treatment succumb to suicide. I have raised such issues with the minister in the past and appreciate the concern, the readiness and the action he has shown. Would the minister please advise the House on recent decisions made by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to expand its cover for non-liability health care? Would he also please outline the practical consequences this will have for Australia's former service men and women? Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cyber Security and Minister for Defence Personnel) (17:53): I will start with the last question first and then go on to the questions that were asked by the member for Newcastle. Since coming into the portfolio in FebruaryI have done wide-ranging consultations. I have visited over 30 ex-service organisations around the country in every state and territory-as I have in your electorate, Deputy Speaker Wicks-to get feedback from our veterans on the ground on what matters are really important to them and what they are looking for when it comes to the government. The feedback was very clear. To start with, they wanted to make sure that they would have a standalone Department of Veterans' Affairs, and we made it clear in our election commitment that we would continue to have a standalone Department of Veterans' Affairs that would look after the interests of our veterans. The second thing they made clear was that there was a concern with the time which was being allocated to processing claims. There were a lot of anecdotes about how a system which was still, in part, paper based needed to be updated for us to have a department which could service the veterans clientele in a proper way. On this point, I think the feedback was extremely valid-and this goes back, I think, over the last decade, goes back over successive governments-because we have failed to give the Department of Veterans' Affairs the IT, the information technology, capability that they need to operate as a department in the 21st century. One of the incredibly important things which we did in this year's budget was allocate money so that, for the first time, we could begin an upgrade of the IT system in the",250,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

337,Mr Tehan (Wannon,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister Assisting the PrimeDepartment of Veterans' Affairs. This will mean that we can make the most significant changes to the way the department operates and make sure that everything they are doing is absolutely centred on the veteran. The other important piece of feedback that I got was that, when it came to veterans who were dealing with mental health issues, sometimes the complexity of the claims process could add extra stress to those issues. What we did-and I know this is something which the member for Canning has been extremely pleased about-is we have said that from now on, if you have PTSD, depression, anxiety, alcoholism or substance issues, you do not have to, in any way, show that it is related to your service in order to get assistance and to get help. It is non-liability health care. We introduced this in the budget, and it came in on 1 July. That has made a big impact, and I would call on all members to make sure they are going out and promoting that within the veterans community. It means that you do not have to prove anything to get help-help is there. If you have served one full day in the armed services, then you are eligible for this. It, in part, fits with all the advice we get in this area which is that the earlier the intervention, the better the outcomes and results. I also had feedback on the VAN offices and the VVCS, as the member for Newcastle knows-and I have spoken to her about this. There are no plans to close the VAN office in Newcastle. We are obviously looking at ways to make sure we are maximising the use of those VANs, and this is something that we will continue to be examining. budget in financial year 2016-17 of $11.7 billion. By my calculations, the cost of having a deputy commissioner in the Northern Territory office, which we do not currently have, is about $30,000. I am wondering whether we can find $30,000 per annum to make sure that veterans in the Northern Territory are represented the same as anyone else in this country. If you refer to the organisational chart of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which has a blank in the Northern Territory, it is because we have not got a deputy commissioner for veterans' affairs. I think it would help veterans in the NT if they were represented with a deputy commissioner, the same as anyone else around the country. Having written to the minister on 28 August, can we get an answer as to when the Northern Territory will have a deputy commissioner for veterans' affairs reappointed? Now $30,000 does not seem like a large amount of money, so, if it is cost cutting, it is probably not a good area to cut. I have made various communications with your office and just ask that, on behalf of veterans of the Northern Territory, we get some answers as to when that reappointment will occur. can be put in writing to the minister.

When he talks about the budget for the Department of Veterans' Affairs, I just highlight that fact to him. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Attorney-General's Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $1,762,709,000 comes to this government, its Attorney-General and his representative here today in this place, it is difficult to know where to start. Since his appointment as Attorney-General in 2013, Senator Brandis has brought nothing but trouble for this government, for the legal assistance sector and indeed for the rule of law in this country. When Prime Minister Turnbull knocked off his predecessor in September last year, Senator Brandis already had a litany of serious mistakes to his name: his total mishandling of the metadata retention bill, his right to be bigots and his disastrous period as minister for the arts come to mind. Mr Turnbull knocked him off as arts minister but, mystifyingly, he kept him on as Attorney-General, a decision which I am sure that he is ruing now. Even after more than three years as Senator Brandis' opposite number, however, I am surprised by the lows that he has reached in recent weeks. His disgraceful treatment of the Solicitor-General, the second law officer of this country, has shocked not just the legal community but also many Australians who did not even know that the position existed before last Friday's Senate hearing, but they do now. The Solicitor-General was created as a position in the Commonwealth in 1916 to give independent apolitical advice. This is what the current Solicitor-General, Justin Gleeson QC, was ably doing until 4 May 2016-the date when Senator Brandis destroyed the integrity of the office. On4 May 2016, Senator Brandis tabled a new legal services direction in the Senate which severely limits the ability of the Solicitor-General to do his job. Instead of quickly responding to requests for advice from a government department, a government minister or even the Prime Minister, the Solicitor-General must now submit a request for written consent from Senator Brandis. Let me step this out: the Solicitor-General receives a request for urgent advice from the immigration department, for instance, at 11.30 pm at night. He cannot respond until he can find the Attorney-General, who might be anywhere or out of the country, and he has to wait to receive written confirmation, a written consent, with Senator Brandis' signature. In evidence given to a Senate inquiry hearing on Friday, Mr Gleeson, the Solicitor-General, stated that he had already been forced to disobey the legal services direction in order to respond to a request to urgent advice in the required time frame as he believes he is required to do by the Law Officers Act. He said that the concern over this conflict introduced by Senator Brandis has kept him awake at night since 5 May. This is not something that a man like Mr Gleeson, who has represented Australia at the International Court of Justice and the High Court, and is a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague, could say lightly. Mr Gleeson was treated disgracefully by coalition senators on Friday. I note that a Fairfax Media article today asks if they are 'the rudest men in Australia'. They were certainly the rudest men in the room on Friday. But we should not be surprised after their disgraceful treatment of another fine statutory officer, Professor Gillian Triggs, in previous estimates",252,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
341,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (18:02): When ithearings and, I have to say, in the current estimates hearing. This is not, as the Prime Minister likes to describe it, just a fight between two lawyers, to be duked at in the bar common room-whatever the Prime Minister intends to mean by that phrase. This actually matters. It mattered on the bill last year that enables the government to strip dual nationals of their Australian citizenship. On that bill, Senator Brandis asked the Solicitor-General's advice on two draft versions of the bill but never on the final version. And yet, in a written letter to me and the entire Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, Senator Brandis said that he had. The Prime Minister repeated that mistruth, and let us not underrate the significance of this: Senator Brandis and the Prime Minister have misrepresented the advice that they received on the constitutionality of a bill that is now likely to be subject to a High Court challenge. Because of the Attorney-General's arrogance, the parliament may have passed a bill that will be struck down, and that, if it occurs, is no-one's fault other than Senator Brandis's. It also matters for a current bill before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, called the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016. This is a bill unprecedented in its nature in Australia, which would allow the Attorney General to keep people in prison beyond the term of their sentence. It is absolutely right that Labor does due diligence on this bill. I would like to ask the Minister for Justice on behalf of the Attorney-General what the answer is to the question I asked in a letter that I have just sent to the Attorney-General, at the end of a correspondence starting on Sunday. The question is: has the Solicitor-General advised on the final version of the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016? If not, why not? And how many of the current bills before the parliament has the Solicitor-General been given the opportunity to advise on in their final versions? (Time expired) for Counter-Terrorism) (18:07): The answer to the latter part of what the shadow Attorney General is asking is: I am not familiar with the correspondence that he is talking about. If he is saying that he has just sent it today then I do not know whether there has been a response or not, but I can give him some general points about the issue that he is raising. We have heard a lot about his concerns regarding the Solicitor-General, and the facts about what he is alleging are very well known. As we know, the Attorney-General issued a direction that established a procedure that gives effect to paragraph 12(b) of the Law Officers Act 1964, which provides that a function of the Solicitor-General is: … to furnish his or her opinion to the Attorney-General on questions of law referred to him or her by the Attorney-General… The direction enables government bodies to request Solicitor-General opinions by seeking the consent of the Attorney-General. Very importantly, these arrangements do not limit the independence of the Solicitor-General, as the member for Isaacs appears to be alleging. A lot of the sound and fury around this seems to be about the method of consultation that occurred between the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, but, again, the facts about this are very well known. A consultation occurred in the Attorney-General's office on 30 November 2015, at which the Attorney-General invited the Solicitor-General to provide further feedback in writing about the issue. The 30 November meeting was requested by the Solicitor-General to discuss the process for seeking and acting on Solicitor-General advice in",253,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
342,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Ministersignificant matters. The Attorney-General considered the Solicitor-General's views before finalising the amendments to the direction and the guidance note that accompanies that direction. I think it is very important to note that, since that direction was made, the Attorney General has considered 10 requests for the Solicitor-General to provide an opinion pursuant to paragraph 12(b) of the Law Officers Act, and all 10 requests have been approved. He has also made one direct referral to the Solicitor-General himself. The member for Isaacs raised the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016, which is amendments to the Criminal Code. This is a vitally important initiative of the government to secure community safety. He is right to say that this is quite an extraordinary power that we are requesting the parliament to approve, but of course we are living in an extraordinary time where we do need to give our agencies the powers that they need to do the job that we require of them. This bill provides for the continuing detention of high-risk terrorist offenders. Our decision to introduce a regime of post-detention for serious terrorist offenders is based on the fact that if they were to continue to present an unacceptable risk to community safety then we would continue to detain them. We have had a conversation with all of the states and territories. Every single jurisdiction in Australia endorses the Commonwealth's approach to this. We are very confident that the bill as drafted is constitutionally valid. The Solicitor General has provided advice on the draft bill. Amendments were made to the draft bill that take into account the views of the Solicitor-General, as well as feedback that we received from our partners in the states and territories. Consistent with the long standing practice of this government and previous governments, including a government of which the member for Isaacs was a member, we are not going to comment on the content and nature of the government's legal advice. There have been opportunities for the member for Isaacs to ask questions about this at the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I urge him to continue in this parliament the very constructive approach that was taken in the last parliament. On questions of national security, between 2013 and 2016 we were able to work constructively with the opposition to ensure that we updated the powers that were available to our agencies. The terror threat that we are facing now is vastly different than that we faced previously and we do need to police it in a different way. That requires resourcing for our agencies. We have been providing that. It also requires powers to our agencies. We need to make sure that they can intervene early. If somebody continues to pose a risk to the Australian community, I think the expectation is that we will continue to detain them. compliments to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security from the Minister for Justice. I accept those compliments on behalf of all 11 members of the intelligence committee, a committee which I was very proud to be a member of in the last parliament. The minister is quite right to point out that there was a very cooperative approach brought by all 11 members of the committee to the work of that committee, which resulted in five reports on counterterrorism bills and some 100 recommendations, all of which, demonstrating the work of the committee, were accepted by the government. Perhaps while we are here the minister could answer the questions I have just asked. I will explain again what the purpose of the questioning is. I wrote to the Prime Minister on Sunday,",254,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
343,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (18:12): I accept the16 October-and I am happy to provide these letters to the minister if he has not come armed with them-because there were reports that the citizenship bill was about to be used by the government and that it was about to be almost certainly the subject of a High Court challenge. This citizenship bill is the bill on which the Attorney-General of Australia misled the parliament and the intelligence committee by falsely claiming in a formal letter to me, which is annexed to the report of the intelligence committee, that the Solicitor-General had advised on the bill. The Solicitor-General himself, in a letter dated 12 November 2015, has made clear to the Senate committee that is inquiring into the dealings between the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General that that was a misrepresentation by the Attorney-General of his advice. To get over the problem, because the Attorney-General has already misled the intelligence committee on a previous occasion, I wrote to the Prime Minister to ask him to confirm that the Solicitor-General had, in fact, advised on the new counterterrorism bill, a very difficult and unprecedented counterterrorism measure, that is before the committee and the parliament at the moment-the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016. The question I asked was whether or not the Solicitor-General had been asked to advise on this high-risk terrorist offenders bill. That is the question I am still asking, because Senator Brandis was asked by the Prime Minister to write back to me, which he did on 17 Octoberthe Monday of this week-informing me that, exactly the same as the citizenship bill, the Solicitor-General had advised on some earlier draft of the high-risk terrorist offenders bill but has not, it seems, advised on the bill now before the parliament. Naturally enough, I wrote back to the Attorney-General the same day. I will read out, for the assistance of the minister, what I said: 'I seek further clarification from you that the Solicitor-General has been given the opportunity to advise not just on the draft but on the final version of the bill which is currently before the parliament and the intelligence committee.' That is the answer I am looking for. In addition, I want the minister to answer the other question which he could not answer-that is, how many of the current bills before the parliament has the Solicitor-General been given the opportunity to advise on in their final versions? I hope he has got those questions clear. I am happy to provide the correspondence if he needs it. In the time that is available to me, in addition to those questions, I want to ask if the justice minister agrees with the new legal services direction that was made by the Attorney-General on 4 May. Can he explain why he agrees with this new legal services direction, which is unprecedented, which breaks with a convention that is 100 years old and which is disagreed with not just by the current Solicitor-General but by the former Solicitor-General Dr Gavan Griffith, who served the Commonwealth for 14 years under the Hawke, Keating and Howard governments. I could also ask the justice minister: has he ever sought the advice of the Solicitor-General without going to the Attorney-General first? If he has, why would he not support others doing the same? There is another topic I want to go to that is different to the dealings of the Attorney General with the Solicitor-General. It relates to the way in which this government is treating the Australian Institute of Criminology. It is effectively abolishing the Australian Institute of Criminology and merging it with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. This is very much a government that does not want to listen to the experts. We heard yesterday that the government is prepared to water down our gun laws in order to secure votes in the Senate for its antiworker legislation. Australians en masse were rightly horrified at the possibility that rapid-fire weapons might be let into Australia. Today, we have been hearing righteous indignationMr Keenan interjectingexpired) for Counter-Terrorism) (18:17): To begin with, I want to deal with the last part of what the shadow Attorney-General was saying. Of course I completely and utterly reject the ridiculous assertion that this government in any way, shape or form has sought or would seek to water down Australia's gun laws. That is complete and utter rubbish. I am very happy to go through what has been going on with that. The government has been taking proactive action to ensure that lever action shotguns over a magazine capacity of five are not allowed to be imported into Australia. The shadow Attorney-General was the Attorney-General for a short and rather inglorious period, but I would still expect him to know something about the way we govern gun laws in this country and the way we regulate guns in Australia. It has been absolutely clear to me, from the questioning in the House-not by him, admittedly, but by others on the opposition frontbench-that they would not have a clue about the way we regulate guns in Australia. I am happy to provide a very quick crash course, given I have got limited time. This is a very important question. Ms Butler interjectinggo back to what I was saying before I was rudely interrupted. Under your protection, Deputy Speaker Kelly, I will continue. The way we regulate guns in Australia is very simple: the Commonwealth regulates the import of guns and the states are responsible for the classification of guns. This is, of course, where we have our leverage; it is in relation to the import of guns. As the Minister for Justice, I have used that to ensure that we would not have a large-scale import of lever action shotguns with a magazine capacity of over five. That is in keeping, I think, with the spirit of the NFA even though the original NFA and the NFA that Labor presided over for six years put all lever-action shotguns into category A-the least restrictive category available of licensing around the country. The thing about category A is that all lever-action shotguns were placed in there regardless of their magazine capacity. It is also the case that in category A you could own as many of these guns as you like. CategoryA is the same category that we categorise air rifles in. I did not think that was acceptable, so we took actions to limit the import of lever-action shotguns whilst we had a conversation with the states about where we should ultimately classify these guns. That has taken longer than I would have liked; I would have like to have concluded that conversation before now. But the reality is that not every jurisdiction agrees, and so we have been using our good officers to try and get a national agreement. There are nine jurisdictions in this country. To keep the NFA intact, we all need to move together. That takes a little bit of patience and understanding, but I do feel very confident that over time we will get the states to agree amongst themselves about where to classify lever-action shotguns with a magazine capacity of over five and also with a magazine capacity of under five. Again, I want to explicitly reject the suggestion that the member for Isaacs just made that we would",255,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

346,Mr Keenan,"I would be very happy if you were to ask me a question about that. I willseek, or have sought, to water down Australia's gun laws. It is nonsense, and I am sure he knows it is nonsense. He raised questions about the Solicitor-General. I might just ask him-there was another issue that he raised in between, which has now escaped me. There were three issues he raised in that question. If the member for Isaacs is paying attention, could he remind what the third one was? remind the minister. It was: has the Solicitor-General advised on the final versionfor Counter-Terrorism) (18:21): No, there was another one beyond the Solicitor-General. justice minister agree with the new legal services direction? Can he explain why? Has he ever sought the advice of the Solicitor-General without going to the Attorney-General first? for Counter-Terrorism) (18:21): I will take notes in future, but in fairness, he did jump around between different topics. First, I absolutely reject the assertion that he made that somehow the Attorney-General has misled the House in any way, shape or form. That is not correct. He knows it is not correct and yet he continues to assert it. The Attorney-General has, as I raised in my previous answer, taken a direction and regarded the administrative process by which we get advice from the Solicitor-General. I think I am as surprised as everybody else in the country that it has caused the shadow Attorney-General to feel so aggrieved. It is an administrative process. It is a mere formality. When the Attorney-General has been asked if the Solicitor-General can provide advice, in every single case that he has been asked he has acquiesced to the Solicitor-General providing that advice. Again, I think this is a very straightforward issue and I am surprised it has taken up so much airtime. record that the minister has failed to answer my question twice about whether or not the Solicitor-General advised on the final version of the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016. He has not answered my questions about the legal services direction, nor as to whether he has ever sought the advice of the Solicitor-General without going to the Attorney-General first. Going to the other topic that I wanted to deal with: the righteous indignation that we have heard from the government on the subject of guns today and strident assertions from, in particular, the Prime Minister, that mandatory minimum sentences are the solution to Australia's gun problems. There is no convincing evidence to prove that mandatory minimum sentencing acts as a deterrent. Despite that, the government is pursuing this measure. It is ignoring concerns expressed repeatedly by state and territory prosecutors. It is ignoring the concerns and opposition to mandatory sentencing expressed repeatedly by bar associations across Australia, by law societies across Australia and by the Law Council of Australia, the peak body. Extraordinarily, it is ignoring even the government's own Attorney-General's Department's formal guidelines, which oppose mandatory minimum sentences. Of course, this government refuses to listen to all of those experts.",257,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

351,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (18:22): Hansard willLabor is tough on guns. The minister knows that, and the government knows that. We want to stand with the government to implement sensible crime and justice policy, but this is a government which does not want to listen to the experts. We are deeply concerned that actions this government is taking in that regard will do more harm than good. The determination to persevere with poor policy and to ignore the experts is not new. At the same time as the government is thinking, at least, about watering down our gun laws and talking to people about watering down our gun laws-particularly senators, in exchange for votes in that House-and ignoring law enforcement experts, this government is also destroying our ability to collect independent expert research on crime. A quieter, but very concerning policy proposed by the government over the past year is the merger of the Australian Institute of Criminology with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. This merger would see our national research and knowledge centre on crime and justice moved into what is essentially a law enforcement body. Labor believes that these functions are best undertaken by an independent agency that can guarantee the independence of the work undertaken. For over 40 years the Australian Institute of Criminology has produced expert research on gun control, including research on firearms and violent crime to firearms trafficking and armed robbery. The research has been critical to developing sensible and robust policies to tackle illegal weapons on our streets. Part of the reason why we in this parliament can trust this research-and why Australians generally can trust this research, and why we can rely so heavily on this research-is that it comes from what is seen to be an independent and highly respected source. Its independence allows it to talk to offenders, to talk to law enforcement, to talk to the courts and to talk to victims. It has a broad overview and a unique insight into crime and justice, and it helps policymakers and law enforcement to stop crimes before they occur. Australia's criminologists must be afforded the independence that allows them to pursue the highest quality of research. Without independent, evidence-based data our gun control policy initiatives will be compromised, as will many of the other initiatives in the criminal justice area. Already the research on armed robbery has been cut. We have seen large reductions in staff and, for the first time in years, the Australian Institute of Criminology is failing to reach its research targets. Now is not the time to be making policy in the dark. This government's refusal to listen to experts or to commit to independent criminological research is very concerning. If this government wants to be tough on crime it first needs to understand crime. Labor will never water down our world-leading gun laws, and we will also stand by our internationally-renowned criminological research institutions. We call on the government to do the same. The questions I put to the Minister for Justice are: how many staff were there at the Australian Institute of Criminology before the merger? How many staff are there now? How many criminologists and research staff have left the Australian Institute of Criminology since the merger was announced? How many have been replaced? How much has the merging of back-office operations saved? And, as to the breadth of research: under the proposed merger, who is going to clear AIC research obligations? And can you guarantee that all current AIC monitoring programs will continue? Finally, as to a concern that has been expressed about reduced research output: has the Australian Institute of Criminology met all of its research key performance indicators in 2015-16 and, if not, why not? And if not, has the Australian Institute of Criminology ever failed to meet its key performance indicators before? for Counter-Terrorism) (18:28): I am sorry to hear the shadow Attorney-General attack what has been a very important policy achievement of this government-the creation of the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission-where we took the former Australian Crime Commission, CrimTrac and the Australian Institute of Criminology and created a new and better agency. The reason we did that is that we believed it was vitally important that we create an agency that was fit for purpose in what are changing times. Everyone would appreciate that we are living in a time where information flow, particularly information flow to our law enforcement agencies, is vitally important. We need to make sure that we have cutting-edge technologies and a cutting-edge agency dealing with that. The merger has leveraged the strengths of those three agencies and has improved their capacity to support the police and justice sector. It has also given the AIC direct access to intelligence that it would not have had as a standalone agency. Following the merger, it is absolutely not the case that there will be a reduction in the quality or scope of research from the Australian Institute of Criminology. They form a new research branch within the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission called the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre, which is headed by a senior criminologist researcher and overseen by an ethics committee. As I said, the merger will not impact on the ACIC's ability to provide high-quality research to the broad range of stakeholders that have been provided research over the past 43 years. The member asked me about the determination of their priorities, but it is not up to me as minister to determine their priorities. It is up to the ACIC board. They will take advice from a non-legislative advisory body that consists of the existing Criminology Research Advisory Council members, the state and territory justice agencies and the Commonwealth Attorney General's Department, two representatives from the law enforcement community, two members of the Australian criminal intelligence commission and a representative from the Australia and New Zealand Society of Criminology. This process will ensure that state and territory justice agencies will continue to play an important role in shaping the future direction of the merged agencies' criminological research program. Far from what the member for Isaacs was saying, the research that was previously conducted by the ARC will continue, but it will continue within a new framework within the ACIC. There is obviously a legislative imperative that we get the administrative processes around this right, because this has actually happened. We are dealing now with the fact that the ARC has been merged into the ACIC. If it were to be the case that the opposition were to take a different view, that would complicate things and provide enormous unnecessary bureaucracy for the ACIC. Quite frankly, the ACIC has got very important things to do-tackling national security priorities and organised crime. We need to ensure that the ACIC is focused on what it needs to do-and that is protecting the security of the Australian people. In his contribution, the member for Isaacs again made a series of outlandish and completely incorrect assertions about what we are doing with Australia's gun laws. The gun laws introduced by the Liberal government in 1996 are gun laws of which we are justifiably proud. We would never do anything to dilute the vital importance of the national firearms agreement.",258,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
352,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime MinisterI do not know whether the member understands anything about the way we classify guns or not but he needs to understand that the current situation is that all lever-action shotguns are in category A-every single one. If you have a category A, licence you could literally have a 110 lever-action shotgun with a magazine capacity as long as the technology allows you. That is the current situation. That is the situation we are seeking to address. We have been talking to the states about the way they want to classify the gun. I am hoping we will conclude that conversation. The only thing we are dealing with is the anomaly whereby a relatively high-powered gun in the form of a lever-action shotgun that could have a significant magazine capacity-in this case, over five-is going into the least restrictive category.

If you look at the welfare of a country, you have to have a country that does not have corruption and that has security so people can go about and live their lives. The thing that has been an issue particularly in the electorate of Mallee has been ice. Ice is being run by bikie gangs, and it has been a really significant issue. I have taken great comfort in the minister's strong interest not only in limiting the trafficking of ice but also in limiting the criminal activity that has surrounded that. About a year ago, I spent a night with the Victoria Police in Mildura, which was fun. It was actually the night of the triple j One Night Stand, which was an experience in itself. An honourable member interjectingup any misunderstanding for Hansard! In that, we were also able to have a discussion around what is happening. One of the questions I have got for the minister is: what is the action the government is taking to ensure the safety and security of law enforcement and intelligence officers? I also commend the minister for taking a very strong and respectful interest when it comes to gun laws. People in my electorate are shooters. They are responsible shooters. The great thing about the Howard gun laws, which often gets lost in the discussion, is the cooling-off period-the fact that you cannot get up a head of steam and go out and purchase a gun; you have actually got to wait a month or more. You have got to have a justifiable reason for it. You have got to pass a good character test. That has been very welcome. I am interested in the minister's response about what action he is taking to make sure that people in my community feel safe. I commend him for the work that he has been doing so far. I have particular interest in what he is doing around the topic of ice, because that is an area where, unfortunately, we seem to have people involved in that trade and partaking in illegal firearm importation as well. It disappoints me that the opposition has been very limp-wristed instead of backing the coalition on closing that down. I look forward to a very worthwhile response from the minister. for Counter-Terrorism) (18:38): I thank the member for Mallee for that series of questions. On the issue of crystal methamphetamine, better known as ice, we are facing a very serious problem in Australia, on which the government has taken significant national leadership. We have been concerned for some time around the reports we get from our own law enforcement agencies and from state law enforcement agencies. If any member of parliament were to go and talk to their local emergency department in a hospital, if they were to talk to emergency services workers in other sectors, they would know that the use of crystal methamphetamine has exploded. The last figures we had suggested that there were about 200,000 users of ice in Australia, but it is almost certain that that figure would be significantly more today. We have been very concerned to take national leadership on this, and we wanted to get the best possible advice about what the federal government can do that is actually going to address the issue and work. We asked the former Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Ken Lay to join with two health professionals in a National Ice Taskforce. They travelled the country, talking to people who have been addicted, talking to treatment services, talking to police, talking to people in hospitals, talking to other frontline service workers, and they provided that advice to the government in the latter half of last year.

365,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Ministerresponded with the most significant investment in drug and alcohol rehabilitation in Australia's history. We know that we need to tackle the supply side, which is policing. We are pulling more drugs off the streets; we are locking up more people who are peddling drugs; and we are confiscating more of the assets of serious drug criminals. But we know the supply side is not going to be the only answer here. We need to get people off this drug. We need to make sure that, if they are addicted and they seek treatment, they can get treatment. We have made a $240 million investment in drug and alcohol rehabilitation. This is an extra investment-on top of the investment that we already make and on top of what the states and territories already make-to make sure that help is available to people when they need it. We have also invested an extra $60 million in education and understanding the rehabilitation process for ice, because the detoxification and the rehabilitation process for this very serious drug is different to what you would use for other drugs-it is different to what you would use for alcoholics or heroine addicts or any other drug. We need to make sure that we have rehabilitation services that are actually dealing with the specific issue of crystal methamphetamine. That money flows from 1 July this year, and I hope some of it flowed into the coffers to some people in the electorate of Mallee. Mr Perrett interjectinga vitally important question, was about the protection for our police and law enforcement officers. This is vitally important because we know that police have been the targets of terror attacks in Australia. The first terror attack we had was at the Endeavour Hills police station in Melbourne in 2014. That was where a Vic. police officer and an AFP officer were both stabbed by the same perpetrator, who was subsequently killed. Last year we had the murder of Curtis Cheng out the front of the Parramatta police station. We know that police are specifically targeted by those who would seek to do harm in the community. In fact, the Director-General of Security upgraded the terrorism threat level specifically for law enforcement to probable, which is a reflection on the fact that we need to protect our police better. I am very pleased to say that in this year's budget, the 15-16 budget, the government provided $153.6 million over the next four years in recognition of the current threat of terrorist acts against law enforcement agencies. This measure will see a range of measures implemented across Australia. The AFP received additional funding of $19.8 million over four years and will redirect $28.7 million over four years from within existing resources. The ACIC also received just over $5 million for their security. Yes, the member for Mallee has identified a very serious problem; yes, we have been taking action to make sure that our law enforcement officers have appropriate protections. We are very proud of the fact that in a very constrained fiscal environment we have been able to find the money for something that is so vitally important. emits a high-frequency sound, which causes physical harm to children and young adults, is being imported into Australia and marketed as an anti-loitering device.

It can have even more serious effects on children who have autism. These devices are being purchased for the purpose of dispelling groups of adolescents through the emission of the high-frequency sound, even though the young people have done no wrong and have a legal right to assemble. One of these devices was installed in a shopping centre in Hervey Bay in Queensland, but it was recently taken down after the community legal centre advocated on behalf of the young workers and visitors to the shopping centre. These young people were perhaps saving up in their jobs to pay for their houses or perhaps their avocado breakfasts. Has the minister given permission for the importation of these devices as an acoustic antipersonnel device under item (5) in part 2 of schedule 13 of the Customs Prohibited Imports Regulations Act 1956? Will the minister look into how this device was ever imported? Can the minister inform the community, particularly young people, about this?

Communications and the Arts Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $1,405,327,000 Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (18:45): We know that the National Broadband Network is one of Labor's and this century's great policy initiatives. Given its importance, we must have a serious conversation about the path going forward. Labor took a policy to the 2016 election which would have seen fibre to the home rolled out to homes in the fixed-line footprint that were not in the current fibre-to-the-node construction pipeline. This would have expanded fibre to 40 per cent of households. This was less than the original 93 per cent target in our 2009 policy, but it recognised where things stood. The policy was thoroughly costed, and would have delivered fibre access across Australia at a rollout cost of between $49 to $57 billion. Our policy objective has remained consistent: to connect fibre to as many homes and premises as possible. In contrast, what has transpired since the 2013 strategic review has been technological confusion, increasing complexity, increased costs and rollout delays. This has translated into a poor user experience and a lack of confidence by the majority of Australians in the ability of the NBN to meet our future needs. We have also clearly seen a detrimental impact on retail service providers. The cost of the copper-dominated NBN is currently projected to be between $46 and $54 billion. If only this government had the conviction to stay the course, Australians would have had access to a better network for largely the same cost! As I have outlined previously, the root cause is that this government lacks a coherent policy vision. This confusion has led the",263,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
368,Mr Keenan (Stirling,"Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Ministergovernment to take its hands off the wheel. There is clearly a lack of comprehension and interest from the current communications minister in the project, and his vision could be described as pedestrian, to say the least. We on this side recognise the transformational power provided by high-speed broadband. I recognise the reality of where the network is up to; we are aware of the operational and systems complexity that are now baked into this multi-technology patchwork. Fragmentation, whether that be in the access network or in the IT systems, does have material impacts on organisation cohesion, customer experience and retailer viability. So, come the next election-whenever that is held-regrettably, an incoming government will not be dealing with a blank slate. Engineering decisions will have been made, contracts will have been entered into and the network footprint will have taken shape. So what we will have is a patchwork of some form. It is a question of how that patchwork can best be shaped by what we do in the present. With this in mind, I want to pose the question: if this government refuses to contemplate fibre infrastructure, then what is the next-best alternative to their current course? What does a fibre-enhanced middle path looked like? The cost of deploying FTTN is now estimated to be around $2,300 per premises. In comparison, the cost of fibre to the distribution point is estimated to be around $2,700 per premises. For consumers, the prospect of more fibre and less copper means better speeds to support the applications of the future. It is also good news for retailers, because they will earn more revenue over the faster network and can deliver a better experience for their customers over newer infrastructure. The underlying technology network designed for fibre to the distribution point also offers better prospects relative to FTTN by preserving a viable upgrade path to take the fibre to the premises into the future. The Vertigan panel did not model the incremental costs or benefits of fibre to the distribution point versus FTTN in 2014. And, in fairness, fibre to the distribution point was not as developed then as it is now, and so perhaps the costs were not sufficiently known to enable this type of analysis to take place. But if this government insists on locking in copper as the primary infrastructure delivery mechanism, they should do so in a responsible way that preserves a viable upgrade path to fibre in the future. Within the parameters of their copper-driven world view, they should be seeking to deliver Australians the best and most reliable service. The comparative merits of fibre to the distribution point and fibre to the node should be analysed in an objective way to evaluate the best path forward. These decisions cannot be outsourced to NBN Co. We cannot expect NBN Co itself to be guided by public interest, as this is not its mandate. This does require policy leadership and it is the government's job to lead. My questions to the minister are as follows: will the government be examining the merits of using fibre to the distribution point as the preferred access network in areas where fibre to the node and HFC build has not commenced? And will the government undertake to ensure that any fibre-to-the-distribution-point design and deployment preserves the option of a fibre upgrade path for end users? shadow minister for the opportunity to respond on the question of the multi-technology mix which characterises the NBN, which is being rolled out by the Turnbull government.",264,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
369,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield,"Minister for Urban Infrastructure) (18:50): I thank theAnd that rollout is going well. As at 13 October, there were 3,252,709 premises which were able to connect. Of course, when Labor left government in 2013 there were barely 50,000 services in operation. So what we are seeing is the rollout of the NBN gathering pace, and a very substantial number of Australians are now able to access the National Broadband Network using the multi-technology model-a combination of fibre to the premises, fibre to the node and, of course, the HFC-hybrid fibre coax. I do emphasise the point-despite some of the ill-informed rhetoric that we hear-that all of those modes involve fibre at different stages of the network. When the incoming coalition government developed the multi-technology mix-more specifically, when NBN developed the multi-technology mix-with the assistance of extensive external consulting advice and also drawing on the capabilities of the management team, amongst the considerations was how best to achieve the rollout in the speediest possible fashion, bearing in mind that after six years' rhetoric we had inherited a situation where there was an enormous amount of talk about an NBN network but very little had been delivered. As I mentioned, barely 50,000 Australians were actually able to get a broadband service, and the primary service delivered by the NBN was supporting photo ops-and they were very good at supporting photo opportunities. If then Prime Minister Gillard had a desire to appear in a photo op with a hard hat and a high-vis vest, then the NBN was at her service. If then Minister Conroy had a desire to be photographed or videoed feeding fibre into a pit, then the NBN was at his service. But when it came to actually rolling out fibre-rolling out the National Broadband Network-it turned out that the company charged with doing that had done a truly dismal job. Now partly that was undoubtedly due to the fact that there was almost nobody on the board who had any serious telecommunications experience. And the chief executive, while certainly with distinguished experience running one of the largest telecommunications equipment vendors, was not an experienced networks executive. We fixed those issues. We fixed those issues when we came to government. We put in Ziggy Switkowski as chair, one of Australia's most experienced telecommunications executives-the former chief executive of both Optus and Telstra. We put in an experienced and capable management team and we charged the management team with developing the multi-technology mix-the combination of fibre to the premises, fibre to the node, hybrid fibre coaxAn opposition member: Yesterday's technology tomorrow. telecommunications industry? like AT&T, British Telecommunications and Deutsche Telekom, and one of the reasons they use it is the speed of the rollout. This was precisely the point that the management team of NBN, together with extensive consultancy advice, arrived at. One of the key considerations was getting the rollout achieved and delivered quickly. And, of course, that is now what is happening. Look at the rate of rollout compared to the performance of the previous Labor government, which, as I have mentioned, managed to connect barely 50,000 people to the network in six years. They spent $6 billion, but they connected barely 50,000 premises to the",265,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

Mr Burke: A point of order! Mr Burke: I raise my point of order understanding order 185, which states that rules for the House apply to the Federation Chamber. In accordance with the rules that apply when we are in the conduct of debate, I refer you to pages 503 and 432 of House of Representatives Practice. Mr Burke: On page 503, at the commencement of the second-last paragraph, it says: Although the allocation of the call is a matter for the discretion of the Chair, it is usual, as a principle, to call Members from each side of the House, government and non-government, alternately. It then goes on to explain the treatment of Independents-I believe there are none within the room. The final sentence of that section says: The call is alternated to each side of the Chamber even when government and opposition Members are not on opposing sides of a debate, for example, in cases of a free vote. I then take you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to page 432Ms Henderson: But I am a government memberMr Burke: Page 432 of Practice deals specifically with consideration in detail. You will find under the subheading, 'Consideration in detail', if you go to the third paragraph: The Federation Chamber goes through the schedule portfolio by portfolio, debating for each portfolio the question 'that the proposed expenditure be agreed to.' That is what I wanted to read to you. The allocation of the call during this part of the parliament's procedures follows the allocation of the call for when we are debating, not the allocation of the call as if it were a form of question time. If it were question time, the questions to the executive would alternate between opposition members and government backbench, with a minister responding on each occasion. In the time. I have been in this room tonight, that is what you have been following. WhatI am advising you, Deputy Speaker, is that is the way the standing orders work for question time. We are not in question time. The Federation Chamber is debating a question. Between each speaker you have been repeating to the chamber the question we are debating. That means the speeches from the minister, even if they amount in their content to a response to a question, count as speeches from the government. If government backbenchers are to make speeches and occupy time during this, then it can only happen if the minister does not",266,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

Mr Burke: It is not a matter of interpretation. I am simply reading to you what Practice says. When debate is occurring, the call alternates between government and opposition, quite rightly. When government members are seeking the call, you have given preference to a government minister over a government backbencher. Those sorts of precedents are something that is quitequestion-the question that the proposed expenditure be agreed to-and then I have given the call to whoever has been standing. I have not put that question again when the minister has answered the question. Mr Burke: If you have been neglecting to remind the House what the question before it is at different points and when you put that, that raises a completely different issue. It does not change the fact that the House is debating at this point. We are not in question time; we are in Consideration in Detail debating a matter, and the call should alternate. When the call goes to the government side, if you want to give the call to the member for Corangamite, so be it. But when it was the turn for the call to go to the government side, you repeatedly, across two ministers, gave the call to the minister. Having done that, the next call should go to the opposition. not restate the questionMr Burke: No, it is not whether or not you restated the question. question that was put. The member for Corangamite on this point of order. Ms Henderson: In my previous experience of Consideration in Detail, the ruling has been made that the alternation of speakers is between government speakers and opposition speakers, both being given the opportunity to ask questions of the minister. Now, I refer to the provisions of the standing orders that the Manager of Opposition Business has read out today. The standing orders do not provide for what the Manager of Opposition Business is arguing. There is no specific provision in the standing orders which reflects what the Manager of Opposition Business is arguing. SoI would put to you that it is a matter of discretion, and previous practice is-and it certainly was on the last occasion that I spoke on these mattersthat there has been an alternation. It follows as a matter of logic that if you do not make that ruling then government members can readily be denied any opportunity to ask a question. SoI would ask you to stay with your ruling. Mr Burke: The critical issue here-and there is no reference to the quotes I gave from Practice to it being different depending on whether or not you have stated the question-is that the call goes alternately from the government side to the opposition side.

If the minister seeks to engage in that debate, then that may well be the call you give for the government. But the fact that you have given the call to whomever you have chosen on the government side means the next call must come to the opposition, otherwise the reference I gave in Practice is being completely ignored. This is no small issue. It goes to whether or not, in Consideration in Detail, this House will continue the practice of the opposition being given equal time to the government. We accept that that is not how question time works-we do not love it, but no opposition ever has-but Practice is clear that we are debating when we are up here right now, and, with respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you are giving consecutive calls to government members, whether they be ministers or backbenchers, then Practice is not being followed. Ms Henderson: To the member for Watson's further point, I would put to you that we are actually alternating between government and opposition speakers and that the definition of 'debate' does not require government speakers to be excluded. The purpose of the consideration-in-detail debate is for the minister to answer questions. It is totally proper. To the extent that there is any concern about the interpretation of the standing orders-because it does not provide what the member for Watson is actually saying-I would ask you to use your discretion on this occasion. Mr Broadbent: I have great respect for the member for Watson and his knowledge of the standing orders. However, the practice in this place has been, as I understand it, that the chair takes from the opposition first, the minister has an opportunity to answer and the chair then defers the next question to the government and so it goes. If the minister chooses to answer at any time through the exercise-and I put this process to the member for Watson-he can take three or four interventions or propositions from either side and then answer all of those. It has been done in different ways. But, if the member for Watson is trying to say that the minister answering a question is therefore a government speaker, that has not been the practice. For the information of the room, we had a very long meeting on this with the chairs and deputy chairs of both sides of the House and we agreed that this was the process up here as it was explained to us-and that is my understanding of the practice. Mr Burke: IfI may, I will respond to the issues that were very respectfully and decently raised just then. I have a copy of that report of the Standing Committee of Procedure in front of me now and I will read from it: The participation of government backbench Members should not, however, result in a disproportionate allocation of time to the government side, as is currently the case. We have a resolution from that Procedures Committee that, when that practice has been followed, it has been wrong. And there have been occasions where what the member for McMillan describes has occurred in here. Originally, when this practice first started, the only people who would come in and question ministers were opposition members. That is how it used to happen. It used to be very, very rare for anyone from the government to stand up. So then the question and answer format just flowed.",268,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

384,The Deputy Speaker,"The member for Watson further on the point of order?The report from that Procedures Committee in the last term made clear that, with the participation government members, the logical way to make sure that you still have equal time is for the minister to not immediately respond to every opposition question; that sometimes the minister will sit back, allow a government backbencher to make a contribution and it will come back to another opposition question and then the minister will respond to the different issues that have been raised. But we cannot have a situation where it is debate, as this is, and the opposition is getting less than half the time. Mr Broadbent: Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I take it is on indulgence, because there is no other reason that I can stand up. Mr Burke: It is on the point of order. Mr Broadbent: In continuance of the point of order: in consideration of the issues that the member for Watson has respectfully put before the chair, it was agreed that government members should not be taking up their full amount of time; that they should be considerate of the committee room in the process of what we are doing to give everybody ample opportunity-and I hope that has been the case. But it does not mean that government members cannot play a role in the process. consideration-in-detail process is something that I have had some concerns with since I have been here as far as the allocation of time. My concern is that members from both sides should have equal opportunity to ask a question of the minister. Ultimately, if I read the standing orders, 'the allocation of the call is a matter for the discretion of the chair.' After that there are a whole lot of advisory points. It is my opinion that I should take it alternately. If the minister chooses to answer, he can. The minister may also choose not to answer and so he will take another question. Therefore, what I propose to do is give the call to the member for Corangamite. If the minister does not want to then take the answer, I will go to the member for Whitlam. Mr Burke: Mr Deputy Speaker, can I clarify so I know exactly what the ruling is. I am not going to continue to argue. I have put my case. I just want to make sure that I know what your ruling is. You are saying that, if a minister responds to an opposition question, that speech will not count as a contribution from the government side? Mr Burke: I move: That the Deputy Speaker's ruling be dissented from. Mr Dreyfus: I second that motion. the minister is happy, I will give the call to the member for Whitlam. The member for Whitlam will have the call and the minister will not answer and the call will go to the member for Corangamite.

However, the administration of the program has been quite wanting. This is a $220 million program-$220 million worth of Commonwealth government funds, taxpayer funds, are dedicated to the shared objective of ensuring that mobile phone services are available to people in rural and regional Australia on the same basis as they are for people who live in the cities. That is a very laudable objective that enjoys broad support across the House. The program was initiated pursuant to an election commitment in June 2015. The first round, worth $110 million of taxpayer money, was allocated to provide funds to build base stations in up to 500 locations that were nominated as black spots throughout the country. By way of background: there are currently 10,000 nominated black spots throughout the country. That is right. Deputy Speaker Kelly, I know you come from a rural area. A lot of them will be in your electorate. There are 10,000 mobile phone black spots throughout the country. It is matter of deep concern to those of us on this side of the House that the administration of the program has been found wanting. Indeed, the member for Greenway last year wrote to the Australian National Audit Office asking them to conduct an audit in relation to round 1 of the program. I have to say that the findings of the Audit Office are of deep concern to every Australian who cares about the allocation of taxpayer dollars and to every Australian who wants one of those 10,000 black spots covered by a new base station. The Audit Office has found that one in four of the base stations that were funded by the government provided no new or additional coverage. In fact, it says on page 9 of the report: … up to 89 base stationsabout 25 per cent of those funded in round 1provided minimal benefits to consumers in areas that previously did not have any coverage and, as a result, did not score a single point for coverage …",270,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process

393,Mr Stephen Jones (Whitlam) (19:12,"My questions go to the Mobile Black SpotThe cost of that failure was $28 million. We have discovered, from our reading of the report and material that has come through Senate estimates in the last 24 hours, that there has been monumental incompetence in the administration of this program. Our question to the minister who is representing the minister in this chamber today and who was the parliamentary secretary responsible for the design and administration of the program is: why did mobile black spot funding go to base stations that provided only minimal benefits to consumers? Why did that happen? Why was $28 million worth of taxpayer funds wasted on base stations that provided no or minimal benefits to consumers? I have heard the minister previously say that one of the objectives of the program was to provide increased competition. On its face, that stacks up. But, if you look at the allocation of the funds under the Mobile Black Spot Program, the overwhelming majority of the funds went to the largest incumbent: Telstra. Is it any wonder that this report, in its damning conclusion about the administration of round 1 of the program, found that substantial consolidation of existing coverage by the big telecommunication players, particularly Telstra, resulted from round 1 of the program? So they cannot say that putting $28 million worth of mobile black spot funding into towers that provided no or minimal benefit to consumers was okay because it was increasing competition. The audit commission has already dealt with that issue. The minister has questions to answer on this. Today he is the minister representing the minister from the other place, but he was the parliamentary secretary who was responsible for designing and administering the program. The parliament deserves some answers on this question. advise that I came in and witnessed the discussion that was had. I have spoken to the minister. One thing that is not in dispute is that this chamber adjourns at 7.30. SoI propose that questions can be asked until 25 minutes past seven. I will call whoever is on their feet at 25 minutes past seven and allow the minister the last five minutes. That is the best use of everyone's time. Ms HENDERSON (Corangamite) (19:17): Out of respect for all members here in the chamber, I will keep my question relatively short. I would also like to put to the minister a question in relation to our Mobile Black Spot Program. I note that, in my electorate in round 1, 10 base stations were funded. None of those areas had any proper mobile coverage. I have to say that Labor, in the previous six years, did not provide one dollar to fix one mobile black spot anywhere in the country. In contrast, our program has been absolutely applauded throughout all rural and regional communities right across this nation. I know that when we turned on the mobile base station in Carlisle River-the first base station to be turned on in Corangamite-a tiny settlement for the first time felt that somebody was listening. Dereel, where there was a terrible bushfire in February 2013-again a community that felt completely isolated because they did not have access to mobile coverage-has also been funded, along with Gellibrand, and base stations have been fast-tracked there. I also want to briefly mention Bellbrae, Anglesea, Aireys Inlet and Birregurra, which have also been funded in election commitments that we gave prior to the last election. For the communities I represent-a very large regional area in Victoria-I am incredibly proud of what we are delivering. I ask the minister to update the chamber on the rollout of the",271,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
394,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Coulton,"BeforeI call the member for Corangamite, IMobile Black Spot Program and the extent to which this is making a real difference in rural and regional communities. Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) (19:19): The 2016 budget saw a concerning drop in financial support for community radio. The services provided by community radio bring diversity to the broadcasting sector and deliver services that are not delivered by commercial stations, particularly in regional areas of the country. In my electorate I have several community radio stations, and they provide an urgent and important service. It is my understanding that in the 2016 budget we saw a decrease in funding for community radio broadcasters from $3.7 million per annum to $2.3 million per annum. This will mean that community broadcasters cannot proceed with the rollout of digital radio, even though commercial stations are committed to moving in this direction. Can the minister please advise what evidence was used to support this decision to cut such funding? I ask that question in the light of the fact that a reduction in the forward estimates for commercial broadcasters is around $163 million, so it would appear to me that, while lending a hand to commercial networks, this government has, by cutting the funding of community radio, hurt community broadcasters and hurt communities. Given the projects that they wish to complete in the near future, community radio is seeking a commitment of $2.2 million per annum over the forward estimates. However, it is also my understanding that the Community Broadcasting Association wrote to Minister Fifield seeking such extra funding and received a reply indicating that the government would deny that. Can the minister advise on the evidence used to make this decision, given the impact of the lack of digital resources and the effect that would have on community radio? With respect to a community radio station in my electorate-Adelaide Hills FM, 88.9-I recently wrote to Minister Fifield in relation to a permanent broadcasting licence for the station. My letter remains unanswered, so I am using this opportunity to talk about this. The radio station is the only one based in the Adelaide Hills. It provides crucial support to the community, including broadcasting of local sporting fixtures and, most critically, it provides advice in relation to weather and bushfires-and we are a high-risk bushfire area. My understanding is that in order to gain a permanent licence, which it is very keen to do, Adelaide Hills FM must be invited by the Australian Communications and Media Authority to apply for one. Could the minister provide me with an update in relation to the Australian Communications and Media Authority. Has he spoken to it to invite Adelaide Hills Radio to apply for a permanent licence. If not, could I ask the minister to give an undertaking to do so. In my remaining time. I would like to talk about mobile phone coverage in my electorate. I was very pleased with the government's election promise for my community to receive mobile phone coverage for blackspots in Ashbourne and Stokes Bay on Kangaroo Island. I would like to ask the minister: when will the government be inviting mobile phone network operators to bid for funding to provide coverage to Ashbourne and on Kangaroo Island? When does the government expect these locations will have full mobile phone coverage? Thank you. because of the time, I will give the call to the minister and at 28 minutes past we will need to go through this appropriation.",272,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
395,The Deputy Speaker,"We will need a minute at the end to close the House down so,range of questions there. Let me come first to the question raised by the member for Mayo in relation to community radio. The position is that the government will provide $15.491 million in 2016-17 to support the community broadcasting sector, including $2.28 million for community digital radio. This funding will continue to be administered by the Community Broadcasting Foundation. There is ongoing funding at the rate of $2.28 million per year for the digital radio project to support the digital community radio services operating in the five mainland capitals. In relation to your specific question about Adelaide Hills FM, I will ask Minister Fifield to come back to you with a response on that. In relation to your question about Ashbourne and Stokes Bay, I am advised that those were probably under round 3. I will get some more advice about the timing of that and come back to you. The member for Corangamite asked what progress is being made in relation to the Mobile Black Spots Program round 1 and the rollout. That rollout is gathering momentum. When last I checked, I think, it was 69 base stations that have now been rolled out, and both Telstra and Vodafone are continuing to roll out base stations. Ms Rowland interjectingand Vodafone are continuing to roll out base stations, and so the program is proceeding in a very satisfactory fashion. That leads me to the issues raised by the member for Whitlam. I want to put on the record a number of extracts from the Australian National Audit Office report in relation to the Mobile Black Spots Program: The department established the key elements that would be expected to form part of a competitive, merit-based grants programme … … … … The department appropriately identified black spots to guide the location of proposed base stations to be funded under the MBSP through its Database of Reported Locations … … … … The department developed programme guidelines that reflected the objectives of the programme and contained an appropriate range of information about the programme to facilitate the submission of applications … Let us go to the question that the member put, which was: are taxpayers getting value for money out of this project? The funding commitment from the Commonwealth government was $100 million. The ultimate amount of money which is being expended to deliver base stations is $385 million. That reflects the fact that the program was carefully designed to attract private sector investment from the mobile operators, and both Telstra and Vodafone put significant dollars on the table. It also attracted significant funding from state governments. New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and WA all put money into the program, and we quite carefully designed it so that the state and Commonwealth money could work together so there was an efficient and competitive process. The member for Whitlam goes to what is an important point: the fact that there is a competitive imbalance and Telstra has the largest network. One way we could have designed",273,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
396,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield,Minister for Urban Infrastructure) (19:23): There are a,274,Pirsa Was Responsible For Managing That Process
397,Mr Fletcher,"That is absolutely correct, Shadow Minister. Well done. Both Telstrathis program would have been to say, 'We will allocate all of the money in one big lump.' We chose not to do that. We very specifically designed a base-station-by-base-station competitive selection process, and we specifically allocated points in the process for co-funding from other sources. So the member for Whitlam is right: there is an important competitive issue to address. The program was designed very carefully to try and maximise competition, and it succeeded in that regard. Vodafone came in and put competitive pressure on Telstra, and that secured a much better outcome for taxpayers: 499 base stations was well at the top end of anybody's expectations. This was a great outcome for rural and regional Australians. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Debate adjourned. Federation Chamber adjourned at 19:29.
