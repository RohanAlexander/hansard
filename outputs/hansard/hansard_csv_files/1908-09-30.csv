We have had, for instance,. a long speech by the honourable member for NeAy England, who, after declaring that he viewed this question from a national stand-point, concluded by advocating the selection of a site in his own electorate. the Minister of Trade ancl Customs. The honourable member made the same declaration, ancl yet we find that of all the sites proposed the only one that recommends itself to him is within his own constituency.

I have no hesitation in saying that the honourable member's memory iseither at fault, or that in making that assertion he has deliberately attempted to mislead the House.

Unfortunately there has been great difference of opinion amongst those of us -who represent that State.

H is suggestion is not new. A similar one was made some years ago by Mr Skene, then representing Grampians, and ever since Victorians have been putting it forward as a bait to entrap the representatives of New South Wales. If it were resolved that the Parliament should meet in one of the big cities of the Commonwealth, I should like it to meet in the capital of my native State; but if an alteration ot the Constitution were agreed '.to, it might be provided that the Capital House as to where the Capital is to be? should be put anywhere in Australia, in which case New South Wales would lose all chance of preserving her rights. vent the opening up of the question now? not become New South Wales members to propose an alteration which may have that It has been said, effect. the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Parkes there would have to be expenditure on two capitals, first on one at Sydney, and, later, on another in the Federal territory. in the best interests of the people of Australia and of our legislation, Parliament should be removed as f a r as possible from the influence of the big cities, and should meet in a capital of its own. If the selection of Dalgety is re-affirmed, we shall be faced with a number of difficulties. In the first place, the Treasurer, one of the strongest Ministers in the Cabinet, has declared that, so far as he is concerned, nothing should be done to expedite the building of a capital there. Secondly, there will be the opposition of all those who are against the expenditure of money on a bush capital-and a large number have been influenced in this direction by the We cannot get daily press of , Victoria. Then, certain honourable members desire that the Federal territory shall comprise at least 900 square We must fight for it miles, and have access to the sea. If Dalgety is re-affirmed with those stipulations, we shall have to deal with a hostile Government in New South Wales; because it is well known that the Wade AdminisTo break up the tration will not go out of its way to afford facilities for giving effect to these proposals.

The request for ai port even in connection with Canterra is a breach of the compact with the people of New South Wales. quote extracts from the speeches of several of those who supported the acceptance of the Constitution on the ground that no matter where the Capital might be placed, Sydney would be its port.

It was thought ancl put before the people of Sydney and New South Wales that the Capital would be placed in such a position that Sydney would be materially benefited. The next leader to whom I wish to refer is the right honourable member for East Svdney. After coming from the Premiers' Conference he spoke at Goulburn, on 16th June, 1899, with reference to the Capital, as followsI am not saying this to-night to please you. I said it in February last when coming through Albury. They asked me if the Federal Capital would be there, and I said that in my opinion it would be on the southern line a little below Goulburn. That was the statement of the honourable member for East Sydney, coming fresh from the Premiers' Conference, at which there was put upon the agreement the construction to which I have already referred. on mv way back from the Conference, that very thing. They asked me if they would have the Capital. member said it was not human nature for a Sydney man to have to go to Albury. human nature for Sydney men to be kept at Melbourne, when we are entitled to have the Capital in New South Wales under the terms pf the Constitution. members have kept us here all the time. Opposition in this House has been doing his level best ever since the Federal Parliament first met, to get the compact carried out. nished by the fact that when the right honourable member for East Sydney led the Government, with the honourable member for North Sydney as his Minister of Home Affairs, although they were opposed to the Dalgety site, and had fought strongly against it, they were prepared, when in -office, to carry out the wish of Parliament in order to get the matter settled. honourable member for Gippsland is not justified in saying that we have kept the Seat of Government in Melbourne, seeing that our party, when holding the reins of office, did. their best to have the Capital established on the site chosen by this Parliament. bers' opposite use their influence with the Sydney authorities for that purpose? capable of doing its own business without attempting to influence the Government of New South Wales. The honourable member ' for Hume, speaking on 31st May, 1899, at Waverley, is reported to have saidThe excess of population in the Colony in the future would be to the north of Sydney and not to the south of it, and the Capital should be placed in Armidale or somewhere in that direction. Perhaps there might be something in the argument that Sydney should not be the Capital. Still, we had a right for the Capital to be placed within a reasonable distance of the metropolis of New South Wales. Tooma! for what the honourable member for Hume' does. No doubt his action was contrary to the statement he made to the people of Sydney at that time. I will give him I told the people at Albury, credit for being one of the leading men in New South Wales who fought in the interests of that State when the question of entering the Federation was being decided. I have always been prepared to give him credit for what he did in the fight over the Constitution Bill. The honourable member on that occasion used the exact words""within a reasonable distance from Sydney""-whic h appear in the minute of the Premiers' Conference of that year. This shows clearly that at that time the construction put on the agreement-in his mind and in the minds of many of us-wa s that while the Capital should not be within 100 miles of Sydney, it should be within a reasonable distance of it. The statements of Sir Edmund Barton, Mr Justice O'Connor, the right honourable member for A striking example of that is furEast. Sydney, and the honourable member for Hume, ought to be Sufficient to lead any reasonable man to the conclusion that when the Constitution was being fought for in New South Wales, the people of Sydney and other parts of the State were clearly told that the Capital, while i,t was not to be in Sydney, was to be w'itliin a reasonable distance of it, and that wherever The it was placed, Sydney would have the opportunity of being its port.

I ask those who are disposed to vote for Dalgety for various reasons-som e I am justified in saying will do so with a view to hanging the matter up so that money may not be expended on a bush Capital-if , when Dalgety is again selected, they will insist on the Government finding funds to build tlie Capital there? Although the compact will not be carried out, the ""people of New South Wales are entitled to have immediate steps taken, when Dalgety is again selected, to have the necessary buildings put in such a position that Parliament may meet there at the earliest possible moment. I hope there will be no trickery or intrigue over the matter. We have to face the direct statement of the Treasurer, an influential member of the Cabinet, that he will allow nothing to be done at Dalgety with a view to Parliament meeting there if he can possibly help it , but I trust there will be a sufficient number of honourable members so sincere in the matter as to insist, when Dalgety is chosen, that the Government shall proceed at the earliest moment to carry out, at any rate, that part of the compact with New South Wales. We appear to have had some of the worse sides of political life displayed to this House and to the people of Australia over the Capital site question. When the Federal Parliament first met, the present Prime Minister and others talked about the higher and rarer atmosphere in which we were to live in the arena of national politics, as compared with the state of affairs previously in existence in the States. But T, as one who had considerable experience in the State Parliament of New South Wales, fail to recognise that we in this Parliament have lived up to that ideal. I am sorry the right honourable member for Swan is not in his place, because he, as Premier of the State of Western Australia, in conference with five other Premiers 'representing the other States, actually put his signature to a comSydney, on behalf of New South Wales, pact which, for a long time past, and even to-day, he has been, and is doing, his best to repudiate. The whole movement to establish the Capital at Dalgety was begun between the present Minister of Trade and Customs and the right honourable member for Swan, in order to ' "" down ' ' their colleague, the present Treasurer, so far as the Capital site was concerned. I ask the honourable member for Fremantle, who so strongly declared last night that he was following the lead of the right honourable member for Swan in the matter, to remember that the report which that right honourable gentleman wrote was not the report of Sir John Forrest, as a surveyor, or as an experienced explorer, but was the report of the right honourable member for Swan, in company with the Minister of Trade and Customs, when both of them were doing their best to "" d o w n "" their colleague. very nice insinuation. ment to make, but I am satisfied that that was the beginning of the movement in favour of Dalgety. The right honourable member for Swan repudiates by his action his signature to the minute adopted at the Premiers' Conference. If the right honourable member for Swan acted in a straightforward and honourable fashion he would feel as Sir George Turner felt when in this House, and would not be using the large influence which he possesses amongst a number of honourable members, not to put the Capital within a reasonable distance of Sydney, but to drag if as far away as he possibly can-to the utmost limits of the State. Surely such an action on fche part of a gentleman occupying the high position of the right honourable member for Swan, in virtual repudiation of his own signature, calls, for strong language. The right honourable gentleman was not at the Conference merely as Sir John Forrest, but as representing, the people of the great State of Western Australia. What a scene there would have been in the Housei f , in connection with the transcontinental railway peating. What a scene there would have been, if there had been a written and signed' compact for the construction of that line, and the right honourable member for East had repudiated his signature, as the right honourable member for .Swan now does in the case of the Federal Capital! a signed understanding be in the face of the Constitution *? dinary construcfion to put on the Constitution ! member for Swan does not attempt to-",17,Dudley Papers

I trust that the amendment of the honourable member for Parkes will be defeated, because I feel satisfied that if the New South Wales representatives seek to amend the Constitution, the effect will be that, although the Federal Parliament may meet in Sydney for ten years, the Federal Capital will finally be last to New South Wales, and those who have to live there after us will curse the day when their representatives were so treacherous to their best interests. Air. ROBERTS (Adelaide) [3.44] I was very much impressed with the cool, calm, ancl dispassionate manner in which the honourable member for Parkes submitted his amendment; in fact, so cool, calm, and dispassionate were his terms that I think the speech earned for itself tlie additional diswill probably then be a Federal State. tinction of being calculated. After his speech J looked very carefully into the wording of the amendment, and I failed to find there the additional claim which the honourable member made for his proposal and his remarks-of being thoroughly impartial. Had they been so, I should have been disposed, after an investigation of the amendment, to give very serious attention to it . But, with the hope that the honourable memIier may be able to add the distinction of impartiality, I intend to suggest some additions to his amendment which, if made, will justify more favorable consideration for it than appears to have been given to it at the present time. amendment distinctly means that the honourable member has no great reverence for the Constitution, and that, i'f it ever suited T i m e after time the his opinions for the time being, he would readily seek an alteration. It would be valuable to place on record the fact that if at any time the honourable member-who , if I read him aright in the past, has stated that he has some reverence for the Constitution-find s that his opinions differ from what is there set down, he will be ready to advocate an amendment. The second part of the amendment proposes that the Seat of Government shall remain where it is for about two ancl a half years, and thereafter for ten years be fixed in Sydney, and shall there remain-althoug h the amendment is not quite clear on the point pending a permanent and final solution of the difficulty. That does not appear to me to be a thoroughly impartial proposal; but, in order to make it so, I suggest the addition of words providing that for periods of ten years following the Capital shall be fixed in Brisbane, Hobart, Perth, and Adelaide, in the order named. Honourable members will notice that, with becoming modesty, I leave Adelaide to the last. done then? rives I cannot reasonably expect to enjoy -any of the benefits from the fixing of the Capital in Adelaide, but I suggest that it shall remain there pending the per manent settlement of the difficulty, not in the terms of the Constitution, but according to the wish of the then Federal Parliament. has omitted the Northern Territory, which Northern Territory will have then developed to such an extent as to justify the placing of the Seat of Government there for a further period of ten years. member has not referred to the last words of the amendment, which preclude anything of the kind, providing that the selection shall then be in accordance with the terms of the Constitution. make myself quite clear.

79,Mr Roberts,"Perhaps I did notmanent settlement, in accordance with, the decision of the then Federal Parliament. We shall then have returned to the situation of the time when certain leading gentlemen of New South Wales sought an alteration of the first draft of the Constitution-whic h had been approved by all the States and by a majority of the people in New South Wales-and be untrammelled in our choice. If that were the position today, I venture to think that the speeches would be of a less recriminatory character than those to which I have listened during the last week. My chief reason for venturing a few remarks on the Bil l is that I have two serious objections to the trend of the debate in a particular quarter. The idea seems to be to still further limit the already regrettably limited power of the [Parliament in the selection of the site, and to cast some sort of odium on honourable members who may, in their discretion, vote for any particular site outside, say, of a limit of 125 miles from Sydney. ' There seemed to be in those quarters concerted action, particularly on the part of three or four honourable members. I noticed a few days ago that the skirmishing was done by the honourable member for West Sydney, ably supported by what would be termed in military circles the advance guard and rifles of the honourable member for East Sydney, followed by the very heavy artillery of the honourable member for ""North Sydney. Bv a singular coincidence, the whole of these three honourable gentlemen represent Sydney. however, that the honourable member, for South Svdney was not in the concert. others ! honourable member speak on the subject, and I cannot condemn him on that mere assertion. South Svdnev mav be a submarine ! the honourable member's qualifications extend to submarine engineering. But it seems to me that, to"" paraphrase tbe words of the well-known song, the winds that blow from the South will not breathe on our listening ears in tuneful harmony with tbose from the West, East, and North. I am surprised to hear it suggested that the honourable member shares the opinions I lwve indicated, and it merelv shows that there are more in the concerted action than I had been led to suppose. discuss the question of Sydney versus Melbourne, or any other particular city ; I am quite indifferent respecting rival claims of the kind. In addition to the utterances of honourable members who seek to limit our powers pret our already limited powers. member will permit me, I shall come to the interpretation; at least, I hope to say a few wcrds on the "" b o n d "" of which we have heard so much. There have been several somewhat flippant remarks made against Dalgety, but no strong reasons were urged against its selection. While I am not com mitted to voting for that particular spot, I think it would have been preferable had honourable gentlemen who are distinctly opposed to it given some valid reasons, rather than have dealt with it with the flippancy indulged in by the two or three honourable members from SydneyI have mentioned. ber think that the photographs of Dalgety are flippant? not to decide on photographs. I do not wish to give the debate a personal turn, but I can assure honourable members that the opinion I formed of one honourable member from a picture in the Bulletin was It is noticeable, quite different from the reality. The chief objection of the honourable member for West Sydney seems to be that when he paid one visit to Dalgety, he was struck by a cold wind. bath ! ber assures us that he had a bath at Dalgety, and possibly a great many might l.>enefit from a similar experiment. All we heard from the honourable, member was that the weather was particularly cold, but he was not quite certain on the point until a policeman, who was driving with the party, drew him aside, and whispered that Dalgety experienced very severe winters. I was almost tempted to express*my sympathy for the tender little hot-house plant of the Labour Party in his having been subjected to the cold winds of Dalgety; butit seems now that he was subjected there to a cold bath,-and that that is the only reason why he objects to that particular site.

I suggest therefore to the honourable member for West Svdney that he should again visit Dalgety. ber declines to have another cold bath. I was going to suggest that possibly if the honourable member again visited Dalgety, his experience might be similar to mine of Sydney. Then, too, I remember that the Treasurer obiected to Dalgety for reasons somewhat similar to those mentioned by my honourable friend. When visiting that site, he was seized with a little pain in his abdomen, and returned post haste to a wanner climate. Possibly he feared the worse, ancl desired to gradually acclimatize himself. These being practicallv the only objections that I have heard in the House against the selection of Dalgety, I am forced to look for evidence in favour of the site if T desire to counteract what has been stated here, and the only printed matter that I can discover on the subject is that issued by the people of New South Wales themselves. It has already been quoted during the debate, but I think that it will bear repetition. I refer to a statement in the publication entitled, New South Wales' Picturesque Resorts: Convenient to the Railways. The very heading is catching. ""Picturesque Resorts""! goes to a cold, blizzard-swept place, such as Dalgety has been declared to be, when in search of a picturesque resort. We find that this publication is respectfully dedicated to Sir HarryH . Rawson, the Governor of New South Wales, and that is in itself a charm. It certainly justifies' our looking more closely into the publication. It 'is published with the sanction of the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales, whom we all know. the' way he speaks that the honourable member has come_ into contact with them in a manner that is not satisfactory to himself. We all know, however, that the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales dare not publish anything of this description without the sanction of the State Government. Here then is an official The whole population publication, the source of which'we dare not question, and which refers to Dalgety in unmistakable terms of approval. I do not say that that convinces me that Dalgety should be chosen; I put it merely against the flippant remarks of honourable members who catch colds and other troubles in that place. question deal with summer tours? An ice I decline to do that. chest is a good thing to have, but not to sit on all the vear round. there are times when even some honourable members require an ice chest. will find that the publication to which he refers gives only the return fares to Kosciusko and Dalgety. It does not quote single fares. by the remarks of the honourable member on this particular subject, as well as by those of others who come from Sydney, I can well understand the authorities of that: city refusing to allow single railway tickets to be issued to other districts', and demanding, on each and every occasion, that those who leave shall return to the city that they so much admire. That, I EEink, is an answer to the honourable member'ssuggestion that the failure of the publishers of this book to quote single faresis due to their desire to get people away from Dalgety. It shows rather that they desire more particularly to keep the people in another centre, although they admit, by this very publication, that an occasional' One scarcely holiday can with profit be passed away from the picturesque centre of Sydney. forth that these trips should be takenduring midwinter? they should be taken must depend entirely on the whim of the traveller.

He should not ask me to commit anyself on a subject on which he speaks with so much warmth. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, Company's advertisement in this book might appeal to me precisely as does the conduct of certain newspapers to the honourable member. The official statement in this publication sets forth thatThis much, however, can be said-that the Federal selectors in choosing Dalgety as the -site for the Commonwealth Government made an unimpeachable choice. That statement is as emphatic as it could possibly be. It carries with it the approval, not only of the Railways Commissioners of New South Wales, but of ithe Government of New South Wales, and, through those two authorities, the indelible stamp pf approval of the people of that -State. No one would believe that the people of New South Wales would leave in office men who could commit themselves to a publication of this description if they thought that it was, as the remarks of the honourable member for West'Tjydney suggest, of a distinctly deceptive character. That, I think, answers the objection that Dalgety is a place from which we should keep as far away as possible. Having read this eulogy, I think that -every reference of an objectionable character to Dalgety is defamatory of ""the New South Wales Government; maligns the Railways Commissioners of that State, and impeaches the whole of the people who -leave these persons in authority to deceive an unsuspecting public, whether they travel in winter or summer. of New South Wales that is not referred to in that book in terms of approval. to the conclusion that if , in respect of Dalgety, this book is a living lie, it is a living lie also with respect to every resort in New South Wales. According to the honourable member's own showing, every -person who desires to take a. holiday, and -seeksa picturesque resort in which to spend the time necessary to recuperate, must taboo the whole of New South Wales. I hope that the honourable member, as the result of his having spoken in -such terms of a State that he so ably represents, will not suffer great damage. I noticed that the honourable member for :North Sydney, in addressing himself to this question, did not enter into any of these objections to Dalgety. He did not raise any flippant objections to it, or refer to it as having a cold and objectionable climate. I arrived at the conclusion that he rebelled, so far as the concert was concerned, against going so far. He merely touched upon what we have been told is the bond, both in spirit and in letter, of the Constitution. It seems to me that the acumen and legal ability of the honourable member for West Sydney, coupled with the dialectic skill of the right honourable member for East Sydney, bave led our honourable friend from the North, with his heavy artillery, into a veritable Colenso. I do not know of any situation that is less tenable than the one taken up by these three honourable members when they seek to still further limit our power to choose a site, and to cast odium upon any honourable member who voles for Dalgety, or any other site situated more than about 125 miles from Sydney. We have heard a great deal about the spirit and the letter of the bond, and many honourable members who have spoken seem to have pinned their faith to something which the Premiers are reported to have agreed upon at the Conference held in 1899. We are justified in carrying back our minds to that period, and in reminding the Premiers themselves, who assert that we should be bound by what was done then, that they were called together, not because of any objection by the people of New South Wales themselves, but because of action taken by the Parliament of New South Wales without consulting its constituents. That action seems to me to have been a breach, not merely of the spirit of the bond, but of the very letter of it, and to have been taken 'with an utter disregard for the compact arrived at at the Conventions, which were of a thoroughly representative character. The New South Wales Parliament showed an utterdisregard for the feelings of a majority of the people of New South Wales when it carried a Bill which demanded that the affirmative votes at. the Federal referendum should be of a. given strength. It was that decision alone that caused the Premiers to assemble. We have that laid down very clearly in the official document put forward for our consideration. Every line and letter of that document, which refers to the alteration made by the Premiers in the draft Constitution, goes to prove that they were bending to the New",21,Dudley Papers

In the very first paragraph of the memorandum we have the statement that the Premiers have fully considered the amendment suggested in the resolutions passed by the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. They were not considering the wishes of the people of New South Wales, or anything but the resolutions of the two Houses of the Parliament of that State. They assembled for no other reason than because that Parliament hacl deliberated broken a compact in spirit and in letter. Thev savWith regard to the resolutionsNot with regard to any negative or affirmative vote of the people of New South Wales, but with regard to the resolutions of the two Houses. Then follow a few explanatory remarks by which it is sought to bind honourable members in the selection of a site. They sayIt is considered that the fixing of the site of the Capital is a question which might well be left to the Parliament to decide. Had the Premiers stopped there, all would have been well. That was a very proper expression of what should be done. But they continuedbut in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South WalesHere the preliminary canter gets a bit ricketty. been a vote taken in New South Wales in regard to the acceptance of the Constitution. and of the fact that a majority voted for its acceptance. that the honourable member knows that there was in force an Act for preventing its acceptance on the vote of a bare majority. an Act was passed by the New South Wales Parliament, which thereby directly broke the agreement with the other States, in letter and in spirit. ThatI deeply regret, and so, no doubt, does the honourable member. Had that action not been taken, this Parliament would have been free to locate the Federal Capital where it thought best, and the probability is that Sydney would have been chosen for the Seat of Government. The debarring of Sydney under the Seat of [REPRESENTATIVES.] Government BUI. present Constitution is to be laid at the door of leading New South Wales politicians of the day, who prevented the compact from being agreed to. The Premiers-' statement says thatIn view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South WalesAnd here, as I pointed out, their preliminary canter becomes a little ricketty.. There hacl been no 'strong expression of opinion in New South Wales; the only strong expression of opinion was on the part of the two Houses of Parliament, whose members had not been before their constituents in reference to this matter, ancl were consequently not in a position to voice their views. The language employed is de^ ccptive, in that it would lead a casuali reader to think that there had been a strong expression of opinion by the State, whereas the Conference assembled wholly because of the resolutions passed by the Parliament, which had acted in this matter without authority from its constituents. The docu.ment proceedsthe Premiers have modified the clause. Why is the word ""modified"" used? It seems to me that it was used in order tolet some one out who had given an emphatic "" no,"" and who desired to give an equally emphatic ""yes."" The use of the word "" modify "" seems to me almost an abuse of its proper meaning, unless we take it to signify that the intention was to place the Federal Capital as far as possible fromSydney.

It simply means waiving the Constitution for ten years, not altering it for ever. Any man of common sense who surveys the present conditions of Australia must come to the conclusion that this is a most inopportune time to select a site. The population of this great country^ has not yet settled itself. I do not think for a moment that the vast areas away to the north, in Queensland, will always be unpeopled as they are .at present.

Another objection that has often been urged is that there is no possibility of finding temporary accommodation in Sydney. ThatI regard as only a trumped-up argument; because I feel perfectly certain that in Sydney there are numbers of buildings which could be made available, or, in any case, temporary erections might be provided.

At any rate, when the difference is only 90 miles, we ought to fix upon the site which possesses the most advantages in other respects.

Failthinks that there are better sites than Dalgety in New South Wales, why does he not vote against Dalgety, so as to bring about the ballot the Government propose? why I vote for the amendment is my-belief that in ten years' time we shall discover many better sites than those now submitted.

The Bill appears to acknowledge the force of the argument I amadvancing, inasmuch as provision is made for accepting territory when it has been granted. Apparently, New South Wales has a right or claim in respect of the territory within which the Federal Capital shall be established; and, if so, I support the State. On the other hand, if New South Wales has no right or claim in this connection, I have no more to say. Further, if territory is chosen which has not been set aside by the New South Wales Government, but is, on the other hand, opposed by them as unsuitable for the purpose, it will be the duty of the Premier of the State tb at once put the machinery in motion to test the action of the Commonwealth Parliament'. tion to that'; the Commonwealth has power to "" acquire "" territory. ternative. Even the lawyers decline to give any definite opinion as to the proper interpretation of the section of the Constitution which deals with this matter; but I , as a layman, take the meaning to be that, in the case of New South Wales declining to grant any territory-expressin g a disinclination for the Commonwealth to establish the Federal Capital within that Statethen the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to acquire territory for the purpose. not inserted to meet just that very case? though a lawyer might give a different opinion. Those who hacl the privilege of sitting in the first Federal Parliament hacl the opportunity of hearing the opinions of honourable members who are now Justices of the High Court. I remember hearing the opinion of Sir Edmund Barton, and I know the opinions of the other gentlemen; but those opinions might not prove the same as deliberate expressions from the Bench, where they have the responsibility of interpreting the Constitution. responsibility ? that responsibility, and would go into the -question thoroughly before giving a finding. The responsibility of a Minister is a matter on which I feel very strongly; ancj the Government ought to have an opinion on the question of the Capital site. It would appear on looking through the B ill that they have some opinion of the kind, because the scope of the Bill is set downTo determine more definitely the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth in the neighbourhood of Dalgety. Those words must be inserted in order to prevent our inserting any other name but that of Dalgety; and, therefore, the Government apparently intend to stand by that site. I have no complaint on that score; but if the Commonwealth Parliament makes this Bill law, then I think the Premier of New South Wales should test the claims of that State in the High Court. When, however, the High Court shall have decided, there should be no more delay. I differ from those who think that Dalgety is the most suitable site, though I think it could be adapted to the purpose. In my -opinion, however, Bombala would be the better site, because it is so much nearer to the sea; to which we ought to have access. If we select Dalgety, however, I do not T h a t is the althink we are entitled to an outlet to the sea; and, for that reason, I regard Canberra as the best site, owing to its accessibility to a finer port than Twofold Bay. I have in my hand a faithfully-drawn plan, showing the depths of water and so forth in both Twofold Bay and Jervis Bay, and the latter has a great advantage, seeing that in the case of the former there must be immense expenditure for dredging. We know that Jervis Bay is big' enough for target practice of the great ironclads of the navy, W as the alternative and on that and other grounds I can conceive of no better site than CanberraI think so, from the point of view I am now presenting. But the best site of all is at Lyndhurst, which our solid party voted for upon every opportunity. I understand that the. "" numbers are u p "" ; and if Dalgety is chosen, we have the promise of the Prime Minister given on the floor of the House that the work will be proceeded with at once. I disagree with those who believe that large sums will be necessary for the establishment of the Capital. Of course, there must be expenditure wherever we go; for instance, in the erecH as a Minister no tion of a printing ancl other Government offices.

170,Mr Henry Willis,"Judges havehere the more difficult it will be for us to shift the Seat of Government. I venture to assert that if we remain here for another ten years, even those most strongly in favour of the establishment of the Capital in New South Wales will be found opposed to our removal on the ground that it would involve too great an outlay. If we were to make Sydney the Seat of Government for the next ten years, there would be just as keen an interest shown in inducing Parliament to. remain there as is displayed by Victorians in keeping us here. In these circumstances, I am of opinion that the Constitution should be adhered to. The framers of it thought that it would be advisable to have the Seat of Government established outside any of the existing State capitals, and we ought to respect their determination. The laying out of the Federal city would cost less than is generally supposed if we were to hold, at the outset, an international exhibition. Such an exposition is really a first-class up-todate city in full going order. The Chicago Exposition is a case in point. The exhibition buildings contained in themselves the essentials of a city life, and yet they were demolished. only to be pulled down again. In building the exhibition we might have an eye to the erection of permanent structures necessary for art galleries and other public purposes, and in that way we should save a very considerable outlay. come from? would come from all parts of the world, and so would visitors.

At various watering-places on the Continent, buildings which cost thousands to erect are destroyed at the close of the season. At one such place in HollandI saw magnificent buildings demolished when the season closed. Some years ago a great exhibition was held in Melbourne. We have still an interesting relic of it in the buildings in the Exhibition Gardens, where some of the exhibits are still to be seen, and, though out of date, make a most interesting display. The Exhibition Building here was considered to be good enough for the ceremony incidental to the opening of the First Federal Parliament,, and I am sure that if my suggestion were adopted much of the cost of laying out the Federal city would be borne by people from other parts. we are now paying, which is equal to interest on ,£200,000. should. It is to be hoped that the suggestion that I have made may be adopted, and an international exhibition be organized. There seems to be at present a great deal of . waste, due to the division of Federal interests in the cities of the several States, and I think that economies up would be effected by the centralization of those interests in the Federal Capital. Some people imagine that the population of the new city would be for many years very small. Possibly it would, but that is no reason why we should not speedily carry out the provisions of the Constitution in this respect, thus establishing a better feeling on the part of the people of New South.

Those are matters that must be settled by the representatives of the people themselves. My view is that every honourable member should arrive at an independent decision.

We may -be influenced-and some have a right to be so influenced-by the opinions expressed by others, but we are responsible only to our constituents, subject to the Constitution under which this Parliament has been brought into existence. We have nothing to guide us but the conditions. in the Constitution, that the 'Capital shall not be within 100 miles of Sydney, and that it shall be within New South Wales. It is from that point of view that I propose lo consider the different sites that have been suggested. wish to make reference to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Parkes. ithe responsibility of carrying out the duties intrusted to it by the Constitution, and .amongst those duties is the settlement of the question of the Federal Capital. The honourable member for Parkes proposes that the provision of the Constitution which governs the action of Parliament in dealing -with this matter shall be referred to a referendum of the people for amendment. I do not think that any advantage is to ibe gained by the amendment suggested. If a i l to see how we shall be advantaged by remaining for two years in Melbourne, on the condition that at the end of that rime we shall proceed to Sydney, and remain there for a further term of ten years. If it is wrong, and some hold that it is, that the Parliament should meet in Melbourne, because there is a probability of its being dominated by the opinions of the people of this State, and by the city press, ""it would be equally wrong for us to go :to Sydney, and to be subjected to similar finfluences there. I have no sympathy with any amendment of the Constitution which -would place us in such a position. I think that it is the wish of the people that >ye should select as early as possible a site which would become Federal territory, and where we .should not be subject to the influence or domination of any State press. For these reasons I have no sympathy with the amendment. The only amendment of the Constitution for which I should have any sympathy would be one to vary the restriction as to the selection of a site not less than 100 miles from Sydney. Whilst not in favour of the proposal that the Subject to that limiCapital should be in. either Sydney or Melbourne, I do say that there are sites within less than 100 miles of Sydney that are better than any that have come under my notice. If I were able, I should be very glad to move-and I gave notice of such a motion last session-that a referendum be taken, with a view to securing an amendment of the Constitution in the direction I have just mentioned. There are sites near tbe city of Sydney which would be eminently suitable for the Federal Capital-site s such as Mossvale, and others Hawkesbury, National Park, Kurringai Chase, and others, might very well be Before doing so, however, I considered. The people of Australia are anxious that a. settlement shall be arrived at, and although there is a disability imThis Parliament is charged with posed by the ioo-miles limit, I think something should be done, and that, so far as the Constitution provides, we should fix the site of the Capital. No doubt Parliament has considered, in its wisdom, that the selection of a site at an earlier stage would not be so desirable as now. This question has been before the House on more than one occasion, but for reasons for which some one is responsible, nothing definite has taken place, further than that in 1904 it was determined that Dalgety was the most suitable site. The Government have now made what we have a right to regard as an honest proposal to proceed with this work. The Attorney -General, in moving the second reading of the B ill , said that the Government were prepared-and I do not know that we should thank them very much-to accept an amendment providing for the omission of the word "" Dalgety,' with a view to the insertion 1 of the name of some other site. The House will thus be afforded an opportunity to consider various sites which have been reported upon, if is only fair to the A t torney-General that I should say that he gave a very careful resume of what has led up to the present position, and I am",29,Willis Exhibit S Causing Our National Life To Expand

We are charged with the responsibility of selecting the site which we consider the most suitable, and must not shirk that duty.

If a site which would be geographically central cannot be chosen, we should select one which would as nearly as possible be in the centre of population, having regard not so much to its distribution at the present day as to that of the future."" Then we must consider questions of climate. The Seat of Government should have an agreeable climate, both for the sake of those whose business willcause them to reside there, and to attract .others who will offered special inducements to those who make it their home, and help to improve it. Regard must also be paid to the character and productiveness of the soil, so that have not followed its example. those charged with the laying out of the place can count upon the assistance of nature in the making of it as healthful and pleasant as possible. Water supplyis also of great importance. We should select a place which has a good water supply, or one for wbich a water supply could be easily obtained. We also need a site where good granite, stone, clay, and other building material can be got. ' Then means of access must be considered, as the Capital should be easily visited from other places. I hope, .without wearying the House, to show how the principal sites are affected by these considerations, and to set to make a line from Wellington to Werrisforth my reasons for the vote I shall give. Albury, Armidale, Bathurst, Bombala, Lake George, Lyndhurst, Tumut, Orange, Canberra, ancl Dalgety have all been spoken of as suitable sites; but in this debate the discussion has practically been confined to the relative merits of Armidale-which were dwelt uponby the honourable member for New England-Canberra, and Dalgety. Each site has its special advantages and qualifications. Armidale has a beautiful climate, Canberra is the most cenCapital. It has been suggested that accestrally situated and easiest of access under present conditions, while Dalgetv has the best water, supply. Mr John Thomson. Armidale is not considered central-thoug h it is more central than it is thought by many to be-and its water supply is believed to be inadequate. So, too, is that of Canberra, while the climate of Dalgety is spoken of as too severe, and its positionis not central. Let me deal with the disabilities of the sites in their order. As to the position of Armidale, I would point out that we must consider, not merely the present distribution of population-, but its probable In distribution fifty years hence, because we are not legislating merely for the immediate The chosen site future. Our experience shows that the< population of Australia is moving northwards. New South Wales is developing faster in her northern half, and particularly on her northern rivers, than in her southern half, while Queensland is attracting more population than Victoria. People are flocking from the south to fhe northern rivers of New South Wales, and from there and elsewhere to Queensland. They go to Queensland partly because the Parliament of that State has very wisely wish to settle on the land. I am sorrythat the Parliaments of the other States We must also have regard to the probable development of the Northern Territory. Although to-day it is practically blank, itmay become thickly populated' if wisely administered under good laws. Therefore, it would probably be a great mistake to place the Federal Capital too far to the south. It may be contended that we cannot forecast the future, but we are bound to look ahead. At the present time, Armidale is 365 miles by rail from Sydney, 372from Brisbane, and 942 from Melbourne, the journeys occupying respectively, 14, 16, and 3.1 hours. It is, however, proposed Creek, which will shorten the distance frcmr Melbourne to Armidale by 133 miles, making it only 809 miles. From Adelaide, when the line from Cobar to BrokenH ill and that from Wellington to Werris Creek are made, the distance will be 1,080 miles;, it is now 1,4.17 miles. I am dealing with the distances from the Capitals of the States, because to get from one State to another it is, in nearly every case, necessary to commence the journey from the sibility by water should also be taken into consideration. Well, Armidale can be On the other hand, connected with Coff's Harbor by a railway Of 157 miles. harbour ? all weathers, though it is to be improved, so that vessels will be able to get in at all times, and steamers large enough to trade with the Old Country may call there for produce. Canberra is 204 miles by rail from Sydney, 929 from Brisbane, and 576 from Melbourne; but the distance from Melbourne"" can be shortened to 431 miles. From Adelaide it is now 914 miles, but that distance may be reduced to 769 miles. Dalgety is 298 miles from Sydney, 1,023 from Brisbane, and 607 from Melbourne; but if it were connected with the Bairnsdale line, it would be only 373 miles from Melbourne. It is at present 1,227 miles from Adelaide, but this distance is capable of being reduced to 993 miles. I have taken these figures from the official reports which have been submitted to honourable members, so that they may be looked upon as correct. I mentioned that climate should be taken into account in considering the agreeableness of a site. I find that the mean summer temperature of Armidale is 79.6 degrees, winter 35.2; Canberra, summer 69.7, winter 45; Dalgety, summer 63.3, and winter 42.2. not correct. shade temperature at Armidale during spring, summer, autumn, and winter square has been 56.7, and 44.1.

Armidale Cotter yields more than twice as much as is 3,450 feet, Canberra 1,900 feet, and Dalthe Mowamba. gety 2,650 feet above sea-level. Dalgety's coldness may perhaps be accounted for byhear that the flow of water in the Cotter its distance south, combined with its great River is even greater than is stated in Mr altitude. The Commissioners, in their reWade's reportport, sayWith regard to climate, in our opinion, Dalmaintenance of purity of supply is unsurpassed. gety may be ranked as somewhat better than Bombala, but not equal to Armidale. The rainfall of these three places must also be considered, because upon it depends largely the productiveness as well as the beauty and water supply of a place. Armidale has an average rainfall of 32.65 inches, Canberra 23 i'nches, and Dalgety 27.18 inches. A feature that has been considered perhaps more than any other in the discusI have always been led to believe that the sion of the Capital site is that of water water supply of the Dalgety site was besupply. The officers who have been charged yond comparison with that of any other I with furnishing reports for the New South Wales Government have assumed that a city, such as we hope the Capital will be, will contain within . a reasonable time a population of not more than 50,000 people, and on that assumption they have made their calculations as to water supply. Armidale has three sources of supply-the Guyra River, 25 miles distant; the Woolomombi, 23 miles distant; and the McDonald River, 34 miles distant. With regard to theseIn the Guyra catchment there are 80 square miles of hilly country, sparsely populated, with a minimum rainfall of 25 inches. The estimated water available for catchment is 2,610,000,000 gallons, or, after allowing for evaporation, sufficient for 57,000 persons. The combined sources of the Guyra, Woolomombi, and McDonald Rivers would, with suitable storage, provide a water supply sufficient for 4So,ooo persons. Sufficient water to give power for generating electricity for lighting, & c , can be obtained from Muddy and Chandlers Rivers, 24 miles distant, or from the Apsley River, 35 miles distant. Those figures are sufficient to show that nature, assisted by human skill, has made ample provision for a plentiful water supply at Armidale. The Canberra site is better provided with water supply than I wav given to suppose. It is generally stated that that site labours under serious disadChief Engineer of New South Wales, in The Cotter River is the most suitable source for a water supply.

Whilst we were there the. representative of the district in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales sought to demonstrate to us the magnificent opportunities for bathing which the river afforded, and had it n<S>t been for some of the visitors he would most assuredly have been drowned.

It appears to me that every Parliamentary party that has gone there has had the same experience. All have chanced to strike a blizzard or, at all events, a very cold wind. One occasionally picks up information quite unexpectedly, and I recall the fact that when I complained to a local resident of the severity of the weather, he replied unthinkingly-""Cal l this cold? You ought to have been here last week ! "" We were also informed that, during the previous week, a coach had been overturned whilst traversing the route that we hacl followed.

If our choice is narrowed down to Dalgety and Canberra, I shall vote for the latter. ""That site, with its accessibility to Jervis Bay, one of the finest along t i e seaboard, is much preferable to Dalgety; but, to my mind, there is a-still better one which has not yet been reported on. I refer to a site in the Hunter River district, with Port Stephens as its port. There is a fine stretch of lakes there and scenery that is unsurpassed by that of any other part of New South Wales. occasionally gets under water? River district is occasionally inundated, but that is regarded by the residents rather as a blessing than a curse, since the floods fertilize the valleys to such an extent that their productivity to-day is equal to what it was 100 years ago. A tour of the district has been arranged, and the programme If the climate of Dalthat has been mapped out is as followsStarting from Newcastle one joins the North Shore ferry for Stockton, and drives through delightful country for 16 miles to Salt Ash, at the head of Telligerry Creek, Port Stephens. Here a change of conveyance is made, and the trip continued through the mangrove-lined banks of Telligerry Creek into the open waters of Port Stephens-the Great Harbor of the North. Magnificent views are obtained across extensive sheets of water to Karuah, Nelson's Bay, the Heads, and Duck Hole. . . . From Tea Gardens a fast oil launch will convey the travellers through the lower Myall River, Nellie's and Chinamen's Bays, Grasswater and Broadwater, the latter being the parting of the ways for Bullahdelah and Bungwahl. Crossing the Broadwater, the Upper Myall River is entered, and 10 miles of winding river scenery, with heavily-timbered banks beautified by innumerable staghorns and clumps of bangalow palms to Bullahdelah, at the foot of the Great Alum Mountain. . . . Those who are prepared for a fair climb may visit the quarries, ascending the tramway incline for the purpose, while for a slightly harder effort a magnificent cycloramic view of river, lake, and bushland is obtained from the very summit of the peak. . .

In fact, I saw red granite there in parts, the rock in some places nearly bordering on diorite. that the honourable member for Wide Bay speaks of, you immediately come in contact with the basalt or bluestone as one sees it in and around Melbourne.

It is not necessary to make long speeches on this question, or to traverse the. ground that has been covered year after year. The debate has already occupied too much time. Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 7.45 p. m-. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [7.45]I do not intend to detain .the House more than a few minutes at this stage of the debate. The subject has been so completely threshed out by the speakers who have preceded me, that anything I can add is not at all likely to be either very instructive 01 very amusing. I understand also that the House is anxious to he.tr a speech from the Treasurer. waiting in cheerful expectancy of that, and 1 should be sorry to keep honourable members from something which will be much more interesting than any remarks that I can offer are likely to be. amendment moved by the honourable member for Parkes been likely to meet with the concurrence of the great body of members from New South Wales, I for one would have given it my cordial support. I believe that it would have afforded the best solution in the circumstances of what is undoubtedly a most difficult problem at this stage of Federation, if the temporary Sent of Government had been allowed to pass at the end of the first ten years to Sydney, so as to allow us another ten years' breathing space before we determined for all time the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. In dealing with this subject in July, 1907, on the Address-in-Reply, I saidA l l we have to look to is the actual bargain, and if any arrangement of the kind suggested is to come, it can only, if it be any modification of the bargainI meant the bargain in the Constitutionbe effected at the instance and by the desire of the honourable members who represent NewI f it were atSouth Wales, which was brought into the Federation by that agreement. Without their desire to have that amendment of the Constitution, I say that they are perfectly entitled to insist upon the fulfilment of the exact terms of the ConstituOutside the limit tion as they stand. For that reason I find myself quite unable, as they are unwilling, to support die amendment. We have' been told by some honourable members that the House has already determined the question of the Capital site. I venture to say that that is not so. We have never yet as a House done what the Constitution requires I shall reus to do, namely, to determine the Seat of Government. As I understand that muchdebated section, 125, of the Constitutionit would certainly take a bolder man,than I am to pronounce himself in favour of any particular interpretation of certain portions of it, because it is full of the greatest difficulties-the one thing that I should think is 'quite clear in it is that, before we can say that this House has determined the Seat of the Government, we must have fixed upon the territory which is to be granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. All that -the Seat of Government Act of 1904 did was to say that the Seat of Government "" shall be within 17 miles of Dalgety, in the State of New South Wales."" Taking We are all that by itself, it means that the Seat of Government, if it is regarded as a geographical point, may be at any place within a radius of 17 miles of Dalgety. Consequently that provision does not fix the point Had the at all. The Act goes on to say thatThe territory to be granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, within which (he Seat of Government shall be, should contain an area not less than 900 square miles and have access to the sea. It does not define the amount of the area; it does not say where that area is to be; it simply suggests the neighbourhood of where it is to be. There might be any number of territories which quite comply with that Act, any one of which might be tbe territory "" within which the Seat of Government shall be."" All that the Act amounted to was an expression of opinion by members of the then House tliat the Seat of Governsupposed to have been made, and supposed ment ought to be somewhere in the neighto have been incorrectly embodied in secbourhood of Dalgety. 17 miles.

H . IRVINE did other honourable members. I am prepared to admit that a number of honourable members, who ought to have remembered the compact, allowed it to slip from their minds at the time the question was debated; but I am not going to attempt to make myself the judge of the conduct of others. All I say is that, if that were so, it does not touch the real question. If there was such an understanding, and if we can reasonably give effect to it , it is one of those things which would affect my mind considerably, though it would not override all other considerations. Sir Wales Government had offered Bombala, Albury, and Tumut. Mr W. H . IRVINE is so, but the New South Wales Government is no more than are honourable members here invested with authority. They .are not prevented, if the fact be brought to their minds that there was such an understanding-which , I may say, was really not for their benefit, but for the benefit of the people of New South ""Wales the Premiers any more binding than the action of the State Government? Mr W. H . IRVINE -Neithe r was binding at all in the strict sense. All I say is that we' ought, in the endeavour to bring about a real Federal union-if we are ever to weld ourselves into one Australian nation-to carry out, in the fullest degree, the obligations of good faith, not being bound absolutely by the letter of the -compact, but giving effect to its spirit as far as we can. But, apart from the question of whether there was a breach of faith, I find that practically the whole of the representatives of New South Wales -which , although only one State, is still the largest in point of population-are , with one or two exceptions, opposed to the site before us. That is a consideration which, for my part, I cannot entirely disregard, apart altogether from any question of bargain. means agreed upon the question whether one of which stands out prethe site should be as near as possible to the 100-miles limit. , Mr W. H . IRVINE -Perhaps not. I know there is a difference of opinion, but And yet Sir George Turner the facts I have stated influence me very much. This stipulation or understanding I . k n o w , and so was introduced for the benefit of New South Wales, but it was not to override other considerations of real value, having regard to the interests of the Commonwealth. If we find that New South Wales, as represented by the great body of its members, is strongly opposed to Dalgety, that is certainly a consideration which I , for one, cannot disregard. It would not override, perhaps, the overwhelming advantages of a site which, in itself, was pre-eminently suitable above all others; but it does weigh very considerably with me, when we come to consider the relative merits of sites, JOHN FORREST -The New South a number of which are really on the same plane, at all events, of comparison. We have heard all sorts of conflicting accounts from honourable I believe that members who have seen these sites, some praising Dalgetyi n the very highest degree, and others describing it as a windswept plateau, almost uninhabited. I am under the disadvantage, or, possibly, the advantage, of never having seen any of the sites; but I try to get down to something solid on which to rest, and I find that the Government . of the Commonwealth appointed a Commission, to go into the whole agreement of question of the sites. The Commission consisted of four members with whose names honourable members are familiar. They were Mr Kirkpatrick, who was chairman, Mr A. W. Howitt, Mr Henry C. Stanley, and Mr Graham Stewart. I do not know Mr Kirkpatrick, but I know Mr Howitt, who is a man with the very widest knowledge of Australian conditions, the highest integrity and honour, and great strength of mind. The other two gentlemen I do not know, but I understand they come from South Australia. Queensland. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Thes e Commissioners went into the whole question, and examined all the sites.

229,Sir William Lyne,"On e was frombut Bombala was. Without wearying honourable members by going into the various reasons which the Commissioners assigned, I shall merely say that they finally came to a conclusion as to the comparative merits of the various sites for all the purposes of a Capital. I find that Bombala, which is the nearest to Dalgety, ""is placed for the purposes of topographical and general suitabilitv last of the seven; for climate it is placed last; for soil and productiveness it is fifth; for building material and cost of building it is seventh; for water supply it is fourth, and for accessibility seventh. This impartial, and, so far as I know, intelligent body of Commissioners decided that Bombala is last as to climate, nearly last as to productiveness, last as to cost of building and building material, last as to accessibility, and last as to general suitability for a Capital site. Those Commissioners were afterwards asked to report separately on the Dalgety site, which was subsequently selected; and this is the summary of their reportAs to topography, and general suitability of site, which latter term is defined to mean picturesqueness, aspect, levels, suitability for arboreal and general horticultural growth, and foundations of buildings, we consider the Dalgety site may be placed on an equality with that of Bombala. As to general suitability, Dalgety is placed on an equality with that site which they, on a previous examination, had placed last. The report goes on to sayWith regard to climate, in our opinion, it may be ranked as somewhat better than Bombala, but not equal to Armidale. That is, that as to climate, it is not absolutely the worse, but next to the worse. As to soil-productiveness, the district within sioners placed Bombala last and Dalgety thirty miles, of the site is less cultivated, and next. apparently less productive than similar areas round other sites. In cost of building, and local supplies of building materials, the site may be classed as equal to Bombala. For water supply it is second only to Tumut. For water supply, Dalgety is second only to Tumut, where, as apparently admitted by all, the supply is admirable. it is only second to Tumut. Mr W. H. IRVINE -There may be a much more copious flow than at Tumut, but I have no doubt the Commissioners took into consideration, not only the magnitude of the river, but the levels, cost of obtaining the supply, and so forth. There is no question that Dalgety is admirable so far as the supply of water is concerned. In the matter of accessibility, Dalgety ranks immediately before Bombala, and below the other sites previously, reported upon. As I said before, had Dalgety presented such outstanding features of advantage as to overwhelm all the other sites suggested, then, for my own part, I should have asked the New South Wales members not to press their claim arising out of an understanding not embodied in the Constitution, and should have been less willing to give weight to their opinion in the matter; but when I find that this site is classed by the only authoritative body which has yet examined the various sites-whe n I find it is classed as to all those things which, in my mind are the most important, such as accessibility, general suitability, aspect,, levels, soil, productiveness, and climateas second last, or nearly as bad as the one they had put last, I feel I am not justified in taking that course. I feel the responsibility that every honourable member has in giving a vote on a question the importance of which is so immense. It is a question, not for this year or next year, but for all time. I feel that it is my duty not to be swayed by the conflicting, and what I cannot helpdescribing as the exaggerated, opinions expressed on both sides in this House-that it is my duty to go back to the authoritative statements made by a Commission appointed especially to examine and report upon the several sites. That, at all events, is solid ground. out, on the general average, with respect to the several sites? Mr W. H . IRVINE -The Commisfirst on the list? Mr W. H . IRVINE A site referred to as Albury, but which I think is knownas Table Top, and is about io miles north of Albury. I feel a good deal of diffidenceand difficulty in dealing with this question, since I find myself differing in respect to it from a good many of my honourable friends sitting in the same part of the House as I do. Mr W. H . IRVINE I am sure that honourable members will recognise that we should deal with this question purely on its merits, and I have certainly endeavoured to arrive, on what seems to me the-",40,Willis Exhibit S Causing Our National Life To Expand

We can all form our different opinions, and I venture to conclude the few remarks I have made by saying that I believe it would be greatly in the interests of the whole of Australia if we could arrive at some conclusion whereby the determination of this all-important question could be postponed for ten or fifteen years. If that is impossible, as it appears to be, judging by the opinions expressed by those who bave already spoken on this question, I'cannot believe that it is desirable to select as tbe site of the Federal Capital so very remote and inaccessible a place as is Dalgety. Dalgety is removed from all the ordinary streams of communication. It is situated in a remote corner of the Commonwealth, and I cannot believe that it is a site that should be selected, if we really intend to build a Capital upon it, if we do not really wish to use it as a means of indefinitely postponing the work of establishing a Capital-and that I should be the last to advocate. Mr W. H have suggested it had it not been suggested before by many others. I cannot believe that any honourable member has such an idea in his mind. The Government are pledged, if this Bill be passed, to take, at the earliest opportunity, complete measures to give effect to it. I cannot believe, however, that it would tend to the advantage of the Commonwealth to make Dalgetv the meeting place of this Parliament. Apart altogether from the huge expense which it would involve, I do not think that the Parliament should go to a place so remote and inaccessible. Dalgety, as I have said, is difficult to approach, and it would be difficult to keep it in ordinary intercourse with other parts of the Commonwealth. It is a place where we should certainly be unlikely to have, for two or three generations hence, a city of any magnitude. If the Federal Capital were established there, it would b<; a city of members of Parliament and public servants. It would be a place from which both members pf Parliament and public servants would endeavour for a considerable portion of the year to get away. I cannot believe that it would be to the advantage of Australia to select that site. I therefore propose to vote against it. Under these circumstances, I cannot disregard, nor do I think that any honourable member should disregard, the fact that tlie great body of public opinion in the State in which the"" Capital is to be established is opposed to the selection of Dalgety. Let me point out one important point in connection with the Bill that is now before us. We find that it provides that access to the sea should be along a certain line. I have not heard any explanation of the meaning"" of that provision. We propose only to take a certain defined area. We cannot do more. We do not propose to take an area which would give us access to the sea. We provide in one clause that access to the sea should be within 15 miles of a certain surveyed line. What does that mean? It is simply the expression of a devout wish that the Parliament of New South Wales will be good enough to give us that line of communication. We are asked to deliberately select a site which, apart from its advantages or disadvantages, is one to which the great body of public opinion in New South Wales strenuously objects. that. Mr W. H . IRVINE I take the IRVINE I should not opinion expressed by the great bulk of the representatives of New South Wales in this House as being the best evidence of public opinion in that State. We have always considered that we ought to accept the opinions expressed in this House by honourable members as honestly representing the views of their constituents, and when we find the majority of the representatives cf New South Wales objecting in the strongest possible terms to the selection of Dalgety, we ought to ask ourselves whether it is wise, if we intend to give effect to our decision-and I hope we do-to choose such a site. We should, in the circumstances, ask ourselves whether we should select a site which will not have access to the sea, unless the Government of that part of Australia, whose wishes we are flouting, choose to give it to us. I believe that access to the sea is not at all essential to the Federal Capital, but I do think that if we choose a site somewhere near the sea, in order that we may have access to it, that qualification becomes an essential to that site. member mean that we should leave to the New South Wales Parliament the choice of a site?

I have said that we are not bound in our choice by the views of the Government, or even the people of New South Wales; but that unless there are overa party to inspect it. I also visited other whelming conditions in favour of a particular site we ought not to entirely disregard such a united expression of opinion as comes from that quarter here. I have felt ashamed and humiliated as I have listened during the debate to expressions of opinion that indicated the strongest feeling of State against State. I deplore such expressions in the strongest possible language, for it seems to me that they put iff for a very considerable time any real fruition of the Federal compact into which we have entered. I have endeavoured to take up the position that I should assume if there were no Victoria or New South Wales in the Federation. deavoured to take the view that we ought to remember that we are now asked to record our votes on what is certainly a most important question, and a question which differs from almost every other with which we have dealt, inasmuch as once we have taken the step we propose to take in regard to it, we can never. retrace it. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [8.20] -The honourable member who has just resumed his seat began his speech with the remark that he would not occupy our attention for any length of time, since he understood that I was to follow with a very important statement. I hope that he will not be disappointed when I tell him that that is not my intention; but I feel that since I have had the privilege of being the principal mover in regard to this question-becaus e I was actively interesting myself in it before the establishment of the Federal ParliamentI should not allow the debate to close without making a few observations. Holding as I do strong views upon this matter, I venture to detain the House for a little while, whilst I give expression to them. In the first place, let me say that I was Premier of New South Wales when the question of the Federal Capital first came up, and that, with members of the Parliament of that State, I visited certain suggested sites before the question came before the Commonwealth Legislature. know what the feel in 2 in New South Wales was at that time, and probably the feeling The honourable is the same to-day. Yass was one of the sites that was visited more than once in those days by members of the State Parliament, l t was then considered by the people of New South Wales to be a suitable site,' and I think that on two occasions I took sites. I am led to refer to these fact* merely because of my desire to show that the question was under consideration in New South Wales before it was approached by this Parliament. It is not often that I agree with the honourable member for Flinders; but I find myself in agreement with him upon this question. other must be wrong. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I know that I am absolutely right. When the question first came up for consideration I occupied a position that enabled me to accurately determine what was the feeling of the I have enpeople of New South Wales. I was at tlie time the leader of the State Government, and in that capacity I appointed Mr Oliver to report on the various sites,' so that in the circumstances it will be admitted that I ought to know fairly well' what was then the intention and the feeling of the people of that State. I did not appoint Mr Oliver to select a site, or to make the strongest recommendations in> favour of any particular district. He was appointed simply to make a preliminary investigation of the various sites that werethen being advocated. At the time sometwentv-six sites or more were named, and"" Mr Oliver was appointed with a view of preparing the way for a decision later on. He was not asked to select a site, and"" exceeded his instructions in the recommendations which he made. to speak in deprecatory terms of Mr Oliver, because he was a friend, and a man for whom' I had a great respect, but T knew his peculiarities. now agree with his recommendation.

Hansard wil l show. trouble has been caused during the existence of this Parliament by the persistence with which the Opposition have urged an early settlement of this matter. It would be better not to settle it for a considerable time than to choose a wrong site. No press writer, and no member here, can show that a Capital site has ever been chosen in other parts of the world within a shorter period than seventeen years. that a site in his constituency would be chosen, he would be anxious to have the matter settled. Sir WILLIAM LYNE blamed by the right honourable member -for Swanf o r not submitting the Tooma site earlier. That is evidence that I have not been anxious to push forward unduly sites in my own electorate. If there are better sites elsewhere, consideration should be given to them. The Federation is young, and great jealousy still exists between the various States, and perhaps between the politicians who represent them. Probably before my lifetime ends, this feeling will have disappeared, or will at least be very much weaker. Buti f a choice is made at the present time, the people in the future may say that we were actuated by jealousy, and did not do our duty. It took the United States of 'America from 1776 to 1791 to select a site, and possession was not taken of the Federal Capital until 1800. bitter feeling in connection with the matter ing the whole of that time. during the whole of that time?

There has the honour of possessing the Federal city, been a great deal of agitation and disconand it was determined that Congress should tent in New South Wales. meet in two cities alternately. strange how the history of the United States has been repeated here. Congress at various times sat at Annapolis, Trenton, and Baltimore, and, on one occasion, New York was nearly chosen as the Capital. No . I have But in 1790 a compromise was effected, and it was agreed that, on the States debts being assumed by the nation, the Federal Capital should be given to the South, and George Washington was appointed sole selector of a site, having an area with a frontA great deal of age of 100 miles to the Potomac to choose from. He chose the site which was adopted, and Congress in 1800 met for the first time in the city which bears his name. In Canada, there were two Capitals, until the passing of the Imperial Act of 1840, when the Governor General, Lord Sydenham, selected Kingston. But the members of the Legislative Assembly, by a majority of two to one, decided, that that was not a desirable place, and on 3rd November, 1843, MonI f the Treasurer thought treal was chosen by 51 votes to 27.

In the following year, after a discussion extending over nineteen years, Ottawa was finally decided upon by a small majority; and it was not until 1867, after an interval of twenty-seven years, that the Capital was ultimately occupied by the Canadian Legislature.

Dalgety was an accident. In 1903 seven sites went to an exhaustive ballot, and after the fifth vote only three remainedLyndhurst, Tumut, and Bombala. On the sixth vote, of sixteen members who had supported Bombala,, fifteen transferred their vote to Tumut, which defeated Lyndhurst by 36 votes to 25. » Treasurer had voted only for sites in his own district. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -That is very likely. The Tumut site is in mv district, and is one of the best which have been recommended. It has an infinitely clearer, cleaner, and better water supply than the Snowy River would furnish. On the 9th August, 1904, there was another ballot. On that occasion, the sites were divided into those in the western, southern, and south-eastern districts. That meant Dalgety or Bombala, Tumut, and Lyndhurst. On the. first ballot the western site got twenty-five votes, the south-eastern twenty-two votes, and the southern twenty-one votes. The following list shows how honourable members voted on that occasion :Western or Lyndhurst -Brown, Conroy, Cook, J., Edwards, G., Edwards, R., Fuller, Groom, Hughes, Johnson, Kelly, Willis, Wilson, Lee, Liddell, Lonsdale, McDonald, McWilliams, Reid, Robinson, Smith, B., Smith, S., Spence., Thomson (Dugald), Wilkinson, Wilks.

Southern or Batlow -Bamford, Carpenter, Ewing, Fowler, Hutchison, Isaacs, Kennedy, Knox, Lyne, Mahon, Maloney, McCay, McColl, Phillips, Ronald, Skene, Tudor, Watkins, Watson, Webster, Thomson (David).

It was an accident pure and simple, and what has caused honourable members to turn their votes backwards and forwards as they have I do not know. The leader of the Opposition said the other night, in answer ing the Minister of Trade and Customs, that the selection of Dalgety was not an accident. I say it was an accident, and the only reason why it is in the running today is that the right honourable member for East Sydney voted, not so much against Tumut as against me. He cast bis vote for Dalgety, and this is the mess he has got us into. That was the second stage of the accident, and the action was taken for party purposes. that dreadful charge. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -It is true. The right honourable member knows that he would not have voted for Dalgety had he not wanted to kill Tumut. Sir WILLIA M LYNE --The reason why the honourable member cast his vote for Dalgety was because he and his party desired to destroy the possibility of Tumut being chosen. I have here a list of those honourable members who changed their votes, and who have changed them backwards and forwards more than once. The majority u of the votes for Tumut in the fifth ballot -1903-were those of Victorians. The largest supporters of Lyndhurst were from New South Wales, with two from Tasmania and five from Queensland. For Bombala there were only sixteen on that occasion, of whom only six were Victorians, the others being mostly from Western Australia and Clarke from New South Wales. They included the honourable member for Wide Bay, a representative of Queensland, who has never altered his vote, so far as I know, except that on one occasion he did not get an opportunity to vote for one place whose chances were disposed of. Tbat has been the history of the matter up to the present stage.

' Sir WILLIAM LYNE but, through .the action of ' t h e right honourable member for Swan, Dalgety was brought before usa site 25 miles further away from Sydney than Tooma is-and I thought, if honourable members were going to select a site right down in the far corner of New South Wales, in the very worse position possible, Tooma should be brought in as the best place to be found-althoug h it was further away from Sydney than I had hoped to see the Capital placed. That was the true reason why I did not submit this magnificent site on the first occasion. I regret that many honourable members have not bad the opportunity-of seeeing Tooma. The right honourable member, wbo was then Minister of Home Affairs refused to visit that site. That was the sort of fair play I got. When he was my colleague, without my knowing anything about it , although others knew of it , he went up to those two electorates. Others knew where he was going and whom he was going to meet, but the first I heard of his going to examine any site in the centre of my electorate was a telegram from my own people on the spot to say that he had arrived.

I telegraphed to two places to get the right honourable member and the Prime Minister to look at Tooma, but, although they were only 10 or 12 miles from it , they took no notice of my telegrams. I was never so treated liefore by a colleague. I was brought up with Sir George Dibbs and other gentlemen who would not do to a colleague what the right honourable member did to me. All I wanted was that he should meet a man who 1 knew the place and who would show him over it ; but no one knew he was going; there was, therefore, no one there to show him the place, and he went away from the district without having seen anything really worth seeing.

Since then I have, fortunatei», had an opportunity of visiting the district, and I can only say that the tablelands of Monaro are the poorest and coldest, and have the least rainfall of any in New South Wales, except, the plains of the west. 1 have taken the trouble to obtain a record of the temperatures taken at Nimitybelle, the nearest place where such records are' kept. During last winter the lowest temperature in June was 15 degrees, and in July 14 degrees, 'while in August it was 18 degrees, showing an average daily lowest reading for the three months of 25 degrees. the ground for three months ! Sir WILLIAM LYNE have received word from Dalgety, though I cannot authenticate the information, that one day last winter the temperature was as low as 10 degrees A t Cooma, which is about 40 miles away, the lowest temperature in June, last winter, was 14 degrees, in July it was 18 degrees, and in August 22 degrees, or an average daily lowest reading over the three months of 30 degrees. I give these figures because I regard them as of vital importance, in considering this question. Groom-the father of the present Attorney General-wh o represented Darling Downs in this House in the early days of Federation, and who was one of my oldest friends, was killed by the cold of Melbourne, when attending his parliamentary duties; and how that gentleman's son, my colleague, can vote for a place' where the climate is twice as cold as it is in Melbourne, I cannot understand. will kill half the older men, most'of whom have lived during the whole of their lives in warm climates. Surely it is cold enough in Melbourne, where the temperature is half as high again : ancl I do not think honourable members really know what they are doing when they talk of supporting Dalgety as the Capital site. I know that the climate is dry ancl a very good one in summer : but, as I have already said, Dalgetv would be impossible as a place of residence for men whose blqpd has become thin from their living in a hot climate all their lives. in which to hold summer sessions.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE Really that question is not worth arguing. The point of accessibility is important in the matter of the site.

People talk about a railway witii a grade of 1 in 40, but such a line would bring them only to the foot of the Bondi mountains. It would still be necessary to devise some other means of reaching Dalgety or Bombala. It would be unjust to The late Mr the people of the Riverina and districts further north, now connected with the railway system of the State, and where produce is largely grown, to select a site which they could reach only by travelling almost to Sydney or to Melbourne.

279,Mr Hutchison,"The honourable memmembers advocating the selection of sites in their own electorates that electorate. of Dalgety would mean the extension of the Gippsland railway, and the honourable member for Flinders is a representative of Gippsland. I have here a copy of a statement in respect to Bombala which was made by one of the finest old men that Australia has known. A reference was made to it during a debate in this House some three or four years ago, but I think that it will bear repetition. It was prepared by a man who was a member of the first Victorian Parliament, and I should say that to know him was to trust him. He writesMy father, Dr. Reid, was the first man who occupied a station on the Monaro Plains. That was in 1828, and the middle of the run was where the town of Cooma now stands. He occupied stations comprising the larger portion of Lower Monaro until the year 1840. That particular part was then considered the very best portion of Monaro Plains. The distance from the boundary of our country to Bombala was 40 miles. It is fearfully cold country in winter, but where we were was much better country than Bombala country. Bombala is subject to exceedingly cold piercing winds. From my own knowledge I say no person in his senses would choose such a place as that for the Federal Capital. My experience was that the stock suffered more from disease, especially catarrh, there than anythan vote for Dalgety, which I regard as where else. I know neighbours of ours (Macfnrlane Brothers) lost 10.000 sheep in a fortnight. an impossible site, I should support the Many others suffered the same way. It is a very cold climate for cattle. They are seldom what could be called really f a t ; nothing more than good moderate store cattle. I have had experience of putting in a crop of wheat and having it blown away by the heavy winds, which was all the easier from the sandy nature of the loam. It is not good country for agriculture. Spots here and there are good, but as a whole it is unsuitable, and would not support a large population. On the eastern side from the top of the mountains to the sea I want honourable members to pay special attention to this, because it bears out my own personal experienceyou get fair timber, That is from the top of the mountains down to the seabut on the main portion the timber is useless except for fuel. One can scarcely see on any part of Monaro a tree that could be utilized except for fuel. The timber to which reference is made in the reports is that which is found in the district running down from the mountains to the sea, and which is sheltered from the terrible winds that blow on the plateauThe soil generally is shallow and very stony except in spots. It has never to my knowledge brought forward any produce of consequence. Through the dryness of the country and its being unsuitable for agriculture and bad for stock I found, after my father died, I could do no good; so left there in 1840, the property having been in our possession for twelve years. I went to the north-west of Victoria, and have been there and on the Murray ever since. Sir WILLIAM LYNE To Wangaratta. Mr Reid concludes with the statement that he is now eighty-four years of age; and I may add that he was one of the members of the first Victorian Parliament, being elected in 1859. I put this statement forward as that of a man whose word would not be gainsaid by any one who knew him. Coming, as it does, from a highly respected man, who has had practical experience of the Monaro, it should have some weight with, not only honourable members, but the people generally. The Monaro has never gone ahead. It is all very well to say that its backwardness is due to the want of railway communication. There is nothing in it to make a railway pay. I feel that, when this question was before us on a previous occasion, Tumut was very unfairly treated, and that I was not to blame for failing to then submit the name of Tooma.

307,Sir William Lyne,"If we act toobecause of its importance, and because of the speeches made by other honourable members in the course of the long discussion which has taken place. I did not desire to speak on this question this evening, because I expressed my views full v in regard to it towards the end of last session, but my name having been dragged into the discussion very unnecessarily, I think it is incumbent upon me to say one or two words. the beginning this question has been too much a political matter. The Treasurer and the Minister of Trade and Customs has each done his best to have a site in his electorate chosen, and there has been a conflict between representatives from New South Wales and those from other States. This is much to be regretted, and is largely due to the fact that the business is not being managed as it could be managed if we were to start again from the beginning. In the first place, no proper examination of the suggested sites has been made. When Minister of Home Affairs, I directed a proper examination of the Dalgety, Bombala, and Tumut districts; but the other sites have not been properly surveyed, no contour map of any of them being obtainable. Why has so little interest been taken in this matter by the Government of New South Wales? New South Wales done more, it would have been said that it was trying to dictate to the Federal Parliament. Sir not have been said had it confined its efforts to the furnishing of information. It might fairly have been expected that the Government of New South Wales would have closely examined every site they were prepared to recommend throughout the State, and had proper reports regarding water supplies, contours, and other details, not from Commissioners, as .the result of a few days' inspection, but from experts who had made careful examinations. The city of Goulburn has not been reported on as a suitable site. ioo-mile limit. the'country between Goulburn and Yass is not within that limit, and there has been no proper survey of it , or of the Lake George site. I did mv best to get the New South Wales Government to carry out such a survey, and to ascertain whether a river could not be diverted to keep the lake always f u l l . tion was made. rical observations were obtained, but when I suggested a more detailed examination, the reply was made that the Commonwealth Government ought to get this information for itself. The present trouble has arisen partly from bad management, and From partly, from political influence. wealth Government have only the Dalgety site surveyed? Bombala, and Dalgety districts were the only sites in the running when the examination to which I referred was made. hurst site, too. . ' Sir JOHN FORREST I had left the Department of Home Affairs before that time. I made a report on the Lyndhurst site, though after merely a cursory exanimation of it , because I had no detailed information to go on. The Treasurer has accused me of having done something which was not friendly to him, nor creditable to myself, in not visiting Tooma. From the reports which I have read, Tooma must be a beautiful place, from which the Snowy Mountains are always visible, and where there is an abundant water supply and fertile land. But the Treasurer alone is to blame for that site not having been considered, because he did not bring it JOHN FORREST -That could forward in time to give an opportunity for its examination. He knew the locality, and he had the power to include it for examination by the Commission, and did not do it . He was then advocating two other sites in his electorate, viz., Albury and ""Tumut. not do so, because Tooma is too f a r from Svdney. ' Sir"" JOHN FORREST -Yes, but he advocated and voted for Albury, which is further from Sydney, and much closer to Melbourne than to Sydney.

I sent a surveyor to each, and during the parliamentary recess I arranged to make a round trip from Melbourne, through Bairnsdale to Orbost, thence through the ranges to Delegate, and on to Bombala and Dalgety, and thence on to Tumut, coming home by way of Batlow, Tumbarumba, and Germanton. When I was about to start, the Prime Minister asked me if I could find him a seat in the conveyance, and we went off without letting -any one know we' were going, as we wished to make the journey privately. The Prime Minister left me at Dalgety, and returned to Melbourne by way of Cooma and Goulburn, while I crossed the hills, passing by Kiandra, to Tumut. There the Prime Minister met me again, and we visited Batlow and Tumbarumba, and arranged for a special train to meet us at Germanton on the Sunday night, to bring us back to Melbourne. At Tumbarumba a request came from the Treasurer that I should visit some place on the Murray, which is now known as Tooma, but we had made our arrangements, and had to travel all day to catch our train. My not visiting the Murray site, to winch he asked me to go, has been spoken of by him as an underhand action, which he will never forget, which is as unfair as it is a ridiculous statement of the -case. In my visit of inspection, my only thought was to do the duty which devolved upon me, and to confer with the surveyors who were at work.

H . Carruthers, to go and look at Canberra. AlthoughI was advised by others not to do so, I said "" As you make such a point of it, and I have heard so many opinions about it, I will do it . "" I did not like doing it, but I did it. The result 'was that I made a report which caused a good deal of annoyance to man)'. I can candidly say that I wish I had had nothing to do with it. If one thinks that one has any qualifications to do any good for this country, it is better that he should keep the opinion to himself. He will only get himself into trouble if he tries to do what he thinks is right, without having any feeling in the matter at all, and simply leaving people to judge for themselves.

If such significance was placed on the words "" reasonable distance,"" how does it come about that the Government of New South Wales offered Albury, Tumut, Bombala, and also, I believe, Tenterfield, which is somewhere on the borders of Queensland ? How is it that for three or four years no member from New South Wales ever drew attention to any significance in the words? It was only after there had been long discussions, and we had expressed our opinion and made up our minds in regard to the qualifications of the various sites, that representations were made on that score, ancl we were expected to reverse our decision.

But time will heal all such difficulties and, doubtless, there will be a railway to Dalgety via Bairnsdale, and another from Sydney. There is no fear that Junee, Wagga, and other places mentioned in the Treasurer's, electorate will suffer, because the producers there will be able to get their produce to market quite as well with two lines of rails to Sydney as with one; and I do not think that kind of parochial argument is worth consideration. I do not see why we should expect the Federal CapitaPto meet all requirements at once; if we can get a good site, we had better put up with a little temporary inconvenience.

368,Mr Webster (Gwydir) [10.9],"I doubtful whether New South Wales wouldto show that it would. The Legislature of that State on the last occasion that this question was deliberately put to a vote practically refused to cede the territory of Dalgety to the Commonwealth. The proposal that Dalgety should be ceded to the Commonwealth was defeated by an overwhelming majority. We should, make a very grave mistake, and place this Parliament in a position that it ought not to occupy, by choosing that site, and I fail to see that we.shall be acting within the Constitution by selecting it until has congregated. it shall have been ceded to us. We .have now to vote upon this important question, and as the House is weary of the debate, and anxious to divide, I shall content myself by entering an emphatic protest against' the selection of Dalgety, and by expressing the hope that the wisdom of the House will lead to the choice of a site enjoying a climate more favorable than is that of that blizzardswept district. doxical though it may appear, the more honourable members speak to this. question, the more necessary it seems for others to address themselves to it. From the outset I have not disguised the view I entertain that I am justified in taking any step that may be legitimately taken in this House to postpone the enormous expenditure which the'preparation of a new home for the Federal Parliament would entail. For that reason I have persistently stated that I shall record my vote in favour of delay. The suggestion made in the early days of the Parliament, that the Parliament should meet alternately in Melbourne and Sydney, for the same reason obtained my favorable consideration. Although when this question was last before us, as a last resort, I voted for Dalgety, J believe that it is altogether undesirable to undertake at this stage the expenditure that would be involved in establishing the Capital there, and I should be prepared to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Parkes. I am sure, however, that the honourable member is now convinced that he has not behind him a sufficient number of votes to carry his proposal, and if he presses it to a division I shall have to move as a further amendment the addition of words making it clear that at the end of the ten. years' period to which it refers the Seat of Government shall be removed automatically to Melbourne. cost? well to postpone for twenty years the enormous expenditure attendant upon the establishment of the Federal Capital, which has been foreshadowed by the right honourable member for Swan and others.

I am satisfied that if the representatives of New South Wales in this Parliament had been able to come forward with a recommendation, unanimously supported by themselves, as well as by the legislature, and the press of that State, the whole question would have received before this the consideration that such a recommendation would deserve. But what do we find? We find the representatives of New South Wales themselves divided with respect to it. There is an utter absence of unanimity amongst the people, the presSj and the Parliament of New South Wales upon this question, and consequently they are not in a position to chide us with having obstructed its settlement. To-night the honourable member for Flinders delivered a very thoughtful address, in which he indicated .very clearly that under existing circumstances it is quite possible for us to review the whole, situation under the Bill now before us. I have all along recognised the many disabilities which would attach to the selection of Dalgety. One threat which has been made by members of the direct Opposition-and I understand that they will be supported in their action by honourable members of the Labour corner -is that if Dalgety is chosen they will insist upon the erection of the necessary buildings being undertaken without delay. Personally, I am strongly of opinion that the Dalgety site should not be finally selected until better facilities from the stand-point of railway communication have been provided.

373,Mr Knox,"I was in favour of Fedesupply me with information regarding the period that would be occupied in travelling between Melbourne and Dalgety. I learned from him that the distance between this city and Dalgety vid Bairnsdale and East Gippsland is approximately 350 or 400 miles, and that an ordinary express train would occupy thirteen and a half or fourteen hours in covering the journey. The members of the direct Opposition, knowing that they will command the support of members of the Labour corner, will thus compel the representatives of Victoria and South Australia-wh o have hitherto been accustomed to return to their homes at the end of each week-to travel to Dalgety vid Albury, Goulburn, and Tooma, a distance of 615 miles. The journey by that route would, I understand, occupy nineteen hours. I think that the threat which proceeds from the direct Opposition have not chosen Dalgety. member should sav "" prediction."" instead Of"" threat."" members will acquit me of having used the term "" threat "" in an offensive sense. I confess that I did think that the proposal to alternate the Federal Capital between Sydney and Melbourne, which found favour in certain quarters in the early days of Federation, was one which would insure the necessary delay in the final selection of the Seat of Government, and admit of ampler consideration. able member for Flinders has thrown a new light upon this question, and, as a result, T hope that an amendment will be submitted which will afford the House an opportunity of selecting a site which, in my opinion, is a very desirable oneI refer to the Tooma or Wellaregang site. That site possesses advantages upon which it would be almost ridiculous for me to dwell at the present stage, seeing that honourable members are already familiar with them: It is located in a district with which I am very familiar, ancl which possesses great agricultural resources. I shall vote-if the opportunity presents itself-in favour of my first, selection of Albury, because I regard that as the best possible site. Failing that site, I shall support the claims of Tooma. I am glad to know that honourable members are to be afforded an opportunity of voting for an amendment under which it will be possible to reconsider the whole position. I am sure that [2312 every one ofus deeply deplores the absence of the Minister of Trade and Customs tonight as the result of indisposition. Before any discussion takes place upon an alternative proposal of that character, I should like him to be in his place. If the honourable member for Parkes persists in his amendment, I can support it only upon the ground that it will cause delay in the selection of the Seat of Government, and with an amendment clearly providing that after the lapse of a certain period the temporary Seat of Government shall again revert to Melbourne. The Treasurer was perfectly accurate when he stated that when this question was under consideration upon a former occasion a fair vote was not cast in respect of tbe claims of Tooma. Failing the Albury site, I propose to vote for Tooma again, as the site did not succeed in getting a fair vote on the last occasion. Had that T h a t is very unfair. We site been treated fairly, I am sure it would have been selected by the Parliament. I make no excuse for speaking on this question. My words will be very I am sure that honourable few. Many people 'have said to me at 1 various times: "" Y o u are lucky in having the Federal Parliament meeting in your constituency."" My answer is that as scon ns my vote can assist in moving the Federal Parliament from Melbourne, it will be given in that direction. I am convinced that we ought to decide the question definitely. I have heard it stated that there was a good deal of bargaining in reference But the honorto the Federal Capital, but the New South« Wales members said : "" If we cannot have the Capital in our State, we will not join the Union."" I shall not enter into that question. I am willing to keep to the bond. New South Wales can have her pound of flesh. But I must admit that I am tired of the continual nagging of a few members from New South Wales. It is getting on our nerves, and we have hacl quite enough of it. No member from Victoria desires to prex'ent the Capital being placed in New South Wales, but surely it is right, as the Capital when built will stand for centuries, that we should be caref u l to choose the best site. Now, what do Ave want? Primarily, we must have access to the sea. That is a fundamental principle. Secondly, we must have a splendid water supply. I do not agree with the remarks of a medical member of this House on that question. It is true lhat the germs of hydatids may be found in a running stream.

I shall be quite glad to have ancient the Parliament removed from my elecsition, torate from that point of view. Another mately issued _by. the authority of the House of reason why I desire to see the Capital esAssembly when 'Daniel de Lisle Brock was Gotablished is that I want to have tried an vernor experiment in land legislation. Queen Victoria, swept away the miserable the total of the scrip, and in lessthan ten memories of Norfolk Island, her advisers years all the scrip was paid back into the public entered upon a I'.ind experiment there which, Treasury, if it had been carried to its legitimate end, the would have been very instructive.

Numerous consultations issue "" Market House Scrip,"" or legal tender of their own, founded on the credit of the Island. The politicians of the day called custom; but, notwithstanding all oppoMarket House scrip to the requisite amount, and of various denominations, was ultiof the Island. The materials were found, When the men put to work, the market erectecT, and the stalls rented. Every month's rent reduced stamped, cancelled, and thus ended l j fe of the Guernsey Market House scrip. But the rents have to this day continued, and cipalitv has been obtaining from ,£4°° to ^500 ""a year inrevenue. Why cannot we follow that example, erecting our own public-buildings, residences, hotels, and lodging houses, and paying for the work by notes secured on the land and buildings, and guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government? Would any man refuse to .accept notes which had behind themthe security of every valley and hill in Australia? As a matter of fact, the notes of the Provincial and Suburban Bank, which has been dead for thirty years, are now current in the back blocks, which shows that the public is not averse from using notes. If this scheme were adopted, the debt would be met in twenty years, and ever afterwards there would be a huge revenue from the various buildings. priety of dealing with public works in this way is creating 'a great deal of attention in America, and I glory in the fact that the system was first tried under the British ring in a country which enjoyed home rule, and minted its own coinage. I hope that the Federal Capital question will be settled now once and for all. If the choice of Dalgety be re-affirmed, it will be the duty of the Ministry to whole-heartedly give effect to the decision of Parliament. AlthoughI represent a Victorian constituency I love Sydney too much to wish to do its people an injury. I have stated there publicly that, were I a young man beginning life again, I should..prefer to start there; and, could I take my friends with me, I should be inclined to ""settle there now. But if the Constitution is to be amended, with a view to having the Parliament sitting alternately in Melbourne and Sydney, I say that we should go further, and ask the people to say straight out where they will have the Capital. If the members of the New South Wales Legislature continue to nag, the public of Australia will demand to be heard. A referendum is not as easily taken under our Constitution as in Switzerland, where, if the majority desired to change the Capital member not to discuss the Swiss Constitution. say that if the Constitution is to be amended, I should like the citizens of Australia to be given an opportunity to finally settle the matter. I shall willingly vote to have the Seat of Government taken away from Melbourne at the first opportunity. I avail myself of this opportunity to ask leave to withdraw the amendment which I moved on Tuesday. I do so because I now recognise that most of the representatives of the State from which I come are unwilling to support it, and, consequently, representatives from Queensland, Tasmania, and Victoria hesitate to do so. If those who promised had supported it, I should have carried it ; but as, in the exercise of their judgment they now think it inadvisable to do so, I have no hesitation about taking this course. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. [10.48] I should like the Government to consent to an adjournment, because I desire The proto move an amendment to give an opportunity for the further consideration of this question. That amendment is to this effect that if the honourable member commences a speech, he cannot move the adjournment; but it may be convenient for him to proceed a little further, and then ask leave to continue his remarks to-morrow. I intend to propose. the omission of all the words after the word "" That,"" with a view to the insertion of the following wordsIn the opinion of this House a farther opportunity should be afforded of taking' a ballot on other position's besides Dalgety for the Seat of Government before this B ill be further pro* ceeded with. I wish to speak to that amendment, but,. as many honourable members have left the building, I should like to defer my remarks until to-morrow. It is of vital importance to the Commonwealth that this question should be judged, not only from a personal point of view, but also from the national point of view. For that reason,'sir, I ask leave to continue my speech on a future occasion. Leave -gran-ted; debate adjourned. ' ADJOURNMENT.
