That, at all events, is the position I take up, and I am prepared to accept the full responsibility for what the honourable member for Coolgardie has described as my ""Yes-no"" attitude. spoken briefly to this question last Friday, I should not have risen again to address ' myself to it but that I desire to ask the honourable member for Coolgardie, who gave us an excellent exposition of the position from his point of view and it is generally recognised on all sides of the House as being a fairly strong one-no t to press his amendment at the present juncture. I take the same interest in the question as he does, and from the first division on the subject, which took place in this House in 1901, have opposed this solution of the question as being too expensive. that the Excise should be continued after 1907, but that proposition was defeated. The honourable member for Dalley also moved-as the honourable member for Coolgardie has done-that the import duty be £ 4 instead of £ 6 per .ton, but this motion was defeated by a majority of two to one. The fact that there were thirteen or fourteen honourable members in favour of it shows, however, that even then there were in this House honourable members who thought we were likely to ""pay too much for our whistle"" in the matter of sugar. The honourable member for Coolgardie has made out an excellent case for the guidance of a Government which has sufficient intelligence to accept it and deeply into this question. That being so, I trust that he will be content with the good service he has done, and not press his motion to a division. If he does, I shall follow the course I have consistently observed and vote with him. I should be pleased, however, if the honourable member would refrain from asking,the Committee to deal with this question without full consideration of the possible solutions, and until ample notice has been .given to the big interests in Queensland, as well as to the consumers who are concerned in this matter. One would be tempted to devote a little more time to this question in order to deal with the delightful deductions from figures which are sometimes given by Minto isters, if it were not that we all desire that this debate shall close without delay. Our debates, however, are occasionally prolonged by some honourable member wno, in order that the true position may be placed before the Committee, tries to clear -up the inferences which Ministers seek to deduce from their figures. We were told yesterday, for instance, by the Treasurer, that it was immaterial what the States paid by way of bounties, since we were getting it back in the shape of revenue. In other words; he asserted that it was of no concern to the States that their revenue from sugar, instead of being, as it was in 1901, £780,000, had shrunk to £241,000. net, because although we paid away a large sum by way of bounty, we secured the Excise in return. According to the honourable gentleman, the fact that the revenue from sugar-judgin g by the increased consumption-woul d have been to-day .£1,000,000 had we not adopted this policy does not matter twopence to the States. I trust that he will put this proI remember moving in1901 position to some of the school boys who are preparing to take, our places ' in the shaping of Australia's destiny.

In a famine yeara year of drought-by means of a duty on grain which pressed heavily on the consumers, we secured a very large revenue which has since fallen to zero. But that is not a test of the morality of our losing £1,000,000",17,Import Duties

49,Mr Glynn,"That is not an analogousa year on sugar. pointed out yesterday that everything was all right so far as the success of our White Australia policy was .concerned, since either the acreage under sugar-cane or the output -of sugar by white labour was increasing. The returns supplied with the Budget papers show that that increase is accounted for -to a considerable extent by an increase in the output of sugar in New South Wales. That State is not affected by the question of the substitution of white for coloured labour, although we are generous enough to give her £ 7 3 , 0 0 0 by way of bounty for continued until 1907, covered a provision doing nothing. the planters of New South Wales a present of that amount, simply because Ministers chose to make a mistake of law, and to think that unless we did so we should not f u l f i l some rule of uniformity necessary under the Constitution. All that we require to do, however, so far as any rule of uniformity is applicable to the granting of bounties is to make a general law; we have not to secure equal effects from it. I showed last week-and my statement has since been established by admission-that sugar from Australia was sold at the port of entry in South Africa at / [ II 10s. per ton, whereas it was saleable here at about £ 2 0 per ton. If we deduct from the £ 1 1 10s. a sum of £ 1 4s., representing the cost of carriage, and add £ 4 per ton as representing the Excise, we get-assumin g that the South African price was the test of the value of the sugara price of a little over £ 1 4 per ton in respect of sugar selling here at about £ 2 0 per ton. I suggested that this sugar, although sent from Australia, might not have been manufactured here-that it might have teen purchased elsewhere by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It now appears that it was a surplus of about 30,000 tons of Java sugar, which, the companv had in hand, and exoorted for sale at a cheap rate to South Africa. It was, however, imported for sale in Australia, and by assumption its value was not much less than was the value of Australian sugar. Its introduction into the Commonwealth created the surplus which enabled sugar to be exported, and to be sold at a lower rate abroad. Whether it was Javan sugar which was brought here to be sold in the local market, and was not sold here, or whether it was Australian sugar, seeing that it was a surplus against the consumpThe Treasurer also tion of colonial sugar last year, the argument to my mind is not substantially affected. As to the suggestion that this Parliament has entered into a contract with the planters of Queensland, I may say at once that I do not think such a contract has been entered into. In 1901 we initiated a policy which was to be continued until 1907. The only implied promise that might"" be assumed from the decision then arrived at is that after 1907 there was to be no Excise. No doubt the policy initiated in 1901, and which we decided should be that the Excise should expire in the last named year. But it was stated in this House, in answer to questions put by several honourable members,, that we could, at the end of 1907, impose an Excisei f we desired to do so, although it would be contrary to the usual procedure to declare that the Excise was riot to expire in that year. The proper course to pursue, we wtere told, was to re-impose the Excise by Act of Parliament. I do not think that any contract was entered into. In 1905, on a report by Dr. Maxwell that our policy of 1901 was not a complete success we gave further t concessions. If a i l to see that those , further concessions could be said to be in the nature of a contract. Even Dr. Maxwell in his report held out no hope that by"" 1913-whe n the concessions were to terminate-the policy would be success. f u l . He said that the whole matter ""would then have to be re-opened. garded that action on the part of the Parliament as a sort of contract or understanding. the intelligence which the Almighty gave them we cannot be held responsible. Queenslanders-and even some honourable members-hav e undoubtedly assumed that although Sn 1892 the State Parliament extended for a term of ten years the time within, which the employment of Kanaka labour was to cease, a vested interest was thereby created. I dispute that contention. As it is desirable that we should curtail the debate upon this question, I do not intend to do more than put these few points to honourable members. I ask the 'honourable member for Coolgardie not to embarrass the Committee by pressing his proposal. [3-°]-I refrained from saying anything upon this question last evening in the hope that we might arrive at a division upon it.",18,Import Duties

54,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"I should not have risen now but for some statements which have been made regarding the effect of the policy which has hitherto been pursued in respect of the sugar industry. In my innocence, I had been led to believe that the policy of encouraging a White Australia had already been successfully established. But, after looking over the figures, I am bound to say that the matter has not yet by any means been decided. We must still look to the future to ascertain how the policy will work out. SinceI have looked into them closely, I confess that the figures are a disappointment to me. Whilst the relative proportions of white and black-grown sugar have been, made more pronounced in the direction of a preponderance of the former, there does not appear to have been a corresponding: diminution of the black labour employed in the industry. ThatI submit is the final test of whether or not the policy has been successful. When imposing these duties, and providing for the payment of bounty and Excise, we did not set out to encourage white-grown sugar any further. Our object was to save the industry from extinction. We also intended to do our best to diminish the number of those employed in the industry who were not of our own race. The statistics now available show that only a very slight diminution has taken place in the coloured labour employed in the industry. All that we have done during the past seven years is to deport 4,000 Kanakas. But, while we have done that, their places have been largely filled by Other Asiatics. randum prepared by Dr. Maxwell, and presented to this House in 1904, I learn . that there were then 9,958 coloured persons engaged, in the industry, and the figures supplied by the Treasurer last evening show that there still remain in the industry 7,90/ -coloured persons. field work at all. look at the figures for 1901, and see the quantity of labour which was employed then? that in 1904 there were 9,958 coloured persons employed in the industry. that white men could not possibly work in the cane-fields. the two sets of figures which are available to me. If the Attorney-General has figures relating to the position in 1901, I shall be glad to hear them. According to the statistics presented by the Treasurer last evening, there .are nearly 8,000 coloured persons still engaged in the-sugar industry. Clearly, therefore, there has been a diminution in the number of coloured labourers of only 1,900. In other words, 4,000 Kanakas have been deported, and 2,000 other coloured persons, have taken their places.. the sugar grown this year has been registered for the purpose of securing the bounty ? black labour is not being employed in the industry ? Mr 'JOSEPH COOK I admit that the figures are puzzling to me. has been quoting the figures relating to 1906. the. figures which were presented to the Committee by the Treasurer last night. employing coloured persons last year were not. eligible to register for the bounty payable in respect of this vear. the explanation. At any rate, the figures do not look healthy at all. Are four or five thousand more coloured workers to go out of the sugar industry this year? I should like to know if the Treasurer has any information of the probabilities in that connection ? It seems strange that 4,000 or 5,000 coloured workers should go out of the industry this year, because they represent more than the total number who have gone out of it during seven years. 1 hope that the suggestion conveyed by the figures in question is well founded, because I am anxious to give the White Australia policy a reasonable trial. Indeed, I believe that we ought to see that Australia is kept for the white races, and I shall do my best to achieve that ideal. For that reason it appears to me that the import duty. the Excise, and the bounty all form part of a carefully-devised scheme. They are all part of an undertaking which was entered, into with the Queensland sugar growers, which it would be very wrong to break at the present time. The period",19,Import Duties

68,Mr Joseph Cook,"That may bewhen this question should have been raised was last year, when we extended the bounty till 1912, and provided that at the end of that time it should vanish. We have entered into a definite understanding with the sugar-growers that after 1912 they must not expect a continuance of the treatment which they are now receiving at the hands of this Parliament. we make a protest against it upon every opportunity. pect it they will have no grounds for doing so, inasmuch as the statutory contract provides that at the end of 1912 it shall cease to exist. To begin to disrupt the present relations in the way that has been suggested by the honourable member for Coolgardie would be a very inadvisable thing. member think that a duty of 25 per cent, is sufficient for the sugar-growers? question which we have to consider. The question is, "" What are we going to do about the arrangements which have already been definitely made with the sugar-growers of Queensland?"" The time to have asked whether 25 per cent, was not a sufficient duty to levy upon sugar was twelve months ago. We are definitely committed for a certain period to much more than 25 per cent -whethe r for good or ill-and until the expiration of that time we should not interfere either with the duty, the Excise or the bounty except for some very special reasons. One of those special reasons was hinted at last evening by the honourable member for North Sydney. If it should happen that a tremendous increase took place in the production of Australian sugar, thus making a huge surplus available for export, I should involved in that policy are being dealt be ready to reopen the whole question, because I do not think that Parliament contemplated that we should pay a large bounty to the growers of Queensland to enable them to dispose of their commodity at cheap rates oversea. The whole arrangement was entered into for the purpose of preserving the industry from extinction and of enabling it to maintain itself under the conditions which then existed. protection without destruction. able member for Parkes says, it was a case of protection without destruction. I do not think this Parliament ought to dream of breaking the contract which was entered into with the sugar-growers. Mr W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [3.11]. I intend to say only a very few words upon this question, because it seems to me that the discussion cannot have any real effect at the present time. I am not inaccord with those honourable members who have declared that this Parliament has entered into an arrangement with the Queensland sugar-growers-a n arrangement amounting to something in the nature of a contract. If ' w e had entered into are arrangement in the nature of a contract it would be wrong of us to break that contract at any time, even under the stress of special circumstances. is aware that a period is fixed during which the bounty shall continue to operate? Mr W. H . IRVINE I am aware of that. But any Tariff law stands upon exactly the same foundation as any other law, inasmuch as it does not enter into any contract by means of legislative enactment. If we say that the arrangement -entered into with the sugar-growers of Queensland is a contract, and therefore ought not to be disturbed, we must recognise that everv person who has vested interests which are affected by the Tariff occupies exactly a similar position, and that it would be unjust on our part to interfere with those interests. differently from any other item in the Tariff. Mr W. H . IRVINE I quite agree that there are very special circumstancessurrounding the imposition of the duty upon sugar, because that duty. forms part of a general policy which can be dealt with effectually only when all the other matters with.

Every Act of Parliament is passed, not with a view to contractual obligations, but subject to the fact that the policy and the necessities of the State may at any time .induce us to alter it. take into consideration the fact that people have been induced to act on the faith of the duties. Mr W. H . IRVINE I quite say so; and that applies to almost every item in the Tariff. Tariff imposed a large duty on woollen goods, and people were thereby induced to enter upon the manufacture of woollens, that duty ought not to be altered without our seriously considering their position. A similar principle applies to the duty under consideration, possibly even in a greater degree, because it is only a matter of degree. opinion was quite the reverse in regard to the. Bounties Bill. Mr .W. H . IRVINE I do not agree with the honourable member. I join with the honourable member for Angas in urging that this amendment ought not to be pressed to a division at present. I , for one, should certainly feel that, under the circumstances, the amendment being introduced at this time', I should have to support the Government proposal; but I am not at all sure that many of the arguments of the honourable member who submitted the amendment are not arguments that at the proper time ought to be given effect to. -In order to prevent any misunderstanding as to the vote I shall give, I desire to occupy a few minutes. I am entirely in sympathy with the honourable member for Coolgardie in any proposal which has the effect of cutting down duties; but, in this matter, there are other considerations to which we cannot shut our eyes. The honourable member for Flinders has contended with some force that Parliament cannot enter into an obligation or a contract; and that is quite true. We know that one Parliament cannot bind the next Parliament. If , for instance, this Parliament were to appoint a High Commissioner for seven years, the next Parliament could, as soon as it met three years later, ignore the decision, and appoint some one else. But although Parliament cannot enter into a contract', Parliament does enter-into moral obligations. into a mail contract, which could not very well be broken. break a mail contract only by subjecting ourselves to very heavy damages outside. But we have many instances in political life of moral contracts. We know very well that when a duty is placed on ai particular commodity, and when on the strength of that duty a number of manufacturers start business, no one cries out more than do For instance, suppose the protectionists about vested interests. The term "" vested interests "" is always taken to convey a sort of moral obligation. A number of people with capital enter into particular industries, not under a. contract with Parliament, but under a sort of understanding that Parliament will not suddenly cut the ground from under their feet by removing the duty. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Without serious reasons. notice, or serious consideration. A similar position arises in the case of public-house licences granted in the States. It is frequently said that once a licence has been granted, it cannot be suddenly taken away.",21,Import Duties

It is recognised that whatever Acts may have been passed in the States Legislatures having the effect of reducing the number of public houses in a neighbourhood, there is always allowed five or seven yeais in which those interested may make arrangements for some substituted venture. I have heard two or three honourable members, who were not in Parliament when this bounty was passed, speak of Parliament as not being bound by what was then done. legally, Parliament is not bound, but I think that those who embarked on the industry at that time were clearly given to understand that the bounty would not be suddenly taken away. was stated over and over again that the .bounty would not be"" suddenly removed, but that if removed at all, it would be 1 gradually reduced from its present rate to nothing. As I say, I am in sympathy with the principle which the honourable member for Coolgardie is seeking to emphasize; but, as a member of Parliament, who'assisted to give this bounty, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that people were then led to understand clearly that the bounty, which was offered because of the obligation to emthey have sympathy with the amendment ploy white labour, would, before abolition, be gradually reduced. If we in this Parliament were to suddenly take away , the artificial crutch which we ab that time gave to those engaged in the industry, without adopting what is called a sliding-scale, we should be committing a moral breach of undertaking. The difficulty I feel is that, whereas as a free-trader, I am, of course, disposed to follow the honourable member for Coolgardie in his desire to cut down the duty, I see, as everybody else sees, that the duty and Excise are inseparably connected, as are also the Excise and the bounty. Therefore, it is quite impossible for us to deal practically and equitably with the question without taking into consideration the three items-duty, Excise, and bounty. Inasmuch as the change from black labour to white labour has only recently come about -at all events, has only recently been consummated-it would be almost hysterical on our part to suddenly change front and sweep away part of the bounty, part of the Excise, and part of the duty. I know very well, as a practical politician, that people outside do not judge us in Parliament by our real motives in all cases, but by the motives that appear on the surface. quite possible that a vote by me Mr Bruce Smith. against a proposal to reduce the duty, as suggested by the honourable member for Coolgardie, would, without some explanation, be taken as a failure on my part to adhere to my free-trade proclivities. I desire to say that my reason for hesitating to support the honourable member is not that I do not sympathize with his desire io reduce the duty, but because I see that those three items in; our fiscal arrangements are so inextricablv connected with one another, I admit that, that we cannot deal with one without dealing with the whole in a comprehensive way. often been said that a' wise Chairman of At that time it Committees ineiver gives reasons for his rulings, and I think that a similar principle applies equallv to honourable members in regard to any reasons they may ha.ve for a particular course they propose to adopt. I am not so surprised at the vote which will, we are told, be given by two or three honourable members who have spoken, as I am surprised at the reasons they have given, those reasons being to me an argument for voting in an opposite direction. Honourable members say that of the honourable member for Coolgardie, and so have I , but my vote goes with my sympathy. That may be an unusual attitude for a politician to adopt, but as you know, Mr Chairman, I am an unusual ""cuss,"" and, as I say, my vote shall go with my sympathy. The honourable member for Coolgardie has certainly made out a strong case for his amendment. The honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Parkes have suggested that reasons might be shown for Parliament departing from a moral obligation or contract. To that I say, in the first place, that this Parliament and country are under no moral obligation to the people of Queensland. The idea of moral obligation is attached to that of replacing black labour with white labour, but according to the returns, the increased areas put under sugar cultivation are not in those parts of Queensland where black labour was employed, but in the temperate portions where white labour has always been employed. It must not be forgotten that anv moral obligation there may be is on both sides; and yet, as a matter of fact, in those areas where black labour predominated, the land under sugar cultivation is decreasing.

I need only mention the jam industry, but, as a matter of fact, there is hardly an industry mentioned in the Tariff in which sugar is not an important factor. It is somewhat remarkable that iron and sugar enter into nearly all the industries concerned with the production of the necessaries of l if e ; and that affords another reason for supporting the amendment. plied by considerations of revenue; and on that point I quite agree with the honourable member for Coolgardie. The honourable member for North Sydney, next to the honourable member for Coolgardie, .presented the strongest possible case for the reduction of the duty, showing clearly that to-day Australia has nearly overtaken the demand in the Commonwealth, and mav in a short time be an exporter. The honourable member asked the pertinent question why we should give a bounty, and impose a high duty in order to encourage the sale of Australian sugar at a cheap rate outside the Commonwealth. In that view I think that the honourable member for North Sydney is quite accurate. and high duty ibe continued, Australia will be placed in a position similar to that of Germany, where the people have to bear heavy taxation in order that Great Britain may be supplied with cheap sugar. This is not altogether a matter of black labour or white labour. The honourable member for Parramatta quoted figures showing that there has simply been a transfer of alien labour from the Kanaka, who was the least objectionable of all, to the Assyrian, and the Afghan"" agent for New 'South Wales in South Africa, left this country an opponent of tlie White Australia policy, buthas returned as a strong advocate of it in consequence of his experience when in the performance of his duties abroad. The aliens That honourable member has now engaged in the sugar industry are of a class which may d r if t into other occupations, and become competitors with white people. I hope the honourable member for Coolgardie will persist in his amendment, so that I may have an opporAs to our moral obligation, the honourable member for Parkes has stated that we are cent, is more than my morally bound to recognise the licences given to hotel keepers. Very many industries recognised by Parliament. New South Wales. has been fixed there. not been recognised by the people of New South Wales. What the honourable member speaks of was a compromise agreed to by the State Parliament. In any case, one Parliament cannot bind another. ThatA third reason is supis made evident by the fact that we are now engaged in altering many .Tariff items agreed .to by a previous Parliament. Have those affected by the changes the right to complain that vested interests are being injured? When we were last dealing with the sugar. industry, the representatives of Queensland said, "" Surely you will not put an end to the bounty payments without giving notice of your intention to the growers?"" In recognition of the justice of giving notice, we agreed that in 1911 and 1912 the bounty should taper off, and then cease. Buti f we agree to the proposed duty now, without protest, we shall be told later on, "" In 1907 you agreed to the duty, and thus gave us reason to beIf. the 'bounty lieve that you intended in 1912 to continue the present system."" I hope that a large number will be found supporting the amendment. My 'opinion that it should be supported is strengthened by the statements made by the honourable' member for North Sydney, as the' result of a careful study of the question.

I believe that the honourable member for Coolgardie is at heart a true and conscientious free-trader, and therefore think that he should have moved the abolition of the import duty. Apparently, however, free-trade is now eliminated from the political catalogue, and in this Parliament, we have only revenue tariffists. Labour Party first of all. members of this party may have their little differences, they are all, whether free-traders or protectionists, loyal to the flag under which they serve. Although some honourable members have complained that we pay too dearly for our sugar, according to Mulhall, in i8n, and again in 1820, the British duty on sugar was £27 a ton,, and the price of the commodity £90 per ton in the firstnamed year, and £63 per ton in the second, while as late as 1890 the French taxation was 3s. 7d. per head of population, so that Australia pays very little to make sugar-growing a white, man's industry. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the price of sugar for table use is £20 wholesale, which works out at 2.i/7d. per lb., and I know that sugar of splendid quality has been sold in Victoria retail for 2s. 6d. for 12 lbs. The view is held by some that sugaris entering too much into the diet of human beings, and many medical men are prohibiting its use in some diseases, but it is certainly cheap enough. According to the Economist, the London prices of refined sugar, on the 7th September last, were as followYellow crystals... Cubes, No. 1 ... Cubes, No. 2 ... Granulated Crystals, white ... Pieces .. --I hope that the honourable member will withdraw his amendment. The adoption of my suggestion to make the Excise on sugar, the product of coloured labour, equal to the import duty, would do more to bring about what, as labour representatives, we both desire-the providing of more work for our white population. I hold that if we agreed to the amendment, sugar produced by coloured labour in other parts of the world would come into this market. Furthermore, a reduction of the duty on beet sugar would do more to gain the honourable member's end than would the carrying of the amendment. Even the people of the West Indies, who for generations have been growing sugar cane, have quite recently been compelled to accept assistance from the Home Government, because their black labour product could not compete with beet sugar, a white labour product. honourable member for Melbourne asks me the to do an impossibility. The difficulty cannot be solved, as I shall show presently, is so. While the by making the Excise duty on Australian sugar equal to the import duty on sugar from abroad, nor can a private member propose an increase in duty. Furthermore, no Excise is proposed in the schedule, the Government assuming-wrongly , I think that the rate of Excise being fixed by an Act passed in 1905, it is unnecessary to prescribe it in the Tariff schedule. I presume, however, that they acted under legal advice. For both reasons the request of the honourable member for Melbourne cannot be complied with, the privilege of increasing a duty resting with the Government. Nor can it be shown that the adoption of this course would solve the difficulty. I freely admit that by raising the Excise a ton to the level of the import duty and increasing the bounty to the grower of sugar by white labour, we should seriously penalize the grower of sugar by black labour, and assuredly drive him out of the industry. We have to remember, however, that under the Braddon section three-fourths of the amount raised by way of Excise must be returned to the States, and hence this proposition, if adopted, would result in serious financial embarrassment. In other words, if we adopted the proposition ... 17/ ... 17/4% suggested by the honourable member ... 20/3 for Melbourne and others, that the ... iq/6 Excise should be raised to the level ... ... 18/3 ... iq/3 ... 18/3 .. iq/3 of the import duty, we jvould raise --13/9 ... 16/9 £1,200,000 estimating, the production' of white-grown Australian sugar at 200,000 tons and as three-fourths of that amount would have to be returned",24,Import Duties

The white grower will be .no better off than before. The only alteration in his position is that, instead of receiving £ 3 as bounty and £ 2 per ton as protection, he would receive the whole £ 5 in one lump payment from the Treasury. The'remedy is. therefore, worse than the disease. We add to the complexity of our already complicated machinery to deprive the black grower of any Tariff advantage, whereas we can do it at once and directly by reducing the import duty to £ 4 . The excuse of the honourable member for Grey and others, who attempt to justify their support of the black grower by pretending that I am taking the wrong method, is thus shown to be hollow and theatrical. The true way, and the only way, to deprive the black grower of his present advantage is to reduce the import duty. have heard a good deal about an alleged contract made between this Parliament and the planters, the assumption being that we have given the planters something in the nature of an assurance that the present arrangement will not be disturbed before the end of 1912. The attempt to make out a case in favour of the existence of such a contract or understanding has been fairly well met by the honourable member for Angas. Mr J. H . CATTS -And by the honourable member for Flinders. clearly showed that there is no warrant for such a contention. WhilstI have never denied that to a large extent the. import duty, the Excise and the bounty are interwoven in the one broad general policy, such an admission does not affect my position. My contention is that if the amendment I have submitted were adopted the planter would still enjoy as large a measure of protection as he is reasonably entitled to receive. If we were starting afresh-if we had in Queensland no black labour, and no Excise or bounty were required-shoul d Unless it is we think it fair to burden the masses of the community with more than a 25 per cent, duty on sugar ? should not impose, even a 25 per cent, duty. common-sense of honourable members would lower rate, or, at all events, not to exceed it. If that be so, my contention that we shall be perfectly justified in reducing this duty to 25 per cent, is unassailable. There has been no agreement that the planter should have undiluted and continuous protection. I must thank the honourable member for Brisbane for having told the Com-, mittee last night what he regarded as theundisguised truth, and in view of his statement, those who vote against the amendment, for the reduction of the duty will do so with their eyes open. The honourable member said that the protection and bounty now granted to the planters would alwaysbe required in respect of sugar grown in. the tropical districts of Queensland. Colonel FOXTON -B y white labour. mission occasioned me some astonishment;, but, at the same time, I recognise thecourage and the frankness of the honourable We member in making it. The honourable member went further, saying that even if the cultivation of some other product weresubstituted for sugar in the tropical districts of Queensland it would require from the rest of Australia equal protection and assistance to enable it to be carried onby white labour. That is a very valuable admission, more especiallysince it comesfrom an honourable member who is thoroughly familiar with the conditions of tropical agriculture in the State of which he is a representative. In the circumstances it must be regarded as an authoritativeThey statement; and, therefore, those who vote for the retention of the duty can hardly complain if , in 1912, or in the interveningyears, they are confronted by their words and their votes on this occasion. They arevoting now in f u l l light of the knowledge that we shall be called upon to continue this coddling of the industry after 1912 ; and if""",25,Import Duties

The honourable member for Angas has appealed to me not to press this motion to a division,urging that the moral effect of my protest is in itself sufficient. I should like to comply with his request, but I . do not think it would be wise to do so. Whenever hitherto this duty has been under the consideration of the House, the honourable and learned member has delivered forcible and eloquent protests against it .

WeI think we should shall be defeated, of course-badl y defeated-bu t the division list will be no true reflex of the opinion of this House.

But this pretence is akin to the others advanced on the part of the planters. that the special legislation dealing with the sugar industry was passed at the end of 1905. The planters must have known then that that legislation would terminate in 1912. That is, indeed, clearly stated in the law. suppose that any sensible man would pay a big price for land, and enter into occupation of it , knowing that the profits accruing from it might be determined seven years hence? We must further recollect that eighteen months would elapse before he could secure any return whatever from his land. I hold that it is very unlikely that any individual would embark upon the industry when he knew that the profits accruing from it were likely to be terminated within a few years. The honourable member for Parramatta appeared to thinkjudging from his remarks-that the honourable member for North Sydney had first discovered that Australia was likely to be called upon to pay an export bounty upon sugar.

If that sugar is sold to a jam-maker, the latter pays that amount to the sugar-grower.

Sydney) [4.10] I have already brought under the notice of the Treasurer the danger of the people of Australia being taxed as the result of a heavy export of Australian sugar. Of course, I am assuming that the usual practice is followed of remitting the Excise upon sugar exported, and also of paying a bounty upon its production. I do not think it was the intention of this Parliament to do more than support the in a reconsideration of this matter. dustry to supply the requirements of Australia. We did not intend to support it to the extent of enabling it to supply other people with sugar at a cheap price, as the result of our contribution to the industry. As ,it seems probable that during the present year the industry will reach an exporting level, I desire to know whether the Treasurer has yet given consideration to the question of whether he will continue to allow the remission of the Excise upon exported sugar. If he has not given it consideration, I desire to know whether he will do so without delay, because the question must almost immediately become a very important one. We must recollect that every 25,000 tons of sugar that we exwill read the debate upon this matter which port will necessitate a contribution of £75,000 by the people of Australia for the supply of cheap sugar to countries oversea. I ask the Treasurer whether he 'has given this matter consideration, and if he that was what was intended-that we has not done so, will the Cabinet consider it at an early dale, so that a conclusion may be arrived at upon a very important matter ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [4.11] I do not wish to utter one word to prolong this debate. In answer to the question put by the honourable member for North Sydney, I merely desire to say that we may well wait until we are exporting sugar before we decide the matter which he referred to. It will be quite time enough for us to take the fence when we come to it. I wish to say, however, that I quite disapprove of any arrangement under which the price of sugar will be kept up internally, whilst being lowered externally. If this debate has served no other purpose-and the present occasion is about the fourth rehearsal that we have bad of the debate upon the duty on sugar taxation to the extent of £1,250,000, it is a very important matter -that at the present time the price of Sir WILLIA M LYNE I am not disputing that. Mr .PAGE -Does not the Treasurer think that new members wish to hear the matter discussed ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The honourable member must recollect that we have a Hansard, and that new members can read the reports of previous debates in that publication. At the present time, we allow a rebate upon sugar exported in the form of jam. When we are exporting largely, I certainlythink that there must be I say that,' in view of what I regard as'an undertaking-if not an absolute bargain-whic h we entered into with our eyes open, that the existing conditions should continue until 1912 Sir WILLIA M LYNE -They will terminate at the end of 1912. The decline which will take place in the bounty during the two years immediately preceding its termination constitute an intimation, which was deliberately inserted in the Sugar Bounty Act, to those in New South Wales and Queensland who are receiving that assistance at the present time, that it is not to be continued. If honourable members took place in the Senate, they can have no two opinions as to what were the intentions of Parliament in this connection. I was surprised to hear it suggested-if should have to continue for all time the payment of the bounty upon sugar, and also the system of charging Excise upon it. gested that. Brisbane did so. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I interpreted his remarks to mean that to prevent the importation of sugar produced by cheap labour, it would be necessary to retain a border duty upon that article. That is what I understood him to mean, and I quite agree with him. Certainly I could not endorse the opinion that the Excise and the bounty should be continued after the term specified in the Sugar Bounty Act. Colonel FOXTON I was not referring to that matter. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I wish to emphasize the fact that it is a scandal-if I may be permitted to use that strong word",28,Import Duties

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I was under the impression that horses were included. This, however, is not really a duty, but merely a toll such as is imposed in other countries, in order that some control mav be exercised over the imports. -The explanation of the Treasurer only serves to put the duty in a worse light than that in which it appeared at first. Such a charge as he indicates would be perfectly justifiable if made in connection with quarantine, for example, in the case of animals imported for stud purposes. I remind the honourable gentleman, however, that all stud animals are excluded from the operation of the T a r if f ; and most of the highly-priped animals are for stud purposes. As I said before, the only occasion on which animals have been imported for food purposes was in the drought of 1902-3, when it would have been perfectly justifiable to suspend the operation of a protective Tariff. The Victorian Tariff, the Canadian Tariff, and the United States Tariff are all samples of protective Tariffs. Sir to be so, and I hope it will be. so, I wish the Treasurer would be as reatotal importation of cattle, sheep, and pigs sonable in regard to other' proposed prois nominal.

There are duty will not benefit in a protective way State laws to protect our herds and flocks the stock-owners of the Commonwealth; against diseased cattle; and, since stud indeed, it will be as detrimental to them as animals are not dutiable, it seems to me that to the consuming public.

I suppose I do not know ; that at the very outside the revenue under this item wouldamount to £ 5 0 a year, unless, of course, people are in the habit of importing such animals as pets. not think that this duty would be of any service from the point of view of either protection or revenue.

I can remember when the Commonwealth Government, although the stock of New South Wales was dying by thousands, refused to reduce the fodder duties. I should be sorrv to see a return of those times, and to find ourselves dependent on Tasmania for our food supplies. During the election, I said that if any of my electors particularly wished that certain strangled industries should be aided by means of a little prolection, I saw no reason why they should not be protected. I also told them that I was waiting for the reports of the Tariff Commission; and when those reports were issued, I found that both the free trade section and the protectionist section recommended that tHere should be no tax whatever'On horses, cattle, sheep, or pigs. Yet we have these heavy duties now proposed. mended by the Tariff Commission to impose duties of this kind, and, therefore, I shall vote against them. It seems to me that the indignation of the honourable member for Hunter must have been assumed, because it cannot matter greatly whether these duties are retained or abolished. we have a big drought. large a country that it is not possible for a big drought to affect our food supplies. Droughty conditions will never prevail all over the continent at any one time, rendering it necessary for us to import cattle and sheep for food.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [5.34]-I am surprised at the opposition to these duties. As the honourable member for Bass has pointed out, Tasmania does not rear sufficient live stock to supply herself with food,her supplies coming, chiefly from New South Wales and Victoria. But, as the vessels trading between New Zealand and Australia have become larger and more powerful, I have expected the Dpminion to commence sending stock to Tasmania. Cattle could be taken from New Zealand to Hobart almost as easily as from Twofold Bay. Why should we not impose a duty to protect Australian interests in this matter? The mainland should have the advantage of supplying stock to Tasmania, iust as in times of drought Tasmania supplies fodder to AusThe Ministry were not recomtralia. stock raisers as well as other persons be protected ? though very often, while desiring protection for themselves, they wish to get their requirements as cheaply as possible.

So far as I can judge, this item is not required for checking purposes. surely the Government should have thought it necessary to apply it to the high-priced animals that are imported for stud purposes as well as to animals intended for our food supplies. If , on the other hand, this is regarded by the Government as a protective duty, I would point out that the stock-owners of Australia are exporters, and that it is only under exceptional circumstances that animals are imported for food. supply purposes. The only occasion on which I remember stock being imported for such purposes was during the drought of 1902-3, and I think the Committee will agree that it would be unwise to impose a tax of this kind not upon the active producing operations of the country, but upon the poverty of the people. It would press upon the people at a time when we should most desire to assist them. question "" That the item as amended be agreed to .

I wish to move that these duties be reduced by one-half. If it is, to the honourable member that he would be in order in moving that.the duties on horned cattle, sheep, and. pigs be reduced by one-half, but that it would not be competent for him to move that the duty on horses, to which we have just agreed, should be similarly reduced. Federal Tariff, as well as in our consideration of that now before us, we have never departed from a fixed rule. I do not suppose that the proposition. submitted by the honourable member for Calare will be carried, so that in this case no difficulty is likely to arise, but if we adopted your suggestion, Mr Chairman, we might, create a precedent which would work badly in relation to a motion that was likely to be carried. The duties under this item have been levied from 9th August last, and if we omitted them from the I propose to put the Tariff we should make the whole of the collections up to the present date illegal. On the other hand, by following the course which we have hitherto pursued we should preserve the interests of the Department, and keep it free from such a situation. We should make the collections legal up to the date on which we determined the duties should cease. For the first time in my experience we are proposingto adopt a form of procedure which is wrong, and might If that course were prove most. inconvenient as a precedent. Hitherto we have always accepted a duty up to the date on which an amendment has been proposed, and the amendment has always removed or reduced the duty from the date of its being carried. It would be rather inconvenient, for the sake of overcoming the little difficulty which you, sir, have foreseen, to depart from that practice. COOK -If the question a decision of the Committee. ber for Calare could move that from a certain date, say, two days later than the date on which it has been decided that under this item'horses shall be dutiable, all stock coming under the item shall be free.

Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 34 -Sag o and Tapioca, per lb., £d. That the words "" and on and after 17th October, 1907, per central 2s.,"" be added. I would point out that the import expenses upon these commodities already amount to a protection of 10' per cent., and that neither sago nor tapioca is produced in Australia. The duty is intended to be a revenue duty only. Further, these articles are very valuable foodstuffs, which are absolutely indispensable to the nursery and the sick room. They are largely used in foods for infants, and the proposed duty is equivalent to quite 56 per cent, ad valorem. In 1906, the importations of sago and tapioca amounted to 76,067 centals, and the duty paid upon them totalled £13,416. Probably, with a reduced duty operative, there would be larger consumption of these commodities, and thus the revenue would be benefited. I know that most honourable members are desirous of disposing of the Tariff as quickly as possible, and with that object in view, I intend to state my reasons for submitting any amendments that I may move as brieflv as possible. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [6.rr] I would point out to honourable members that the duty proposed is that which was operative under the old Tariff. It is similar to the impost which is levied in Canada, and in the United States. It is true that tapioca and sago are not grown extensively in the Commonwealth, but there are commodities produced here which take their place. I believe that these articles are produced in some parts of Australia, but in very small quantities. The duty of Jd. per lb. is equivalent to 4s. 2d. per central. It is better to make these commodities dutiable at i d . per lb. than at 4s. per central. Honourable members will notice that both sec lions of the Tariff Commission recommend the adoption of a duty of 4s. per central. with the Treasurer when the members of the Tariff Commission do not happen to Watkins, D. agree with him.

Biscuits, per lb., i | d . move That the words "" and ° n and after 17th October, 1907, per lb. i d . , "" be added. I claim the support ot the Government to my proposal, inasmuch as the Tariff Commissio.'j do not recommend any increase in the old rate of duty. On these grounds, the Government, judging from their recent action, should offer no objection to a reduction of the duty. port the amendment, having myself given notice of one to a similar effect. Flour being cheaper in Australia than in the older countries, biscuits could be manufactured here at a lower price than almost anywhere else, were it not for the duty on sugar, and, in a lesser degree, the duty on currants. The importations of biscuits in 1906 amounted to 219,1.98 lbs., on which duty was paid to the amount of £1,1:22. Of the 219,198 lbs. imported, 201,185 lbscame from the United Kingdom, so that the proposed duty will be really operative, almost wholly, against the British product. The foreign importations in the same year amounted to 18,013 lbs.; and most of the imported biscuits went to Western Australia. The importation of biscuits was very small under free-trade in New South Wales before'Federation. biscuits in New South Wales then. tralian biscuits is very large, and is constantly growing. In 1900, the importation of .biscuits from outside Australia into Victoria amounted to 11,610 lbs., and into New South Wales to 10,000 lbs. In the same year, the export of the domestic product to countries outside the Commonwealth from Victoria, amounted to 2,017,020 lbs., and from New South Wales to 654,064 lbs. Of the exports from Victoria, 1,070.000 lbs. were sent to South Africa on account of the war. Biscuits, it will be seen, are very largely exported, and, so far as the manufacturers are concerned. I do not think : they are asking for anv higher duty. The export of biscuits for last year totalled 3,423,091 lbs., whilst only 219,198 lbs. were imported, and these were nearly all of British manufacture. One manufacturer,",40,Pairs

That shows that the imported article was beaten out of the market before the protective duty was put on biscuits at all. So far as I can ascertain, there has been no increase in the imports; and on the evidence of those primarily interested, I ' think we should be perfectly justified in making this item free. However, as the honourable member for Grey has moved a reduction of the duty to i d . , presumably for the purposes of revenue, I support his proposal. surer) [6.22] I hope honourable members will not adopt the proposal of the honourable member for Grey. I find that a duty of l j d . per lb. was the idea of the honourable member for Adelaide, when he introduced the Tariff of 1902. I also find that in New Zealand there is a duty of 3s. per cwt.. on ship, plain, unsweetened, and dog biscuits, and on all other biscuits 2d. per Ib., or one half-penny more than the duty now proposed. In Canada the British preference duty is 22J per cent., the intermediate duty'32^ per cent., and the general Tariff 35 per cent., the latter of which may be taken as representing, perhaps, 2jd. per lb. In the United States the duty is 20 per cent. or if d . per lb., the price of biscuits, although it goes as high as 9d. and iod. per lb., being on the average about 6d. on which the Tariff Commission were unanimous. with the Tariff Commission in referenceto this item. In New South Wales, before a duty was imposed, the price was If you at least one-third higher than afterwards, when Arnott's factory commenced operations in Newcastle. Arnott's biscuits came into competition with the imported biscuits, I believe we could go and brought the price down to the extent I have mentioned: ally been getting less. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The imports, amount to 219,198 lbs. WhatI find is that those manufacturers who have secured the run of the market do not desire competition. While preparing the TariffI found that all those manufacturers desired was sufficient duty to establish themselves, and, when they were established, they did not desire any others to come in and share the trade. I want to prevent that state of things. I desire to increase competition so that the price may be made still lower than it is at present. was examined before the Tariff Commission, and he said he did not want any higher duty. cause the manufacturers now in business do not wish to face any competition; and the same feeling has been found in other industries, for instance, in the case of Hoskins' ironworks. As a protectionist, I have, in preparing the Tariff, always tried fo so arrange duties as to induce morecompetition. Not a single biscuit ought to be imported into Australia. bines ! Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Before the Tariff has been completed the honourable member will find that we shall deal with combines. Part and parcel of the object of the Tariff is to stop combines; and if we cannot devise means to that end, a great deal of the interest I take in this protectionist Tariff dies. I desire to stop combines, as I said; and they shall be stopped if the machinery of the law can stop them. give manufacturers duties that they do not want? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The manufacturers say that they do not want the duties; but, on the other hand, the public say that the duties ought to' be imposed because cheaper biscuits are wanted.

If he would at once decide what he intends to do with respect to this momentous issue there would be an end to the debate. The duty collected on biscuits imported into Australia last year was £1,122, and as the honourable member for North Sydney has said, the situation will not be altered if prices remain unchanged. There can be a greater inducement to competition only when the prices go up; and I do not think we desire the prices of commodities of this kind to increase. Not a manufacturer in Australia has asked that the duty on biscuits be increased. In Victoria, where the imposition of protective duties was done pretty thoroughly, the last duty, prior to Federation, was i d . per lb., whilst in New South Wales it was Jd. per lb.

Item 36, Blue, laundry, per lb., 2d. move That the words "" and on and after 17th October, 1907, per lb., i d . , "" be added. Under the old Tariff-the duty upon this article was i d . per lb. blue at the port of shipment is 5^d. per lb., so that the proposed duty is equivalent to about 40 per cent, ad valorem. The cost of importation represents an additional 15 per cent., and, consequently, the total measure of protection that would be afforded local manufacturers under the Government proposal would be about 55 per cent. The principal ingredient in blue is ultramarine, which is imported from Germany. The mixing of this dye with flour is the only process in the manufacture of blue, and provides employment for scarcely any labour. Some. so-caIle_d local manufacturers import bulk blue from Reckitt's and other British makers, and after putting it through a slight treatment-whic h is really a process of adulteration-sel l it as their own product. The proposed duty is practically prohibitive. I may mention that the quantity of blue imported into New South Wales in 1900 was 6*82,546 lbs., and into Victoria, 47,911 lbs. The price raising influence of the duty may be seen from the following fact:-Messrs. Lewis and Whitty manufacture blue in Melbourne and issue price lists in Melbourne and Sydney. , According to a price list issued instance the Government propose to inby them on 24th May, 1900, the price of crease the old rate of duty by 100 per blue squares, "" Vienna Brand,"" in 8 lb. cent. No information has been supplied parcels-12 8 lbs. constituting a case-wa s 4^d. per lb. in Sydney, and 6Jd. per lb. in Melbourne. The price of Keen's blue, made in England, was quoted on 12th This is one of those cases in March, 1901, in the Svdney Trade Review, at 6£d per lb., and in the Melbourne Journal of Commerce, on 16th March of the same year, at 8^ per lb. From the Sydney quotation of Messrs. Lewis and I shall accept that proquotation ? have not the price lists at hand. the prices of imported blue? point out that practically all the blue used in the Commonwealth"" is imported. As I have already explained, it simply undergoes a simpleprocess of adulteration and I is then sold as Australian blue. Ultramarine is a German production, and is really the finished product of the German manufacturer. In 1906, the import of laundry blue into the Commonwealth was The value of 2 3 7 J 3 8 4 lbs., valued at £ 5 , 4 9 3 , of which 237,008 lbs., valued at £5,483.. came from the United Kingdom. It will thus be seen that the proposed duty would simply be another tax, almost wholly upon British manufacture. The Government, which, professes to be so greatly in favour-of extending a preference to goods from the United Kingdom, is actually proposing to levy a prohibitive duty upon British blue. The persons who would be called upon to pay this duty would be primarily, the small householders of the poorest class, who cannot afford to send their linen to laundries and, secondly, 'on the laundry men and women. They cannot increase their prices on account of the duty, and thus the impost would f a l l principally upon the poorer classes of the . community. I am' well within the mark in affirming that 95 per cent, of the proposed duty would be borne by the smaller householders who are in poor circumstances. Consequently, I hope I shall receive the assistance of honourable members in securing a reduction of the duty by one-half. ' '",46,Pairs

336,Mr Wilks (Dalley) [8.27],"In thisby the Tariff Commission to warrant any such step being taken. Tariff Commission has recommended an increase. little evidence. The amount of duty collected in 1906 upon blue was less than £1,000. Judging by the statement of the honourable member for Lang, it is not outside competition which is to be feared in connection with this industry so much as internal competition between the States. Apparently New South Wales has made a speciality of the manufacture ofblue, and is making inroads upon the market of other States. In speaking upon the last item under consideration the Treasurer declared that he dearly loves competition. If he is sincere in that statement, why should he desire to impose a duty of 2d. per lb. upon blue? That is the way to foster the creation of trusts. A duty of i d . per lb. has been sufficient to prevent serious importation in the past, and why, therefore, should we increase the impost to 2d. per lb? We had a similar experience in regard to starch a few years ago. honourable! member for Lang has shown what are the component parts of blue, and he asserts, on trade evidence, that it is impossible to manufacture without importing the material. I , therefore, urge the Treasurer to reduce the duty to the original id. It cannot be said that, the industry has not grown in Australia, because the importations are considerably less than they were, and there is a large output of the article in New South Wales. though there is a number of blue manufacturers in Victoria and New South conditions Wales, only one of them, the representaandWhat tive of Messrs.

He the was then asked whether the trade had suffered to any extent, and he replied, "" Well, we have not progressed as we should, have done."" That question was asked the witness on several different occasions, but he never, said that the trade had suffered-the most he would say was that it had not progressed as it ought to have done. The whole source of the trouble, so far as the Victorian manufacturers are concerned, is that, in consequence of the establishment of the industry in New South Wales by Reckitt, the well-known manufacturer of England, and other smaller firms, Inter-State competition has come largely into operation. It is not importations from outside from which the Victorian manufacturers are suffering; they are feeling the effect of that competition which all Australian manufacturers must meet under, Inter-State free-trade. I submit that no case was made out before the Tariff Commission by Messrs. Lewis and Whitty to justify any increase in the duty. The question we have the evidence taken before the Tariff Commission, and the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Commission, that the duty be increased. Last year there was imported £5,803 worth of blue, as compared with £4,740 worth imported in 1905} showing an increase of £1,063. This increase is evidence that more protection is necessary.

341,Mr Fuller,"The other witness was' ioemploys twenty men in the manufacture of blue, while the other witness, who represents a firm in Great Britain, said that no one but himself is employed in his business in Australia. The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission simply refer in their report to the evidence given by this importer's agent, whereas the protectionist section rely on the evidence of the man who employs a number of hands ""in Australia, and pays the wages which we consider ought to be paid.. I trust the' Government will adhere to the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Commission. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [8.37] The question appears to be whether or not sufficient protection is given, under the old Tariff. I have in m.v hand a letter from a well-known firm of Brisbane merchants, from which I read the following passageThe highest quality of imported blues, viz., Keen's, formerly paid duty at the rate of i d . per lb., which with landing charges amounts to the solid protection of 35 per cent. The new rate of i d . per lb. means the prohibitive rate of 55 per cent. This blue sells retail at qd. per lb. Generally speaking, the very best colonial blues sell at the rate of 6d. per lb., which proves clearly that there is no necessity for the increased duty. Not being in the trade,"" I cannot, of course, vouch for the correctness of the figures, but the firm I quote are very large importers, and in a position to know what they are writing about. figures from another source. Colonel FOXTON -Apparentl y it pays to produce blue locally and sell it 3d. per lb. cheaper than the imported article. It would appear that what is required is, not more protection, but an improvement in the quality of the Australian blue. honourable member for Batman quoted from the evidence of Mr Lewis as to the difference in the labour conditions as between Australia, and foreign countries, and read an extract showing that Mr Lewis, when asked what the difference was, replied. ""There must'be nearly 100 percent."" I said a. little while ago that out of an importation of 237,384 lbs., there came from the old country 237,008 lbs. I presume the honourable member for Batman does not Tegard England as a foreign country; and, therefore, the whole importation from foreign countries is only 376 lbs. What, then, does it matter whether there is a difference of 100 per cent., or of 1,000 per cent., in the labour conditions, so far as foreign countries are concerned? is another case in which the Treasurer might carry out the principles of the Government in regard to preference to the mother country. I do not know that there are any more magnificent efforts of eloquence in the language than those of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer on the subject of preference to the dear old mother land. Here we have an opportunity to show the practical nature of our patriotism, because the whole of the importation of blue comes, not from Japan, China, Malabar, or any of those other cursed places, but from the mother country. The English blue does not crush out the Australian blue, because, as shown by the honourable member for Brisbane, the former sells at 3d. to 4d. per lb. higher than does the local product; and this must be a strong inducement to the poorer classes of the community to purchase the cheaper article. This is not one of of those items on which the Committee need go rabid. Blue is an article of general consumption, and enters into a form of Australian industry, which, I am sure, no one wishes to discourage. Mr Lewis, in his evidence before the Tariff Commission, very properly referred to the twenty hands he employs; but we must not forget that blue is an article used in an industry which employs thousands of hands amongst the women of Australia. I notice that, according to Mr Lewis' evidence, his firm has invested some thousands of pounds in the industry, and that they employ about twenty adult hands, at wages ranging from 15s. to 50s. weekly. Now, 15s. a week for an adult certainly does not indicate a very healthy state of things. This is an item in connection with which much time would be saved if the Treasurer would accept the suggestion which has been made to him. This suggestion has the advantage of meaning a genuine preference to the mother country, because there are only a few cwts. of foreign blue imported. I hope honourable members will, seeing that it would not involve the sacrifice of their principles, or the crushing of anv colonial industry, give the preference suggested. The Government' have created very large expectations in the mother country in this matter, and by adopting my suggestion they will have an opportunity to give effect",48,Pairs

Therefore the giving. of preference in this instance will mean merely the reduction of the duty. As has been stated by Mr Asquith, very frankly, effectively, and properly, it is the duty of the' Commonwealth to develop its resources without considering the commercial interests of Great Britain. I am a preferentialist, but I think that we should consider the question of preferences in a business-like and orderly manner. We should first frame our ..Tariff against the whole world, with a view to the speedy development of Australian industries, and then deal with the question of preference either by increasing or decreasing duties. like way of dealing with the matter.

Still, I hope that the 'Government, when duties are necessary for the protection of Australian industries, will resist what I regard as specious methods of obtaining reductions. Ministers should not allow the sentiment for preference to be used as a lever for the reduction of duties.

While the Tariff exempts from -duty machinery for woollen and hat mills, no advantage is to be given to the washerwoman of Australia. honourable member for Wimmera has complained that no reference has been made to the Tariff Commission's reports-on this subject. Although the protectionist section recommended a high duty on blue, this is what the free-trade section said on the subjectThe only complainant before the Commission enjoyed a monopoly of the blue trade in Victoria before Federation (Shrimpton, Q.4132). "" They enjoyed 85 to 90 per cent, of the blue trade "" (Shrimpton, Q.4132). appeared before the Tariff Commission to make a complaint about the existing duty on blue. The report continues"" It is not so much Reckitts as the other manufacturers (in New South Wales) that are competing in Victoria"" (Shrimpton, Q.4134). "" Messrs. Reckitts, my chief opponents, have established a business in Sydney for making blue. There are two or three small manufacturers there, and they have been attacking the Victorian trade for several years. That, primarily, in my opinion, is why Messrs. Lewis and Whitty's trade has decreased considerably "" should stand as against the mother country, (Shrimpton, Q.4132). In the face of those statements, honourable members will have great difficulty in justifyin g any vote that they may give to increase the duty on blue. I hope that the Committee will have some consideration for the two large sections of the community who have to seriously look at every farthing they have to spend, and who will be the greatest sufferers from this impost. ness. the honourable member for Riverina says that we ought to get on with business, I wish to point out that the items in DivisionI V . are those which chiefly concern the working classes and the poor, and if we are to make reductions for their benefit., we should make them in this division. Blue may not appear a very important commodity, but if we agree to the duty without demur, allowing the proposed high rate to be fixed, we shall be asked to take the same course in regard to other items. I hope, therefore, that the honourable member The whole Tariff question for Lang will press his amendment. Honourable .members, both in the Chamber and be rediscussed. Therefore, the on the platform outside, are always speaking of their interest in the wage-earners, and to-night they will have an opportunity to give effect to it by their votes. Honourable members have said that the original duty imposed under the Tariff of The 1902 was equal to 56 per cent. If that duty is to be increased by 100 per cent, we shall have a total protection of 150 per cent, in faivour of the local manufacturers of blue. that. statements that have been made in regard to the percentage rate of the old duty. The honourable member for Wimmera has referred to the question of preferential trade, and it would seem that the views of many honourable members upon that question differ according to the item with which we are called upon to deal. They are very glad to grant Great Britain a preference in favour of goods which we do not obtain from the old country^ but in this case they have an opportunity to do something for her. The whole of our imports of blue come from Great Britain, and I understand tbe honourable member for East Sydney to suggest that the old duty of i d . per Ib. and that<-a duty of i j d . per lb. should be imposed against the rest of the world. I hope the honourable member for Lang will persist with his amendment, for I should like to see a vote taken upon it. The whole of this division-fro m item 34 to item 105-is of concern to the poorer secdons of the community, and if we are going to put up a fight on their behalf it should take place upon these items. If we allow what is practically the first of them to pass we shall have no justification for opposing the remainder. No. one will contend that an increase of i d . per lb. in the duty on blue is likely to bring disaster ""to Australia, but we_ have to remember that this constant piling up of taxation-penn y after penny-ha s a serious effect upon the workers.

[9.3] -S o many statements have been made as to what this duty means that I have taken the trouble to refer to the Journal of Commerce, in order to ascertain the price of the imported article. I find that the price of Keen's Oxford blue in the Melbourne market is 7 j d . per' lb. If we deduct from that price the duty of 2d. per lb., we find that the price here is s£d., or about sd. per lb. at the other end of the world.

Sir JOHN.FORREST (Swan) [9.12] A case for diis increase of duty on blue has not been made out. The item, after all, is a small one, for even if the old duty were doubled the revenue would not be increased by £1,000 per annum. It seems to me that to double the duty on blue would be indefensible. A duty of i d . per lb. is equal to an ad valorem duty of between 20 and 25 per cent., and I think that that is high enough. If we doubled the duty it would be equal to about 45 per cent. If instead of a fixed duty of 2d. per lb. an ad valorem duty of 45 per cent, had' been proposed would honourable members have supported it? same rate of duty that the honourable member proposed. propose such a duty ?

It is notlogical for us to grant a preference to some articles of commerce and to refuse it to. others unless there is good reason for making such a distinction.

Is that the reason why no preference is proposed? call the attention of honourable members to the summary of evidence prepared by the Tariff Commission upon the item of blue. In the first place, Mr Lewis, a Melbourne manufacturer, favoured the imposition of' a duty of 2d. per lb. upon that article. He declared that his request was based upon the fact that the industry was affected to a considerable extent by importations. His attention was thereupon called to the circumstance that a great deal of this importation came from the-other States, notably from New South Wales, and in reply, he stated that he was disposed to doubt the accuracy of Mr Coghlan's statistics. He added that he thought Mr Coghlan was in error in attributing to New South Wales a quantity of produce which was transferred to Victoriai n 1903. Another witness, Mr Shrimpton, submitted that the contention of Mr Lewis that the dutyshould be increased to 2d. per lb. was not warranted by the facts of the case. He pointed out that between 1902 and 1904 1 He the imports of British blue into Victoria had declined from 100,000 lbs. to 16,000 lbs., while during the same period, the transfer of Australian blue from other States had increased from 25,000 to 71,000 lbs. English blue had always been very much higher in price than the local article, and therefore did not compete with it ; it sold at from 8 i d . to' is. per lb., against the Melbourne price of 6Jd., and the Svdnev price of 7Jd.. for Australian blue. If we are in earnest about preference, this is an item on which the principle we deal so largely with the old country in this commodity. As the honourable member Apparently, we for Swan has shown, the old duty meant 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, ad valorem, whereas under the proposal before) us the protection will amount to 40 per cent, or 50 per cent. Blue is an article which It is hypocrisy. enters very laxgely into domestic consumption, especially in the homes of workingmen and farmers, and such a duty as I have mentioned, is not warranted under the circumstances.

[9,47] -The proposal of the honourable member for Franklin is a hollow mockery. We have heard from the members of the Opposition a great deal about their desire to protect the poor; but now they want to give a preference for the benefit of those who can afford to buy the dearer kinds of blue. I am in favour of preference to Great Britain, but I wish to give her real advantages; I do not desire to benefit merely the wealthy. cheap blues are imported from England. Tariff Commission, the prices of imported blue range from 8jd. to is. per lb., while locally-made blue can be bought in New South Wales for from 6Jd. to 7d. per lb. It stands to reason that the poor washerwoman will not use the dearer blue. I think that hollow shams like these should' be exposed. orable member for Hindmarsh thinks that hollow shams should be exposed, and it is very easy to expose the weakness of his argument. Persons do not pay is. per lb. for blue when they can get locally-made blue more cheaply, unless the dearer blue is the better article. The Treasurer has spoken of his love for and attachment to the mother land, and while there expressed The Government are as his readiness to do all that he could to help to increase the duty on English blue by 100 per cent., and says that he cannot give a preference to Great Britain ""because all the blue imported into Australia is the manufacture of that country. As a matter of fact, the local manufacturer, under the old Tariff, had a protection of nearly 50 per cent. It seems to me that the true protectionist cannot be a preferentialist. I could understand the Treasurer, as a protectionist, saying, "" Australian industries must be fostered at any cost, and importations, wherever they come from, must be stopped but it is inconsistent to say in one breath that he wishes to give a preference to Great Britain, and, in the next, that a was a revenue duty of 100 per cent, must be imposed on blue, because all our importations come from' that country. I am a preferentialist, and, therefore, will vote for the amendment. I hope that the question of preference will When we come to the duty on be thoroughly fought out at an early opportunity, so that the sham professions of protectionists may be.exposed. (Hindmarsh) Treasurer having stated that lie is willing to take a test vote on the subject of preference when we are dealing with the duty on candles, it is unfair for honourable members to force a division on this amendment. The blue trade is of practically no value to Great Britain. But in this division there are a large number of items on which we might well impose heavy duties to protect our manufacturers from competition from both Great Britain and foreign countries, while in other divisions there are' manv items in respect to which we could well t»ive Great Britain a preference without im'uring ourselves.

There was never a greater violation of the laws of hospitality than that of which the representatives of Australia were guilty, not by the speeches at the Imperial Conference, where they were entitled to speak in the freest and most fearless way, but by their speeches at various functions during their visit. troubled waters of party politics and created a feeling of irritation in the mother country which although it has not appeared on the surface is still very real. It is the irritation of a people who having escaped from grinding taxes upon the necessaries of life, find prosperous people from Australia urging that those obnoxious taxes should be imposed upon the crowded millions of the mother country for the benefit of Australian farmers who are ten times better off than are the farmers of the old land. One would have expected a true protectionist to suggest that Great Britain should impose heavy duties on wheat in order that the farmers there might have some protection. honourable member, when we were dealing with the duty on wire-netting, said that the man on the land was badly off. man is liable to adversity. The honourable member to-day might be rolling in wealth, and a year later, as the .result of a drought, might become an object of sympathy. I think he will admit that comparisons between the conditions of the people of the old country and those who are here are not in favour of the first-named. £ 3 0 2 per head whilst we are worth only £ 2 6 6 each. worth much more than that. right honourable member in the average. taken up by our representatives at Home in endeavouring to tear up the cherished policv of the people of the mother country m order that Australian products might obtain free admission, and at the same time making professions of an honest desire to secure more power for British trade and British manufactures in the markets of Australia was a sham. We sometimes talk of wholesale shams' and mockeries, but that was the hollowest sham of all. I cannot understand a man being a genuine protectionist and at the same time a genuine preferentialist. posing prohibitive duties we ought to be prepared to give Great Britain an advantage. They entered the posal be put in a fair way it is not worth much. I admit that preference, even if it be limited in the way proposed by the Government, is worth something, and such a proposal, coming from protectionists, is a revelation of relaxation which is refreshing to me. But I wish to point out that it is a hollow sham to tell the people of the mother country that if they will consent to their food supplies being taxed Australia will give their products a substantial advantage in their entry to Australian markets. There is not one protectionist-fro m the Prime Minister down to the humblest man in the rank'' and file-who would give any preference that would endanger the stability of the protected manufactures of Australia. I I thought that the right do not blame them for that. The protectionist I blame is not the man who says, "" We are building up our manufacturing industries, and not even for the sake of the mother country can we relax our attitude or open our ports to enable British manufactures to imperil the stability of our own protected manufactures."" I can understand such a , position; but I have an infinity of contempt for the man .who is determined to keep the door shut to British manufactures, and yet goes to the mother country and professes to be ready to open it, endeavouring to persuade the millions of the people of the old country under absolutely false pretences to put taxes on their"" food supplies.

460,Mr Reid,"If the Government promanufacturers to imperil the soundness of Australian protected industries. That sort of sham ought to be at once dismissed. One of the good effects of this Tariff is that it will give people at Home a better idea of what we really mean. The Treasurer has said that he is going to seriously test the question of preference on the item of candles. I thought we had already tested it on two occasions. We certainly tested it in connection with the item of wire netting, and also on the item of biscuits. To affirm the principle twice, and then to test it, is a rather curious procedure. It would have been more convenient to test it at an earlier date, or else to have refrained from testing it until later on. It may be convenient to have this decision now, although I take it that the Ministry have affirmed the principle by the way they have framed the Tariff. ence to Great Britain, and, in time of diffisider is a very full measure of protection, culty, took it away again, would it not be said that we were disloyal or unreasonable? on that score, since the people of the mother country have taken without resentment all the knocks we have given her. As Gladstone said on one occasion, the Australian people have a right to buy their experience in whatever market they please, and they are buying their experience in the protectionist market. Notwithstanding the admitted majority of protectionists in this Chamber, I am very glad to see, on the part, of the Committee, every trace so far of a desire not to push this Tariff to extravagant proportions. I fully recognise that; but in this particular case, I think that Ministers might"" well have accepted the preferential arrangement proposed, since the item of candles will be a very unfortunate one on which to test the question of preference. We have with the mother country no trade in candles that is worth mentioning. This item affords a better opportunity to test the question, since comparatively speaking, there are enormous imports of British blue, and the suggested preference of Jd. per lb. is a very modest one. The effect of this preference would be really to leave a 50 per cent, increase of the old duty as against the mother country. That is to say, the duty under the old Tariff has been increased by 100 per cent., and it is proposed that, as against imports from the mother country, it shall be in-' creased by only 50 per cent. already largely excluded from Australia. proposal the old duty will be raised by 50 per cent, against the mother country and by 100 per cent, as against the rest of the world. I think that the proposition of those who do believe in preference is, in this instance, one that might well be supported by protectionists, since it would at the same time afford a substantial increase of the duty. I must certainly support the proposition of the honourable member, because it is one to grant preference in a very reasonable form. an honest desire to assist the Government in passing an effective Tariff, and certainly share the wish of the Prime Minister that a reasonable preference shall be granted to Great Britain. On the last division, I voted with the Government for what I conbut they are placing me, and, I am sure, other honourable members in the Opposition corner, in a false position by resisting the proposal that this duty fee reduced as against British imports from 2d. per lb. to I'Jd. per Ib.' On-the score of consistency, as well as on the ground that the passing of the Tariff should be expedited, we have some claim for consideration at the hands of the Government. They readily gave way when it was proposed that a preference should be granted to British manufacturers of biscuits, and the principle underlying the proposal in this instance is the same. Although most of our imports of blue come at present from Great Britain, every one knows that no nation is more expert than is Germany in the manufacture of commodities of this kind, and it is quite possible that we may have, next year, large importations from such a country. I urge the Government not to place honourable members of the Opposition corner, who desire to assist them in framing this Tariff on effective protective lines, in a false position when we are endeavouring to help them. If honourable members are to be compelled to rise in this Committee upon every conceivable occasion to explain their reasons for voting in favour of certain duties, this debate will be inordinately prolonged. There is not a single honourable member who does not desire to see.the confusion which exists throughout the Commonwealth consequent upon the introduction of a new Tariff terminated at the earliest possible moment.

In view of the inconsistent attitude of the Ministry upon the question of preference, I shall be compelled to support the amendment. If the Prime. Minister or the Treasurer intends to-morrow to outline a distinctive policy on the part of the Government in connection with the whole subject of preferential trade, it would be a reasonable thing to report progress now, and to allow the House to adjourn. At present, we are merely floundering in the dark. I repeat what I stated upon a previous occasion, that it would have been better if we had settled the duties imposed under the general Tariff before dealing with the preferential proposals of the Government. ence proposals should have been considered first. questions should have been considered separately.

The honourable member for Dalley said that the decision was given "" for some reason of their own,"" meaning the Government. What construction can be placed on that statement? it would be good ground for a vote of censure. members that no debate can take place in the nature of an anticipation of the Tariff discussion later on. If I permit this discussion to continue there will be a multiplication of debate which can serve no purpose. I ask the Minister not to. refer to any matter in anticipation of the Tariff discussion. sire to show that the decision to which the honourable member for Dalley referred is similar to decisions given every month, every ""week, and, in fact, almost every day; indeed, ' in order to make the Customs' 'Act' Work smoothly, such decisions must be given.
