The death and misery that have been brought to the island by the militias are well known. But we are only just starting to come to terms with the sickness and disease that is spreading due to hunger and exposure of the refugees who fled into the hills to escape the militia's genocidal attacks. One news report this week stated that 20 people had died in one village as a result of malnutrition and disease. Thousands of people are currently suffering from wounds they have received in fighting and many will die without early medical help. Our first priority should be to provide security throughout East Timor to enable medical teams to enter the areas of refuge and start the provision of emergency aid. There will be a huge job to rebuild the health system to cope with this crisis and to provide for East Timor after it achieves independence. I am told that there are two health systems in East Timor: one previously provided by the Indonesian government and the other based around 27 hospitals and clinics run by the Catholic aid agency, Caritas. Caritas have only recently been able to re-enter East Timor and, along with other aid agencies, they will face a huge task. I was very pleased to hear there are moves afoot within the pharmaceutical industry to provide large quantities of urgently needed pharmaceuticals to assist the work of the major aid agencies. This is being coordinated by the aid group OPAL-Overseas Pharmaceutical Aid for Life. This group is run out of South Australia. Manufacturers around Australia are donating their products to meet the needs identified by major aid groups. A large container load is being loaded in Adelaide and will soon be dispatched. Caritas has also collected a' significant stock of materials through Catholic Health Australia by donations of medicines from Catholic hospitals. These will be distributed quickly in packs accompanied by advice in the local language so that local doctors and paramedical staff can get the medicines they desperately need. I understand another collection is being coordinated by the Australian Nurses Federation. These are all excellent initiatives which demonstrate the generosity of spirit that Australians have to help those in need. I am sure there are many other ways in which the health community in Australia can playa vital role in helping East Timor start on the road to recovery. I also understand that many people have expressed an interest in assisting East Timor. Many are health professionals with important skills to contribute. The avenue for interested people to get involved is to register with Australian Volunteers International, the largest body in Australia supporting overseas aid projects through recruitment of volunteers. AVI has opened a special register of interest for people who have skills to offer in East Timor, with the intention of providing recruitment and training services to support delivery of emergency aid and longer term projects to support the development of the country.

188,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl) Took The Chair At 9.55 A.m.,"Thursday,23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10441 Green Corps Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage)--It is with great pleasure that I aim to put on the record some of the outstanding contributions that younger people are making in Australia today in natural resource management. We have a number of government programs, for example, Green Corps. A lot of our Work for the Dole programs are particularly aimed at younger people taking on work that is of paramount importance in terms of sustainability of our biodiversity, water and land resource management. These younger people are doing an exceptional job. With Green Corps, for example, we have had more than 1.3 million trees planted. There is a sudden realisation in Australia that, if we do not gain control of vegetation management, we are going to see things like dry land salinity and exacerbated water quality throughout the country and other serious problems. As well as the 1.3 million trees planted by our younger people, through the program called Green Corps, they have collected over one tonne of native seed. In previous generations, we had a view that any vegetation would do, but we now understand that our indigenous vegetation is of critical importance. A lot of us do not yet understand how to collect and germinate that native seed. These younger people are learning the basics. It is essential for us that our younger people carry on that knowledge into their adult life, perhaps in careers of natural resource management or whatever work they do-the philosophy of our indigenous vegetation being of major significance to this country. After all, it sUp'p0rts our flora, our fauna and our insect life. In this country we have mega-diversity. We have lost a lot of that diversity but we are still amongst the most mega-diverse of nations on this earth.

BILL (No.1) 1999 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 September, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time. Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, John Herron, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.1) 1999. The bill does not do anything of great note, but it is very symbolic. It is symbolic of John Herron's careful and attentive management of his portfolio and the recognition by the government of the importance of supporting the Aboriginal people's right to achieve as much say as possible over their affairs. This bill is a progression of that-let me explain why. The bill deals with the present structure of ATSIC, which is a representative body of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples. It has been operating in Australia since 1990, and has a tremendously difficult and complex task, I might add. There are many critics of ATSIC;",114,Representatives Main Committee

Do not make your judgment on one or two issues alone. That is not to say that ATSIC is perfect-it does not claim to be. It is not perfect, and from time to time it has had problems. No doubt in the future, with the complexity of its role, it will continue to have some of those problems. But we hope that, with good govenunent and a good minister like John Herron, these will be overcome. better committee member, might I say. He is a member, as Mr Haase is, of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which I have the honour of serving as chair and which works pretty well for Aboriginal people, for Australians and for the parliament. which are then divided into 16 zones. The position to date is that the minister, John Herron, and his predecessors have appointed the chairperson and one other commissioner. The rest have been elected. This provision of the act was amended in 1996 and provides that the commission consist only of elected representatives, not those appointed by a minister. I welcome that because that is the sort of thing that we need to do. White man's parliament, meaning well, should try to limit as much as possible its involvement in the decision making process that indigenous people want to make themselves. We should be encouraging indigenous people to have a go and make decisions, to be accountable to their own people and to Australians. It is better for them to do that than for govenunents to appoint people to these sorts of bodies. That amendment was a good one and it is about to take place. There was a deferral of the implementation of that, by agreement of both sides of politics, when we entered govenunent in 1996. I would also like to pay tribute to the chairs of ATSIC, who include Dr O'Donoghue. Sometimes she has been a pretty severe critic of the government that I am a member of-unjustly, I thinl:. But on other occasions she has been a good advocate for indigenous people and is generally well respected. We wish her well. The current chair, Gatjil Djerrkura, is a remarkable man. I have got to know him quite well and I wish him every success. I am not sure what is going to happen with the current elections, but I certainly do admire Gatjil and thank him very much for his good advice to me from time to time and, especially, for his very generous comments in relation to the report on the Northern Territory land rights act that the committee which I chair recently released, which is entitled Unlocking the future. We understand that the chair of ATSIC has endorsed the general thrust of that report, and we appreciate that generous endorsement. The bill before us today does not include any major changes to the ATSIC Act, but it does clarify the process pertaining to the new arrangements for the chairperson. The bill provides that the person who will be elected-in contrast to being appointed as in the past-by his or her fellow commissioners to be the ATSIC chair ceases to hold his or her original office-that is, of being a regional councillor and a zone commissioner. Obviously, it would be wrong to hold both positions. The present act does in fact provide that they would hold both positions, and that is not practical. The chair, having been elected, should not have those other positions. The bill deals with that situation.",115,Representatives Main Committee

192,Mr Lieberman,"And a reasonably good shadow minister, Daryl Melham-who is aThursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10443 The bill goes on to say that the positions left vacant by the election of the chair will be filled through a process set down in the election rules made under the ATSIC Act. What will happen is that the indigenous people in the affected region will not have to vote again, having lost their zone commissioner, that person having being made chair of ATSIC. A recount will be done to elect the new councillor-they will go through the votes that were recorded in the previous election. In the case of the vacant position of a zone commissioner, the regional councils will elect a new commissioner in a by-election. That process is facilitated in this bill. It will complement the policy of the government, allowing commissioners to be elected by the people and electM commissioners to elect the chair. The bill is a simple one. There are no substantial financial costs on the Australian taxpayer, except that the person who fills the vacant office of the commissioner and the regional councillor would, of course, be entitled to the appropriate salary and allowances. In conclusion, there is a lot of work to be done by all of us to address the unfortunate disadvantage that indigenous people suffer. Unfortunately, they die a third sooner than all other groups of Australians, their unemployment rates are 60 per cent higher than the rates in any other area of Australia and their health is in many cases very bad. So the government's focus, under John Herron, has been to give greater attention and targeting to that. Hence, we have brought in a policy where all the skills of all of the health deliverers in Australia, at both Commonwealth level and state level, are brought into play. Rather than have indigenous people, it is far better to use the whole of the talents of all Australian health workers, the family of health people and the ministers to work collectively together. Michael Wooldridge has brokered agreements between all the state health ministers to that effect. That is a much better, targeted way of doing it. My colleague Barry Wakelin, with Harry Quick, who is deputy chair of my committeeBarry is chair of the other committee-is inquiring at the moment into indigenous health and has issued a discussion paperwonderful job. I would encourage all members to read their discussion paper because it does highlight a number of important issues. In training, the ministers David Kemp and Peter Reith, together with ATSIC and others, have put in a targeted program to create partnerships where targeted results and outcomes will be achieved. We have already got a great development there. My colleague the member for Kalgoorlie has been briefing me about an exciting development in Murrin Murrin in Western Australia where Anaconda has formed a partnership with the local Aboriginal people and they are talking now about establishing a training college, which is a fantastic idea. So there are great, exciting things happening-good, positive things, and the best thing for us to do is to focus on the positives. Don't ignore the negatives, but don't allow the negatives to knock off the positives. It has been a shame in indigenous politics in Australia that there have been too many negatives knocking off the positives. I support the bill and wish it a speedy passage.

I have often been criticised as a savage political opponent of the Liberal Party, but I find it appropriate at this juncture to congratulate the member for Indi for his generosity of spirit towards the Aboriginal people of Australia and for the integrity with which he has conducted himself in his dealings with Aboriginal people. Speaking on this bill provides me with an opportunity to provide a few ideas about how we can bring ATSIC closer to the people whom the commission seeks to represent. I think that we can go some way towards doing this by devolving authority from ATSIC to the local communities which it seeks to represent. I, like many other people in this parliament, read with great interest the paper delivered by Mr Noel Pearson to the Brisbane Institute some months ago. Noel Pearson, as many people in this place would know, is the director of the Cape York Land Council and a prominent Aboriginal leader in Australia. His paper offered a great insight into the ways in which governments might be able to relate to Aboriginal communities in the future. Mr Pearson spoke about an interface between Aboriginal communities and the state government and the federal government. So he was talking about moving away from some of these joint committees which exist and these departmental responses to the problems which Aboriginal communities face. He is talking about making a radical departure from that and starting again with something new, something over which the people in that community can have greater control and which would give greater responsibility to the people in those communities. I congratulate Mr Pearson on making those remarks. He has been very courageous, certainly politically courageous in the context of the constituency which he speaks for. I congratulate him on that initiative. One of the things which ATSIC needs to consider in the future is regional offices. I come from Victoria and had the good fortune to work as the chief executive of the Central Gippsland Aboriginal Health and Housing Cooperative, in Morwell, where our primary responsibility was the delivery of an Aboriginal health service to the people there. We were not a large organisation; we had, I think, only 16 or 17 staff at anyone point. But our dealings with we sought to deliver services to, would have been made better if we had had an ATSIC office based in Gippsland, as opposed to an ATSIC office based in Melbourne. We need to encourage the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to consider more closely whether or not this would be practicable. I know that many of the Aboriginal people in Gippsland with whom I have the good fortune to be friends consider ATSIC still an organisation far away from their needs and aspirations. I think that placing an office there, of whatever staffing would be considered appropriate, considering the size of that Aboriginal community and also the community'S needs, would be a step in the right direction. It would give the likes of the Central Gippsland Aboriginal Cooperative, the Ramahyuck Aboriginal cooperative in Sale, the Gippsland and East Gippsland Aboriginal Cooperative in Bairnsdale, and the Aboriginal cooperative in Orbost much closer links into that very important organisation, which still is responsible for delivering a large number of programs to Aboriginal people. I mention that today, not in the context of trying to impose the view which I have about the way that Aboriginal services should be delivered in regional parts of Australia, but rather offering it as an idea based on the experiences which I have had in the delivery of Aboriginal services in Gippsland. Thursday,23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10445 In considering the bill and its provisions which relate to the democratic provisions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, there are a few important points which need to be made. The first is the very low rate of participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in elections. We have such a small number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the Australian Electoral Commission rolls. When members here go through their polling booths on election days-as I think most people do; they visit the various polling booths in their constituencies-I would just ask them to consider how many Aboriginal people they ever bump into as they are doing the rounds of their constituencies. The truth is probably not many, even though many of us have significant Aboriginal communities in our electorates. This is something which we need to address very seriously. I noted with some alarm that there were substantial cuts to the Australian Electoral Commission Indigenous Enrolment Program in 1996. I would urge the government, in the best bipartisan traditions of this place, to urgently reconsider whether or not it would be appropriate to reinstate that program as a way of encouraging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in general elections in this country. I think that we are all the better for having those people participate in the democratic process. I cannot tell you how much it pains me when I go and see Aboriginal people in my constituency and talk to them about an election coming up---as we have just had in Victoriaonly to find that there is indifference in some people's minds about the fact that there is an election on and many people still are not registered to vote. We have a great democratic tradition in Australia. We need to seek to extend that democratic tradition to include all people in our community, and especially Aboriginal people who, for so long, have been marginalised from the political process. A second point I want to make is that little is being done to empower Aboriginal people to participate in the entirety of the democratic process. It concerns me that so many Aboriginal people still feel very locked out from that process. I am talking about not just encouraging people to vote but also encouraging people to participate fully and wholly in the democratic process. It was with some enthusiasm that my office advised me that a number of people involved in the land claim which is being pursued by the GunailKurnai people in Gippsland have made an appointment to see me at my office in Moe this Friday. I am fortunate in that many Aboriginal people in our community feel confident coming to see me in my electorate office and, I hope, feel that they get some service from me. I am very pleased indeed to see that that group of people-a group of people who are usually marginalised from the political process-had the initiative and, in many ways, the courage to go and see a local member of parliament to discuss this claim. Often local members of parliament are seen as people who will not be supportive of the cause of Aboriginal people in their community. It is a shame that that has been the case for a long time. I am very pleased that that group of people has had the confidence-and the confidence in me-to come and see me to discuss the issue of their land claim. There tends to be a lot of talk about empowerment, but I think we need to be careful not to allow that talk to just be the shrill banter which politicians can go on with from time to time. I notice, with some concern again, that the Community Training Program, which is worth about $67.2 million, has been cut. I think this has undermined the efforts of people on both 10446 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday,23 September 1999 sides of parliament who are committed to genuine participation by Aboriginal people to try to encourage more Aboriginal people to be involved in the process. I think it is worth reflecting on what the Community Training Program aimed to achieve. In the ATSIC Annual Report 1996-97, the objective is listed as follows: To improve decision making and service provision by Aboriginal organisations, through training which aims to increase skill levels and enhance employment prospects. I think most people in this place would agree that this is a very important objective. In describing community training, the document lists a few dot points, one of which is as follows: · provides assistance to selected individuals to enable them to undertake specific accredited training or education courses. It continues: The component had three elements: community training funded through ATSIC Regional Councils; · Inwork, funded through ATSIC State and Regional Offices; and · Full-time Professional Study Grants, funded through ATSIC Central Office as a national program. So it is a shame that this Community Training Program has lost $67.2 million worth of Commonwealth funding and will now be unable to be delivered to Aboriginal people. I think it is worth noting as well that cuts to ATSIC, totalling nearly half a billion dollars, have occurred and have undermined Aboriginal self-determination. Whilst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission regional council elections will take place in October this year, we need to consider what the government has done to empower Aboriginal people to participate more fully in this process. It is worth considering the program that existed previously to encourage more Aboriginal people to get onto the electoral roll. I can remember that the Aboriginal organisation which I used to work for had some great posters up around the place encouraging Aboriginal people to participate in elections. We had these posters up all around the organisation, and as people came into the organisation they would say, 'Here we have an Aboriginal organisation'-these were all funded by ATSIC-'giving us encouragement to get involved in the political process.' As a result of that and of having some Australian Electoral Commission enrolment forms around the place, people were certainly encouraged to get involved and to have their say in ATSIC elections and also in the general election process at both state and federal levels. Most people would understand that the advantages of having more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people participating in the democratic process are huge. By having more involvement by Aboriginal people in democracy, we end up with much more representation at federal, state and local levels. This can only be a good thing in making sure that the interests of Aboriginal people who have traditionally been very marginalised from the political process are not forgotten. I think it also encourages more understanding by Aboriginal people of the democratic process oflocalland councils, for example, and also of health services and cooperatives which are often charged with the responsibility of delivering various services to Aboriginal people. It is worth noting that in the past a number of problems have been encountered by organisations delivering services to Aboriginal people which have been run along democratic lines. Thursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10447 Questions have to be asked about how realistic it is to expect Aboriginal people to deliver services to their own communities using the democratic processes of cooperatives, elections for land councils and all the rest when not enough effort has been made by Commonwealth or state governments to try to engender greater understanding amongst Aboriginal people of the democratic process. We catmot just set up an organisation to fail and then wash our hands of it saying simply, 'We gave the funding to a democratic Aboriginal organisation. Unfortunately they did not run it correctly and therefore we are not to blame; they are to blame.' That sort of approach is clearly unacceptable. We should use the opportunities we have through funding to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to try to encourage people to participate in programs which engender within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community a greater awareness of the role of individuals in the Aboriginal community in electing directors onto Aboriginal health services and local Aboriginal land councils and in electing people to serve on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander regional councils. I think we have a great responsibility. If we are going to take it seriously, we have to look at empowering some of those organisations which deliver Aboriginal education programs and encourage and support them in delivering programs to the Aboriginal community of which they are a part. For example, in my own electorate there is an enormous amount of good work done by the Koori unit at the Central Gippsland Institute ofTAFE. This group of very hard working people deliver programs in adult literacy as well as in a whole range of other programs such as computer literacy and Aboriginal child care and assist Aboriginal people to access mainstream programs. We need to talk, through ATSIC, about how we might ask the Koori unit at the Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE, or other organisations, to deliver some type of management training or community leadership training to Aboriginal people. We talk a lot about the need for leadership in communities. Members of parliament who represent regional areas hear regularly that there is a need for community leadership to come from the regions so that the regions may seek the opportunities which are available to them. We talk a lot about the realities of globalisation and how regions are competing against not just other regions in Australia but regions in other parts of the world. However, we have not put in place processes which will allow Aboriginal people in regional areas to step fOlward as leaders in their own communities to take advantage of the opportunities that exist to put in place empowering practices for communities-not the type of paternalism we have seen in the past but empowering practices. We need to look seriously at the way in which we can deliver those services to Aboriginal people and encourage the likes of the Koori unit at the Central Gippsland Institute of T AFE to be a participant. An important point is that the govenunent is letting Aboriginal people down through its inaction in this area. We need to be serious about preparing Aboriginal people for leadership roles in management, assisting them to understand their roles and responsibilities in the positions of director in the various organisation which I have mentioned. There are some opportunities for director training for Aboriginal people. I note that ATSIC, some years ago, produced a very informative video titled So You Want to be a Director. It was in plain language and very easy to understand format-I myself found it very useful-and provided clear indications of what the responsibilities of being a director would be. I think 10448 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 that sort of service delivery-that type of appropriate education-is something that we should try to encourage more. In conclusion, I will speak briefly about a great dream that I have and which I hope some day will be realised-that is, that we will have a system of Aboriginal scholarships in this country which will be genuinely available to ordinary men and women and their children in Aboriginal communities right across Australia and that this would be something which Aboriginal communities could control themselves and therefore have responsibility for. Aboriginal communities would choose the leaders of the future and would have a stake in it. People in those communities would be able to undertake the type of management and leadership training which would empower them to be able to go out and seek new opportunities for their community, which they need to take advantage of if they are to succeed as a people in the future. We have some great Aboriginal people and some great Aboriginal leaders in this country. Noel Pearson, whom I mentioned earlier on, is a great example of that. If we had a process in place which was able to produce Aboriginal leaders with experience and training in management, in accounting, as well as in director training, we would be going some way towards meeting our responsibilities-giving Aboriginal people the tools of empowerment. This is an area in which we are not going anywhere near far enough. I think everyone would agree on both sides of the parliament, that there has been far too much paternalism in terms of Aboriginal service delivery in the past. We need to relate to Aboriginal people as partners in the process. Only by including them as partners in the process can we possibly hope to assist them to choose a better future for themselves and for their children. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this important matter. Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.1) 1999. This marks a stage in the evolution of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. ATSIC, as it is known, was established under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. One of its objects, as set out in its legislation, is 'to ensure maximum participation of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of government policies that affect them'. members are elected by indigenous people. These regions are then grouped into 17 zones. A short time after an ATSIC election, regional councillors from each zone meet to elect one of their number to represent the zone on the ATSIC Board. The next ATSIC election is scheduled to be held on 9 October this year. It is expected that the elections Qf zone commissioners will take place in early December 1999. Those regional councillors elected as zone commissioners following this election will, for the first time, elect one of their own number to be the new The bill provides that the person elected by his or her fellow commissioners to be the ATSIC chair ceases to hold his or her original offices of regional councillor and zone commissioner. The positions left vacant by the election of the chairperson will be filled through the process set down in the election rules made under the ATSIC Act. The indigenous people in the affected region do not have to vote again. A recount is done to elect the new councillor. In the case of the vacant position of zone commissioner, the regional councillors will elect a new",117,Representatives Main Committee
196,Mr Haase (Kalgoorlie) (10.29 A.m.},"I rise to speak in support of the Aboriginal andThursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10449 commissioner in a by-election. This process results in a commission of 18 members rather than the 19 currently. To ensure that the number of commissioners should equal the number of zones, plus one-the chairperson-the bill provides that a chairperson who resigns is also taken to have resigned as a commissioner. The bill removes the current reference to 17 members in section 27 of the act and clarifies that the minister must appoint as members of the commission those persons elected to represent the several zones. There is quite a history to the choosing of the chairperson. Originally, the minister chose the chairperson. Later, the act was amended so that the minister appointed the chairperson from amongst the commissioners. Still later, an amendment was passed which provided for the commissioners to choose their own chairperson. This amendment will come into effect after the next election on 9 October. This bill concerns the arrangements that follow from the appointment of one of the commissioners as chairperson. Section 26 of the ATSIC Act allows the commission to review, from time to time, such aspects of the operation of the act as it determines. The bill also provides that a commission chairperson who resigns is taken to have resigned as a member of the commission. In April 1997, the board of commissioners determined that a review of the act under section 26 should be undertaken. This review involved comprehensive and wide ranging consultations with indigenous people. The ATSIC board requested that appropriate arrangements be put in place prior to the next ATSIC election. In 1998 the board reported to the minister, putting forward a number of recommendations arising from the review. Recommendation 7 says: Where the person elected to represent a zone is subsequently elected as Commission Chairperson, the person should cease to hold office as a member representing the zone and as a Regional Councillor, with these offices to be re-filled through the normal electoral process. It is this recommendation that is reflected in the bill before the House today. In its report on this recommendation, the commission said: There was strong support from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community for such a provision to be included in the Act. It went on to say: Bearing in mind the strong support expressed for the proposal during the consultations and the undoubted heavy workload falling on the Chairperson, the Commission favours, on balance, that he or she be replaced as the Commissioner representing the zone and as the Regional Councillor. This bill reflects the commission's view and its provisions will be in place before the next clarity and certainty that this bill brings. In particular, it is pleasing that representation at the regional level will not be diminished. There is much to be positive about in indigenous affairs, not only for indigenous people but for all Australians. Indigenous people are undeniably severely disadvantaged against all socioeconomic indicators, but we are beginning to see some real and lasting improvements. As a government we are committed to addressing that disadvantage in a practical way so that indigenous Australians can enjoy equality of opportunity with other Australians. While money alone is not the answer, we are committing record levels of funding to specific programs that will address that disadvantage. 10450 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday,23 September 1999 Self-reliance through greater economic independence is the ultimate goal in enabling indigenous Australians to create their own businesses, generate employment and generally create a more positive future for themselves and their children. A new indigenous employment program, IEP, has been announced in the budget. This program has an emphasis on private sector oppOltunities and support for indigenous small business. Major features of the IEP include a strategy to encourage chief executive officers to recruit and train indigenous staff, private sector structured training and a national cadetship program for cadetships in the private sector. In my own electorate, in the towns of Leonora and Laverton in the north-eastern goldfields, exists an organisation called the Leonora-Laverton Cross-Cultural Association. This is a group formed with the cooperation of mining operations in the area and is a classic example of the opportunities created under our new employment programs. The opportunities for Aboriginal people in the goldmining and exploration sectors are quite extensive. One of the sad realities, however, is the level of base education currently possessed by Aboriginal people in the goldfields area, and it is creating a great problem for the LLCCA to effectively employ and continue to provide employment for Aboriginal people. The problem highlights itself in a specific area. In Western Australia, state legislation enacted allows for the forfeiture of driving licences in the case of unpaid traffic infringements and other fmes whereby individuals owe money to the government. A consequence of this may arise if Aboriginal people who have sat for, passed, been issued with a motor vehicle driver's licence and had it forfeited apply for employment in this particular local employment scheme and state that they are licensed to take a position that involves driving on a mine site. It is a clear requirement of the mining companies that all drivers so employed be licensed under state legislation as drivers. It is subsequently realised, often through a routine licence check on community roads, that the individual has had outstanding fines, has not paid them and that their licence has been forfeited. The fact that they have been stopped whilst driving a motor vehicle results in a further fine for driving whilst unlicensed, and the revolving door continues to revolve. Of course, the immediate consequence is that the individual is no longer licensed and able to hold down employment on a mine site as a driver. Once again, the opportunity to gainfully employ one more Aboriginal person and get them out of the welfare paddock is lost. I believe that my approaches to the state government are being considered, but more needs to be done in this field to effectively remove this insidious and revolving door situation. Some of its solutions are to be found in more effective communication when licensing drivers-I am not just referring to Aboriginal drivers but to all new drivers gaining their licence-that informs them of the consequence of not passing on their current address to authorities and of not paying fines. However, that said, we have made great progress with programs for employment and education, health and housing of Aboriginal people generally. In fact, 70 per cent of the $2.2 billion budget this year is going on health, housing, education and employment programs for indigenous Australians. To give you just a few examples of these practical improvements, four years ago there were just 800 indigenous Australians doing apprenticeships or traineeships. Today there are 4,800. The number of indigenous apprentices and trainees is an example of the success of the coalition's approach. When we came to office in 1996 there were just 800 indigenous apprentices and trainees Australia-wide. Three years later, this number has grown to 6,000. Thursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10451 Twenty years ago, only 8.6 per cent of indigenous students stayed at school until their final year. Today, over 33 per cent finish school, and that figure continues to rise. Expenditure on indigenous education programs will be increased by $16.3 million in 1999-2000. The Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program will target indigenous students' literacy and numeracy competencies and school attendance levels. A decade ago there were 1,600 indigenous university students. Today, there are almost 9,000. The indigenous infant mortality rate is of great concern, but even in this area things are improving. Twenty years ago, the indigenous infant mortality rate was more than 20 times that of the wider community. Today, with still some improvement to be made, it is only three to four times higher, a considerable improvement. This is an area that will continue to be addressed, particularly in remote communities where there has always been a lack of prenatal and postnatal care. Over the past three years, 35 additional Aboriginal medical services have been provided, mostly in remote areas. Indigenous health funding has quadrupled over the past decade. The Indigenous Business Incentive Program has provided about $18 million in seed funding to 84 businesses. Successful indigenous business means more indigenous employment opportunities and therefore less dependency upon welfare. The CDEP Work for the Dole Program is a great success in indigenous communities with 33,000 indigenous Australians voluntarily working for the dole. In conclusion, these may be only small steps towards addressing disadvantage and there is still much work to be done. Nevertheless, they are steps in the right direction because they are steps away from welfare dependency and towards economic self-sufficiency, and they are important steps on the road to reconciliation. I commend this bill to the House. Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation) (10.43 a.m.)-in reply-I thank the honourable members who have contributed to this debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No.1) 1999, and also thank particularly the opposition for their cooperation in expediting the bill. I want to say how pleased I was to hear the contribution from the honourable member for Indi, Mr Lieberman. The honourable member for Indi is following in the steps that I followed at one stage in this parliament by chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I know my colleague the member for Aston, MrNugent, has also had a long period of involvement with that committee and in these matters. The honourable member for Indi has been very much involved in pursuing, as this government has, the best ways and means of ensuring that Aboriginals are able to playa meaningful role in the decision making that affects their own lives. And particularly through the consideration recently of some of the issues relating to the reform of Aboriginal land rights law in the Northern Territory, he has had a focus on consultation and involvement. This has been the hallmark of this government and former governments. There is nothing new about the emphasis on Aboriginal self-management or upon individual self-determination. This is a view supported by the government. It is part and parcel of the way in which previous ministers such as Ian Viner, Peter Baume and Fred Chaney implemented programs when the Fraser government was in office.",122,Representatives Main Committee
197,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and MinisterlO452 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday,23 September 1999 I find it very beneficial when we have contributions from members of parliament with considerable experience, like the member for Indi. I welcome the contributions from newer members, such as the informed contribution from the member for Kalgoorlie, who was able to outline, in a very comprehensive way, some of the programs of the government, particularly in the area of training, and the impact that they are having, and the cooperation that is now being seen in the areas of cross-cultural training through the Leonora-Laverton program, which he enumerated. I thank him for that contribution. I welcome also the contribution from the honourable member for McMillan, because he showed perspicacity in his comments-something that is not often understood by other members of the opposition. He recognised that, ultimately, education, health, housing, employment, and particularly training, are keys to Aboriginals being able to have the capacity to make those decisions in relation to their own lives. That is a very good starting point. He may not know everything that has been done; he may not have the detail of that in his mind, but it is a good starting point for him to focus on those programs and to assist the government with the initiatives that they are taking in this regard. It is important to focus on training, but you cannot focus on training until you have really started with basic education-literacy and numeracy. They are the sorts of issues that have been very comprehensively dealt with in the programs that my ministerial colleague the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, David Kemp, has been pursuing. It is important to recognise that there has been some movement. As one who has examined these matters over a long period of time, when I look back at what I saw when I was fairly new in the parliament more than 20 years ago, as I visited many centres around Australia, and when I visit those same places today, it is important to recognise that there remains very considerable disadvantage, but there has been change, and it has been positive. Without that change, the Noel Pearsons of this world, having regard to the education that he has received, would not be there-and he is not alone. When I started in public life 26 years ago, I recall there being two Aboriginal graduates-Charles Perkins and Margaret Valadian. Today, we are talking about thousands of young Aboriginal graduates. That is a very significant shift in a very short period of time. Of course, today, we see year 12 retention rates that have quadrupled over a period of time. We see post-school qualifications doubled to 13.6 per cent. We have seen higher education enrolments trebling. We have seen the proportion of indigenous people in professional occupations rising from 14 to 22 per cent. These shifts do not occur without a good deal of effort and commitment. But it also ought to be recognised that when you are coming off such a very low base-and it is acknowledged that that is where we were-these sorts of changes are going to be generational in terms of ultimately bringing all Aboriginals to the same sort of standard of living that Australians generally are able to enjoy. That is where we want it to be. That is what we are seeking, and we are seeking it through very practical programs, but also by trying to address the issue of self-esteem, particularly through the approach that we have taken in supporting reconciliation. Some of the steps that have been taken recently by the parliament, and the support that has been given to the work of the Reconciliation Council, are all incremental, but are going to be very positive in terms of creating an environment in which the programs that are in placeand bear in mind that they cost in the order of $2 billion-are able to have a positive impact. It is in that context that I want to thank honourable members for their contribution to this debate. The debate is really about implementing ATSIC's section 26 review. I found a high Thursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10453 degree of awareness amongst members of what we are doing here: simply ensuring that, when you have an ATSIC chair elected from amongst the members, the place that he or she would have otherwise occupied as one of the regional councillors and zone commissioners be able to be filled in the normal way, so that those people who have given up their representative to assume this leadership role will not be left unrepresented. We have an election under way. That election is going to be an important one. This will be the first time in which ATSIC is able to elect its own chair. These changes are necessary to ensure that it is able to be conducted and that these aspirations in terms of the new structure are met. I am delighted at the support that is being given to the bill and the expeditious way in which it is being handled. I commend the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. EAST TIMOR Debate resumed from 22 September, on motion by Mr Reith: That the House take note of the paper. interrupted yesterday, on the motion before us on East Timor. Yesterday I had outlined a number of very direct things relevant to East Timor and some of the things that were going to happen in the future, and I had identified some of the longer term aspects of the issues this raises for this country in terms of foreign affairs. I had particularly been exploring the relationship with the United States and the fact that these days that country no longer regards itself as the world's policeman, and that that had perhaps caused us to have some reappraisal of our military and diplomatic relationships with that country. One of the problems in the United States is the current leadership. In terms of Australia, I am not so sure that we are actually on the radar screen on occasion. One of the reasons they perhaps were so slow in responding to our requests was that they do not have the background that the leadership of 20 or 30 years ago had of direct exposure or experience here and in this part of the world because of World War II, the Vietnam War, the Korean War and so on. We certainly have this problem of East Timor on our doorstep. Military capacity is, of course, limited. We cannot quite rely on who we thought we could in the same way that we thought we could, and so it all gets a bit lonely. To me, it has been staggering to see some of the comments in the media from so-called serious journalists about our handling of the East Timor and Indonesia situation and that US relationship. Not only have there been some total reversals of position by those journalists in very short order, but some of the alleged facts have been way off beam. The public deserves better-but more of that on another occasion. Indonesia has seen us as interfering, as causing their public humiliation, and there is talk of retaliation, of interfering with our shipping, our aircraft navigation and so on. It will take a long time, I suspect, to patch up that relationship, but patch it up we must. We cannot live forever with the fourth largest country in the world-which, in our lifetime, will overtake us in GDP and military terms-being at odds with this country.",125,Representatives Main Committee
198,Mr Nugent (Aston) (10.52 A.m.),"I am pleased to continue my remarks, which were10454 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 We have taken a principled stand on East Timor and backed it with actions, and quite rightly so. I believe that, recently, the Prime Minister and the foreign minister have navigated very well through some pretty difficult and rough seas. Nobody really knows how this will finally tum out. But we can say with confidence and certainty that it will take time; it will take money. We need to reappraise our military situation; we probably need to reappraise our relationship with the United States; we need to work harder still with our neighbours in the region; and we will eventually have to normalise our relationships with Indonesia. May I close by saying that, as one who has served in the military for a great number of years and served in areas on active service, I wish our military personnel in East Timor the very best and a safe return. I wish this not only to the Australians but to all the members of the international force. These are difficult times, as we have heard on the radio and the television this morning. Our thoughts go out very much to the families and our hearts go out to the East Timorese people. I support the motion. debate on the motion before the House this morning. I would like to start by responding to the recent events in East Timor, and in particular the plight of the dispossessed East Timorese, forcibly removed from their land to West Timor and other parts of the archipelago. On Saturday, 18 September 1999, Sister Susan Connelly, of the Mary MacKillop Institute of East Timorese Studies, gave an address to a large crowd at the East Timor rally assembled in Sydney's Hyde Park. It is worth quoting from those words, placing them on public record. The speech is a demand to the government to use all force necessary to give those dispossessed people of East Timor the right to be repatriated to East Timor if it is their wish. Sister Connelly notes the United States comments likening East Timor to a 'speed hump' in the path of Indonesian diplomatic progress. 'East Timor,' they say, 'is a speed hump on the way to Jakarta and we must get over it safely. Indonesia is such a big place and so central to the stability of the region.' This statement represents a profound ignorance of policy and I note Sister Connelly's observation: This speed hump insult betrays a monumental ignorance of human nature and human self-understanding ... All of our cultural traditions and religions present us with stories and reflections which show that the small ones are ignored, not only to their peril but to ours. We too are a small nation, of only just under 20 million, neighbouring a powerful country of 211 million. Are we going to allow ourselves to be subject to the same rules that we allow East Timor to be subject to? To put this another way, the ethic we have applied here alongside the United States is now the same ethic being applied to Australia. It is the ancient pre-Christian ethic of Greek origin that, indeed, 'might makes right'. The weaker give way to the stronger. It is the central rule of law. It is purely nihilist, purely secular. It asserts that, because I am stronger than you, therefore I am morally right to do whatever I do to you and you are wrong. This is the ethic of our modem government, this government, in rewarding the rich and punishing the poor because they are incapable of defending themselves. What was the principal factor that led to the United States winning the Cold War? Was it that the United States had more military force than the communists? No, they were not always stronger militarily. The former Soviet Union, at certain points in time, easily outmatched the United States and her allies militarily. The United States and her allies did not win the Cold",127,Representatives Main Committee
199,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (10.56 A.m.),"I am very pleased to be able to participate in theThursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10455 War; the former Soviet Union lost the Cold War. The communist regime was so hated that it literally disintegrated. It was unsustainable. Any regime, be it fascism, communism or the regime in Indonesia, that places its foundations on cultural relativism or other false ideologies faces the same destiny of disintegration. Thus Australia faces the same plight so long as we place our trust in philosophies that violate the rule of law and the natural law. That does not mean we do not apply force. That means that our policy formulation must acknowledge up front when the ballot in East Timor is imminently likely to be violated by parties that do not honour the rule of law but seek to violate its principles with alternative false and evil philosophies. What can we as Australians say now without the assistance of the false United States umbrella of protection-that delusional lie that we have been living for so very long? What will be our response when we too are subject to the same worldly philosophy that drives mobs of militia or even governments to perpetrate what we know in our hearts and minds to be the most conspicuous evil? It is clear that we as a culture in Australia have lost the Christian ethic that underpins our legal system, our very notion of the rule of law. I note that the rule of law has been said a lot lately in respect of the United Nations peace enforcement charter in East Timor, but do we know what that means? Let me tell you what that means. It means that a law is applied probatively and predictably without favour. It does not discriminate between one citizen and another. The rule of law is universalist in its perspective. It is not cultural relativist. What does this mean in East Timor? It means we are dealing with regional powers that have no concept of the rule of law. They apply cultural relativist standards. I go so far as to say that if the East Timorese had not been Christian then we would not have seen anything like the massacre that happened. I note that even Mr Xanana Gusmao was surprised and shocked at the extent of the carnage. Even he did not anticipate the scale of the reprisal. Sister Connelly is totally conect when she begs the question, 'After 2000 years, haven't we yet understood that might is not always right, that big is not always better?' Sister Connelly reflects on the law of the world, that Greek philosophy that is so seductive, so evil, so wrong. We face the same threat here in Australia. We are just one big popUlated island with vast resources. Are we too to be subject to the same ethic by which we adjudged East Timor, allowing ourselves to catTy on in some vain hope of an idyllic world where Indonesia would seriously honour the commitment following a vote? It is time this parliament wakes up culturally to who and what we are. The naivety of our beliefs were profoundly ignorant. Indeed, such beliefs are invincibly ignorant. We were told a vote would secure a peaceful transition. We were told that cultural relativism would not be the rule of law for East Timor. We then witnessed cultural relativism at its very best-the systematic annihilation of a people culturally different, and I say religiously different, from those perpetrating the evil. I say 'evil' because under any definition it is evil. The action of the militia, backed by the Indonesian arnly, offends every moral code imaginable, the rule of law, human rights and universalism. This brings me to the next point about the plight of the displaced persons forcibly expatriated from East Timor to West Timor and other parts of the archipelago. I quote again from Sister Connelly who says, 'The East Timorese people's troubles are far from over.' We must pay particular attention to those in West Timor. The majority of East Timorese at present in West Timor have been kidnapped at gunpoint, forced to move to enemy territory and are living in 10456 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 mortal fear for their lives. The retreat of many militias and some Indonesian troops from East Timor to West Timor, defeated, humiliated and vengeful, are a major threat to life and limb. They have proved themselves willing and capable of attacking unarmed women and babies, and so the fear is well founded. The Indonesian government's reluctance to admit care agencies from outside Indonesia into West Timor and elsewhere, to say nothing of foreign journalists, is a disturbing signal of its intention to allow further ferocious slaughter. We must all redouble our efforts to help an estimated 150,000 East Timorese hostages. We must demand that the Indonesian government face reality and accept the help it needs to repatriate those people safely to East Timor and to protect them in the meantime. We must lobby our leaders and the world's leaders to induce Indonesia to make this happen. We must appeal to the Indonesian leaders to redeem their international image by facilitating the return of these people. We are starting to hear about the 'hurt feelings' of some people. We are told that we have to consider Indonesian sensibilities. Well, I have got news for people pushing this barrow. The life of one Timorese baby, the thumb of one Timorese youth, the pain and terror of one raped Timorese girl, and the sorrow of one Timorese father is of more consequence in the scheme of things than having to consider Indonesian sensibilities. Australia, the United States and the United Nations got it totally wrong in respect of the East Timorese ballot-fatally wrong. We cannot be fools and get it wrong one more time. A failure to understand our own reasoning has been the cause of an estimated 20,000 deaths, including the deliberate killings of specific individuals such as pro-independence community leaders, priests, community workers, nuns and so forth. For the first time in history the Red Cross has come under attack, its buildings and property destroyed. Do we now believe that the philosophy of cultural relativism has suddenly lifted from the paradigms of Indonesian thought? I do not believe it has. For that matter, neither have our paradigms shifted. We are patting ourselves on the back for a so-called leadership role we cannot lay claim to. We play a significant but limited role in the initiative of the United Nations. Only by the grace of the unanimous vote of the Security Council are we in East Timor at all. Thus, the scene is set for recalcitrant and recidivist tendencies that may see the matter resurface again. Both our views are institutionalised in terms of belief systems. They are not remorseful because they have killed innocent women, babies and other people. They are remorseful because they did not get away with it. They will now attempt to do exactly the same with the displaced persons in West Timor and elsewhere. We, on the other hand, will fall into the same error of judgment and will repeat history if we do not change our process of reasoning now. I urge the government to encourage the international community to press the Indonesian government to repatriate the displaced people of East Timor who have been forcibly removed against their will to West Timor and elsewhere. I urge the government to not become complacent in seeing that these displaced persons be placed under the immediate care and control of international care agencies and ensuring their safe repatriation to East Timor. I strongly endorse the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Mary Robinson, in seeking an international commission of inquiry into all aspects of these atrocities, and expect Australia to make available all intelligence resources at our disposal to present Thursday,23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10457 evidence in support of the laying of charges and convictions flowing from a commission. I would hope this parliament likewise endorses the president's recommendations. Finally, God bless the people of East Timor and all the members of the peacekeeping force, guard their safety and unity and preserve their harmony, for therein lies our strength and peace. Amen. a.m.)-We all appreciate the heartfelt comments of our colleagues on both sides of the House in relation to this very difficult matter. It gives me great comfort to know that in my comments I enjoy the broad support of the people from right across my electorate, from East Roseville to the Harbour Bridge and from Linley Point to Cremorne. The 140,000 people of my electorate have certainly, as one, spoken with a sense of frustration, at times outrage, and occasionally deep anger at the events that have occurred in East Timor over the last few weeks. At a time when the world around us seems to unravel and events, including those causing great emotion, start to unfold, it is important that we keep a level head. That is the great test of leadership--your strength at a time when things are going badly, when you are under enormous pressure. The test of leadership does not come when things are going well. So Australia's leadership--and I say that as a nation we have displayed leadership--in helping to resolve the problems of East Timor has had a profound impact not only on our relationship with our near neighbours in Asia but also, importantly, in a global context. I say that because if we put in some perspective the events that have occurred over the last few weeks, we will start to get a grasp of how significant the reaction. of the world has been to the events that have occurred in East Timor. The United Nations throughout its history since 1944 has been developing as a body to try and resolve human conflicts. It has had police actions initiated by the most powerful countries in the world, such as the United States or the Soviet Union. It has always had a Security Council where the veto has been exercised on a regular basis. But, most importantly, when you have a good look as an outside observer at international relations you start to pick up that very few actions by the world's peacekeepers are an answer to a matter of principle. Sometimes political ideology is involved; sometimes religion is involved; sometimes-mostly, in fact-economic interests are involved. Where was the principle of the UN action in Kuwait when around 27 countries participated to push Iraq out of Kuwait? Where was the principle in Rwanda when the Hutus and the Tutsis were turning the rivers into a flow of red bodies, and the world stood back and watched TV each night? Where was the principle? There was no principle. Economic interests were the main focus in Kuwait, and the world did not react on principle in Rwanda. Whenever you look at international relations, you see one constant theme: that there is virtually no principle regarding humanity that results in an immediate reaction. Everything was weighing against the world reacting swiftly to the events in East Timor. The first question you need to ask is: how long should it take for the world to react to a domestic activity in East Timor? Before any government commits troops, it needs to ask the question: what are the army and the troops of the existing nation doing to protect the interests of the people? Timor is still a domestic matter. President Habibie had the courage-and I say that not lightly-to have a vote, when President Suharto and every Indonesian leader of any consequence to challenge President Suharto over the last 25 years had always rejected a vote. There was a free vote, supervised",128,Representatives Main Committee
200,Mr Hockey (North Sydney,"Minister for Financial Services and Regulation) (11.0610458 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 by the United Nations and taken with the knowledge that it would be, effectively, an overwhelming vote in support of full independence. When did that last happen in the history of the modern world? When did the existing government of a sovereign nation agree to have a secessionist vote, supervised by an outside body? The only case I can think of is Quebec, in Canada, but even then it was not supervised by the United Nations. In this case, President Habibie then went on to agree to have UN peacekeepers there. I commend him for that. The United Nations Security Council reacted within days, in a time frame that has been unheard of. Most importantly and most far-sightedly, the United Nations reacted by sending troops to enforce a matter of principle, one that is fundamental to the charter of the United Nations: the freedom of individuals, the liberty of a people to declare their culture, to have their own government. This, hopefully, wraps up the end of a dramatic century in the history of humanity, when-for all the wrong reasons, and all the right reasons at times-we have gone to war. Hopefully, at the end of the 20th century and as we approach the new millennium, this act of principle involving East Timor by the United Nations and the world community is going to have a profound effect. There have been numerous people in my electorate that have felt the pain of what has happened in East Timor. I particularly reach out to my friends in the Jesuit community, who have lost three of their colleagues to the murderous treachery of the TNI and the militia. The Jesuits are fantastic human beings and their sacrifice, like those of the nuns of the world, is never ending. The sacrifices they made in defence of humanity in East Timor have certainly not been lost on me, and I reach out to the communities around St Aloysius College and St Ignatius, Riverview, and also the parishes of St Mary's, in North Sydney, and St Francis Xavier, at Lavender Bay. Others in my community, like James Harker-Mortlock of North Sydney, have long been advocates of a free East Timor, a peaceful East Timor, and an independent East Timor. But, at the end of the day, the challenge for all of us is to maintain relations with Indonesia, our nearest neighbour, and to recognise that the people of Indonesia do not support the bloodshed inflicted by the militia and the TNI in East Timor. Most Indonesians are peace-loving people. Most Indonesians are happy to have warm and close relationships with Australia. They are our nearest neighbour. They are a developing country. They are the fifth largest country in the world. They are a Muslim country occupying 17,000 islands. We must have the courage at this moment to recognise and exact appropriate justice on the people who have inflicted crimes against humanity. Whoever they may be, We will go after them. When I say 'we', I mean the world community that will not tolerate crimes against humanity in a century where we have had the most heinous crimes in the history of mankind. But, we also need to keep our heads and recognise that the leadership displayed by Australia, and particularly by our Prime Minister, in a very difficult situation, means that we will prevent, hopefully, further bloodshed in what will be a very volatile region in the years ahead. for North Sydney, Mr Hockey, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, on his very thought-provoking speech here in the Main Committee. Well done! I would like to take a few minutes and add a few thoughts of mine on the motion before the Main Committee today concerning East Timor. I, like others, welcomed United Nations resolution 1264 authorising a multinational force to restore peace and security in East Timor, to protect the United Nations mission in East Timor, and to facilitate humanitarian assistance.",131,Representatives Main Committee
201,Mr Quick (Franklin) (11.16 A.m.),"First of all, I would like to compliment the memberThursday,23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10459 How does one convey in a few minutes the impact of what has transpired in East Timor? The past few weeks have seen the best and the worse of humanity. We have witnessed through our television screens families lining up to exercise their democratic rights for the first time. They were lulled into a false sense of security by the international community. They went to vote naively believing that the transition to independence was going to be smoothly achieved and that their Indonesian masters would walk away from it all without blinking an eyelid. We have all watched the horrible aftermath unfold on the television, and seen the homicidal behaviour of the militia and some of the Indonesian troops. We even saw evidence of that this morning on our morning television programs. I have been reminded, as all of us have been, of just how fragile the veneer of humanity really is. As an Australian, I experienced a wide rangof emotions. As a member of the House of Representatives, I wondered just how to put into words my cun-ent feelings towards the Indonesian people, their leaders and the Indonesian military. We have seen on television the stage-managed demonstrations by groups of Indonesians, with their messages of hate, their burning of the flags, burning of effigies, and the messages of what they intend, allegedly, to do to those of our peac¢'keeping forces stationed in East Timor. We have seen President Habibie address his parliament the day before yesterday and trot out, to my mind, a biased and emotive speech to justify staying on as a leader. Just how stupid does he really think we all are? I would like to take this brief opportunity to convey to General Wiranto and his officers the statement that I have nothing but contempt for them. I abhor their collusion and complicity in allowing the systematic brutality meted out to those Timorese who dared vote for independence. Members in this place would probably say that we should not apportion blame to the Indonesian people as a whole, that it is not their fault, rather, we should continue the dialogue, continue the aid and the financial assistance in the hope that democratisation will solve all the ills currently evident in Indonesia. I agree with this sentiment. I have worked tirelessly, as many in this House have, to promote international understanding and to alleviate Third World poverty and Third World debt. I do not want to see Australians harassing Indonesian students as they walk through the streets of Australia. I would rather that we sat down with them and conducted a real dialogue in order to strengthen the deep friendship that exists between Australians and Indonesians. On the other hand, what is our response to be to the tens of thousands of people who have disappeared; to the countless families brutalised by the militia and the Indonesian army as they rampaged through East Timor? Go and browse through the history books. Look at the pictures. The uniforms are different, but the looks on the people being herded away are just the same. People in this place and in the House have already spoken of how the defence and intelligence experts and the diplomats failed to see that this hon-or would eventuate and of just how ill-prepared, as an international community, we were to resolve it. Others have spoken of the speed with which the United Nations moved to implement resolution 1264, which enabled the peacekeeping forces to enter the scorched land of East Timor. One wonders what these experts thought was actually going to happen after the vote for independence. The peacekeepers are there now. Our troops are gradually restoring some semblance of normalcy to a crazy mixed-up world. My thoughts and those of the people of my electorate go out to them as they face uncertain months ahead in a strange land. Our thoughts are also 10460 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 with their families and close friends. I know that those serving overseas will serve with distinction, as did their forebears in the same countryside. To the numerous aid agencies who are being confi'onted with the huge task of providing humanitarian assistance, I would like to convey, on behalf of my electorate, my heartfelt appreciation for the superb work they have already done and will continue to do in the months ahead. To Xanana Gusmao, I express, on behalf of my electorate and myself, the heartfelt hope that East Timor will be given the opportunity to live in peace and harmony. Australia has gone some small way to repay the huge debt we owe the East Timorese people. We will not let them down a secdnd time. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (11.22 a.m.)-BeforeI start my remarks on this motion on East Timor, I must say how moved I was by the previous speaker, the member for Franklin. I share his heartfelt appreciation of the situation in East Timor. I rise this morning to speak in favour of this motion moved by the Prime Minister. This is probably one of the most tragic motions I have ever had to speak to in the short time that I have been a member of this House. Like all Australians, I was horrified at the events that have unfolded in East Timor in the last few weeks. AndI have been horrified by the long history of suffering and violence inflicted on the people of East Timor. I am sure that the images will never fade for me of the mothers and fathers passing their children over those razor wire fences into the compound in their terrible flight from the militia terror. Those images will also make their way into the archives of mankind's cruelty, alongside the images from Tuol Sleng prison in Phnom Penh and of the genocide in Rwanda. Another image that comes to me as I speak today is of the death of a mother in the hills and the television footage showing the very tragic grief of her young daughters as they cried for their lost mother. The death of a Dutch journalist a few days ago continues to remind us of just how dangerous and perilous life is in East Timor. All those who are there at the moment, whether they are inhabitants, whether they are foreign companies which invest there, whether they are children who are attending international schools or our soldiers and humanitarian aid workers, are facing daily peril as they go about their tasks. The events that followed the declaration of the referendum result were some of the most shocking and appalling that we have witnessed in our region in recent times. It is really a testament to the strength and commitment of the East Timorese people that they have suffered for so long and that they have been able to hold out for what they have always dreamed for. This is all the more so when you consider that their voice was finally heard and yet they still had to suffer. I do not think any members here today would disagree with me when I say that the East Timorese have shown themselves to be a proud and resilient people who have maintained their dignity in the face of all this barbaric cruelty. At the height of the murderous rampage in East Timor, my Petrie office was flooded with calls from average Australians who were angry, horrified and absolutely overwhelmed by the brutality of the militias and elements of the Indonesian military. I was struck by the emotion of some of those telephone messages. Clearly, people were phoning with tears in their eyes and were very moved by the situation, and I must share that sense of revulsion at what was happening in East Timor. I am very proud to be part of a government that has put aside long held conceptions of Australia's immediate national and political interest, to ensure that the popularly expressed Thursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10461 wish of a very small emerging nation is respected. More importantly, I am very proud of our efforts and, in particular, those of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in securing an international peacekeeping force for East Timor and, hopefully, putting an end to the wanton violence of the militias and rogue elements of the Indonesian military, or TN!. It is in this sense that I wholeheartedly support the first two statements of the motion by noting the results of the East Timor referendum and also welcoming the United Nations Security Council's resolution 1264 authorising the multinational force to bring peace and security to East Timor. One should never underestimate how quickly that resolution was passed by the United Nations Security Council-a resolution that usually would have taken probably two to three months, at the very minimum, to have been put through. It is an absolute credit to the work of our foreign minister, our Prime Minister and the members of that council to ensure that it was put through by such a speedy process. It is a sign of Australia's hard work and leadership on the issue of East Timor that the international community, through the United Nations, has requested that we lead this mission. I endorse our leadership and I want to state publicly my personal support for all those service men and women who are serving with the United Nations-soldiers from Brisbane, from my electorate of Petrie and, particularly, from Bracken Ridge. When I spoke to the mother of one of the soldiers who at the moment are waiting on alert in Darwin, I was very touched by her feelings. She said something that reminded me how real the pain is of the mothers and fathers and the families of military personnel. She said that they love what they do and they are trained to do their particular jobs and carry out their profession, but it was not real before the order was given that the soldiers were going to East Timor, and now it was real. At one meeting we were at, somebody spoke about the death and the possible carnage that might be involved. She was clearly distressed by the prospect that there is always a real danger. There is always a danger that there will be carnage, there will be death and there will be losses. SoI am very pleased today that this motion states our support, expresses our confidence in the ability of the armed forces and, more importantly, looks to their safe return home. I know that they will do us proud. They will certainly renew the long held ties between the people of East Timor and the Australian service men and women. The motion before the House marks a watershed in the political geography of South-East Asia, particularly in tenns of Australia's relationships in the region. Not only do we have a new nation on our doorstep, but we have a chance to imbue our relationships with Indonesia with a new level of maturity. It is little wonder that Australia's leadership, particularly on the East Timor issue, has placed great strain on our relationships with Indonesia. It has also tested our relationships with other countries such as the United States, which may not have always been as positive or as strong as we believed them to be in the past. RecentlyI heard the statement by Indonesian President Habibie to the Indonesian house of representatives. I believe that his view that he is 'disappointed by the Australian attitude in dealing with the matter' will allow us to redress the past mistakes of Australia's relationship with Indonesia. For too long, it seemed to many that our relationship with Indonesia was unbalanced. Australian governments, particularly the Keating government, in the past were often too eager to .please the Jakarta political elite at the expense of our long-tenn relationship with the region and humanitarian concerns. It is worth noting now that our relationship is at an all-time low. 10462 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 It is symbolised by the imminent danger of conflict involving our forces and by the abrogation of this agreement. It sounds like we have a lot to consider in the future and we have much to do at a particular time in our relations with Indonesia. We have a chance to reverse the imbalance and, much more importantly, to recognise that our policy should not be based solely on deference to the concerns of one small section of Indonesian society, regardless of whether or not those people are in power in Jakarta. It is with this in mind that we will be on an even footing with our Indonesian neighbours. It is in our longer term interests, and also in the interests of humanity, that we look at this relationship. I express my absolute best wishes to our soldiers for a safe return. The prayers and thoughts of our nation are with them and their families. I also express my gratitude to the international agencies for the work that they are doing with many of the refugees at the moment. It is too early to anticipate where this situation will lead. How long it will go for is another thing that is uncertain. It has every potential to be, as I mentioned to someone the other day, what Albania was to Italy; certainly that situation has unfolded in past months. A considerable amount of funding for the military will be needed, and also for a continuing international relief program. There is a nation that has to be rebuilt. There are no utilities. There is absolutely nothing there at the moment. I hope and pray that Australia can playa very positive role in ensuring that East Timor will again rise from the ashes. Ms KERNOT (Dickson) (11.32 a.m.)-East Timor has halmted Australia's national consciousness for more than 50 years. There is a deep feeling amongst many Australians that we owe a great debt to the East Timorese that we have failed to honour. That, I think, is one of the reasons why so many Australians have so strongly endorsed calls for international action to end the bloodshed that has taken place in East Timor since the referendum on 30 August. Irrespective of our political persuasion, Australians feel that we cannot stand by and allow such a convincing and brave vote for independence to be overturned by violence and oppression. Many Dickson residents have contacted my office-along with the member for Petrie, I also record the emotion that was expressed in these telephone calls-and many who have signed petitions about East Timor have wanted it to be made known that their argument is not with the people of Indonesia. They do want Australia to have a productive and friendly long-term relationship with Indonesia, but not at the expense of the lives and the freedom of the East Timorese. Many Australians are also wondering why the referendum went ahead at this particular time. They wonder how wise it was to set off down this path in the first place, with militia violence and the complicity of the Indonesian military evident in East Timor well before the ballot and when East Timorese leaders themselves were urging a longer time frame. Many Dickson residents expressed to me their concern about whether lives have been lost unnecessarily and whether a more peaceful transition to independence might not have been achieved at a later date. I do not think that these questions have yet been answered satisfactorily by either the Prime Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs. To say that 'no-one could have predicted the events following the ballot' I think must rank as one of the more ingenuous statements of all time. To ignore the concerns of Xanana Gusmao and Bishop Carlos Belo-and, as we now know, the United States-in favour of the assurances of President Habibie and General Wiranto now looks to have been a terrible error in diplomatic judgment. Thursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10463 To have sided with Indonesia in its refusal to accept peacekeepers prior to the ballot taking place-and I know you can always say that you can see things with hindsight, but I am arguing there were a lot of circumstances evident before this decision was taken-now seems a wilful and blinkered denial of the facts. None of this, however, excuses the behaviour of the militias, of the Indonesian military or of the Indonesian government. But it does now seem that what could at best be described as Australia's naivete contributed to the destruction wrought on the people of East Timor over the past three weeks. Of course the United Nations also chose to ignore the evidence and pressed on with the ballot even though it, too, knew the militias were not being disarmed. As the Labor shadow minister for foreign affairs, Laurie Brereton, said in the parliament on Tuesday, there can be no doubt that the people of East Timor have been grievously betrayed by both the United Nations and Australia. I agree with those who say that we have let these people down once again-as we did in 1942; as we did in 1975; and as we did in 1979, along with another 32 countries, when we recognised Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor. We have let them down by helping to push forward a flawed and dangerous process that has ended in violence and ruin. Having said that, I think we must now look to the future. We must now honour our debt and meet our responsibilities towards the nation of East Timor. It is not going to be a small responsibility or a minor commitment. We, as a nation, must be prepared to playa strong and positive role in returning East Timor to peace, in rebuilding its towns and its infrastructure, in returning home its refugees and in helping it to become a free, peaceful and prosperous nation. I believe the vast majority of Australians would support a government commitment on that front. I also believe the vast majority of Australians want a friendly relationship with a democratic Indonesia. Irrespective of provocation, we must remain positive, calm and constructive in that relationship. Perhaps now is also the time for the coalition to recognise the serious error it made in reducing funding for Radio Australia. I join others in asking the government to rebuild that service as an important part of informing Indonesians of our goodwill towards them. Finally, I think we have to take stock of what East Timor might mean in the wider regional and international context. There is often a tendency to place stability in a nation or a region above human rights concerns or democratic principles. History is littered with the disastrous consequences of appeasing brutal regimes in the perceived interests of regional stability. But this really does seem to have been changing since the end of the Cold War. We can see people's movements, democratic movements, springing up all around the world. I think we have to face the fact internationally that some nations may not be able to hold themselves together in the future, particularly those with diverse cultures, faiths and ethnic backgrounds within their borders. And this may not be such a bad thing. In a globalised economy, the actual size of countries may not matter all that much in the future, providing those countries can sustain friendly relationships with their neighbours. But there will be those who cannot let go and who will seek to hold on to power at any price, and the rest of the world has to ask itself how it is going to respond to the growing tide of independence and separatism. Writing in the Guardian a fortnight ago, the columnist Polly Toynbee summed up the question very well, I think, when she said: 10464 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday,23 September 1999 The world should consider whether it really wants to waste the next century trying to hold together those who wish to break apart, at what cost in money, arms and blood and according to laws laid down by what authority? Far better to let the people go. Perhaps that is a message Indonesia should have heard in regard to East Timor. But it is also a message which the rest of the world has to pay close attention to in the years ahead if other nations and other peoples are to avoid paying the same terrible price for independence and freedom as that paid so far by the people of East Timor. Like other speakers, I want to close by sending my thoughts and best wishes, on behalf of all the people of the electorate of Dickson, to those parents I have met who have children serving in this operation and also to those serving personnel who are indirectly or more directly' involved. Their safe return is obviously at the forefront of our thoughts. Mr I(ATTER (Kennedy) (11.40 a.m.)-During the last world confrontation-the Second World War-it was proposed to abandon part of Australia north of Brisbane to the Japanese invaders. The people of North Queensland have a very strong memory of that and there are very few who are not conscious of the fact that we were simply going to be abandoned. If you take away a very small strip of land about 100 kilometres wide running down the east coast of Queensland, the population in the northern half of Australia-in that infamous Brisbane Line, if you like, that stretches right across Australia-is much the same, in terms of numbers, as when Captain Cook arrived. It has not changed very much at all. You cannot say that there are no resources there. Half of Australia's agricultural production comes off the Murray-Darling system, which has 22 million megalitres of water. Just North Queensland-my electorate and its periphery; not the coastal strip, but the Gulf country-has 126 million megalitres of water. So if half of Australia's agriculture can be produced off 20 million megalitres, how much should we be producing in the Gulf country with its 126 million megalitres of water? We have twice as much arable land-flat rolling blacksoil plains-in the Gulf country and its periphery as the Murray-Darling system which extends over three states. That brings me to the subject of Indonesia, where 200 million people are jammed on to six main tiny little islands. We have to understand the way that those 200 million people will . interpret our actions. It is with deep regret that I say that many of those people will interpret those actions as people of European descent depriving them of half of one of those six main islands-and they are not going to be very happy about the situation. We have reacted with righteous anger over the killing of Indonesians-and righteous compassion too-and I think it is right that we reacted to what was taking place there. But if we have been upset over the sight of Indonesians killing Indonesians, you must understand that they are not going to be very happy about the sight of the people of European descent who are now there, and undoubtedly people will subsequently die. Let us tum back to Australia and think about the defence of a country and how we would protect our own nation and its territorial integrity. There was a wonderful series on SBS recently, and Ian Causley, one of my colleagues, rang me to tell me to switch it on. In fact, I already happened to be watching it. The program was about the German invasion of Russia where the Germans had taken two-thirds of the Russian population. They had the three major cities under siege and they had killed 3Y2 million Russian soldiers, which was almost the entire size of the German army. So the Russian people were conquered. The reporters were interviewing an old lady who had been a teenager at the time, and they asked, 'What did you do when the situation arose?' She said, 'I got the family'S hunting rifle Thursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10465 out and shot 12 Gelman soldiers.' The interviewer asked, 'What did the Germans do?' She answered, 'They shot 20 villagers by way of retaliation.' The interviewer asked, 'What did you do then?' She said, 'I went out and shot 20 German soldiers.' The interviewer asked, 'What did they do?' She answered, 'They put a cordon around a whole village and slaughtered all of the 102 people inside that cordon.' Then the interviewer asked, 'What did you do then?' She said, 'I got two other people who also had hunting rifles and we shot 103 German soldiers.' The point of the story is, of course, that the Germans had conquered nothing. Every person behind their lines was there with a rifle and was prepared to shoot Gennan soldiers at whatever cost to themselves. The Gennans had conquered nothing, even though there were 3Yz million Russians killed or captured in the space of about seven months and the Russian army was left with very few people and very little equipment. I spent a bit of time with a businessman in Australia who was a colonel in the Six Day War with Israel and I said, 'Those Arabs can't fight.' He said, 'The only people that say that are people that have not fought the Arabs. I might remind you that you people took them on and you threw the whole might of the British Empire at them for six months and you never made it off the beaches at Gallipoli. Don't ever say that the Arabs can't fight.' 1 asked, 'How do you people keep beating them?' He said, 'Even if they can get an any of a million people together,'-that is a very big army-'when they invade Israel, or attempt to invade Israel, there are 3 Y2 million people of whom pretty close to three million have automatic weapons they are trained to use.' So they are up against an any of three million when they confront Israel. Switzerland has been left out of most of the big wars because every Swiss family has an automatic weapon at their house and they are trained to use it to protect and defend their country. So people do not pick fights with people who are tough, whether Swiss, Israeli or Russian. Going back to the situation that exists here: we have huge undeveloped spaces in this country and there is no way that we, as a people, can morally defend a situation where we are sitting on the resources of the Gulf of Carpentaria without developing those resources. And we cannot deVelop those resources without the assistance of the government of Australia and the government of Queensland-it is impossible. In fact, the laws, under national competition policy and native title, make it almost impossible to develop those areas. So those laws must be changed and attitudes must be changed. If you do those things, we are told, people in Indonesia-and there are 100 million people going to bed hungry in Indonesia of a night, we are told-have not got the money to buy our products. That is not entirely true, because one-eighth of this nation's cattle, until the recent economic upheavals, were going to Indonesia. With a very enlightened government in Indonesia, simple little farmers take those cattle and feed them on reject bananas and rubbish until they are big cattle and then they slaughter them over there. But the point of the story is: poor as that country may be, it is already taking one-eighth of our entire Australian cattle production, and I am quite sure that we can produce numerous other products which will make us good trading partners with people whom we desperately need. It is vitally important that we are friends in the longer term. So, whilst we go forward in a righteous cause, there is no doubt that there are very grave dangers indeed for people of my age in Australia. I was handed a gun when I was 18 years of age, I think it was, and told to go and fight the Indonesians in Sarawak. Soon afterwards 10466 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 we were then told that we were on 24-hour notice to go and fight in Vietnam, where 300 million in the countries of the United States and Canada faced off against 30 million Vietnamese. The Americans lost heavy casualties in Vietnam. Fifty-six thousand Americans were killed in Vietnam, versus only 54,000 in the war against Japan. So if we go forward, we must go forward in the knowledge of the very sober realities of the situation which Australia and our neighbours are in today. support of most of my electorate of Lyons, go out to the Australian troops now attempting to engender some peace and protection in East Timor. They have my personal backing in this unenviable task of trying to broker peace in a situation where nothing is known. I have been totally dismayed at the way the foreign affairs portfolio has been managed by this government, with an inarticulate foreign minister, an indecisive Prime Minister, and a ministry of defence without its most senior adviser. This would be a joke if it were not so serious. It is serious because we have let down badly again those East Timorese who fed, sheltered and nurtured those Australians who survived in East Timor during the Second World War. We owe so much to these people, both now and then. Times do not change much. The scene was set for disaster when Australia demanded a referendum vote without any thought of what might happen afterwards, and when no provision was made to assist in the changeover between Indonesia and East Timor. There was no thought given as to how the local people might act, both the bewildered Indonesians-a lot of whom have property in East Timor-and the terrified East Timorese. Over the years there has been a lot of work done building up Australia's relationship with this part of the world, something this Prime Minister did not really understand when he took office. He rubbished Labor's efforts to obtain a greater understanding of South-East Asia and APEC, yet when the Indonesian economy started to break down and the Indonesian election did not produce a clear result there was a definite feeling of unrest. There were warning signs there that this government did not read. The Department of Foreign Affairs does not seem to have grasped the background or the history of the situation in Indonesia at all. The political situation in Indonesia has been in turmoil for some time. The Indonesian people themselves had been revolting against militarism and demanding to have a more democratic government. The outcome of their election has brought a tough time for them as well. With the overthrow of Suharto, Indonesian politics changed. Currently, there is no government in place and players are jockeying for positions of leadership..The military prepared for this at least a year ago. Now was not a good time to try to annex a part of that country. The other thing that seems to have been forgotten is that the military have played an intimate role in government since Sukarno took over Indonesia for the Indonesians. What we have here is a series of small countries put together under one umbrella to help them set up a structure to govern. The military have been placed strategically at every level of society, from community groups and local councils upwards. The military have been in the local council. They have been the provincial leaders. They have representatives in the parliament. The military have been in goveniment. You cannot change that overnight. There are many different peoples in the Indonesian archipelago and, although many have not agreed with the role of the military, they came to respect the relative stability the military brought to Indonesia. However, when it started to become corrupt, many questioned the role",132,Representatives Main Committee
202,Mr Adams (Lyons) (11.49 A.m.),"My good wishes and my support, and I guess theThursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10467 of the leaders and how they used the military. Violence comes from corruption, and power with violence. This is perhaps oversimplifying a very complex structure, but suffice to say that the military have been government, the seat of power, and flow this is in tunnoil because of the election. Somehow it has brought the hostility of many nations against them because of their treatment of the East Timorese. I do not believe the East Timorese are the only ones very frightened. No one can condone the killings, the murdering and the violence, and I hope all those who had any part in it will be taken to task very severely. But we should understand the situation as it really is. The militia are the worrying ones as they are not apparently led by anyone in government and have used their military protectors as a licence to cause mayhem. They are paid provocateurs, and paid by the military to kill, maim and scare people out of the country. The Labor Party recognised this complex situation and realised that there was no way that East Timor was likely to have a violence free vote or achieve independence without some sort of aggression, given the instability of government, the economic crisis and the role of the military in government. We asked for assistance to be set up and to go in before the vote was taken. But the Prime Minister vacillated. He hesitated. He hoped for the best. And then when disaster struck, nothing had been done to put a contingency plan into action. People died. Finally, under pressure, late in the game after the vote, he suddenly decided that Australia had to intervene in the slaughter of East Timorese. He started his foreign affairs and defence ministers off in a direction to try and cobble together a United Nations force two weeks after the vote. Meanwhile, people died. Then people started to flee because they felt the situation was helpless and that, if they stayed, they would have been shot, or starved to death. It was an appalling lack of forward planning and an amazing lack of judgment. No wonder the Indonesians are objecting now and no wonder we have a situation of people being massacred. It was a total disaster. The mismanagement and misunderstanding were woeful. Even food aid took far too long to be started. Now we have a situation where troops are being sent to East Timor with little idea of what will happen to them. Some of the people they may have to be in conflict with are those who have trained with them. I suppose one consolation in all this is that I have great faith in our defence forces. They have been on other peacekeeping missions. They know what is going to be asked of them and I know they have compassion. I have had heaps of email since this situation became critical. People from all over Australia have been desperate to communicate their views. To deal with this, I set up a section of my web page and developed a regular bulletin that can be accessed by anyone. I have also personally answered the emails and tried to give practical ways for people to be able to assist in this process. I think many have. We must continue to gather funds and resources for the relief of the East Timorese people. We must start planning ways of helping them set up their structures for democracy with their new leaders now. The country is devastated and will need a lot of time and energy to put it back in order. We need to think about that and start planning it now. I can only say again that the Prime Minister should be condemned for the disgraceful way he has dealt with the situation. And, quite frankly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should be replaced by someone who actually knows a little bit about what is going on in Asia and in the world. 10468 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 My best wishes and hopes go to the troops and their commanders. If anyone can help the Timorese in their time of need, I believe these people can. I would like to thank all those other countries that have heeded Australia's call to come and help them try and solve this terrible problem on our doorstep. Most of all, I would like to commend those who stayed in East Timor-those members of the UN who remained in the compound, a few journalists, incognito and acting as aid workers, and all the aid workers who did not leave those people on their own. They were heroes among the people and they stayed to try and protect them and give them advice. Their courage is an inspiration to all. I certainly hope that we can assist East Timor to grow as a nation, to build itself into an independent, democratically elected nation with good structures for the future. (Time expired) absolutely appalled when listening to the last speaker, the member for Lyons. I have never heard such a woeful effort, at a time when one would have thOUght that the parliament was going to give real support to what we are trying to do. You could not even call that halfhearted. It was just equivocation. It was like so much of what the Labor Party has been saying in this debate: 'Good on you for the troops, but we cannot really say that we are going to support the decision,' although it is in the national interest. That really is pathetic, and I will come back to it in a minute. The important point to note is that, as the Prime Minister said to the parliament this week, there is no more serious decision than to commit Australian troops to a foreign country. What the Prime Minister has done is an example of realleadership, and something that Australians right around the country have really got behind. It seems that about the only people who cannot supportA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.01 p.m. to 12.13 p.m. presentation of the previous opposition speaker. I would just like to contrast the presentation of so many members of the Labor Party with the support given by the then opposition in 1991 when Prime Minister Hawke sent troops to the Gulf War. On that occasion it was quite clear that the opposition was right behind the decision of the government and gave wholehearted support to the government of the day. I would have thought that the Australian troops in East Timor will be mortified to see all the equivocation that is going on within the Labor Party at the moment. I would like to congratulate Prime Minister Howard on the magnificent job he has done over what has been a very difficult period. I would like also to congratulate the Minister for Foreign AffairsAlexander Downer, and the Minister for Defence, John Moore, for the professional way they have handled a very difficult situation, and for the way they have shown very strong support for our troops. It is important to note also that in my role as Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-and I note the deputy chairman, Mr Price, is in the chamber-I had the opportunity to meet with Major General Peter Cosgrove before he went over. I can assure all honourable members he is a very fine soldier and will do a very fine job in what is going to be a very difficult situation. When talking about the soldiers, it is important to note the support that is there. For example, Lieutenant General John Sanderson, a former Chief of Army, said recently:",140,Representatives Main Committee

204,Mr Hawker,"As I was saying before the division, I was absolutely appalled by theThursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10469 The Australian Army is well trained for the situation it will confront in East Timor. Good field skills and self-discipline have earned its soldiers a strong reputation for success in places .such as Namibia, Cambodia and Somalia. I believe that East Timor will certainly be added to that list. I would like to refer to a couple of points raised by the member for Lyons, because I really do not think he can get away with what he said. He made some reference to the Prime Minister demanding from President Habibie an immediate ballot. In fact, that was not the case at all. When the Prime Minister wrote to President Habibie late last year, he argued for a long period of autonomy for East Timor, leading up to an eventual vote on the region's future. I make that point very clearly, because it seems that the member for Lyons was either unaware of or chose to totally misrepresent what the Prime Minister did. It was the decision of President Habibie of Indonesia to bring on a quick ballot which created all the various difficulties that we have since had to confront. But to the credit of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence, they have confronted them in a very professional way, and in a way that does us all very proud. It is also important to recognise that the government was not caught short. It was the government that took this decision, through the Prime Minister, to approach President Habibie last year. It was an initiative by this government. When you compare that with what the Labor Party did, you see that they sat on their hands and did nothing for all those years when they were in government. It is rank hypocrisy for them suddenly to be critical now. Let us look at what followed from that. The Minister for Defence, months ago, as the member for Chifley would know, got the 3rd Brigade onto 28-day readiness. That decision has stood us in very good stead. that decision by the Minister for Defence, we have seen the work done by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in getting United Nations support for a multinational peacekeeping effort. It is very important to note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his work in the United Nations, got a decision in record time. Australia has worked extremely hard to do everything we can to try to alleviate what has been, as all members would acknowledge, a very difficult situation. That is why I find it so difficult to accept the criticism by some of those opposite who seem to have completely overlooked the facts and have come in with this mealy-mouthed duplicity, almost, saying on the one hand, 'Of course we'll support the troops,' while on the other hand saying, 'But we're going to sit there and bag the government for doing this.' The hypocrisy just leaves me cold. It is worth looking at the efforts of the Prime Minister. He did approach President Habibie. What did former Prime Minister Keating do? He was happy to go over there and have little pacts which have since been tom up. It was not a great achievement and certainly did nothing to help those in East Timor. The efforts of the Leader of the Opposition have been disappointing. He chose to selectively quote some media commentators. We could quote the commentary by some highly respected journalists. I refer, for example, to Glenn Milne in the Australian on 20 September. With respect to the criticism about not talking to the United States, the article points out:",142,Representatives Main Committee
205,Mr Price,And we supported it.,143,Representatives Main Committee
206,Mr Hawker,"He should support some of the other things we are doing, too. Following10470 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 In fact, when Howard visited President Clinton in July they spent more than a third of their working lunch at the White House discussing East Timor. That is not a matter of just bringing it up in passing. It was made a prime focus. Likewise, the article states that he pointed out to President Clinton that he had raised the same concerns with President Habibie at their Bali summit in May. It goes on to point out that that meeting went on for an extra hour, and that when Prime Minister Howard suggested to Habibie that he allow an international peace force under UN auspices into East Timor before the independence ballot, those present say that President Habibie went 'ballistic'. So to say that we had not been trying to do something about it is not to look at the facts. Milne pointed out later in the article: ... for those who say Howard should have done more to put an international peace force in place ahead of the ballot, the question also remains: exactly what should he have done? He goes on to point out: He had put the proposition to the Indonesian President and been refused. And he'd briefed the US President. What point would there have been in proposing a pre-poll peace force to Clinton when Habibie had made it plain such a force would be regarded as invaders? Of course, at the same time, had we taken that course of action, the ballot would not have gone ahead. That is an important point to note. Another important point to note in this article is that: United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan was among those who backed Australia's balanced judgment to proceed with the ballot. So, again, Kofi Annan from the United Nations made it very clear. If we look at another article that appeared on the same day in the Financial Review, Christopher Pearson pointed out: Howard is the first prime minister in a quarter of a century to have confronted what are literally life and death decisions. And take note of this next point: Doing nothing would have meant that people died. As he pointed out, the policy of the previous 25 years of doing nothing would have meant continued unchecked genocide. In other words, doing nothing would only have allowed what had already been going on-which people have been so concerned about for all these yearsjust to continue. It is time to get this debate back into focus and to realise that what the government has done deserves the support of all Australians. And it is time that those on the other side put aside their silly prejudices, stopped trying to play cheap politics, and got right behind the work that the government is doing and supported our troops in the very difficult task ahead of them. performance or lack of performance of the Howard government on the issue of East Timor. History will make an appropriate judgment on those issues. More importantly, I rise to talk about human rights violations, which I do not believe are acceptable at any time or in any place. They are morally wrong because our essential commonality as human beings must triumph over any differences we may have between us. Where people choose to impart violence on others, we have to stand up and say no. The rights of the vulnerable in the world are no longer protected only by organisations such as Amnesty International; they are now protected by most of the developed nations. They are not protected nearly enough, particularly in the case of minorities, but they are at least protected. .",143,Representatives Main Committee
207,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (12.22 P.m.),"I rise today not to talk about theThursday,23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10471 Australia in its role in East Timor is doing just that-protecting human rights. A measure of a modem nation such as Australia is its ability to face up to its shame. Around the world, we see expressions of national pride, but it is often too difficult for some to also face up to questions of shame. I raise that today because I also think it is part of the debate. Rarely do we see genuine acknowledgment of national shame. Governments taking responsibility for matters of national shame are actually showing leadership, because it is not an easy thing to do. Very often, it is not a popular thing to do. Unfortunately, this is not just restricted to Indonesia in 1999. There remain many Australians who cannot bring themselves to recognise our national shame in relation to the treatment of indigenous people. We should not pretend, in the relatively comfortable light of Australia today, that the issues are easy; they are clearly not. Australia has in the past sent its troops on very different journeys. While the world wars are still sources of great national pride and respect, the memory of Vietnam is one that still sits uncomfortably in the Australian psyche. The fact that after putting their lives on the line for their country, in some cases without choice, Australian military personnel were treated with disdain by some in our society is a shameful reflection on our society of the time. The fact that an Australian government has in the past embarked on conscription is, too, a shameful reflection on the times. Fortunately, I believe that on this occasion we are mature enough to take these issues off the agenda in this case. We have learned from our mistakes. Such issues should never again be part of the Australian defence debate. The journey our soldiers are emb(!rking on may be a long one. It may even be that some of them do not return. That is something that we all need to be prepared for. It is the reason we must tread warily in relation to these matters. It is about the lives of our fellow citizens, our families, those whom we care about. With all of our hearts we wish them, above all else, safety. We hope that they will return to their families, to their communities and to the normalities of life. Though the prospect of international engagement typically incites feelings of animosity towards Indonesia, I would also make a plea for a perspective. We must keep in mind the importance of our long-term relationship with our most powerful neighbour to the north. I suggest to the Australian community that the Indonesian people are not to blame. In the long term, Australia needs Indonesia and Indonesia needs Australia. We must be sensitive to the task of repairing that relationship in the future. Such repair will not come easily, but our economic and cultural role in the region is at stake if we do not face up to the issue of repairing that relationship. In the same way, we must face up to our responsibilities with respect to the people of East Timor. One of the most important immediate tasks is to ensure that our aid assistance is also fully utilised. The approach must be a cooperative one. We must not have competition between delivery agencies which sees a waste of scarce resources in the rebuilding of East Timor. Immediate assistance is needed to ensure the basic needs of people are met, but we must also be thinking about how we can assist the East Timorese people in the long term. The East Timorese people have always stood by Australians in times of need, most notably in the Second World War. Now it is Australia's tum to stand by the people of East Timor, not just in the months ahead but right through to the establishment of the institutions and structures that will be critical to their long-term future--their democratic, economic, cultural and social institutions. Australia's interest in East Timor has reflected the legacy of the Second 10472 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 World War when, as we all would know, Australian commandos operated against the Japanese with the assistance of many East Timorese people. The controversy surrounding the manner of Indonesia's invasion of East Timor and the deaths of five journalists working for Australia's media in October 1975 rings in the mind of a lot of people at this time, and so do the allegations of human rights abuses over the past quarter of a century. The ongoing nature of human rights abuse in East Timor, particularly in the Dili massacre of 1991, have left many people asking the question: are we too late? The simple answer in some ways is yes, we are too late. That, therefore, creates a sense of urgency in the minds of many Australians who want to do the right thing on this occasion by the people of East Timor. Perhaps the more complex answer is that probably we could have saved lives earlier but now it is important that we do all that we can to reverse some of our mistakes of the past. In many minds, the end of the Suharto regime brought the prospect of the East Timorese status being revisited. The agreement of 5 May 1999 to allow the East Timorese a vote for independence was met with hope and in some quarters, let us be honest, scepticism. The scepticism has proven well founded. Our task now is to ensure that the hope also proves, on this occasion, well founded. We must recognise the courage implicit in that August vote for independence. Amid threats of death, amid the very real possibility that turmoil would precede triumph and that many of those who voted for independence would not live to see it, the East Timorese turned up to vote conclusively in favour of their future, and they did so in droves. That is an enormous statement by a little nation of solidarity and courage, something that all Australians should recognise as cause for pride. After almost a quarter of a century of human rights abuses, the resolve was thick. That is what comes of being tortured, being starved, being beaten. The old paradigm that 'might is right' no longer has credibility in East Timor. It never had credibility in the hearts of the East Timorese people, and they voted in their droves to put to bed the old paradigm that 'might is right'. As a recently returned aid worker reported, many of the East Timorese people voted with the statement, 'We will suffer for the next generation,' and suffer they have, after the vote. The militia have sought to maximise the devastation, the intimidation, the human tragedy. But, at the end of the day, the human rights tragedy will only strengthen the resolve of the East Timorese people and of those in the international community who realise what is at stake. Systematic intimidation cannot be allowed to suppress the right of self-expression and self determination. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived. to recognise that. To the East Timorese refugees we say this: our hearts are with you; we are by your side; we are your friends. Given the tragedy and suffering that you have seen and endured, we cannot claim to understand. We offer you our open hearts and all that we can to ensure your safety and well-being. We should also be concerned at the plight of Indonesia-and there is concern that Indonesia may slip into deeper recession. We should be aware of the potential for a downturn in the industrial sector to impact on the agrarian sector, the poorest Indonesians. They are not to blame for the problems of East Timor.",144,Representatives Main Committee
208,Mr Martin Ferguson,"Some may see it as sad that it has taken Australia so longThursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10473 It is essential that Australia, in facing up to its responsibilities in East Timor, also does what it can to ensure that hyperinflation is kept in check, that financial institutions are fundamentally reformed and economic stability is restored to Indonesia. It is a mistake to believe that it is a short-term task; it also carries political risk as the millions of Indonesians without work may not appreciate aspects of the necessary reform process. We must resist the temptation to see this as a conflict with the Indonesian people-it is not a conflict with the Indonesian people. They, too, are human beings. They are not responsible for the complicity of their military or some in their government. Finally, I would like to wish our soldiers and those from other nations who have joined us in the peacekeeping effort a safe return. Our hearts are with you and you can be assured that they will be with you on your return. I also simply say in conclusion: yes, we must do our best in East Timor. Also, in looking to the stability and safety of our own region, we must face up to our responsibilities, support reform in Indonesia and maintain its developing democratic structures. That is in the best interests of Australia and it is also in the best interests of the people of East Timor. (12.32 p.m.}-Along with many other Australians, through our public media I witnessed the agony of the East Timorese in the days following the announcement of their ballot. People at the time thought our intervention was too slow, but I want to congratulate the Prime Minister and our Minister for Foreign Affairs for the speed with which they managed to move the issue to a strong, internationally supported agreement on intervention. This crisis has also focused public attention on the urgent need to get humanitarian aid to East Timorese displaced by the events of the past three weeks. As parliamentary secretary with the responsibility for administration of Australia's overseas aid program, I should like to place on the record the matter of Australian aid to East Timor and how it will contribute to the territory's rehabilitation and reconstruction. Even without the terrible destruction of the past three weeks, East Timor's needs are immense. East Timor is the poorest of Indonesia's provinces: 80 per cent of East Timor's popUlation depend on subsistence agriculture for their livelihood. According to the most recent statistics-1990-life expectancy is a low 57 years, and infant mortality a shocking 124 in every 1,000 live births. A 1992 UNICEF study found that more than half of East Timorese children under five were malnourished. The Indonesian government itself estimated that 53 per cent of the population of East Timor did not have access to safe water. In 1997, almost half the popUlation over the age of 10 had never attended school. These are the sorts of indicators of severe poverty which place East Timor's people amongst the poorest of the poor on a global scale. I believe our record in East Timor needs to be stated for the record, because in recent times it has been brought home very strongly to me how much the Australian public is in ignorance of what we have been seeking to achieve in East Timor for some time now. A u s t r a I i a recognised East Timor's needs at an early stage. Between 1980 and today, Australia has provided more than $50 million in development assistance to East Timor. This is more than , any other donor country. Australian assistance to East Timor has a clear poverty focus. Over a period of six years, Australia has helped to more than treble the number of people with access to town water in Suai and Dili. We have trained 3,500 agriculture sector workers to give them basic skills in",146,Representatives Main Committee

Since 1982, Australia has provided more than $6 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross for its work in East Timor. We have worked closely with both Australian and local nongovernment organisations to support a large number of small scale community development projects. Since well before the autonomy ballot, Australia has been planning to expand its aid program in East Timor. A program planning mission in May this year recommended not only a continued and expanded focus on critical poverty related areas of rural development, health and education but also more attention to building the capacity of East Timorese institutions to deliver basic services. This latter focus was especially important in light of the growing exodus of those non-East Timorese workers who have historically occupied most of the skilled positions in East Timor. However, the deteriorating security situation in East Timor made it difficult-and later impossible-to implement many of the recommendations of the program planning mission. Work on a number of proposed new activities had to be put on hold. Nevertheless, some important work was able to be done, in particular to strengthen East Timorese non-government organisations. Australia also made a major contribution to the successful conduct of the 30 August popular consultation. Australia was the largest contributor to the UN mission in East Timorthe ballot process. In-kind support, in the form of vehicles and helicopters, enabled UN officials to access remote areas of East Timor to ensure that all voters understood the importance of the ballot process. A very high voter turnout testified to the success of the UN electoral team, which was very well supported by expert advice from the Australian Electoral Commission. Finally, I must acknowledge the critical role played by Australian civilian police advisers and military liaison officers in ensuring that registration and polling was able to occur, substantially free of intimidation. Many of these officers stayed on with UNAMET after the ballot, showing great personal courage. The challenge we now face is to create an environment in which the will of the overwhelming majority of East Timorese people can be fully realised and the real needs of the East Timorese can be addressed. One tragic consequence of the terrible violence of recent weeks is that East Timor's economic and social development has been seriously set back, perhaps by many years. At this moment, we can only guess at the actual scale of the damage which has occurred. Almost three-quarters of East Timor's population-more than half a million people-have been forced to leave their homes to hide in the bush or, worse, to be transported against their will to West Timor or elsewhere. Their homes have been burnt and their livelihoods destroyed. Many people-we do not yet know how many-have been killed. The militia seem to have particularly targeted young men, community leaders and church workers-in other words, some of the very people most critical to the development of a newly independent country. Many of the survivors are deeply traumatised. Many may yet die of sickness or disease in camps of displaced persons before they are able to return to their communities. Many others may also face terrible hunger as they try to salvage something from ruined food gardens or to plant new crops before the coming wet season. Thursday,23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10475 Unfolding in Timor-East and West-is a human tragedy on a scale rarely seen in the AsiaPacific tegionIt will require a massive and well-coordinated international relief effort to prevent it. Australia will make a major contribution to this through our aid program. As an initial step, the government announced last week a contribution of $3 million to support the work of major UN relief agencies, to be used by the World Food Program and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to purchase and distribute emergency supplies including food and shelter materials, medicines, and household essentials. The government is also supporting the work of the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs-the agency with the critical task of planning and coordinating the initial humanitarian relief effort. On Tuesday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced further funding of $4 million to assist the many hundreds of thousands of people in both West and East Timor who have been displaced or affected by the recent violence. This additional funding will be used to transport emergency relief supplies to East Timor, including through the use of ADF and commercial charter aircraft and shipping. It will also assist non-government organisations that are working to help people displaced by the conflict. The ICRC will receive $500,000 to assist its work in providing protection for displaced people and the reunification of families in both East and West Timor. Australian non-government organisations such as CARE Australia, Community Aid Abroad, Oxfam, Australian Red Cross and World Vision will each receive $250,000 to support their work in delitrering rapid and effective emergency relief to displaced people in East and West Timor Australia is also providing other support to the international relief effort. Quick action to pre-position supplies in Darwin and to organise transport will enable relief goods to be moved without delay to those in need, as soon as security permits. With the help of ADF C-130 Hercules transport planes, AusAID was able to make the first drops of emergency food supplies to displaced people in East Timor as part of the UN organised operation. Further contributions this week to the relief effort particularly focus on supporting Australian NGOs and other international agencies working amongst displaced East Timorese in both East and West Timor. As at today I can inform members of present activities relating to this contribution. Government funding assistance to date includes a barge loaded with humanitarian supplies and vehicles provided by the UNHCR, World Vision and Medecins Sans Frontieres, including 30 tonnes of medical supplies which should be departing today and arriving in Dili early tomorrow morning. Aid staff on the ground in Darwin are working closely with Australian NGOs and international relief agencies. Two warehouses in Darwin have been provided to store supplies, with one being used as a World Food Program logistics centre. Seven tonnes of first aid kits and water purification tablets and 100 tonnes of rice to act as an emergency food reserve have also been supplied. The situation in West Timor is especially worrying. Approximately 180,000 East Timorese are reported to be in temporary camps awaiting resettlement. Conditions in a number of camps are believed to be very poor with worsening water and sanitation problems as well as harassment or violence at the hands of militia members. The most urgent priority is to ensure relief workers are quickly able to access displaced persons both to offer humanitarian assistance and to help those who wish to return to East Timor. Most relief workers have been forced to leave West Timor in recent weeks because of worsening security. Representatives of the international donor community, including 10476 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 Australia, are now trying to re-establish that access to displaced people in West Timor. I am sure all honourable members will join with me in urging the Indonesian authorities to do everything possible to facilitate international relief agencies' access to East Timorese refugees in West Timor. In East Timor itself the work of reconstruction and rehabilitation must await action by the multinational force to re-establish security. Of course, the immediate priority will be to meet emergency relief needs-food, shelter, medical care, water and sanitation. Australia will work closely with the major international relief agencies to meet these needs as quickly as possible. Beyond this, Australia will work with other donors, the UN, the international financial institutions and, most importantly, with the representatives of the East Timorese people to plan for East Timor's future. There will be many jobs to do: reconciliation of communities deeply divided by violence; establishment of the rule of law with competent and impartial systems for the administration of justice including a new police force; rebuilding systems of basic health care and education; and repairing the damage to public utilities and essential economic infrastructure. (Time expired) debate concerns taking note of a paper. That paper is the United Nations Security Council Resolution of 15 September 1999. The Chair would be grateful if at least some passing reference could be made in members' contributions to the subject of the debate. of the most important resolutions that this House has considered. It is the largest deployment of troops in peacekeeping since the Hawke, Keating and Howard governments have taken office. Like all members of the opposition and all members of parliament, I believe I can say, we wish our troops who have been dispatched to East Timor all the very best. They can be reassured of not only our support and interest in their welfare but also our concern and anxiety for their families. I rise to participate in this debate not only as the current deputy chairman of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Tmde in this parliament, but also having been chairman of the defence subcommittee. When I was chairman, Mr Sinclair, the member for New England, was the deputy chairman and then, when he became the chairman, I was pleased to serve under him as I was to serve under Senator McGibbon and do now under the member for Wannon, Mr Hawker. It is true to say that the subcommittee really does reflect a bipartisan attitude to matters of defence. I have often said that perhaps we have not been critical enough of what has occurred. As momentous as this decision has been, and notwithstanding the unanimity of support for it, it behoves an opposition to raise questions where there are doubts and to seek answers where questions need to be answered. I regret to say that this is one very such occasion. I could dwell on the lead-up to the deployment of troops. There has been much comment about it. Of all the commentary I have read in the papers, the most objectionable has been the line fed out and peddled by Laurie Oakes in a magazine that this was 'the massacre we had to have'. If the government will not accept the criticisms starkly put by the opposition about the lead-up to the deployment, it needs to re-examine what has happened to understand if mistakes were made. If mistakes are made and you do not learn from them, you will repeat them. The East Timorese have paid an awful price, notwithstanding the fact that we are going in. I /",147,Representatives Main Committee
210,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),I would again remind the Main Committee that this,150,Representatives Main Committee
211,Mr Price (Chifley) (12.42 P.m.),"Thank you for reminding us of that. It is perhaps oneThursday,23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10477 I want particularly to raise concerns about defence issues. At the briefing that Laurie Brereton gave our caucus this week, and indeed at our caucus meeting, I raised the issue of troop rotation. We are sending over more than 4,000 troops. I congratulate the governmentand I did so at the time-on getting the 2nd Brigade to an increased state of readiness. It was quite clear that we had to plan for a worse-case scenario where peacekeeping troops would be required. Whilst we would all hope that these troops will be deployed and returned with great haste, we have been given no idea of the duration of this commitment. This government has broken new ground in peacekeeping, both in Bougainville and in East Timor. When you look at peacekeeping deployments under Labor, you see that clear objectives and a finite period of time were set. There were pleas to keep the Australians longer in Somalia, but we brought . them out. This time, I believe, the troops are not being sent with the clearest of objectives. Certainly there is no clear idea of the duration of the deployment. I think it is fair to say that there was a great deal of planning made on the basis of sending such numbers in for a short time before bringing one brigade back to be rotated with another. It is becoming clear that that is not possible. When asked about this yesterday in the House, the Minister for Defence said, 'We will address rotation issues when it is appropriate.' Wouldn't you need to plan for rotation now? Forty-five minutes later a colonel, the spokesman for the Defence Force said, 'Yes, we do have plans. Our plans are to fire up the 7th Brigade.' This is the brigade that was re-formed after the axing of the Ready Reserve. The Ready Reserve provided 12 months of full training for recruits, 60 per cent of whom went on to university studies. The Army was delighted to be getting a different type of recruit, with different capabilities from what they h!ld normally been used to, into the Reserves. But the government axed it. I have always said that was a mistake. The Army was not dissatisfied with it, but the government axed it. This was clearly a reserve that would have enabled the government to deploy troops overseas. We also have the conundrum that, notwithstanding recommendations from the defence subcommittee, reserves cannot be mobilised overseas. We have 23,000 full-time soldiers and 27,000 part-time soldiers who can be mobilised for Australia but cannot be sent on peacekeeping missions. So we ask platoons to nominate how many are prepared to serve. Not only do we have to get the platoon up to readiness, but we have to pick and choose from those who volunteer, regroup and re-form them and send them out. General reserves are on 365 days readiness. That is the doctrine; that is the state of preparedness. But what that means-if it is accurate-is that you have to pull them out full time for a year in order to send them overseas. Does that mean the deployment is going to be for 12 months? Clearly, everything we have learnt is that 12 months is too long. With great fanfare, the Prime Minister said, 'I want a report into the reserves.' And where is that report? That report was due in June of this year. I am a fan of the reserves, and I heard the chief of the Army at his national press conference say that the reserves are playing a marvellous role overseas. Indeed, they are. But the reserves we are using are doctors. That is what he was referring to. And for those doctors who are in private practice, we pay practice payments. But if you are not a doctor, if you happen to be working for a small business or you happen to be a farmer or you happen to be self-employed, you do not get a practice payment. Why not? If it is good enough for doctors, why isn't it good enough for the rest of the reserve? 10478 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday,23 September 1999 I believe that the general reserve, as we know it, is reaching the limit of its usefulness. That is not to deprecate them, but when you have a government that will not guarantee job security for the reserves, that will take them out of award conditions and then out of firms for considerable periods of time--and I do not blame the firms, because they feel very keenly the loss of any employee--then the notion of reserves that we have been used to is running the limit of its usefulness. But do not accept my view on this. What about the former head of the reserves and his comment about the problems that exist with the reserves. Let me make another point. When you are mobilising the reserves to get them up to a higher state of readiness you not only have to spend 365 days in training them but also have to provide more equipment. Do we have that equipment? I think these are issues that are deserving of answers. I thought it was outrageous yesterday when the junior minister talked about the allowances and the family support he was providing for the troops being deployed overseas but could not answer the critical question: how long would each tour be--would it be three months; would it be six months; was it going to be 12 months? He would not provide the House, the people of Australia or the families of the servicemen with that information. I want to say this about the Minister for Defence: at the time the situation in East Timor was coming, he was preoccupied with sacking his secretary; and he is the only defence minister for some time--either conservative or Labor-whose Indonesian counterpart would not accept a return telephone call from. Such is the depth of the breakdown of our relationship with the second most important country with which we have a strategic rehitionship-the United States being first and Indonesia being second. (Time expired) for Chifley, I would like to send my good wishes and support to all members of the peacekeeping contingent in East Timor. My hopes go with them. I express a sincere concern that they have a safe mission in East Timor and that the outcome for them and their families is positive, as well as being positive for the East Timor community. I do take issue to some extent with what the previous speaker said. I do not believe it is necessary on this occasion, when we are speaking to a motion to take note of a paper on the formulation of this exercise, for us to descend into a political debate about who did what and when and how. I think we should be looking at the great credit that the rapid build-up of personnel in East Timor has bestowed upon the efforts of the Australian Defence Force. We should note the fact that by yesterday over 2,300 peacekeepers were on the ground in East Timor and that by the end of today more than 3,000 peacekeepers-that is, the lion's share of the peacekeeping force--will be in place and undertaking their laudable activity in East Timor, fanning out from the capital, Dili, and restoring peace as they move around. I think that the smooth transition reflects great credit on the defence forces. It also reflects great credit on the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, as well as on the individual troops who have had to put up their hands for a very difficult mission. They have gone with the knowledge that there may well be, in the Prime Minister's words, 'a risk of violence, a risk to their own personal safety'. The families left behind deserve to have 100 per cent support from their members of parliament, and I believe that everyone in the parliament should be out there making sure we give them that support and whatever assistance we can. As things progress in East Timor, we certainly should take nothing for granted.

212,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (12.52 P.m.),"Like the previous speaker, the memberThursday,23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10479 the troops when they arrived in East Timor was very positive. But, since then, there have been some ominous statements and, at the base of it all, I am thankful that the powers given to our troops to act are very clear. I would like to read the mandate and mission of INTERFET as it has been set out: In authorising the establishment of a multinational force in East Timor, the UN Security Council has acted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. INTERFET has been given full Chapter VII powers authorising it to take all necessary measures to fulfil its mandate. The mandate of the multinational force is expressed in UN Security Council Resolution 1264 (1999) which was adopted unanimously on 15 September 1999. Under UNSCR 1264 INTERFET has been mandated to: Restore peace and security in East Timor. Protect and support UNAMET . Facilitate humanitarian assistance operations. I am pleased that that mandate is clear-that this chapter VII does authorise the use of deadly force when it becomes necessary. In the past, we have seen well-meaning UN missions get into deep trouble because of clouded mandates that did not have that degree of strength behind them. Once again, great credit is due in this case to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his efforts to have that mandate passed and passed very swiftly with overwhelming support. That does him great credit. Australia has committed 4,500 troops to the operation. We should recognise the great contribution of other nations to this force, and it is reassuring to have the world community well and truly lined up behind Australia in this regard. We have seen firm commitments from Thailand, New Zealand, the United States, Italy, Canada, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, France, Brazil and the United Kingdom. We also have expressions of willingness to contribute from Fiji, Brunei, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Egypt, Mozambique, Spain, Ireland, Germany and Denmark. Also, we have consideration of contributions from Chile, Sweden, Norway, Sri Lanka, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Korea, Nepal, South Africa and Kenya. Recently, we had a rally in the city of Ipswich in support of the East Timorese, which was organised by local church groups. There was a great deal of emotion at the time but, overwhelmingly, the message was about peace and forgiveness and for support for our troops over there. It was a very positive occasion, and I note that amongst those countries that are considering making a contribution is Papua New Guinea. Some of the comments that were made at that rally noted the fact that many East Timorese are of Melanesian extraction, and there was a feeling that a contribution from Papua New Guinea might be a very good thing. On behalf of the people at that rally, I raise that in this forum, and I hope that people give consideration to it. I would like also to refer to the contribution to the INTERFET forces being made by RAAF Base Amberley in my electorate of Blair. Amberley is Australia's No.1 strategic Air Force base. It is the home to squadrons Nos1 and 6-the FIlls. We also have the air defence guards and the 38 Squadron with Caribou aircraft. When we look at the TV reports coming back from East Timor, one thing that has grated a little bit on the locals out Amberley way has been the fact that we have had constant reports about the activities of the Australian Army. Anyone who knows the defence forces knows that, if you are a RAAF person, you are not an Army person. I think we should note the activities, particularly of members of the air defence guards, who were the ones from Amberley who 10480 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday,23 September 1999 helped to secure Dili airport. If people watching TV want to be able to tell the difference between RAAF personnel and Army personnel, and note perhaps who are the air defence guards and the other elements from the RAAF that are contributing, they can tell the difference by noting that RAAF personnel have their rank on their epaulets. While that activity has been going on, squadrons I and 6, commanded by Air Commodore Peter Growder, have been relocated up to Townsville and Tindal with their FIll aircraft and are on stand-by there. We have got a total of 100 people from Amberley participating in the East Timor activity. Amberley is a very close-knit community. Recently, when it was suggested that Australia could be put up as a temporary home for those Kosovar refugees, the people of Amberley were among the first in Australia to put up their hands and say that they would like to assist and to offer some of the disused housing at Amberley village as temporary accommodation. That request was not granted because Amberley is an operational Air Force base, after all, and operational considerations have to have right of way. I attended meetings out there where it was considered and the personnel were very outspoken in supporting the government's efforts. It is another example where a peacekeeping activity, which is contributing to the overall good of people across the globe, is well and truly supported by Australians, in general, and certainly by people from Amberley, in particular. It is a shame that Amberley village was not used to accommodate those Kosovar refugees because it is such a very picturesque location and for the people living there it has all the advantages of living in your own home rather than in a donnitory. Later on, some dissatisfaction was expressed along the way about some of the accommodation that was made available. It is a very busy time at Amberley at the moment. Apart from making this contribution to the East Timor exercise, Amberley is also contributing to Crocodile 99. Group Captain Stewart Cameron is the head of RAAF Base Amberley, and at the moment, in accordance with Crocodile 99, we have 800 marines in from the United States located at Amberley for the next four weeks. Of course, they are very welcome. These are busy times not only for RAAF Base Amberley but also for defence personnel across Australia. Once again, in closing, I express my complete support for the troops, RAAF personnel and all personnel who have been sent to East Timor in this peacekeeping exercise.

Local Elections the local government elections held in New South Wales on Saturday, 11 September, and the history of senior members of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party in trying to avoid the democratic will of the people. Leichhardt Council is a somewhat famous council, made more ,so by the movie Rats in the Ranks. But stories of Leichhardt Council did not end in 1994. On9 September 1995 there was a general election for Leichhardt Council. In the Glebe-Annandale Ward, Christine Bourne, the Liberal Party's No.1 candidate, was successful over the ALP's No.2 candidate, Ms Alice Murphy, by 17 votes. That was to be short-lived because, in the recount held on 15 September,",152,Representatives Main Committee
213,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (1.03 P.m.),"I rise to make some comments with regard toThursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 10481 that margin was reduced to three votes. Due to electoral irregularities, legal action was taken by Ms Murphy and on 27 September, in order to stop the mayoral election going ahead, an interlocutory injunction was granted to defer that mayoral election so that the challenge to the New South Wales Supreme Court, acting as a Court of Disputed Returns, could take place. The mayoral election was indeed deferred for a short time. Unfortunately, some two months later the mayoral election did take place. Christine Bourne's vote at that mayoral election saw the NAN-No Aircraft Noise-Party candidate, Ms Maire Sheehan, elected mayor by that margin of one vote. We then had long legal proceedings. Ms Bourne engaged Peter King, a former head of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party, as her barrister. Richard Smallwood was engaged as her solicitor. On2 February, in order to show how keen they were to get costs, a bill of over $7,000 was sent to Ms Murphy on behalf of Mr Smallwood for the costs of that interlocutory proceedings. What occurred after that was that the Court of Disputed Returns overturned the result and ordered that the ballot be recounted with the votes that should have been included to elect Ms Murphy to be included. In order to stop the democratic process and will of the people being carried out by the correctly cast votes being counted, Ms Bourne took further action. She appealed to the Court of Appeal and that court handed down its decision, which was to cast aside the election of Ms Bourne and order a by-election. That was not enough. The Liberal Party heavies, including Peter King, still acting as her barrister, appealed to the High Court of Australia to stop the democratic will of the people being exercised in Leichhardt council. They were again unsuccessful and costs were ordered against Ms Bourne for those proceedings, which by then had gone all the way to the High Court. The by-election was then held on 14 June 1997. Ms Bourne, running under a 'build Badgerys now' platform, failed to succeed in that by-election and Alice Murphy was elected by a significant majority. At that time it did not help that Christine Bourne was the executive director of a four-wheel drive group that had gone into the Wollemi pine, known as 'the living fossil', and was advocating a free-for-all in national parks. This Christine Bourne has since shown her senior connections with the Liberal Party by being the state Liberal candidate for the marginal seat of Mulgoa at the last state election, and last Saturday she was a candidate for East Ward of Penrith council. What is significant about Penrith and Leichhardt and the link with Ms Bourne is that front parties, the Seniors Party and the Marijuana Smokers Party, appeared in both Penrith and Leichhardt giving preferences to the Liberal Party. Christine Bourne, in spite of all this, has refused to pay any of her legal fees and was served a bankruptcy notice last Thursday in the electorate office of the member for Lindsay where she works. Why is it that the Liberal Party of New South Wales, and in particular the campaign being run out of Jackie Kelly'S office, is prepared to go to any lengths to stop the democratic processes from taking place? There were other parties there, of course-most amusingly, the No Badgerys Creek Party, which, given that Christine Bourne campaigned for Badgerys Creek when she was in Leichhardt is quite an extraordinary situation.

The school hosted this important event to promote the link between young people and older citizens, and was supported in its effort by local Coolum businesses, such as Festival IGA, Stewart's Hotels and Simply Pies, which supplied food and equipment for the occasion. I should like to record my special thanks to the Coolum State High School Principal, Warren Kelleher, and the Deputy Principal, Denise Schultz, for their generous hospitality in providing not only a venue for the presentation ceremony but also musical entertainment for guests, courtesy of the school band. The school captains, Clinton Hearne and Kellie-Lea Hey, did a sterling job in assisting me with the presentations and it was great to see so many other young people participating on such a significant occasion. Each award recipient was assigned a year 8 student who stayed by their special guest throughout the ceremony and afterwards when the refreshments were served. It was marvellous to see them get to know each other and appreciate the things they shared, despite the differences in their ages. There can be no doubt that our Fairfax award recipients are outstanding examples of how senior Australians remain active in the community and continue to show their value and skills in a variety of fields.

Australian Seafood Industry Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (1.15 p.m.)-I must congratulate the member for Isaacs for spending so much time with his son and taking him to electoral functions. It is really good to see that. I try and extend that same opportunity to my children in the short time. I have with them. I want to speak today about the seafood industry. I know that some of my colleagues always have a bit of a chuckle when I do this because they feel that I have some sort of declared self interest in this. I am very passionate about the seafood industry not only because my family has been involved with the industry for 50 years but also because I represent the electorate of Petrie, which has 30 kilometres of peninsula extending all the way out to Moreton Bay. We have some very rich produce in Moreton Bay and a number of seafood processors down in the Redcliffe Peninsula. But the reason for getting up today is to particularly praise a publication that has come out, called From the Antarctic to the tropics: a snapshot of the Australian fishing industry. It details the composition of the Australian seafood industry, an industry that is always widely overlooked, I feel, even though it is one of the top five export earners. Just to give the House some idea: annual exports are $1.5 billion from this industry, and they are growing at the rate of 15 per cent per annum. As I said, it is one of our top five export earners. The seafood industry is worth some $1.9 billion in total for this country. One of the good things that the report highlighted was the fact that it is a high value product and that we are also developing best practices, particularly in the areas of fisheries and farm management. 10484 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 Australians are eating much more seafood these days than they ever have before and, clearly, when you look at the consumption patterns over the last 20 years, we are each now consuming some 12 kilograms of seafood a year. The report itself highlighted an increasingly valuable part of that market, the aquaculture industry-and I want to speak about that in the short time. I have left. Aquaculture in Australia yields some very high value products for domestic and world markets. Some of the products are: oysters, Atlantic salmon, Karumba prawns-which are particularly popular in our export markets of Japan-and southern bluefin tuna and pearls. Aquaculture is clearly the way of the future for this country and it is one of the highest producers. Last year the value at the farmgate was something like $500 million per annum in aquaculture. It is important to note that we have developed this industry only in the last 15 years, and we have the technology in Australia to have some of the best practices. We are also early innovators of our industry around the world. Corporate farming is the way to go and, clearly, that is an area that many people are getting into. We need to be much more competitively focused on this area. I had the pleasure of touring the salmon factory in Tasmania, and we are producing great results in that area. But we must not overlook important things like environment and the role that that plays. Aquaculture is not a short-term thing; it has a long-term horizon, and we need to develop that vision. We also need to attract more investors to the industry. Also, consumers are much more confident about using aquaculture products. When many of you go to shop at the supermarket, you will see that much of the produce in the supermarkets will be farm produced, as well as sea caught. We must continue to encourage innovation, particularly with our scientists. I want to pay a great tribute to the work that the Fish Research Development Corporation does, particularly the work in Deception Bay in my electorate and in areas like Townsville. It is to be absolutely congratulated for the industry. It is still in its infancy and we do have a long way to go, but we need a greater commitment from federal and state governments and we also have to ensure that we continue to develop the industry. Regardless of the risks, there are also many rewards. We need to focus as well on keeping the waters pristine and on ensuring that we have a viable aquaculture future because this is the way that we will feed our growing population. (Time expired) Bankstown Airport In the last two weeks when the parliament was sitting I spoke five times on the issue of Bankstown airport and its future and on the proposals that have been put forward by a number of vested interest groups for moving country or regional services from Kingsford Smith to Bankstown airport. I want to take up one further aspect that has more recently been somewhat confirmed in relation to what the impact would be. In the speeches I gave I indicated that I had particular concern for the 3,500 existing jobs iIi general aviation at Bankstown airport. The fact that most of these proposals would shift those out to Badgerys Creek creates the conditions in which they would only look at general aviation at Badgerys Creek, that Kingsford Smith would inexorably expand after the extra spaces were filled up, that instead of 35 to 38 per cent of the slots being available the maximum would be about 25 per cent because of air space management considerations. I also made the point that for all of those people currently using regional services in New South Wales and flying into Kingsford Smith, the airlines are under pressure from the operatives of",156,Representatives Main Committee
216,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (1.20 P.m.},"Bankstown airport is in the electorate of Blaxland.Thursday, 23 September 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 10485 Kingsford Smith airport and they are under pressure because they want to jack up the landing fees. So part of the impetus to try to get the regional airlines to agree to go to Bankstown is the existence and the threat of increased air landing fees. I also indicated that it was my view that if it did come to pass that regional aircraft were moved to Bankstown, a direct outcome of that and the displacement of general aviation out to Badgerys Creek or elsewhere would be that the sustainability of a regional airport at Bankstown for regional services in New South Wales would not be there in the long term. The key reason for that is the requirement and demand of people using country services to access KSA and the movement that there already is to try to start a hubbing operation in Newcastle. All we need is one further operation for people to decide that they would hub in Newcastle and then west of the ranges and then Uy small jets into Kingsford Smith to satisfy regional customers that Bankstown could be left with a great vacancy-a loss of 3,500 jobs in general aviation and a giant gaping hole because of the economic changes in regional operations as they are not going to stay with the aircraft that they have now. There is one key point that I did not make and that I make today. This is a message to the Prime Minister because if he has not got this message yet he should get it now: if regional aircraft move to Bankstown airport, then the long-term operating plan is dead. It is not just precision radar management which is creating some problems with that. It is dead, and it is dead on the day it happens. The reason for that is the airspace management demands are entirely different with a general aviation airport at Bankstown and moving regional aircraft to Bankstown. That would mean simply this: that the east-west runway use would be knocked out, Kingsford Smith would be back to two north-south runway operations, and the Bennelong funnel would be totally back into operation. The airspace management demands are such that that is an inexorable outcome of moving the regionals to Bankstown. That is underlined by the fact that Airservices Australia is moving towards trying to bring in precision radar management so that in all weathers craft would be able to come in. What they have proposed is that craft would fly at 3,000 feet and their approach should start at Hornsby. That would necessitate craft flying dirty at 30 per cent power into Kingsford Smith. We would have two effects, because they want to push that very hard, with at least 25 per cent and up to 30 per cent more jets running into and out of Kingsford Smith: the Benne10ng funnel back in operation and people in north Sydney-in Liberal electorates-suffering a noise impact far greater than they have had before. I have had experience in Bankstown of just what flying dirty means. That has not come from our general aviation airport; it has come from the change when the two runways came into operation. When that happened, Airservices Australia ran three lines up through Bankstown and Parramatta, they ran at 30 per cent power, and at north Parramatta and over Drummoyne they went to 100 per cent and blasted Sydney with noise. (Time expired) East Timor of my constituents go to make up the peacekeeping force in East Timor. I will say from the outset that the Australian Defence Force is at the highest point of military readiness since the Vietnam War.

217,Mr Schultz (Hume) (1.25 P.m.},"I, like many members in this House, have seen some10486 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 23 September 1999 gave a mandate to restore peace and security in East Timor and to facilitate humanitarian assistance operations because the Security Council detennined that the present situation in East Timor constituted a threat to peace and security. Australia faces a difficult task in East Timor but our personnel are there with a clear objective: to help restore peace in East Timor. The rules of engagement for the Australian contingent authorised the force not only to defend themselves but to use appropriate levels of force to fulfil the mandate given by the United Nations. Our troops are in East Timor in the knowledge that they have the full support oithe Australian government and the Australian people. Months ago we made ready an additional brigade of the Australian Anny in case Australian forces were needed for peacekeeping operations ill East Timor. As a result, we were able to respond immediately to the United Nations request, not only to participate but also to lead the multinational force. The defence force follows in the footsteps of other Australians: the Federal Police, military liaison officers, consular officials and United Nations workers who have done so much in East Timor in past weeks to help its people. Although the goal of our forces will be the restoration of peace and stability, the conditions they encounter could well be violent and disruptive. Any operation of this kind is dangerous. There is a risk of casualties. Our troops, however, are highly trained and totally professional. We should not only feel proud of them but also have every confidence ill' their ability to do the job. Our soldiers go to East Timor as part of a great Australian military tradition which has never sought to impose the will of this country on others but only to defend what is right. It galls me, as a member of this House, to hear members of the Australian Labor Partywhen we as a nation face this serious conflict that puts our young men and women at riskrunning ideological arguments as to the way in which the peacekeeping force was put together and the actions of the Australian government in sending it to East Timor. That in itself gives an indication of just how shallow some members of the Australian Labor Party are in their commitment to this nation. As a parliamentarian I would have thought that, at this time of this commitment by this nation to our neighbours, we could have joined in a bipartisan way to wish well to the people who have gone over there on our behalf and at their risk to assist others. WhilstI can understand what drives some of the comments that have come out of this place in the last two or three days, I just question the motives behind them. We are committed, as part of the United Nations, to assisting our allies when we are requested to do so. Nobody should have the gall to say that we should have gone into East Timor when to do so without perinission from the Indonesian government would have placed us on a war footing and created massive problems for the people in East Timor today. It is irresponsible of people to be pushing that line. I take this opportunity to praise the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, for the very statesmanlike and professional way in which he has handled this matter at all times, keeping in mindhas expired.
