The honourable member's suggestion will be covered by the general scheme with which the Government is associated, for dealing with pillaging on wharfs. Yesterday, I said that £200,000 was to be set aside by the Commonwealth for this purpose. I wish to make a correction of that statement; £200,000 was applied for by the parties responsible for the organization, but they discovered that, because of the shortage of manpower, particularly of the kind that they need, it would not be possible to expend more than £60,000 immediately. However, the larger amount has been set aside and will be expended as it is needed.

He said that the Mustang aircraft being produced in Australia had already been superseded in Britain by the Tempest, and implied that Australia's aircraft industry would always lag far behind that of overseas countries in the types of aircraft manufactured. It is unfortunate that the honourable member should venture to make criticisms of aircraft policy without first taking upon which he based his comments. Had he made inquiries, he would have found that the aircraft authorized by War Cabinet for production in Australiathe Beaufighter, the Mosquito, the Mustang and the Lancaster-ar e still unsurpassed in their fields in any theatre of war. The Lancaster to be produced in Australia is the most up-to-date version of this aircraft, and its production will be concurrent in England and Australia. There is absolutely no suggestion ofi the Tempest superseding the Mustang in Britain or elsewhere. The Tempest has heen developed as a low medium altitude fighter, and as such has been very successful both in the shooting down of flying bombs and in operations in the European theatre of war. The Mustang is a high altitude fighter with a ceiling of over 40,000 feet and, as such, is not inferior in performance to aircraft of any other type at present in production; in fact, experience has proved that the Mustang can be used with satisfaction at low levels, and that it is superior to the Tempest throughout, the whole range of performance.

52,Mr Beasley (West Sydney,"Vicein Australia, gave f u l l consideration to Tempest aircraft for production in Australia not in place of, but in conjunction with, the Mustang. It was found, however, that it would not be practicable to undertake the concurrent manufacture in Australia of both high altitude and low medium altitude fighters. The production of Mustang aircraft, the world's best high altitude fighter, was authorized 1 because the Royal Australian Air Force required high altitude fighters, and also because a large number of low medium altitude fighters already was available in the South-West Pacific Area. Further, the Mustang is powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, and production of that type of engine in Australia has been authorized, whereas the type of engine used with the Tempest has never been, and is not likely to be, made in Australia. vitally important, factor is that the type of Mustang to be produced first in Australia, with its splendid performance recoi'd, is built to a design which makes fairly easy the change to improved types giving even better performance. Other Mustang types are being developed, in the endeavour to improve still further the performance of the aircraft, as was done with the Spitfire by the British authorities. Consequently, the selection of an aircraft type that was at the commencement of its life was a wise one. ter for Labour and National Service consider the advisability of instructing all national service officers to exhibit publicly a list of all available jobs which the National Service Officer is authorized to allot, in order that those persons who are registered for employment may exercise whatever choice may still be left to them? taining a list of existing vacancies, which is kept as up to date as possible, is issued Post-war Reconstruction read the stateto all national service officers.

It is also necessary to protect our civilian population. I shudder to think of what would happen iu our capital cities in the event of a gas attack to-day. As the first step, I urge that our railway gauges should be standardized. I disaster that can be caused by breaks of gauge. The British forces in Palestine under General Allenby defeated the Turkish force of 130,000, but it was the break of gauge at Damascus that break of gauge, some 70,000 would have escaped into Turkey, but, as it was, only about 4,000 got through the passes of the Taurus Mountains to safety.

The job will take many years, and will provide employment for many thousands of men. As New .South Wales already possesses the standard gauge, those men -will be employed in other States, and the project will probably entail the shifting of labour from New South Wales to them. I hope that in the post-war period tlie Government will give favorable consideration to this urgent problem. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which has been in existence for a number of years, has perportant airport placed in other parts formed a good deal of valuable work, but most of its researches have been into matters concerning primary industries. In my opinion, this organization should extend its activities, and engage qualified staffs for the purposes of conducting other landing ground near Sydney posresearches of benefit to secondary indussesses those facilities. In addition, Mastries. After the war, Australia must provide employment for all its people. 'On the outibreak of war in 1939, 200,000 persons were unemployed in Australia. 100,000 persons were still without employment, although most of them were able and willing to work. Many industries could be established in Australia in ney by motor car from the landing the post-war period, if sufficient encouragement were given to manufacturers. I contend that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research could be of great service to manufacturers, parplans that have been formulated, the ticularly in supplying advice on the components of paints, rubber and plastics, and on processes for the extraction of oil homes in the neighbourhood. Because from coal and shale. Although Australia has not yet extracted oil from coal, it has commenced to produce oil from shale, but at an excessive cost. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research could, with advantage, investigate the reason for that high cost, because various cot, should inform those residents as early processes employed in other countries are not nearly so expensive. The oil content of Australian shale is supposed to be greater than that of shale found elsewhere, but, for some inexplicable reason, the cost of extraction is too high. Why it should cost 6s. or 7s. to produce a gallon of oil from shale is beyond my comprehension! The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should be instructed to engage a staff of experts to Mr Sheehan. conduct researches into the manufacture of rubber, motor engines, plastics and new metals, with the object of giving the benefit of their discoveries to Australian manufacturers. If that were done, Australian industry would be encouraged to expand, thereby providing employment for our ex-servicemen. I was gratified to learn that the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) had given instructions for the drawing of plans designed to make Mascot aerodrome the aerial gateway of Australia. 'Certain interests desire to have this imof the metropolitan area of Sydney, but Mascot is particularly suited for this purpose, because it can provide landing facilities, not only for land planes, but also for seaplanes. No cot is situated only 2 miles by direct road from the heart of the city, so that passengers on disembarking from aircraft may motor to Mai'tin-place in a Nearly twelve months later, few minutes. It is futile to travel 200 or 300 miles by air for the purpose of saving time, if the aerodrome is located 20 miles from the city, and the jourground <to the city occupies an hour or 90 minutes. I urge the Minister to make an early decision on this matter for at least one important reason. Under the landing ground will be extended, and that will necessitate the removal of some of the acute housing shortage, great hardship will be imposed on these families when they arc obliged to move. Therefore, the Minister, when giving consideration to the remodelling of Masas possible how long they may expect to remain in their present dwellings. They should not be given only four or six weeks' notice. The plan will require a good deal of reclamation work, the diversion of Cook's River, and certain other preparatory work, but the landing ground, when completed, will he capable of taking the heaviest aircraft in the world. With regard to the part that Australia has played in the war, one feels proud lo be an Australian, particularly when he recalls the sacrifices whioh the men and women of this country have borne in this conflict. However, I believe that some of the existing controls can now be relaxed without impairing the efficiency of our war effort. Yesterday, in reply to a question by me, the Minister for Transport said that he was hopeful that the War Railway Committee would l if t the restrictions on interstate rail travel in the the present building restrictions could be near future. Two or three additional carriages could be added to many passenger trains in operation to-day without exceeding the tractive power of the engines employed. Indeed, many trains leaving Sydney are not of sufficient length to absorb more than half the tractive power of the engines. Trains consisting of seven or eight cars could be increased to eleven or twelve cars without requiring the provision of additional engine power. Even on interstate trains many seats are left vacant. Yet, many people who desire to travel interstate for family and other reasons are prohibited from making such journeys. In these circumstances, the existing restrictions on interstate travel are very irksome indeed. The lifting of such restrictions would not impair our war effort in any way whatever, but would confer a great advantage upon the community as a whole. The rationing of tobacco and cigarettes should be greatly relaxed. To the worker tobacco is a medicine as well as an indulgence. Thousands of workers, howover, still find it very difficult to obtain any.tobacco at all. Canteens have been established at most factories, but this has not effected any reduction of consumption because employees at such factories are also able to make their usual purchases at the store from which they deal. For many thousands in the community, however, the existing rationing of tobacco is a serious hardship, and many menfolk feel this restriction more severely than they otherwise would because so many women now are smokers. It would be wiser for the Government to cease the rationing of tobacco and cigarettes and, at the same time, increase the sales tax on those articles. Under existing conditions black marketing in tobacco and cigarettes is rife. The .people who gain most advantage from the present restrictions are the "" blacketeers "". I understand that sufficient supplies of tobacco are available to meet the needs of the community as a whole. The time is also opportune to l if t the restrictions upon the installation of telephones in business premises and private homes. I fail to understand the reason for this restriction. Similarly, many of lifted without impairing our war effort. With regard to post-war reconstruction, I urge the Government to pass a right-'to-work bill in order to provide against the recurrence of unemployment as we knew it in Australia prior to the outbreak of war. Under such a scheme every person who wished to work would be required to register, and upon registering would be guaranteed employment, whilst persons who preferred to work for themselves without entering the labour market need not be required to register. Should we again experience adverse economic conditions, preference of employment would be given to all persons registered. Riordan) -The honourable member has exhausted his time. [Quorum formed.'] matta) [4.2] -Without indulging in undue repetition, I should like to commend the very generous words of welcome to our Royal Governor General which have been expressed by honourable members on all sides of the House. Some of the remarks made by honourable members opposite on this point have indeed been a revelation. The speech made by the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) in this debate was in the very best Imperial tradition. I hope that that speech was not only genuine-and I believe that it was-bu t also that the sentiments he expressed will be lasting, and are sincerely endorsed by his supporters. However, only a few minutes ago we were provided with evidence that such sentiments are not completely endorsed by honourable members opposite.

71,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr,,29,Eraser
72,Sir Frederick Stewart (Parra,"the sentiments of all his supporters when he applauded the appointment of a member of the Royal Family as Governor General of Australia. Much has been said regarding the use being made of Australia's fighting forces. At this late stage of the debate it is difficult to say anything novel or original America, even before it entered the war,, on that point. I have had personal contact with many soldiers who have become weary of sitting down in camps in Australia when they know that their brothers, of course, for the pooling of all material friends and comrades are rotting in Japanese hands. Despite the resentment which might be expressed in some quarters, the sincerity of which I doubt, regarding the expression "" mopping up "", I lcnow that many servicemen really feel that instead of being restricted to operations of the kind upon which Australia's fighting men are now engaged, they should be employed in more aggressive tasks on more important fronts. Reference is made in the Governor General's Speech to the expansion of our overseas representation. I freely commend the Government for the manner in which it has endeavoured to increase the knowledge of Australia in other lands and tbe knowledge of other lands in Australia, for this is what results from the exchange of diplomatic representatives. I firmly believe that Australia should be effectively represented abroad because I believe in the value of personal contacts. When I was Minister for Commerce in 1934, I had the great privilege of extending Australian commercial representation overseas. Later, when I held the portfolio of External Affairs, it was my privilege also to extend, to some degree, the diplomatic representation of this country abroad. I congratulate the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) on the excellent manner in which he has been able to put Australia on the world map. doubt, the outstanding lesson of this war is that no nation can live unto itself. Revolutionary changes in transport and communications have caused countries which formerly were remote from us to become, in many senses., contiguous. A clear indication of present trends is to be seen in the statement of the President of the United States of Sir Frederick Stewart. America, at his recent inauguration ceremony, that the isolationist policy in America must go. The spirit of international co-operation has found effective expression in many countries during the war. The lend-lease procedure under which was able to render great material assistance to the United Nations, is an expression of this spirit. That system provides, resources, and for full co-operation by the participating nations. Any such system, to be effective, must be all-embracing. It cannot stop short of the readiness to pool and share resources. Articles4 and 5 of the Atlantic Charter are also an expression of willingness to apply the policy of international co-operation. These paragraphs provide that the signatoriesFourth-wil l endeavour, with respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victorious or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity. Fifth-desir e to bring about the fullest collaboration befcweeu all nations in the economic field with the object of securing for all improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security. Those words give evidence of advanced thought in the field of international cooperation. This spirit is evidenced and expressed also in the establishment of Unrra, the eastern section of which met in conference recently in Australia. The whole spirit and objective of Unrra is that the more fortunate nations, which may have a. surplus or even an adequacy of the necessaries of life in their larder, should share them with other nations which are not so fortunate. Al l this is evidence of the Without growing spirit of international co-operation. Because of this, it is essential that Australia should be appropriately represented in all international councils. We have often, and rightly, been accused of a degree of niggardliness in our representation. When I had the privilege of representing Australia at the 1935 International Labour Conference I had three other representatives with me. At that conference Japan had 39 representatives, America 28, and Great Britain between 50 and 60. I am glad that the Minister for External Affairs, and his colleagues, are providing a more adequate representation of Australia at future international gatherings. But although Australia will share in the benefits of world co-operation of the nature to which I have referred, it has tasks to which it must apply itself in the domestic sphere, in respect of which it will have no right to depend on external influences. Our voice in international councils will be the more effective, and will be the more readily listened to, if we demonstrate our ability as a nation to deal appropriately with our own affairs. which the Government has been prepared The Speech of the Governor General quite rightly referred to the greatness of our war effort. Mention is made of the fact that as we are a relatively small comoffer of a Commonwealth-wide pension munity of about 7,000,000 people, our war effort has been rather remarkable. I agree with that statement, but I am not prepared to say that our war effort could not have been much better or that we could not have used our limited supplies of men, money and material to greater advantage. The time is overdue for a re-survey of our man-power resources. I consider that (ve have in the services to-day a surplus of personnel in certain categories which could be made available to assist in the discharge of the ordinary civilian work of the day. I have in mind, in particular, medical practitioners. We all are well aware that doctors serving civilian needs in these days are finding it extremely difficult to meet the demands that are being made upon them, yet many medical men in the forces are doing routine work which could be done by men without professional qualifications. We all are well aware, also, that our hospitals, particularly mental institutions, have been us to study the implications of that practically denuded of female nursing staff because the shortage of nurses in other branches of the profession has been such as to attract very many girls who formerly worked in mental hospitals to other classes of nursing work. They have, in short, been able to choose more desirable jobs. I have little doubt that, like myself, other honourable members have been informed, on good authority, that many nursing sisters in the services are not fully occupied in these days. The same story can be told in relation to rural work and the building trades. Many men who were co-opted to the forces are being kept there, although it cannot honestly be claimed that their services are being used to the best advantage. I do not intend to recapitulate the sorry story of unjustifiable strikes that have occurred in many fields of industry. I do not consider that I am doing the Government an injustice when I contend that a not inconsiderable proportion of the industrial trouble of this country has been due to the manner in tc appease and even offer bribes to those responsible for the industrial chaos and anarchy. The classic instance that gives point to my statement is the scheme made by the Prime Minister to the miners' federation. I have endeavoured, by questions, to ascertain from the Prime Minister, and also from the Minister for the Army while he was Acting Prime Minister, the nature of the undertaking given to the miners' officers in respect of a pensions scheme. My effort was in vain; all that. I received was an ambiguous reply. Therefore, we are bound to assume that the Prime Minister promised to transfer to the Commonwealth the system of miners' pensions that has been operating in. New South Wales for the last couple of years. It is also fair to assume that nothing less generous than that scheme will be acceptable to the miners and their representatives. We know that that scheme has broken down completely. The Government Actuary of New South Wales has reported that the fund was insolvent by an amount of no less than £10,000,000. As we are the custodians of the money of Commonwealth taxpayers, it might be as well for scheme. It was introduced as late as 1940a war-time measure, another act of appeasement by the Labour Government of New South Wales. The act stipulated that coal-miners must retire from engagement in their industry at the age of 60 years, and that they would then be entitled to pensions at the rate of £2 a week for themselves, £1 a week for their wives, and Ss. 6d. a week for each child. generous, those payments are extremely liberal if judged by Australian standards of pensions which apply to every other section of the community. For these benemany of them quite illegally. These are fits, the miners were required to make a weekly contribution of 2s. 6d. A levy of 5d. a ton on all coal produced was imposed deficiency in the miners' pension scheme on the proprietors, and the New South Wales Treasury was placed under the obligation of providing up to £80,000 a -year. But generous as were the pensions set out in the original act, a little more political pressure was exerted in 1942 and the legislature of New South Wales passed an amending bill, a copy of which I hold in my hand. When I make known some of the amendments which it made to the already generous pensions statute, no one will be surprised at the recent report of the Government Actuary. One of the amendments provided that the widow of a miner who had been widowed since 1921 should be entitled to draw 30s. a week for the remainder of her life. Even though her husband might have died in 1922, she still would be entitled to the full pension. measure further provided that certain miners who had been incapacitated since .1920, twenty years before the scheme came into being, could claim the full pension. The act of 1940 stipulated that a miner must have had service in a mine or mines for a certain number of years before he would become entitled to the pension. In 1942, that was liberalized to provide that any man who, during the twelve months prior to the introduction of the measure, had worked for 60 days in and about a coal mine, would be entitled to the full benefits of the scheme. As those miners who continue at their employment work on only five days a week, they would become entitled to a pension of £2 a week for the remainder of their lives after twelve weeks' work, involving an aggregate contribution of £1 10s.; and their wives would be entitled to £1 5s. a week instead of the original £1 a week, because in 1942 the act was liberalized to provide that the wives of miners who had retired because of having reached the age of 60 years should receive £1 5s. a week. Sir Frederick The discrimination against the wives of some miners which that involved was Whilst not intrinsically too much for the (political administrators in New South Wales to withstand, with the result that to-day the wife of every retired miner is being paid £1 5s. a week, the circumstances that have been responsible for a catastrophic financial in New South Wales. We have the right to learn from the Prime Minister whether or not that is the scheme of pensions which he promised to the miners, and withdrew only because they had failed to fulfil the promise which they had made to him. If that is not the scheme, what was promised? The New South Wales scheme is contributory. The policy of the Commonwealth Government, oft-times expressed by the Prime Minister and other Ministers, is opposed to contributory schemes of insurance and pensions. Is it intended that the benefits which now operate in respect of the coal-. miners of New South Wales shall be given to coal-miners throughout Australia, without imposing on them the obligation to make any contribution? The amending If so, one may ask whether railwaymen, Commonwealth and State public servants, and the school teachers of the various States, are to share in an equally generous "" hand-out"" by the Commonwealth Treasury. If they are not, is this to be a special concession to the small mining section? for striking, and impeding the war effort. Obviously. This brings us to a considers-' tion of the Government's general social services policy, to which lengthy reference has been made in the Governor General's Speech. I propose to link my remarks not only with that Speech, but also with a more recent speech by the Treasurer. Only a few days ago. we were regaled with what that honourable gentleman would probably describe as "" a sad and sorry story""paraphrasing a remark which he made recently in regard to the conditions in the coal-mining industry. It is a sorry story, which gives very little comfort to those taxpayers ' who have fondly Stewart. imagined that, with the removal of the",29,Eraser

What a terrible picture that is, when contrasted with the circumstances of British social services policy! I hold in my hand the White Paper which sets out the.intention of the British Government in respect of the social services that are to be enjoyed by the people of Great Britain as soon as tlie war clouds have passed. They are to be on a contributory basis. Whereas the Commonwealth Treasurer has issued a direful forecast of the state of the Ausscheme will be acceptable to the federaIralian exchequer in a year or two, because of the outgoings on social services and the like, it is ex,tremely interesting to note that, at the end of December, .1.943, the health insurance scheme inGreat Britain had to its credit no less than £152,000,000. gentleman claim that the benefits under that scheme are comparable with the social services legislation of this Governservices, which are disgraced by the apment ? Sir FREDERICK: STEWART I am glad that the honourable member for Brisbane has invited me to make that comparison. At the same date, the unI'mployment insurance -fund had a credit balance of £300,000,000, which is being augmented at the rate of £75,000,000 a year. Therefore, those two funds must now have a credit balance of approximately £600,000,000. That money is helping to prosecute tlie war. The Treasurer warned the Labour caucus that, far from helping the war effort, the policy of social services in Australia was making serious inroads on the ability of the Government to finance its war-time obligations. The honourable member for Brisbane has suggested that the insurance .schemes in Great Britain are not comparable with what is here proposed. I am able to give both the contributions and the benefits proposed in the British British Government. White Paper. I have already stated that tion by a male adult is to be 3s. lOd. a the coal-miners of New South Wales are week. This is to be supplemented by a required to make a weekly contribution of 2s. 6d.

Prime Minister has promised a Commonwealth-wide scheme. We have endeavoured to ascertain whether or not the existing scheme is to be made Commonwealth-wide, but have been unable to obtain any information on that point. Knowing as I do the Prime Minister and the coal-miners, I do not believe that anything less generous than the present tion; consequently, I regard it as the minimum that is likely to be provided. In Great Britain, the contribution by the beneficiary from this form of social service is to be 3s. lOd. a week.' The scheme is not to be confined to miners, but is to be open to every member of the British the honourable community, without restriction. It is time we began to introduce something of the kind in connection with our social plication of the means test. Only ithis week, I had before me a letter from a widow who lives at Northmead, near Parramatta. She owns a broken-down weatherboard corner shop, from the letting of which she receives a rent of 17s. 6d. a week. She pays £7 or £8 a year in rates, and periodically has to effect repairs to the property; consequently the net amount which she receives is no more than 12s. or 13s. a week. But because the property is valued at £425, her application for a widow's pension has been rejected. It had to be; legislation enacted by this Parliament, lays that compulsion on the Commissioner of Pensions.

The payment of 3s. lOd. a week by a male beneficiary will also entitle his widow to a pension of £1 16s. a week, and 5s. a week for the first child for the first thirteen weeks. Further, there is a funeral grant of £20 for adults, and grants varying from £6 to £15 for children. The children are entitled to have meals and milk provided for them in the schools. The scheme provides for family allowances at the rate of 5s. a week for all children after the first, and 12s. a week is allowed for orphans.

There will be no experience similar to that in Australia in 1931, when the government of the day most unwillingly had to reduce the invalid and old-age pensions. Treasury £356,000,000 a year from Consolidated Revenue? Sir Frederick Stewart. Sir FREDERICKSTEWART The simple fact is that, instead of the -Chancellor of the Exchequer suffering a headache because of having to provide the necessary funds, the contributions by the beneficiaries help him appreciably in the onerous task of supplying the money required to carry on the functions of war-time government. That is not the only direction in which the financial policy of the Commonwealth might be adjusted in order to provide more adequately than at present for the whole of the money resources of the country to be made available for the conduct of the war. To-day, with heavy Commonwealth deficits, we have the spectacle of the State Treasuries bursting with resources. I cannot speak in detail regarding the conditions in States, othei than New South Wales, but the last budget preWales, who is also the Treasurer of that State, indicated a surplus of about £1,000,000. He did not say that the surplus likely to be realized would be nearer £10,000,000, although it has been There is also a maternity grant pointed out authoritatively that the Railways Department of New South Wales has set aside £3,000,000 as a reserve for future replacements. Those railways have shown a surplus of £1,000,000, and £630,000 has been expended on capital works which would normally be paid for out of loan funds instead of out of consolidated revenue. Other public works have been provided for by the State Treasurer to the cost of about £3,000,000, and the money has been obtained from the State's booming revenues. This is due to the fact that the Treasuries of the States, as the result of the Commonwealth income tax reimbursement legislation are receiving, for the currency of tbe war and one year afterwards, the f u l l income tax which they had been collecting in the pre-war years when they had obligations which they no longer possess. [Extension of time granted.] The Government of New South Wales is to-day receiving, in substitution for its own collections of income tax, the f u l l the British income tax which it collected in 1938-39, also have to provide when it had social obligations which it no longer has.

78,Mr Chifley,"Does notunemployment relief, totalling about £6,000,000, were being met by the State Treasurer in the base year which was adopted in arriving at the reimburse?nent rights of the States under that measure. It is not surprising that today the State revenues are booming. That legislation provided that, in the event of prejudicial influences upon the State Treasuries, they would have the right to ask the Commonwealth for an increase of their financial allotment, hut there is no provision permitting the Commonwealth Treasurer to re-open the matter. I am sorry the Commonwealth Treasurer did not take the advice tendered by the Opposition, which urged that the legislation should provide for a reciprocal right. Then it would have been competent for him to have required State Treasurers to hand surplus moneys back to the Commonwealth Treasury, which is carrying the full burden of the war. A considerable amount of wasteful ex. penditure occurs in war-time. I am not so simple as to believe that £500,000,000 or £600,000,000 could be expended annually without leakages. I realize that there must be losses, because in these days of bursting war-chests the same degree of care which would be exercised in peace-time is not taken, particularly by those who have newly come into control of Commonwealth moneys. However, this does not justify some cases of wanton waste. I have a letter 'before me which illustrates my point. It is from tlie town clerk of the municipality of Holroyd, near Parramatta. It states.[ am directed to bring under your notice the matter of the dismantling of the military cam]) as Prospect (erected for the use uf United States of America troops) and the removing of materials to a camp at Schofields, and to request that you be so good as to have the matter investigated, as the council considers that the work being carried out is a scandalous waste of money and that the camp could have been made use of. for the British forces. The electrical installation alone for the camp, which was carried out by the council for the Allied Works Council, eost'f 3,281 9s. 4d., and in addition there were some miles of roads constructed and a large number of kitchens erected. From observations of the condition of the material after dismantling, it is considered that a large portion of it w ill not be f it to be used in any other project, and the council feels that the matter should be probed wit h a view to ascertaining whether or not public moneys have been wantonly expended in the matter. That camp wa3 never used at all, yet a new camp is being built and some of the materials are being taken from the Prospect camp, so that they may be used at a camp elsewhere. mendation ? do not know, but I strongly suspect that this is being done at the expense of the Australian taxpayers. I draw the attention of the House to this authenticated case. The council concerned did the contract work in connection with the roads and installations. I was pleased to hear the reference by the honourable member for Cook( Mr Sheehan) to the Glen Davis project. He advised that the Government should enlist the aid of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in order to convert the Glen Davis venture from a losing to a paying proposition. I remember that, not many years ago, when members of the party now in power were the Opposition, they declared that the failure at Glen Davis was due to the political control exercised by the government of the day. I agree that all advice and assistance available to the Government should 'be utilized, so that that project, which is vital to the civil life of the community, should be placed on a satisfactory basis. Other matters of serious moment have been referred to in the Governor-'General's Speech, but, as legislative proposals in respect of them are forecast, we shall have an opportunity later to discuss them. The Speech of His Royal Highness was a well-considered review of Australian affairs, and also gave a forecast of the Government's plans for the immediate future and for the post-war years. No well-based exception could be taken to any item in the 'Speech. I join with His Royal Highness in paying a tribute to our valorous fighting men on land, on the sea, and in the air. These young men, like those of other nations, were drawn into a conflict which was none of their making. They have acquitted themselves nobly, and, by their great",34,Eraser

81,Mr Wilson' (Wimmera) [4.44],"sacrifices, we in this country have been able to carry on our ordinary way of life; such changes as have been imposed on us are slight, in comparison with what has been endured by people of other countries engaged in the conflict. I join with other honourable members in welcoming to Australia Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. His Majesty the King has honoured us by appointing the Duke of Gloucester as Governor General of this country, and I am confident that the appointment will prove to be one of great historical importance. I hope that the Duke and Duchess and their family will have a, very happy time here, and I am confident that, when they return to Great Britain, they will, like many of their predecessors, become ambassadors of goodwill for Australia. I pay a well-deserved tribute to our Allies in this war, and to our Mother Country, Great Britain. The leadership of Great Britain has been inspiring. When I was there nearly two years ago, I saw for myself the scars which war had left on that historic land. I saw something of what the people had endured, and even while I was there I saw what they had to put up with in the way of air raids. We in this country can be proud of the stock from which we have sprung. Doubts have been expressed during this debate as to whether the peace settlement at, the conclusion of the war will be a just one. I have no fears in that respect. I am sure that our great ally, Russia, is not, seeking to grasp anything to which it is not entitled. The sacrifices which Russia, has made in this war have not, been exceeded by any other country fighting on our side. The history of the last twenty yea rs shows that there is solid ground for believing that whatever undertakings are given by Russia will be honoured in full. As for the United States of America, that great democracy of the new world, we need not fear that it will be rapacious when the peace settlement is being framed. All the gestures of the United States of America in the course of this war have been co-operative. Indeed, it has set a new standard of co-operation by instituting the system of lend-lease, by which a helping hand was extended to all Mr TFt/son. the Allies engaged in this struggle for civilization. There is much to be said for a continuation, at least in principle, of the system of lend-lease after the war in order to assist in the work of reconstruction, and to bring about a better system of trade and exchauge between the nations of the world. There are great possibilities inherent in this principle, which was inaugurated by the United States of America, and expressed in the various lend-lease agreements. The co-operation between the Allies has set a standard which governments and Parliaments throughout the whole world might with ' advantage seek to attain. When I witness the wrangling which occurs in our own Parliament between the various political parties I feel that it is to be deplored, particularly in time of war. For my part, I have always given credit where credit was due; that has heen my attitude to all governments and this might well be done at this time by honourable members on both sides of the House. I deplore the tirades which are delivered purely for political gain, and to discredit an opposing political party. I look back'to the early stages of the war, when the party which is now in power was in Opposition, and I have this to say: The co-operation then given by the Opposition party compares more than favourably with that received by the present Government from the present Opposition. When the war is over we shall have a splendid opportunity to develop Australia and to make of it a better country in which to live than it has been in the past. We shall have an opportunity to be realists, to sweep aside all considerations which impede development. I hope tliat we shall never again hear the cry, ""Where is the money to come from?"" I hope that we shall never again hear that the country cannot afford to bring migrants here, or to give social security to the people. When we remember the immense sums of money that have been found for the carrying on of the war which, economically, has involved nothing but destruction, surely it is within our ability to devise ways and means financially to do those things which are necessary for the development of the country and the economic security of our citizens. To-day, our entire economy is out of balance because we have had to throw all our resources into the winning of the war. We have had to supply our troops and those of our Allies with goods of all sorts, and as' a result civilians have had to put up with many inconveniences. We have had to go without & good many things, but if we count our blessings we can still say that we are better off than many of our Allies. We have been scarcely touched by the war itself. We have not had bombs bursting on our capital cities, nor have we experienced the devastation that has been wrought in many European countries. We have not thousands of our women and children crippled and maimed for life by enemy action. It is true that we have had to send forth to fight our battles a very large proportion of our able-bodied men. population, Australia has made a great contribution to the war effort of the Allies. During my travels in other parts of the world two years ago, I found nothing but admiration for what Australia had achieved, and for the men of our fighting forces. Wherever our men went they were admired for their exemplary conduct. As I have said, our economy is unbalanced, and I regret that, instead of getting the help and co-operation that we might expect from certain sections, they are exploiting existing conditions for political ends. They are pressing on the irritated nerves of those who are suffering inconveniences, and saying that all their troubles are due to government interference. There is much talk of bureaucracy and of bureacrats, as if the existence of the bureaucrats were responsible for the inconveniences which we have to suffer. That is a cheap gibe. The fact is that we have had to organize the country for war, and in thousands of cases powers have had to be delegated. Directional controls of all sorts have had to be assumed. This condition of affairs will pass with the coming of peace, as was explained in the Speech of the Governor General. But I recommend that, insofar as controls are necessary for the winning of the war, and to prevent the exploitation of the people, we should go carefully; they should he relaxed gradually as economic conditions permit. As the representative of a country electorate, I have been gravely, exercised in my mind because in country areas there is no prospect of useful employment for young people, no opportunity for providing them with careers. Due to economic conditions, the great capital cities have become industrial centres and the country has been utterly neglected industrially. If existing economic conditions be allowed to continue, this state of affairs will be perpetuated and even accentuated. If we are to have decentralization of industry and redistribution of population-and we must have these reforms-som e form of control will be necessary, and we must he prepared to pay the price for what we want. We must make it possible for industries to be established in the country on an equal Considering the smallness of its economic footing with those situated in the large centres of population. Surely we cannot allow a system to continue which denudes the countryside of population and concentrates it in a few large cities around the coast. I hope that ' the Government realizes that that policy will not spell safety for Australia. If we are to keep our young people in the country, we must establish industries there.. I believe that this fact is recognized by the Government-a t least, I hope sobut it is not sufficient to understand these problems; the Government must show courage, and take what action it considers necessary to correct the position. Nearly every honourable member who has spoken in this debate has referred to the need for additional population. Various remedies have been suggested. I am not one who believes that by following certain lines of action that have been suggested by some honourable members larger families will result, but the suggestion of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) that marriage loans should be provided does appeal to me. I regard it as a sound and practical proposal. From our own experience in the early years of our married lives and from our contacts with the present generation of young married folk we know that the only obstacle to young couples marrying and rearing children is economic insecurity-thei r inability to afford to do so. is no doubt in my mind that if substantial marriage loans and decent housing were provided, the objective which we all believe to be most desirable would be realized. history contradict everything that the honourable member has said on that subject. honourable member. Totalitarian countries have proved that the granting of marriage loans and other incentives has improved the birth-rate and increased their population. I am no admirer of totalitarian governments, but we can learn some lessons from them. That is one lesson that we can learn. at the Government -benches, I am inclined to think that we have learned too much from totalitarian countries. have been suggested have general acceptance, but we have to ask ourselves whether this Parliament has power to give effect to them. The powers of the Commonwealth Parliament are limited by the Constitution. The State parliaments derive their power from the Crown; they have unwritten constitutions which have practically no limitations. able member is quite wrong. again. The powers of this Parliament are heartily on having brought forward limited to those which were transferred to it when the federation was formed. Time after time, when we have wanted to do something for the development of Australia, we have found that our powers are too limited to do so. That fact has been admitted by honourable members on both sides of the chamber. The regrettable fact is that when the party in office asks for additional powers, the party in opposition does its utmost to prevent those powers from being obtained. That is done regardless of tbe nature of the powers sought. The game of party politics has been played so successfully that every effort towards progress by constitutional alterations has been neutralized. members always occupy uneasy seats on the fence. to disregard the interjections of the honourable member for Barker, who has a reputation for being a mischievous interjector whom no one takes very seriously. I hope that some administration-preferabl y the Government now in office-wil l again seek additional powers. I have always believed in a more unified form of government than now exists; in my opinion, the present division of powers as between Commonwealth and .States is undesirable. I know that it is to the advantage of certain monopolistic interests in this country to play one government off against another. Adopting a policy of "" divide and rule"", they make progress impossible. These people remain on the box seat and prevent movements which would: benefit Australia. I welcome the proposals for banking reform outlined by His Royal Highness. As honourable memlbers know, I have frequently advocated proposals similar to those which are now before the House. Despite the hue and cry that has been raised by private interests, the fact remains that they are concerned only about their ability to make profits and their control of the monetary system. They know that whoever controls the tically controls that country's destiny. I congratulate the Government most its banking proposals, and I believe that what happened on a former occasion, when the Commonwealth Bank was created, will happen again.; the hue and cry will di© down, and the people will realize that the legislation has not produced dire results, but, on the contrary, has been instrumental in furthering the progress and welfare of Australia. I see in this proposal a prospect of the effective repatriation and rehabilitation of the men and women of the services.

89,Mr Wilson,"The House can affordand State Governments in regard to land settlement, particularly of men now with the fighting services, and that a tentative agreement had practically been arrived at. I am glad to note that the Government hopes to avoid some of the errors which were made after the last war in connection with land settlement men. have been again called up for service schemes. I am pleased that it is proposed not only to settle servicemen in suitable areas, buit also to prepare the land until it has been brought to the stage of production. When that stage has been reached there is to be a revaluation of the holding; the Commonwealth and State Governments will write off any excess valuation, and will share the losses. That difficulties when it is trying to do the is a good start, and should do much to ensure success for the men who will settle on the land. I hope that the scheme which has been outlined will be proceeded with. Indeed, I am concerned that greater progress has not already been made, because numbers of men have been discharged from the services and desire to bargain sale prices. In the services are settle on the land. It would appear that little, if anything, has been done, to acquire land and prepare it for settlement gest that some of these factories should by servicemen. 1 hope that this work will be accelerated, and that the Minister servicemen, to be conducted by them on a for Dedman) and the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) will co-operate in this matter, and will approach the States with a view to the preparations being expedited. There is a general outcry throughout the country because of the great shortage of houses. The situation is most pronounced in the metropolitan districts. I sympathize with those who cannot get homes and are forced to live in cramped quarters, particularly young couples who cannot start their married life in a home of their own but are compelled by circumthat the Government will examine all of stances to live with parents or friends. I do not feel called upon to take the Government to task for not making men and materials available for building bouses, because I know only too well how difficult is the situation confronting the of vocational training. Indeed, the numGovernment. In my opinion, it would be helpful if all honourable members were to tell the people the truth, namely, that imposed, or whether the Government is the demands of the war are so great that labour and materials cannot be spared for home-building. When we consider the demands being made on our resources by the presence in Australia of units of the British Navy and other armed forces of Great Britain; when we remember that our commitments in this connection amount to £21,000,000 for the current year; when we reflect that thousands of with the Civil Constructional Corps, surely we will not say that these commitments to the British authorities should not have been entered into, and should be repudiated? Unfortunately, instead of telling the people the truth, there are some people who try to make political capital out of the Government's right thing. I have been wondering what the Government proposes to do with many of the factories which it has acquired during the war. I hope that it will not hand them over to private enterprise at many thousands of men who have come from all trades and professions. I sugbi: handed over to groups of returned Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr co-operative basis. That would be one way to repatriate and establish them in the post-war world. Some of the men will settle on the land, and others will find employment in industry as workers, because they will choose to do so. Again, others will be ambitious, and we should do everything in our power to help them. Rather than hand over these factories at bargain prices to private enterprise, we should endeavour to enlist the support of the State governments so as to operate the factories on a co-operative basis of Commonwealth and State ownership. Many avenues can be explored, and I hope them for the purpose of deciding the best course to adopt in the circumstances. Figures which were released recently indicate that only a very small proportion of servicemen have availed themselves ber is-so remarkably small that I am led to wonder whether some limit has been unable to accept more trainees. If that be the case, steps should be taken immediately to increase the opportunities for giving training to much larger numbers of servicemen. As I had hoped that, by this time, 10,000 men would be trained in trades and professions, I was most disappointed to learn that the number was only a little more than 1,000. This figure should he "" stepped up "" without delay, and every effort should be made to teach servicemen trades and professions. B y that means, we shall be able to repay a debt which we owe to our servicemen. young men who had not been trained in civil occupations prior to their enlistment. They should be taught a trade or profession before we lose hold of them. They should be equipped to perform some usef u l aud skilful occupation, instead of being condemned to be merely hewers of wood and drawers of water. Since the outbreak of war, Australian workmen have constructed a number of vessels. Having seen some of them in various States, I know that they are a credit to the men who built them. The 9,000-ton vessels, which are adapted for the overseas trade, are fine ships. Smaller vessels of various types have also been built. Later, I may ask a question for the purpose of ascertaining how many ships have been constructed in this country since the outbreak of war. The important fact is that the shipbuilding industry has been re-established here. Pounded during the last war, the industry continued for a short period after 1918, but was sabotaged, and the ships were sold or given away. In that manner the shipbuilding industry in Australia was destroyed. I sincerely hope that during the next few years the Commonwealth Government w ill avoid a repetition of that disastrous policy. I propose lo read to the House extracts from a pamphlet relating the history of the establishment of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and its demise after the last war. this short review, honourable members w ill learn some facts which w ill bring home to them a valuable lesson. The shipping nf any nation is an indication of its strength in peace or war. sion of time granted.] The wonderful advancement of British shipping was the foundation for the greatness of the Sir. Wilson. British Empire. If we desire to safeguard our future, we must recognize the soundness and wisdom of the policy of developing shipbuilding, and carrying to all parts of the world not only our own produce but also the goods of other countries. If we are ever again threatened with invasion, and I regret that we cannot dismiss that possibility, our position w ill be greatly strengthened by our possessing a large fleet of ships. I have in mind particularly the To-day, one of the great difficulties of the Allies arises from the shortage of shipping. Transport by sea w ill never be replaced by any other form of transport. It w ill always be the cheapest method of carrying bulk goods. What happened to the Australian shipping line after the last war is related in the pamphlet to which I referredIf the exploitation of shippers had been intense before tlie war it was now unbearable. Soon after war broke out, the shipping companies humped up freight Tates from £2 7s. 6d. a ton to £5 5s. a ton, notwithstanding the fact that the Imperial Government had shouldered the burden of war risk. In May, 191.6, one member of Parliament told honourable members that: "" Owing to the enormous increase in freights the returns from one short voyage had been sufficient to cover the cost of a vessel previous to the war, and a vessel valued at £7,000 before the war now sold for £47,000."" One typical example of piracy on the high seas was quoted: "" While the value of the cargo (maize) was .£18,220, the freight was £50,443, or 200 per cent, 'higher than the value of the cargo."" (Hansard, Vol. 88, page 1.1,008.) The freight on wheat rose from £1 Ss. a ton to £1 10s. per ton to £15 per ton. That occurred during the last war. In this war, the rise in rates has not been quite so sharp, but it has been bad enough. Freight on the transport of wheat has risen. In 1940, the freight was approximately £1 15s. a ton. During the next couple of years, the figure rose to £6 15s. a ton. As the British Government is carrying the war risk, there is no justification for such a From big increase. The figure has been fixed by the British Ministry of War Transport, an executive body which consists largely of shipping magnates. In Australia, the position has been relieved [Extensomewhat through tlie representations of the present Commonwealth Government, and a reduction of about 15s. a ton has been made, bringing the rate to £6 a ton. The article continuesI n Britain, Lord Inchcape had formed the "" Shipping Conference"" to keep all British Government ship-building, which offers a most ship-owners in line.

Those fifteen boats, built between 1900 and 1915, and averaging dustry in Australia, subsequent to the found3,500 to 4,500 tons apiece, became known as ing of tlie Commonwealth Line.

The third method of warfare against the Fleet was to get members of Parliament who were "" sympathetic"" towards the "" Conference "" to press for its employment in places where _i t would not only ,be removed from competition with the Monopoly, but in addition would operate at a heavy loss. At the latter end of 1921 Lord Inchcape caibled an offer to the Government to either purchase the Commonwealth ships on behalf of the "" Conference "" or to sell the combine's own ships engaged in the Australian trade to tlie Commonwealth Line. This offer was debated in Parliament and turned down. Up to that time the propaganda of the monopolists had apparently had little effect. The President of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce eulogized the Fleet and referred to the debt of gratitude owing to it by all business men. A Farmers' Conference, then in session, instructed country representatives in Parliament to object to any siile. Fifteen months later, in February, 1923, the Bruce-Page Ministry came into otiice. The interests represented in this Government were closely interwoven with English banking, shipping, and insurance companies. Things looked brighter for Lord Inchcape and Co. Bruce had barely dusted the Treasury Bench with the seat of his Savile Row trousers before he announced, ""he did not think that what had been done by the Commonwealth Line justified its continuation as a Government venture "". .Soon: afterwards he produced a financial statement purporting to outline the situation of the Fleet. Long association with the importing and warehousing concern of Patcrsou, Laing and Bruce had taught him how to manipulate price tickets, and the urbane Mr Bruce had no trouble in converting an actual gain of £2 million into a bookkeeping loss of £3 million, to impress the bovine back-<benchers and the loobies in the lobby. He followed this up w i th a B ill "" to remove the Fleet from Parliamentary control "". Under this measure both the Fleet arid the Dockyards were handed over to a Commonwealth Shipping Board, which had power to dispose of any of its assets, subject only to the approval of the Treasurer, S. M . (""Spats"") Br.uce. In return for the property received, the Commonwealth Shipning Board was obliged to issue debentures to Bruce for £4| million, bearing interest at 5%. Br.uce, as Treasurer, mortgage over the Line, which could be foreclosed at any time in the event of the Board dtffau-ltiiig on its interest Mr Wilson. Lord Inchcape rubbed his hands and chuckled w i th senile glee. To pay the interest bill on its debentures the Board would have to raise freight rates, which would bring it into line with the Monopoly. If it failed to do this and defaulted on its obligations, Bruce would seize the Line and sell it up. To make doubly sure that the Line could not carry on, it was saddled with a highly paid and superfluous executive and subjected to crushing taxation. The ships began to be sold. Bruce carried on like a mad floorwalker at a remnant sale. The eleven remaining Austral ships, whose market value was £550,000, were sold up for £248,000. Bruce valued the ex-enemy vessels at £197,000. The British Government valued them at £337,000. He finished up paying the British Government something like £3.10,000 to gain a clear title to these ships, which were then sold for what they would fetch, mostly scrap iron prices. The"" D "" boats, which cost £271,000 to build, were sold for £84.000, aud the "" E "" boats, which cost £2,000,000, were given away for £380,500. By the beginning of 1927 all that was left of the once proud Commonwealth Fleet were the five "" B a j ' "" liners and the two "" D a l e "" boats. These seven ships were the"" pick of the Fleet and even Bruce dare not sell them out of hand. The tactic of setting ii|p a Public Accounts Committee, to advise on their retention or disposal, \v,as resorted to. In May, 1927, this Committee reported"" No t only has the Commonwealth Line been responsible for actual reductions in freight, but the presence of the Line has exercised a material restraining influence against proposed increases. The Committee, therefore, recommends that in the interest* of Australia the Line be continued"". This, of course, was just the opposite to what Bruce wanted.. He then fell back on the method of tendering evidence' in camera, a device often used by employers in the Arbitration Court, when some particular judge finds their arguments in favour of wage reductions a littl e abstruse. The Chairman and four other Bruce-Page appointees to the Board were called on to interview the Public Accounts Committee behind closed doors. Nobody knows what transpired at this stage, only the people concerned. But the upshot was that in November, 1927, the Committee reversed its previous finding and urged that the Line be disposed of. ""Bruce announced that he would sell what was left to the ""Shipping Conference"".

The ships went overseas, to augment ' the tonnage of the "" Conference but all that Australia received was the first instalment of £580,000. Lord Kylsant, who handled the business for the "" Conference"", very conveniently went bankrupt, and Australia now has neither ships nor money. I urge the Government to continue ship-building, and to constitute the ships that we have already built in the name of, and for, the Commonwealth into another Commonwealth Line of Steamers. It should augment that fleet by constructing improved ships in its own yards. A government-owned and controlled line of vessels is required to enable Australia to enter the carrying trade. By such a policy we shall strengthen ourselves as a nation, and do much in the interest of our own defence in the future. I trust that the Government will cont'.nue its policy of stabilized prices for primary products. As a representative of the primary producers, I realize that that policy presents the only safe line of action for the future. I hope that we in this country shall never be obliged again to rely upon the fluctuations and vagaries of over=eas prices which are manipulated by certain interests. The Government should continue its policy of guaranteed prices for all primary products, particularly dairy products, wheat and wool. With regard to wool, I hope that the Government will never revert to the auctioning system which lent itself to all sorts of abuses. To-day, we have in operation a system which is developing towards protection, so far as classification and selling are concerned. The Government should continue that scheme. Reference has been made to what has been described by the honourable member steal"". Naturally, I do not agree with the views expressed by the honourable member and those who support him in his contention. In fact, I was the first honourable member in this House to ask for an assurance from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) that whatever the difference might be between the concessional price for stock feed and the average price of wheat for home consumption and export, it would be made good to the farmer. I received that assurance, and I repeated to other honourable members, and I know that the Government will honour it. Therefore, I refuse to join in any party political propaganda on this matter designed to mislead the farmers and to turn them against the policy of the Government. But I am not entirely satisfied with the present price which, we are told, is to be paid for next season's wheat, namely, a first advance of 4s. 3d. a bushel. All the indications point to the probability that the ultimate realizations should exceed 5s. a bushel. Why does not the Government come straight out and give the farmer 5s. a bushel for his wheat at harvest time? The wheat will probably realize that amount, if not more, on the markets of the world. No other section of industry has to wait for payment by instalments in this way in respect of its labour and products. In all other cases, moneys are raised, and cash is paid for work done, or for goods produced. I emphasize that if the Government wants to remove the cause of dissatisfaction which now exists among the wheat-growers, it should courageously announce that it will pay 5s. a bushel cash for wheat at the sidings next year, because it believes that the wheat will realize that price, and, therefore, the pool will not lose on the transaction. But even should the ultimate realization be less than 5s. a bushel, that payment is little enough to the farmer when one considers the increases of his costs of production in recent years, and the fact that he has to pay from one year's return the cost of carrving on through two years of drought. This places a tremendous strain",38,Cameron Th E Honor Monetary System Of Any Country Prac

92,"For Lndi ( Mr Mcewen) As The "" Wheat","on his resoairces. I urge the Government lo look carefully into that matter. I regret that the Government has given no indication whatever that it has any settled policy with regard to migration rcthis country. .Indeed, it does not appear to have even an interim policy. Any attempt to obtain landing permits to-day for persons wanting to come to Australia is met with the statement that the Government's policy has not been formulated, or that it is not the practice to issue permits. I know of several cases of people who want to come to Australia from the Old Country. They have already obtained exit permits from the United Kingdom and can arrange .passage on a cargo ship. These persons are eminently suitable as migrants. They are young, and nearly all of them have fiancees in Australia. However, their applications for permits are bluntly refused. If the Government is unable to determine upon a final policy in this matter it should formulate and announce an interim policy to meet cases of the kind I have mentioned. In conclusion, I again express my pleasure at the appointment of the King's brother, the Duke of Gloucester, as Governor General. I congratulate the Government on its banking proposals, which will have my full support. As lo other business to be submitted to the House, honourable members know that it is my practice to deal with all submissions on their merits, and I shall continue to do that. have listened to many of the speeches delivered in this debate. Some of the statements made have been particularly interesting, and some have been upsetting, to me. I wish at the outset to add my words of welcome to those already expressed to Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) expressed a doubt as to whether the words of welcome to Their Royal Highnesses expressed by the Prime Minister were concurred in by all government supporters. afraid to express his convictions. I have always considered that-we should have an Australian-born Governor General. But that does not mean that after an appointment has been made. I will not genuinely welcome the person appointed to the office. I trust that Their Royal Highnesses will have a happy and prosperous experience in Australia. I believe that they will leave this country, ultimately, better citizens of the Empire, because they will have learned something of and from the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), in his speech, referred to what he called the "" mopping-up "" operations in which the Australian troops are engaged in the Pacific. It is to be deplored that any one in the community can talk in that fashion about the work , that our men are doing in New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, and elsewhere. I have not been to those parts of the Pacific, but I know the tropical conditions of North Queensland very well. I know, also, what that country was like years ago, before so much of its heavy timber and scrub had been removed. Travelling conditions can be extremely difficult in such country, particularly in the wet season. The honourable member for Parramatta said that some of our soldiers to whom he had spoken were not satisfied with the role that had been allotted to them. I also have talked with numbers of our men who have returned to Australia on leave after participating in the present operations. I found them to be most resentful of hearing their essential service described as "" mopping up "". In my opinion, our men are fighting the very cream of the Japanese army, for they were the men who were sent to the front line of battle by Japan and were intended for the invasion of Australia. Those are the men against whom our troops have to fight. A noted Japanese writer, Ishu Maru, stated in his book, Why Japan must Fight Britain, that Japan would have to meet The honourable member and conquer singly, or, if need be, the combined British and American navies, otherwise it could not expect to succeed in a Pacific war. That writer was a highranking Japanese naval officer. We all know now that disaster for the JapaneseI am not one who is commenced in the battles for Guadalcanal, when they began to lose so many of their ships.

93,Mr Martens (Herbert) [5.46],"IJapanese navy is to-day, but I remember hearing William Winter or another American commentator speaking from San Francisco, suggest the construction of glass-bottomed submarines to take the Japanese leaders into the Pacific Ocean so that they could see where Japanese have to be exterminated from the Japanese navy is. Our men are to-day doing one of the stiffest jobs that any section of the allied forces has been called upon to undertake. They are engaged in a terrific struggle, and those who speak lightly of their work deserve the utmost condemnation. In the country where they are fighting so valiantly there arc millions of mosquitoes, and all kinds of creeping and crawling creatures. The work our men are doing has to be done, and those who are criticizing them should be ashamed of themselves. Wo all know that the American troops who went to Luzon said that they were very glad to get out of New Guinea and the Solomons because of the difficulties of the terrain and the shocking weather that is so commonly experienced there. General MacArthur and our own commanders know what a good job is being done by our boys. Those who talk lightly of this campaign cannot possibly appreciate the dangers of it. Moreover, it would be a disastrous thing for this country if the Japanese were allowed to remain in the nearby islands for any extended period. We do not desire a community of half-bred Japanese near cur shores. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) told us something of tlie deplorable standards of the half-bred Japanese in Western Australia. I consider the Japanese are among the worse people in the world. I do not know of one redeeming feature in them. I have held this opinion for many years; it is not a product of the war. The Japanese are a people of extremely low morals. I know very well that in the northern parts of this country many so called Japanese laundries are merely brothels. The Australian Labour party was not responsible for the coming of these people to Australia. The blame for that rests with the anti-Labour governments in power in Queensland years ago, for they were associated with the blackbirding that the Burns Philp crowd engaged in. It ill becomes gentlemen like the Leader of the Opposition to talk in a derogatory way about the '""'mopping up"" that our men are doing. The the Pacific Islands. No one realizes the necessity for that more than I do. Few, if any, honourable members of this House know what our boys are going through in their present campaign, or how many of them are making the supreme sacrifice. These so-called "" mopping-up"" operations are proving costly in every way. I pay tribute to the men. for the wonderful job they are doing in exterminating the Japanese. I shall be happy when the job is done. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) made a statement to the effect that if there had been no Russia there would have been no D-day. I say that if there had been no Britain there would have been no Russia. Too much is being said about what Russia has done, aud too little about what Britain has done. I have no desire to detract in any way from the .magnificent work of the Russian armies, but Stalin has admitted that if it had not been for the early assistance given to Russia by Britain and America in supplying aircraft and other essential war equipment Russia would have had a much more difficult struggle. The Germans made every effort to conquer Russia, but they did not succeed, and the essential help that Britain and America gave to Russia was a factor in the failure of Germany. But for the help that Britain and America gave to Russia the Russian people would have had a much more difficult straggle. The right honourable member for North Sydney is one of the last who should talk about the unsatisfactory equipment of this nation when the war started. I take no responsibility for -that state of affairs. We all know that anti-Labour governments were in office for many years before the war began, and they must take the responsibility for the failure to prepare the nation to defend itself. If those anti-Labour governments had considered it proper to prepare the nation for defence, they should have done it. They cannot now throw the responsibility on to other shoulders. They had a parliamentary majority which would have enabled them' to take action. Practically the only countries in the world that were prepared for war in 1939 were Germany and Japan, and they expected to secure a quick victory. I hope that our forces will ""finish off"" the enemy. There is one thing I am sorry about, and that is that so many Japanese prisoners are being taken. I do not think that we should take Japanese prisoners; they should he destroyed. That is all they are fit for. It is. a pity our men have to go out in small numbers to hunt the Japanese from foxholes and the like, and so have to risk being shot from machine-gun nests. The whole of the circumstances of the fight that is going on in the South-West Pacific make it extremely unfortunate that there should be talk of "" mopping-up "" operations. I hope that our men will go ahead, and do their utmost to destroy the Japanese. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) said, in effect, that our men were engaged in what could be described as "" charwoman's "" work. I was surprised to hear the honourable gentleman make such a remark. As a soldier he has won distinction on the battle-field, and it was unworthy of him to describe as charwoman's work the job that is being done to-day in the iSouthWest Pacific. I say, God help even those who have to do ordinary charwoman's work in that area. Soldiers on furlough to whom I have recently spoken very greatly resent such descriptions of the campaign in which they have been engaged. Some of these men I have known since they were boys, and they have made such remarks to me as: "" Mr Martens, it is an awful thing that we have to do this job; but we know that it has to be done. We would not like to ask any one else to do it "" . I say: "" God bless every one of the boys fighting in this area, and may they come safely through"". I hope that we shall hear no more about "" mopping up "". When the then honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) made a remark some years ago to the effect that it might be a good thing if a few bombs fell on the complacent crowds in our big cities, Mr Martens. I was greatly incensed; but I begin to wonder now whether there is not something in the idea. If some of those city people could spend a while in my electorate, and in that of the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), they would know what it feels like when the enemy drops a few "" eggs "". They would also know what it feels like to live in uncertainty as to whether a few more "" eggs "" might not fall upon them with very little notice. Something has been said about supplies failing to reach northern centres. I have no complaint to make against the Government on this account. I appreciate the difficulties of the situation. I know that the Government realizes the need to provide transport for equipment and supplies of one kind and another for the South-West Pacific forces, and it has heen doing the best it could do. Only recently Sir Thomas Gordon referred to the difficulties of transporting supplies. At times the authorities have been given to understand that an extra ship would be provided to run from a north Queensland port and"" provision has been made to use it to the best advantage, hut the sailing has often been cancelled at the last minute because of unforeseen circumstances. All this should be borne in mind before complaints are made. We, in Australia, have no grounds for grouch about the difficulties we encounter for our people, are not suffering hunger. But some of us remember that in the bad old days of anti-Labour governments many thousands of the Australian people were living on the dole. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. hardships which the people have to endure, I am satisfied that if they were bluntly told the truth they would be more contented. In the districts represented by the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) and myself, the people are suffering more than those who live in any other part of the Commonwealth because of the shortage of many of the commodities that they need, yet they are not squealing. To me, their forbearance is remarkable. They realize what their conditions would have been had Japan invaded Australia. Because of shipping",44,Cameron Th E Honor Monetary System Of Any Country Prac
94,Mr Martens!,"Despit e all thedifficulties, many things -which ought to go to north Queensland are not being sent there. The people understand that the available transport is being used to carry munitions, food, and equipment to our troops, and they do not protest unduly. I hear more complaints about shortages in Sydney and its environs than I do in my electorate. The people of Sydney hardly realize that a war is being waged. The transport authorities appeal to them not to use the trams and trains at peak hours, when they are required by others who are doing war work, yet from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. on any day of the week there is a continuous flow of traffic into and out of the heart of the city. Goodness knows what business the people have to transact ! If they cannot make purchases, they simply waste time. We are doing without many things, and the cause is not insufficient production; more is being produced to-day than at any previous stage in the history of Australia, and with less labour. I have no doubt that in the near future our friends opposite will strive in every way to gain a political advantage by arguing that the 'Government has been trying to socialize industry. If that were Belling an invader they have .to put up done, the object would be to avoid a scarcity of the necessaries of life. We do not want people to be deprived of their actual needs. In my electorate, an airstrip was completed hy the Allied Works Council on an area of land which three weeks prior to the commencement of operations was covered by a f orest of big timber. If the machinery which made that possible were put to other uses, it would displace a lot of labour. In the gathering of a potato crop there is a machine which can do as much work as many men, and if its use were widespread the difficulty under normal conditions would be to find employment for the human labour thus displaced. There is no reason whatever for us to fear the effects of telling the people the truth. Difficulties exist only because some people try to make party political capital. Falsehoods, or what are close to them, are told to the people in regard to many matters. They are informed, "" You could get these things, but the Government will not allow them to be transported"". They hear about boatloads of beer going to the north. I can recall such an occasion, but not within recent times. I know that there is a genuine difficulty in regard to the transport of commodities which the people need, to which they were accustomed, and which they ought to have. I challenge any one to prove that any government could provide better transport than exists at the moment. No one is suffering much by having to go without certain things. I do not know of any hungry people. The majority are to-day living as well as or better than they were before the war. I have heard a good deal in this House about the hardship occasioned by the impressment of homes. In my electorate there are properties which were taken over by the Royal Australian Air Force years ago. The people who own them receive less from the Government by way of rent than they are paying for the cottage they are renting from some one else, yet they are not squealing very much. Naturally, they would like to return to their own homes; but the view that they take is that, as the choice lay between occupying their homes and rewith the inconvenience to which they have been subjected. In regard to housing generally, perhaps something could be done in the direction of home construction on a substantial scale; but the department which handles the matter is at its wits' end to find the labour that is necessary to provide what is needed by the British forces in Australia. Does any honourable member believe that the Government should not do what it is doing for the British personnel? Yet that is the only suggestion that could be made in opposition to what is being done at the present time. If the available material is to be used for the construction of houses, others will be denied things that they need. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) referred this afternoon to the shifting of a camp site. I asked him by way of interjection to give some information in regard to the matter, but he said that he could not do so. I wanted to know who had suggested the shifting of this camp. If it were of the size that he suggested-whic h I do not dispute-it seems passing strange to me that with the modern roads that we have an additional 8 or 10 miles would make any difference to the personnel of the British or any other forces, and they could well have used the camp already established. my point. suggested its removal, or why it was done. the collar in that regard.

98,Mr Martens,"That does not cut even then it has to be interstate inshould ask the 'Co-ordinator-iGeneral of Works, Sir Harry Brown, to give deep and earnest consideration to the value of such a bridge to Australia at any time, but particularly in a time of war. As I have said, a new high-level bridge should not be built where the present low-level bridge now crosses the river. Political gerrymandering by vested interests in Townsville was responsible for its having been placed where it now is. That was not uncommon in those days. The political history of every State contains instances of similar happenings, in the attempt to secure votes and win seats. The Burdekin bridge is built over a wide stretch of river, and is very low. Twelve miles or so up tlie river, Nature has prodevelopment in Queensland, but it must vided a crossing known, as The Rocks, where there is a solid foundation on which a bridge that would be open in all weathers could be constructed, because it would not be affected by floods. The matter should be seriously considered. Another cause for concern is the enormous volume of water that is flowing to waste down the Burdekin River, and all the other rivers of northern Queensland, at the moment. I am not qualified to express an opinion on the scheme of irrigation propounded by Dr. Bradfield, but I know what its value would be if it could be given effect. An enormous volume of water is carried by the Herbert, Johnstone, and Tully rivers. These waters would be of inestimable benefit if they could be harnessed for the use of man, in a part of Australia which is regarded as almost desert. In the Mildura area, and on the opposite side of the river Murray at Barmera and Berri, there is magnificent agricultural country which was a dreary waste before the adoption of irrigation. If the major portion of the water which goes over those gorges in northern Queensland could he diverted into central Australia, a wonderful result would be achieved. I have heard the objection raised that the cost would be £30,000,000 or £40,000,000. That is the cost which has to be met every minute to fight the war, and the result of it is only destruction and desolation. We should consider not the £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 necessary to create the asset, but the value of the asset to the Commonwealth after its creation. He would be a shrewd and wellinformed man who could determine that value, but I know that irrigation engineers contend that the scheme is practicable. Dr. Bradfield's proposals for dealing with the dust bowl of Australia are well worth immediate consideration. Money expended in that direction would be used for a constructive, and not a destructive, purpose. I recall tliat when a proposal was advanced for an irrigation and water conservation scheme in the Dawson Valley, certain roads and other initial work were constructed, and then the whole project was abandoned. There are vast areas of excellent land within easy access of the coast awaiting be provided with irrigation facilities. The Burdekin Delta, in the Ayr and HomeH ill districts, is intensely cultivated, but the excellent results obtained in that district are due to the ample water supply. On one occasion I mentioned that the average rainfall in a part of my electorate was 5 or 6 yards a year. Some honourable members laughed at the remark, but the statement was literally true. During the present year, more than 4 yards of rain has already fallen in parts of my electorate. It is regrettable to see huge volumes of water run into the sea to waste, when its application to fertile land, where the rainfall is limited, would produce astonishing results. If we are to increase the population of Australia, whether by natural increase or by immigration, we shall have to provide suitable employment for the people. Young people should be given every encouragement to marry and raise families, but every effort should be made to ensure to them economic security. The basic wage was originally fixed on the basis of what would be required to enable a man and his wife, with one or two children, to enjoy a reasonable standard of comfort, but no margin was allowed to enable a married couple to save any portion of their income. The important factor is not the amount of the wage, but its purchasing power, and it should be fixed at a level which would enable the workers to provide ample food and clothing and the ordinary amenities of life for their wives and families. [Extension of time granted.] I was delighted to know that a conference of Unrra had been held at Lapstone, near Sydney, for the purpose of discussing matters of international concern and in an endeavour to provide food for the people in devastated countries. J welcome conferences of that nature. This nation has been too parsimonious in its dealings with its public men. I consider that a salary of £1,000 a year is too meagre for a member of this Parliament. SinceI became a member of this House in the latter part of 1928, tlie opportunities provided for honourable members to visit various parts of the Commonwealth have been too limited, although it is necessary for us to make personal contact with the people throughout the continent, in order to appreciate their problems. Two or three weeks are occupied in a visit to Western Australia, and from four to six weeks are absorbed in a visit to the Northern Territory. It is regrettable that the most rapid form of transport is not made available to enable us to obtain first-hand information regarding the needs of the people. In certain parts of"" the electorates represented by the honourable member for Kennedy and myself the country is more beautiful than people living in the southern areas of Australia imagine. I suggest that people in the southern States who need a holiday should take a winter trip to Ravenshoe and the Tully Falls. I certainly advise them not to leave their top coats at home, because those resorts have an elevation above sea level of 3,300 feet. Atherton Palmerston lands, offer great scope for further development. there at present is of only a limited nature, but with the assistance of the genius of man, which could be rendered through the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the settlers could be advised as to the best methods of cultivation to adopt. For the last five or six years I have endeavoured to have the telephonic communication provided in the Palmerston area improved. About 100 children attend the local school, but the nearest telephone is 4i miles distant and can be reached only by means of a bridle Mr Martens. track. The settlers have hewn their homes out of the forest. They have built shacks with split logs, and they live under hard conditions. The Government should at least endeavour to improve their living conditions by providing them with a telephone service and good roads. I claim that the conditions under which the outback settlers live is a matter of concern to the Commonwealth as well as to the State authorities. If I had my own way, I should abolish the State Parliaments to-morrow, because I consider that they should not be given the right to dictate to this Parliament. As long as the States retain their sovereign powers this Parliament will remain a hobbled giant. I recall no referendum of the people on the subject of conferring increased powers upon the Commonwealth Parliament at which there has not been a bitter fight between the Opposition and the government of the day on the questions at issue. Bogies have always been raised, whilst the importance of the interests of Australia as a whole has been overlooked. Always State rights have prevailed. I believe that the 'Commonwealth Parliament should be clothed with plenary powers. It should have control of all transport and of all other matters which are of nation-wide importance. We have been told that Commonwealth public servants cannot conduct public utilities, but there is no better conducted instrumentality than the Postal Department. join with other speakers in the welcome The extended to Their Royal Highnesses the Tablelands, and also the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, and we trust that their stay amongst us will be The settlement a happy one. In the Speech of the Governor General, reference was made to many important legislative proposals that will be brought to the notice of the House in the near future. I feel impelled to take part in this debate because of the comments offered by the Opposition regarding the disposition and use of Australia's fighting forces. Some honourable members opposite who set themselves up as military strategists recently told us where the Australian troops, which are known throughout the world as one of the greatest fighting forces in the Allied",48,Cameron Th E Honor Monetary System Of Any Country Prac
99,Mr Mcleod (Wannon) [8.27],"Iservices to-day, should be employed. It ill-becomes those who are not competent to judge to say where those forces could be used to the best advantage. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) seemed to have no difficulty in telling us what he would do with them. ""With a wave of the hand, he said that they should have taken part in the campaign in the Philippines. employ them in the capture of Malaya, and send them into Burma; but there must be some limit to their capacity. I wonder whether it has ever dawned on these military strategists that the war against Japan is only just beginning, and that it might not be wise to throw all our forces into the struggle now without making provision for their reinforcement and supplies for perhaps another two years, I sometimes wonder from which military academy these selfappointed critics graduated. I imagine that it must be situated in close proximity to the Constitutional Club, and that when they become mellow over a glass of whisky and a good cigar, they tell one another what they would do if they were in General MacArthur's place. Some of them had an opportunity at the beginning of the war to show what they could do, and they did not make a conspicuous success of it. As an Australian I resent the suggestion that our forces are engaged upon mopping-up operations only. I should like to see some of the critics fighting alongside them for even six days, let alone six months. They would quickly alter their opinion of the nature of the operations upon which our men are engaged. Our forces are fighting desperate men-cornere d men, and we know the characteristics of the Japanese soldiers in such circumstances. There are, perhaps, 100,000 Japanese in the islands to the north. They are obviously in good condition, and well supplied with weapons, ammunition and food. We do not know what might happen if they are allowed to remain in occupation. It is even possible that Rabaul might still be used as a base for Japanese warships. It is. better that Rabaul and other such places in the north should be in our hands. After the Japanese are cleaned out of territories which are the responsibility of Australia, our forces will, no doubt, go on to more spectacular victories, but the campaigns might prove to ibe easier than that upon which they are now engaged. The enemy in the north is well dug in. The nature of the country prevents our forces from using heavy artillery barrages. Conditions also forbid the use of such modern instruments of warfare as heavy tanks and flameThen, he would throwers. For warfare of this kind, specially trained men are needed. As a matter of fact, there are not so many troops in the world, apart from the Australians, with the ability, training and initiative for such a job. Our men are trained, jungle fighters. Another thing which disturbs me is tlie attack which has recently been made upon the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces, General Sir Thomas Blarney, and it is hard to say whether the attack is inspired by hostility to him or merely out of a desire to ""belt"" the Government. I am not a personal friend of General Sir Thomas Blarney. I was a digger in the last war when he was an officer holding high rank. What is the reason for this criticism of the Commander-in-Chief? Senator Foil attacked him recently in the Senate. He has been attacked in the newspapers, and last night the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), while he did not make an overt attack upon the Commander-inChief, he suggested that it would be better for Australia and for all concerned if he resigned. As I say, I do not know the motive behind these attacks, but I know that in the last .war General Sir Thomas Blarney was one of the most capable staff officers we had. It used to he the custom on the Western Front, when our forces were attacking, to put down an artillery barrage, and then for our infantrymen to advance in its wake until they met the enemy's counter barrage. This practice was followed in the battle of Ypres, and resulted in a terrible loss of men. I was only a digger, but even I criticized General Haig for persisting in such tactics. Of course, it is the prerogative of the soldier to criticize and grumble. General Sir Thomas Blarney, who was a staff officer at that time, had a great deal to do with devising the tactics which were eventually applied successfully on the 8th August. very .black for the Allies at that time. Indeed, it was thought that we might have to evacuate France. At first, the new proposals were opposed by the British military authorities, but eventually the British approved of them. The tactic employed then was something entirely new, and proved to be very successful. It was employed by General Sir Thomas Blarney with complete success in the present war, resulting in the saving of many lives. In the last war the Australian commanders matched the German generals, and defeated them. ""When General Sir Thomas Blarney returned to Australia from the Middle East, a military board, was in charge here, but he was placed in supreme command of the Australian forces. He went to New Guinea at a time when our forces were falling back. He took over during the campaign of the Kokoda Trail, and from then on, it was the Japs who fell back. I have yet to learn that General Sir Thomas Blarney has suffered defeat in battle when leading his troops. If , under his command, our forces had suffered grave reverses and heavy losses, there might be some justification for the criticism directed against our present Commander-inChief,j his direction of the campaigns in tlie north, in conjunction with General MacArthur, complete success and a loss of men. For this he is deserving of credit, not criticism. reputation as a staff officer stands very high. It is said that he can size up a military situation even by flying over the country. The charge has been made against him that he is too old. As a matter of fact, he is about the same age as General MacArthur. It has been said that he does not spend enough time with his troops. I remember seeing photographs taken during the battles of Salamaua and Buna, which showed General Sir Thomas Blarney amongst the frontline troops, and at the time. I thought it was not right that a man, whose life was so valuable to his country, should take such risks It must be remembered that he is responsible for maintaining lines of communications right back to the base in Sydney or Melbourne, and it is necesThe situation was sary that he should spend a certain amount of time at head-quarters. If I know anything of. General Sir Thomas Blarney, he would be with his men all the time if it were possible. His interest is at all times with the front-line troops. What Commander-in-Chief right has Senator Foil to criticize the Commander-in-Chief? Senator Foil went to Malaya at the beginning of the war. It was before Japan came inotherwise he would probably not have been there. At the time he was Minister for Information in the Menzies Government. the Government. tribution to winning the war was to suggest that there should be a better news service. He did not suggest that aeroplanes should be sent to provide air cover for troops which might have to go there, although it was found subsequently that was what they needed more than anything else. One would think that so capable a military strategist as Senator Foil would have recognized that need. Even his department was in a chaotic state until it was taken over by the present Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell), under whose direction it has but become very useful to the services. It is certain that the unjustifiable criticism of General Sir Thomas Blarney can do has been marked by nothing but harm. Let the critics, if they minimum have anything against him, come out into the open and state their charges plainly. His Tn the meantime, let us judge the Commander-in-Chief on his record. I desire to emphasize the importance to Australia of the wool industry. I am sorry to have to say it, but I believe that people in other countries are more alive to the value of Australian wool than are Australians. I happen to grow a little wool myself, and as a ScotsmanI 'know that I do not get the full value for it. The marketing of Australian wool is nothing but a racket. This is the first government which has interested itself in the matter, and the Opposition, no doubt, will say that we should concentrate on the war effort, putting domestic affairs aside. Of course, they want us to procrastinate for as long as possible. Most of the social and economic",50,Cameron Th E Honor Monetary System Of Any Country Prac

101,Mr Lawson,He was sent there by,52,Cameron Th E Honor Monetary System Of Any Country Prac
102,Mr Mcleod,"That is so. His conills from which we are suffering may be traced to the procrastination of previous governments which took their directions from big, vested interests. It is the duty of the 'Government to protect the interests of the primary producers, and to see that they get value for what they produce. Prior to the war, buyers from all over the world came to Australia to buy our wool. It is the only commodity we produce that we have no trouble in selling, and no bounty on wool has ever had to he paid. We sell our wool in the grease on what is described as a free, open market, governed by the law of supply and demand. As a matter of fact, the law of supply and demand ceases to operate the moment the wool is outside the farmer's gate. He has no more say in its disposal and does not know whether or not the .buyers are genuine. In 1939, wool was sold at 2d. per lb. below the cost of production, yet the Government at that time took no steps to remedy the position. Wool is a most valuable commodity to Australia, and action to protect those who produce it. is necessary. Something in that direction was done after 1939, but, even then, the Parliament failed in its duty. Ultimately, the present Labour Government took the matter up with the Governmient of the United Kingdom, with the result that an increased, price for It is true that in the United States of wool was obtained, notwithstanding the protests of the Opposition in this Parliament. The Government would welcome the help of members of all parties 1 in its attempts to assist the wool industry. This is a matter of national importance. The production and processing of wool offers the best opportunity to provide employment after the war that this country possesses.' If only 1 per cent, of the total wool clip were processed in Australia, £3,500,000 per annum would be added to the amount Australia now receives for raw wool and employment would be provided for 2,000 people in the manufacturing industry. With that figure as a basis, it is easy to calculate the benefit to Australia of a policy which provided for the processing in Australia of 10 per cent, or 20 per cent, of the clip. I do not say that every pound of wool grown in Australia should be processed in this countryI realize that Australia must trade with other countries-'bu t we could with advantage manufacture 30 per cent, of the clip in Australia. The best minds in the comtmiunity should be engaged on means to protect tlie wool industry. Naturally, the wool-brokers and overseas buyers wish to see the open market for wool restored. I do not blame them, because that system has put millions of pounds into their pockets, and has enabled the wives of wool-buyers to wear diamonds, whereas the wives of the wool growers are lucky if they can purchase a string of beads costing. 5s. We must never revert to the open market for wool. By exporting greasy wool, freight has to be paid on worthless dirt. In that way thousands of pounds are lost each year. If we did no more than process the wool to the scouring stage, or spin it into tops, that would be an improvement; but we can do more than that. Australia could lead: the world in the production of high-quality woollen cloth if our efforts were concentrated in that direction. Climatic conditions in this country, together with the natural herbage in our pastoral areas, makes Australia most suitable for the production of merino and comeback sheep. No other country can compare with Australia in' the production of merino sheep. America there are large numbers of merino sheep, but the wool obtained from them has a much shorter staple than that obtained from Australian sheep. If we were to concentrate on the production of high-quality woollen cloth in Australia, we would have no. difficulty in selling it. We should strenuously avoid the manufacture, particularly for export, of poor-quality woollen cloth. Why should other countries reap the advantagesassociated with the manufacture of materials made from Australian wool ? I read recently that 1,000 tons of wool had been sent to Boubaix and Lille, in France, for manufacture there. A good deal has been said of the competition of synthetic fibres. I believe that there is room for these fibres as well as for wool, because the probabilities are that, at least in the post-war years, there will not be sufficient wool available to meet the demand. We must strain every nerve to expand our woollen industry, and the Government is doing a great service to Australia hy planning in that direction. Just as during the war it has been found necessary to have capable men in charge of our munitions programme, so good, capable Australians, with a thorough knowledge of their job, must be given direction of the woollen industry. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) referred to shipbuilding -a subject which was mentioned by His Royal Highness in the Speech which he delivered to the Parliament. viously, the transport of goods by sea was left almost entirely to private enteradversely affected, the Committee has deemed prise, but the present realizing the importance of sea transport to the nation, has set out to build ships. It realizes that freights and other costs may be so prohibitive as to make it almost impossible for Australian goods to compete in the world markets. I understand that freights from Australia to the United Kingdom are higher than from other places no closer to the market. Freight on wheat shipped to Great Britain costs over 4s. a bushel, and in addition there are other charges, including insurance. When we realize that lis. a bushel would have to be paid for wheat sent to Egypt or India, it is evident that some one is making excessive profits-profits greater than the amount which the farmer receives for his wheat. Some years ago, a previous government decided to establish its own line of steamers, because those in charge of private shipping lines were holding this country to ransom by charging excessive freights. I fear that after the war the position will again become acute, should shipping remain in the hands of a combine, which is concerned only with making profits. combine for seeking to make profits, but I do blame the people who submit to its demands. We must continue to build ships in this country, even if they are not produced at a profit, so that we may be able to ship our produce to any market we choose; otherwise, I fear that we shall have difficulty in finding markets for our produce, especially our wheat. Honourable members will recall the circumstances in which the Australian Gomimonwealth Line of Steamers was disposed of. I have here the interim report of the Public Accounts Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Granville Ryrie, on the Comanonwealth Government shipping activities, and shall read an extract from it. The report of a later committee which advocated the selling of the ships was signed by Senator Kings-mill. The interim report to which I have referred statesIn view, however, of emphatic evidence placed before the Committee that, owing to the uncertainty which exists concerning the Precontinuance of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, its business has been it desirable to submit to Parliament, prior Government, to the approaching recess, this Interim Report. To arrive at a decision, apart from the question of Government policy, as to whether the Commonwealth Government Line should be continued, there must be considered what benefits have accrued to the country by the establishment of the Line, and whether such benefits have outweighed any financial loss incurred as a result of its trading operations. The evidence so far placed before the Committee indicates that not only has the Commonwealth Line been directly responsible for actual reductions in freights, but that the presence of the Line has exerted a material restraining influence against proposed increases. Whilsti t is difficult, in fact, almost impossible, owing to the many factors to be considered, to indicate in figures the actual gain to Australia by such action, it appears to the Committee, from the evidence already heard, that shippers and primary producers of Australia have derived much benefit from the establishment of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. The Committee, therefore, recommends that, in the interests of Australia, the Line be continued. In making this interim recommendation, the Committee desires to emphasize the fact that it has not yet completed its investigations; so far as these have gone, however, they indicate the necessity for a review of the present system of financing the Line, and a drastic curtailment of the overhead expenses, including the London Office; but until Mr Larkin has had an opportunity of expressing his views in I do not blame a evidence, the Committee does not consider it desirable to indicate the lines along which such re-organization should be effected.

103,Mr Mcleod.,"of Australia thousands of pounds in freights. Some of the reasons why .the line failed are given in the report. The report contained complaints about unfair press criticism. To-day, the press is directing a barrage of criticism against the Government's banking proposals, which w ill create better conditions in the post-war period for ex-servicemen and civilians alike. The people should be warned against this insidious press campaign. Apparently, it was no novelty twenty years ago. The report proceededPress Criticism -Unfai r press criticism and a tendency to give undue publicity to any matters adversely affecting the Commonwealth Line and its operations, exercised, it was stated, an influence on its business. Instances were quoted in evidence of the prominence given in the press to happenings of a detrimental nature on Commonwealth steamers, whilst similar episodes on other vessels were not mentioned. The committee itself had specific examples during its investigation. In one case a paragraph appeared in a Melbourne paper that passengers on a "" Bay"" steamer had complained that the food was poor during the voyage. The editor was asked if he could indicate the source of the information, and whether the names of the passengers were available, but a reply was received regretting that, although he had inquiry made, no such particulars could be furnished. In another instance a Sydney newspaper published, during the course of the committee's investigation, a paragraph headed "" federal Ships-D o not pay-May all be sold"", and then proceeded to quote, in heavy type, an opinion expressed by the Prime Minister, when a private member of Parliament, some three years previously. Similar tactics are being pursued to-day in order to foment opposition to the legislation foreshadowed in the Governor General's Speech. I have no hesitation in saying that the reform of the banking system is long overdue. Housing presents an acute problem in Australia, but a visitor, listening to the criticism voiced by honourable members opposite, might be excused for believing that the problem had been caused by the bungling and neglect of this Government. Honourable members opposite should read some of the pamphlets issued by the Department of Information , in which are published. extracts from the Housing Commission's reports on slums in Sydney and Melbourne. Undoubtedly, the housing shortage is most serious. I know what it means to young married couples. [24] They do not mind greatly where they live, provided they have a roof over their heads. Consequently, people are herded together on verandahs and in depressing slum surroundings. The Government must take urgent action to solve this problem. The Housing Commission in Victoria is constructing an excellent type of house; but 250,000 homes are required throughout Australia, and the commission can provide only a negligible percentage of that number. Eveni n the post-war period, when man-power and materials w ill be available, the shortage of houses w ill be acute for a considerable time. Meanwhile, we must seek a temporary remedy. I propose to offer a constructive suggestion. During my lifetime, I have often been compelled to make-shift, particularly when I became a soldier settler, but I did not mind the inconveniences so long as I had a home. At present, the Government is erecting houses costing £900 or £1,000, but because of the lack of materials and man-power, the number of these dwellings is almost infinitesimal. Many local government bodies would make land available near r a i l or tram services and on those blocks could be erected houses of three or four rooms, with the necessary modern conveniences. If an ex-serviceman and his wife were allotted one of those dwellings they would be able to say, "" Well, at least this place is ours "" . Those structures would be only temporary. They could be pre-fabricated and supplied in large numbers. The Government must adopt that expedient. [Extension of time granted.] Honourable members w ill be interested to hear some extracts from the report of the Housing and Slum Abolition Board of Victoria, presented to the Parliament of Victoria in October, 1937. It gave the results of a house survey and social census of 7,330 houses in which 25,000 persons were living. Those houses were w it h in 5 miles of the Melbourne General Post Office. The board found that in every 100 houses50 were in bad condition externally. 23 had leaking roofs, due mainly to rusted iron and displaced and broken slates. 32 had no bathrooms. 51 had no washhouses. 88 had no kitchen sink, or water laid on to kitchens. 11.7 were overcrowded. Most of the houses had unsound floors, poor lighting and ventilation, while others were unfit to live in because of dampness. 50 had ceilings S feet high or less. 40 were overrun by rats, and sixteen were vermin infested. The board found, too5,742 families living in the 7,330 houses earned aggregate average incomes of £3 Is. Sd. a week. 3,118 families living in 3,040 houses, classed as unlit to live in average a total income of £2 10s. 4d. a week. 43.5 .per cent, of the inhabitants of these slums were children. Rents of the bouses classed as unfit to live in averaged l is . 2d. a week-22. 5 per cent, of the aggregate family income. Suddenly, honourable members opposite have discovered that the housing shortage is serious. When the Scullin Government was in office it made a gallant attempt, despite tremendous odds, to secure the consent of the Parliament to a fiduciary note issue of £1S,000,000, of which £10,000,000 was to be devoted to housing. For the next ten years anti-Labour governments were in office, and thousands of men were unemployed, butno attempt was made to provide them with work by launching a nation-wide building programme. During the depression, men were evicted from slum dwellings because they could not pay the rent of l is . 2d. a week. Those dwellings had probably been erected 60 years before, when they were let for 7s. 6d. a week. As their condition deteriorated, the landlord increased the rent. They were still a good investment. Private enterprise cannot solve the housing problem, because there is no profit in it. During the depression, some people who had been evicted from their homes were compelled to live under bridges. I have seen them living under appalling conditions at Mildura and Shepparton. They beqame an embarrassment to the local government authorities, because of the lack of sanitation. What did the anti-Labour Government do for them? Government had launched a vigorous liome-building programme, the nation would have benefited from it to-day. It is futile for honourable members opposite to blame the present Government for the shortage. Instead of voicing baseless criticism, let them offer constructive suggestions for solving the problems. Doubtless*, some honourable members opposite, being wealthy men, have homes with ten or twelve rooms, and a cottage at the seaside as well. On one side of the River Yarra, in Melbourne, are situated some dreadful slums, but on the opposite bank there are some magnificent mansions; and more children are to be found in the slums than in the better-class area. That contrast makes people think. I regret that last year the people, in rejecting the Government's referendum proposals, refused to grant the Commonwealth authority to control land settlement. As a soldier settler after the last war, I quickly discovered that the system under which I took up a block was impossible and doomed to failure. I soon became an advocate of the only method which, in my opinion, can be successful. When the Crown resumes land, let it remain a Crown asset for all time, and let it be granted to a settler on the basis of a lease in perpetuity. Under any other system, the original settler will never be able to discharge the mortgage, and even his children will be over-burdened with debt. The system of perpetual leases will solve the problem, but the financial institutions and the money lenders will not like it. Indeed, I do not blame them, because, after all, it is their business to take the greatest slice in interest from the produce from the land. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) and I endured great hardships as soldier settlers after the last war. Fortunately, the position will be different after this war. As the result of a decision by the Commonwealth Govei-nment, in consultation with the States, ex-servicemen will be able to settle on the land under very generous conditions. My only regret is that similar conditions did not operate when I became a settler. Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia will adopt the perpetual lease system, which is already in existence in New South Wales and, to a large degree, in Queensland. Victoria has elected to retain the. old system of conditional purchase. That is unfortunate. If the capital value of an area is £3,000, the settler will be in debt for many years. He will also require a good deal of luck to enable him to meet all his commitments, because he will pay such a vast",54,Cameron Th E Honor Monetary System Of Any Country Prac
104,Mr Pollard,Nothing.,56,Cameron Th E Honor Monetary System Of Any Country Prac
105,Mr Moleod,"If the anti-Labourtribute in interest out of his produce from the land. That thought leads me to remark that the Government must ensure continuity of stable prices, and the settler our power to prevent another conflict of must produce commodities for which there will always be a ready demand. Butter is one of those commodities. Even in normal times, some Australians were not getting enough butter. That position must be remedied in future. When men have security in employment, the effect on the birth-rate becomes apparent. Riverina and the Goulburn Valley, the average farmer had ten children. Even now, although the families might not be so large on the settlements, the number of children is proportionately higher than the number in urban areas. One reason is that the farmer is usually certain of being able to supply his dependants with food. Even in the bad ok! days, a farmer could defy the authorities when they sent him an account for £1,000, or a notice to quit. As a general rule, the farmer was able to keep his family supplied with butter, milk and eggs; hut tlie worker as in a different position. As a member of the War Expenditure Committee, I discussed the system of lend-lease with the men responsible for its operation in this country. They said that the idea was something new, and. that when it was first suggested they did not think that it would work. But it has worked wonderfully well. I suggest the possibility of continuing lend-lease in the days of peace. Already we have had considerable experience of the system, and, perhaps, in some modified form it can be turned to good account in peace. It might be possible by such an arrangement, for instance, to avoid the destruction and restriction of production of foodthat Thursday on which, under the provisions stuffs which occurred before the war in all countries of the world, when we were destroying products urgently needed by the peoples of other countries, and they were destroying products of which we stood in need. Perhaps some arrangement along the lines of lend-lease could he devised to prevent a recurrence of evils of that kind. Therefore, I earnestly suggest that the Government study the proposition I now make. Anything that we do to promote goodwill and co-operation between the nations will help to prevent war. We should do everything in the kind in which we are now engaged, the misery and destruction of which is appalling. Man has yet to solve the problem of how to live in peace. Fortunately, the nations are coming together more closely. I agree with the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) that war is not inevitable. I trust that the representatives of this country at Forty years ago in the conferences overseas will reflect the vigour of this young land-, and that if war cannot be completely outlawed the co-operation of all countries will at least guarantee an era of peace.

109,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"have not heen given an opportunity for a general debate on matters affecting the interests of our constituents. If we are to preserve democratic government, the undertaking on the part of the Government to give to private members an opportunity to debate such matters from time to time must be something more than a mere fiction. Since the last general elections I cannot recall one occasion on which such a debate has taken place. ally, private members look forward to grievance day in order to discuss points of government policy affecting their constituents. We are given a similar opportunity in connection with ordinary adjournment motions, but on such occasions attendance in the chamber is very sparse, sometimes only one Minister being present at the table, and in the circumstances he has every excuse for hoping to get to bed instead of having to remain to listen to the complaints voiced by honourable members. I hope that we shall be given some assurance that the rights of private members will be respected in this matter. The Government must recognize that for a long time past private members on this side have not availed themselves of the. opportunity to place motions on the notice paper to enable certain matters to be discussed, but have refrained from doing so because we desire to give to the Government every opportunity to bring forward matters of an absolutely essential character. However, when we find that the Government is placing domestic issues above world and war issues we have a right to strive for recognition of our rights as private members. I sincerely hope that under Standing Order 241 Opposition members will be given an opportunity to place their views before the Government. Question resolved in the affirmative. surer) [9.23] I move That the hill be now read a second time. The bill seeks to repeal the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act 1939 and the Motor Vehicles Agreement Act 1940. The Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Bill was introduced by a previous government, and the act was assented to on the 15th December, 1939. Briefly, the act provides for the payment of bounty at varying rates on engine units for motor vehicles manufactured in Australia subject to certain specified conditions, one of which limits the payment of a bounty to companies incorporated in and conducting business in Australia. The act, in general terms, also provides that not less than two-thirds of the total shares of a company claiming the bounty shall be held by British subjectsresident in Australia or in territories under the control of the Commonwealth, and stringent conditions are applied regarding the use of Australian materials. The Motor Vehicles Agreement Bill was also introduced by a former government in May, 1940, and the act was assented to on the 3rd June, 1940. Briefly, the act authorizes the execution of an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, under which certain undertakings were to be made by the company and certain assurances given hy the Commonwealth. The proposed undertakings by Australian Consolidated In dustries Limited were mainly to form a company with a nominal! capital of £1,000,000, and an initial subscribed capital of £250,000, for the purpose of manufacturing motor engines and chassis in Australia. The proposed assurances by the Commonwealth included(1) Safeguarding the interests of the proposed company against the establishment of similar manufacturing in Australia by foreign or foreign-controlled companies. (2) The payment of bounties on engines as specified in the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act 1939.

(5) The control by the Commonwealth of imports of engines and chassis. (6) The using of such control to ' counteract any unfair' trading methods by overseas traders selling competitive vehicles in Australia, if necessary. Following an inquiry by the Secondary Industries Commission and consideration of the subject by a 'Cabinet sub-committee, and later by Full Cabinet, the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin), in a press announcement on the 12th September, 1944, indicated that the Government had agreed to the following course of action:(1) The Motor Vehicles Agreement Act to he repealed. (2) The Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act to be repealed. "" (3) All interested parties to be requested to submit proposals for the Government's consideration. (4) When considering these proposals the question of government factories for the production of components on a scale adequate to maintain the factories as efficient units for defence production to be examined. (5) Should satisfactory proposals not be received the Government to set up a corporation to manufacture a complete car. (6) With a view to decentralization, financial assistance to be provided to enable effect to be given to freight equalization. The changing circumstances, and the marked engineering development which has occurred in this country since the outbreak of war, have influenced the Government in reaching its decisions. The 'Government felt that to ensure that motor vehicle engines and chassis are manufactured in Australia it had to give all interested parties full opportunity to submit proposals for the Government's consideration. As will be observed the two acts are of a restrictive nature, and the Government has, therefore, decided that they should be repealed. The Commonwealth Solicitor-General has carefully reviewed all correspondence which"" has passed between the Commonwealth Government and Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, in connection with this matter, and is of the opinion that no binding agreement for the manufacture of motor vehicle engines and chassis exists between the Commonwealth and Australian Consolidated Industries Limited. As the Prime Minister has announced, the Government would never be a party to disregarding agreements or contracts, but as I have previously stated there is no evidence that an agreement between the Commonwealth andAustralian Consolidated Industries Limited has ever been executed. It will be noted that a special provision -claus e 4-ha s been inserted in the present bill, whereby appropriate provision has been made to safeguard any claims for compensation which may be made by Australian Consolidated Industries Limited on the ground that a binding contract between the company and the Commonwealth came into existence either in 1940 or in the latter part of 1939. In other words, if the company's claim that a contract was made is substantiated its right of action for compensation will not be prejudiced or taken away.

In September last the Government deaupointed by the Governor General, and cided that, in the interests of the Aussix members appointed by the Governortralian wool industry, a comprehensive General upon the nomination of the Ausplan should be inaugurated for research tralian Wool Growers Council. The Gointo various aspects of the wool industry vernment considers that the composition and for publicity to promote the use of of the board in this maimer is undemowool fibres in Australia and throughout cratic, and it is proposed in the bill that the world.

116,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister for and clothe it with new functions to bringtotally inadequate for tlie purpose, and the machinery at present utilized is not suited to their proper application. The reconstituted Australian Wool Board will be an integral part of the new machinery hut the funds available to it and its activities will be complementary to the activities which the Government proposes through its appropriate departments and instrumentalities. With regard, first, to the funds which shall be available for this essential work, the 'Government proposes that the rate of tax under the Wool Tax Act shall be quadrupled. The Treasurer will introduce the necessary amending bill at the appropriate time to provide that the tax on wool shall be as follows:For each bale-2s . For each fadge or butt-Is. For each bag-4d . On the basis of the proceeds received from the tax in 1933-34, the total sum thus levied will he about £325,000 per annum. To this sum the Government proposes to add £1 for £1, as provided in the present hill, making available for research and publicity an amount approximating £650,000 per annum. Clause 16 of the bill provides that there shall be a fund administered by the board, to be known as the "" Wool Use Promotion Fund "", into which shall be paid, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which the bill seeks to appropriate accordingly, all the moneys received by the Commissioner of Taxation from tlie proceeds of the wool tax. It is proposed to establish a second fund, or account, to be known as the ""Wool Research Trust Account"", into which the Treasurer shall pay, every financial year, a sum equal to the amount received by the Commissioner of Taxation in that year under the Wool Tax Act, as proposed to be amended. It is provided that tbe Australian Wool the wool industry will be the responsiBoard shall not retain the whole of the proceeds of the tax which is appropriated to the Wool Use Promotion Fund for publicity purposes, but only such moneys as remain after Ministers have determined what proportion of such moneys shall be paid into the Wool Research Trust Account. Representatives of the growers' organizations have been consulted, and they have agreed that it would be satisfactory if a proportion not greater than 25 per cent, of the Wool Use Promotion Fund, were directed to be paid into the Wool Research Trust Account annually for five years for the purposes of research. The bill provides that the following Ministers shall be associated in determining the relative claims of research and publicity in respect of wool, and they will direct the board accordingly:The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. The Treasurer. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. The Minister administering the Science and Industry Research Act 1926-1945. The purpose underlying this procedure is to ensure that the Commonwealth Government, through the Ministers mentioned, shall be in close contact with tbe progress of research and its relation to wool, the extension of its use, and the evolving of new usesa subject upon which I propose to lay emphasis at a later stage in my speech. It is proposed that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture shall he authorized to appoint a ""-Commonwealth Wool Adviser"", who, added to the grower representatives on the Australian Wool Board, shall be the seventh member of that body. In addition to the Australian Wool Board, which will continue to engage in publicity, there will be two departments principally concerned with research. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will be responsible for scientific, biological and technological research, and the cost of research into production, treatment and manufacturing processes applied to wool fibres. Research into the -national and international economic aspects of bility of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, which will also initiate Commonwealth and State cooperation in extension work to ensure that the results of the research are applied. To co-ordinate the work of these three authorities, it is proposed that Ministers shall have the services of an inter-departmental committee which will be set up by administrative action. In order to ensure that all phases of the wool industry shall fall within the scope, and receive the benefits, of the enlarged scheme of research and publicity, the bill provides for the setting up resemble woollen fabrics, at least superof a Wool Consultative Council to advise the associated Ministers in regard to the aspects of the industry with which they are connected. It is proposed that the council shall consist of the Commonwealth Wool Adviser and seven other members appointed by the Minister to represent respectively(a) the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research; (b) the Australian Wool Board; (c) wool manufacturers; (d) textile distributors; (e) authorities concerned with technical education; (/) the Australian Workers Union; and (g) the Australian Textile Workers Union. I have covered the main machinery provisions of the bill, . and I do not think it necessary to spend much time in justifying the general policy of the measure. It will be evident to honourable members, and indeed to any thoughtful person, that vigorous action is necessary to meet tlie threat of artificial fibres. There are many persons who seem ready to disregard the threat of synthetic fibre production. They shelter behind the complacent point of view that wool is the perfect fibre and is thus immune from competitive attack by the product, of the chemical laboratory. I shall therefore quote some figures to show the growth of the production of synthetic fibres. In 1932, the production was 500,000,000 lb., or 4 per cent, of the world production of textile fibres. By 1939 it had risen to 2,200,000,000 lb.,' or 13 per cent, of all fibres. It is estimated that current production is about 4,000,000,000 lb., or oneparticularly suited to the manufacturer's fifth of all textile fibres. This is nearly double tbe world production of scoured wool! Two pounds of synthetic fibre are produced for every pound of scoured wool. The range of types of synthetic fibres is steadily increasing. The first artificial fibre was rayon, which resembled silk rather than wool, and did not affect, in any measurable degree, the markets for wool. Mr Dedman. artificial fibres are now being produced, many of them from plant and animal proteins, such as milk casein and soyabean protein. These can be woven to ficially, and it would be idle to pretend that they will not affect the sale of woollen materials if no action be taken. I do not agree, of course, with the other extremists, who consider that wool will be unable to hold any significant place as a textile fibre. Wool has unique properties which will always ensure its use for many purposes. I accept the midway point of view, which appreciates the certain role of wool in many fields, but recognizes the threat of synthetics and the need for research to' combat that threat. I propose to give some indication of the fields in which research will be undertaken. It should be understood that this is not an attempt to present a detailed account of the technical programme. The research programme can be divided broadly into these three phases(1) Research on the production of wool; (2) Research on processing problems; and (3) Economic and marketing research. The principal research agency on production and processing, will be the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. However, the State Departments of Agriculture and other bodies have been active for many years on various problems related to wool production, and their work will be encouraged in close association with that of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. In the past, the manufacturer has accepted tie wools made available to him by the grower. There has been little attempt on the part of the producer to grow wool which is purposes. It is most desirable that there should be a much more intimate link between the requirements of the manufacturer and the class of wool produced by the industry. The sheepbreedersof Australia have made an enormous advance in the standard of the Australian merino, and other breeds used in this country. Nevertheless, there Numerous other is great scope for the application of more closely controlled genetical methods in improving the yield, uniformity and quality of wool fibre. For example, some progeny testing is already being undertaken by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, arid extension of this work is contemplated. Australian research workers have similarly contributed to the control of many pests and diseases in sheep. The work on foot-rot, internal parasite, and blow-fly control may be mentioned as instances in which a relatively small expenditure on research has been abundantly repaid in reduced production costs. The study of nutrition is another field in which great expansion of the research programme must be undertaken. Both the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the State Departments of Agriculture have advanced our knowledge of such subjects as drought and supplementary feeding, whilst the control of coast disease in South Australia has provided a spectacular example of disease prevention, by the provision of a minute supplement of copper and cobalt. Pasture research is yet another field in which many problems, particularly in the northern sheep areas, remain unsolved. been undertaken in connection with sown pastures in southern Australia; but both in this field and, in particular, on the treatment of native pastures it will be necessary to expand our programme considerably. The Government realizes that the ultimate value of any such research is in its effect on tbe cost of production as well as on the quality of the product. Consequently, due attention will be paid to the economic implications of any research findings, and costing studies will be undertaken. The textile research programme will cover all phases of the processing of wool, from the greasy state to the production of the fabric for sale to the consumer. Carbonizing, fellmongering, and scouring will receive attention, and the manufacturer of tops, yarn, and woollen materials of all kinds will be included. A part of the research which is contemplated consists of fundamental physical and chemical studies of the wool fibre. The results of this will be of great assistance when applied to more direct problems. Whilst wool possesses many unique qualities which are unlikely ever to be imitated in synthetic fibres, it must be recognized that it also has disadvantages that are not possessed by synthetic fibres, such as moth attack, tickle, and shrinkage. Progress has been made in research on these disabilities, but much remains to be done before commercially successful results oan be achieved. In addition to improving the qualities of processed wool, it will be necessary to explore the scope for the production of new fabrics not previously produced. There is little doubt that research will demonstrate that finer fabrics and new weaves which can not at present be achieved with wool, are possible of realization. There is need also for research on the engineering and technological problems of manufacture. There are many more processes in wool production than in the production of synthetic fibres, and this tends to add considerably to the cost of the final product. Studies of such processes as dyeing and finishing must be undertaken. The broad objective will be to improve, to the greatest degree possible, the quality and finish of wool Considerable research has products, and to extend the range of fabrics to the maximum degree. A t present, very little use is made of the by-products of wool processing, despite the fact that little more than one-half of the raw material is actual wool fibre. There is, however, considerable promise that research will enable a full use to be made of the grease of the wool. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will undertake the research on wool processing. In order to obtain the benefit of developments in other countries, notable authorities from overseas will be invited to visit this country and advise on the formulation of the research programme. Mr B. H . Wilsdon, director of the Wool Industries Research Association, Torridon, Leeds, has already accepted an invitation to visit Australia, and I hope that other men of similar . status in the textile industry also will assist. The proposed research on both the wool production and the wool processing sides will be of limitedvalue without the assurance that the research findings shall be made available to the producer and the manufacturer respectively. Not only must he be constantly informed of the results of the investigations in progress, but we, too, must be assured that he will be encouraged to adopt them in his undertakings. No detailed plans have yet been drawn up in this regard, but the Government has made provision in the bill for the application of research findings, and intends that this phase shall be adequately covered. Concurrently with research into primary and secondary production, a vigorous programme of economic research will be undertaken. The investigations will include inquiries concerning the factors influencing the cost of production, processing, and manufacturing of both wool and its competitors, also the economics of wool marketing and all its related international proiblems. Manufacturers of synthetic fibres overhas been avoided in two main ways. seas are spending enormous sums on research and publicity. They realize that the investment in research of a few tens of thousands of dollars may reduce the cost of their product by a cent or two cents and thereby return enormous profits. It is the firm view of the Government that unless similar measures are taken in respect of wool cheaply produced synthetic, fibres may threaten our major industry. The bill is introduced because of this conviction. It proposes that an extensive programme of research on all aspects of the industry shall be undertaken, and that adequate publicity shall be given so as to stimulate the use of wool as a textile fibre. The readiness with which wool-growers have agreed to subscribe with the Government on a £1 for £ l basis is an encouraging sign staffs, the farmer and the pastoralist of the recognition of the need for such a programme as is now being formulated. I am confident that our combined efforts will be of major assistance to the wool industry and to the nation. I commend the bill to the House. adjourned. Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [9.53] I move That tlie bill be now read a second time. As at present constituted by the Science and Industry Research Act 1926-1939, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research consists of three memlbers nominated by the Commonwealth Government-on e of whom is the chairman-the chairmen of the six State committees, and other memlbers co-opted by reason of their scientific knowledge. The three Commonwealth Government appointees form an executive committee, which exercises all the powers and functions of the full council in the intervals between its meetings. The activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research have necessitated a widespread and adaptable organization. Undesirable centralization In the first' place, the policy has been followed of establishing laboratories in different places in the Commonwealth where the necessary facilities, contacts, and other suitable conditions could best be found. Secondly, a State committee, widely representative of scientific and industrial interests, has been established in each of the six States. These committees advise the council on general matters, and on particular subjects of investigation and research. For about twelve years after its establishment, the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was devoted mainly to the solution of problems affecting the agricultural and pastoral industries. Unlike manufacturing concerns, which often can employ their own scientific are dependent on outside help for the solution of their proiblems which require research. It was a recognition of the greater need for the primary producer which directed the council's early policy. However, in 1937 the Commonwealth Government decided to extend the activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research so as to provide assistance to secondary industries, and the council proceeded to establish several laboratories for work in that field. It was thus in the fortunate position of being able to render to these industries",60,Second Reading

118,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister forassistance of vital importance almost immediately after the outbreak of war. In fact, the remarkable technological advances and developments in secondary industrial production during the war would, to a large degree, have been impossible had it not been for the assistance rendered by scientific research, and this may well serve as a forceful illustration of what may be accomplished in times of peace. For the purpose of carrying out its research work, the council has established a number of divisions and sections. The divisions, of which there are now twelve, comprise the major establishments for which special laboratory buildings have been erected and equipped; the sections generally include establishments which have not reached a stage of development, so far as tbe scope and magnitude of their operations are concerned, that would justify their, designations as divisions. As the council's investigations are on a Commonwealth-wide basis, and as many of the investigations being conductedparticularly those concerned with problems affecting the agricultural and pastoral industries-necessitat e experimental work in the field, a number of field stations has been established in various parts of Australia. The divisions established are(1) Plant Industry, with main laboratories at Canberra and field stations. (2) Economic Entomology, also with main laboratories at Canberra and field stations. (3) Animal Health and Production, with main laboratories in Mela great organization, with ramifications bourne and Sydney and field stations.

(10) A section for Council for Scientific and Industrial Research activities in Tasmania, will shortly be established there. Since 1926, Sir George Julius has presided as chairman of the council, and during the nineteen years that have elapsed the council has developed into in almost everysphere of scientific research. That is a comparatively brief period as the lives of scientific instituand industrial development of Australia. The council has achieved a distinguished place among the scientific institutions of the world. This is an achievement of practical importance in the lives of all Australians, without which the Commonwealth as a nation could not have played the ipart that it has played, and that it will play in war and peacea part which future historians will record among the significant factors in the history of the Commonwealth. Advice has been received from Sir George Julius that he considers that the time has arrived when he should relinquish the position of chairman of the council. The retirement of Sir George Julius will probably take place at some time during the present year. Appreciation of his devotion to duty and of the supremely important results which the council has achieved during his term of office has been conveyed to him. The retirement of the first chairman of the council coincides with the time when we must prepare for the important task of applying to the problems of peace and post-war reconstruction the scientific organization and experience gained by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and applied so successfully to the problem's of war. The need for the application of scientific knowledge in both primary and secondary industries will be greater than at any time in Australia's history. Australia will be facing a new worlda world full of industrial surprises, and of scientific and technical developments not thought of a few years ago. During the war, government authorities and industrial undertakings have learned to rely more than ever before on the help of the scientist. In the post-war period, the Government, as well as industry, will be even quicker to recognize the roie which science in general, and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in particular, must play in solving the problems on which Australia's future development depends. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research must be more than a great scientific institution; it must be an integral unit of industrial society, and must play an important part in public education. It must foresee the problems which cry out for solution, and must maintain close contact with the departmental or industrial authorities that have problems that need to be solved. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case-the impending retirement of the council's first and only chairman, the wide ramifications of the council's work, and the part which it is being called upon to play in post-war reconstruction and development-it is desirable that the organization of the council Mr Dedman. should be modified so as to enable it to maintain a close contact between the day-to-day direction of its work and the developments which are taking place in industry, in the universities, and elsewhere. This can be achieved in two ways: first, by increasing the number of members of the council, and secondly, by appointing additional members to the executive committee. As regards the council, the Science and Industry Research Act already provides that the council may, with the consent of the Minister, co-opt additional members by reason of their scientific knowledge. After consulting the council, consent has recently been given to the co-option of four additional members. council are there at present? ber of members of the executive committee cannot, however, be increased without an amendment of the act. The appointment of two additional members, increasing the number from three to five, as provided in the measure before the House, would not only facilitate closer contact with activities in world affairs, but would have the additional advantage that it would permit of a distribution of the burden which has grown increasingly heavy in recent years. Moreover, it would, in the long-term view, provide a larger reservoir of experience to meet the changes which must inevitably arise when other members of the present executive retire, thus maintaining continuity in the direction of the council's work. The council has been consulted on this matter, and concurs in the view that an increase of the number of members of the executive committee is desirable. The amendment contained in the bill is in itself small, but it symbolizes the successes of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to date, and is an indication of wider efforts and achievements to come. I commend the bill to the House. reached as to the appointment of an acting chairman, pending the retirement of Sir George Julius? adjourned.",64,Science And Industry Research Bell 1945 Second Reading

123,Debate (On Motion By Mr Holt),"WAR Tliat the House do now adjourn. impress on the Government the need for an increased measure of encouragement and assistance to those important 'bodies known as local Repatriation Committees. These committees were established twenty years ago under the auspices of the Repatriation 'Commission, and their duties were laid down in a handbook entitled Instructions for the Guidance of a Repatriation Local Committee,. The instructions include the following:Country local committees can do much towards retaining a man within the confines of their influence."" Where a suitable returned .soldier is helped to re-establish himself in a rural area, he is not only benefited himself, but the community as a whole reaps an advantage, as such re-establishment prevents another man driftin g to the capital or to a provincial city. A local repatriation committee is an honorary body appointed by the commission to afford assistance within a prescribed area. It is responsible for all its transaction to the Deputy Commissiiiner. The role of a local committee is to supplement the general scheme of repatriation with particular regard to the special requirements of the. area in which the soldier and his dependants reside. The duties of the committees are set out on page 13 of the handbookof instructions, which statesA committee is expected to assist and cooperate with the .Deputy Commissioner in furnishing him with reports, if required, on ex-soldiers and their dependants who are resident in a committer's area, and especially to help, him in the task of placing returned soldiers in suitable employment. As the placement of soldiers and their dependants in satisfactory employment is often the solution to most of the problems which confront them, a committee is requested to give this aspect of its work close consideration. I regard the work of these committees as of great importance, because, at least, they provide for a measure of decentralization in the solution of repatriation problems. In my electorate several .of these 'local committees have been formed in the last two years. Their members are men of standing in the district and men of great public spirit. They include local majority, if not all of them, are returned soldiers, and they are obviously the best qualified to speak on the subject of the re-establishment of ex-service personnel in tbe areas in which they reside. They carry out their duties with great enthusiasm, and devote a great deal of time to their work. They have already produced excellent results, and, no doubt, when servicemen return in increased numbers the committees will do a great deal more work than heretofore, which will be of inestimable value in placing ex-servicemen in profitable positions. At present, unfortunately, much dissatisfaction prevails amongst the members of these committees. In October last, I brought to the notice of the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) the case of the Repatriation Committee at Korumburra, whose members felt aggrieved and impeded in their work by the fact that discharged men in that area, had been assisted to jabs and supplied with information over the heads of the committee. There was no liaison or co-operation between the Repatriation Commission and the local committee. The Minister looked into the matter, and I understand that the differences havt been straightened out; but, unfortunately, the matter does not rest there. Other committees are, to say the least, upset over the fact that their work is not, in their opinion, properly recognized, and they are not getting necessary assistance from the department. The members of these committees often work after business hours, and in the course of their inquiries they use their own motor cars and provide their own petrol. The suggestion has been put to me that assistance should be given to them in the form of either petrol or tyres, or that some financial help should be provided for the extra work they are doing. The volume of work is bound to increase, and if it is to be done properly these men should receive some material assistance from the Repatriation Department. We must see not only that discharged men are put into jobs, but that they are put into jobs which will assure them of security in the future. No one is better qualified to supervise such matters than people actually living",66,Science And Industry Research Bell 1945 Second Reading

Apart from the financial aspect, I believe that the closest contact should be maintained between the department and the committees.

Now, when the husband is discharged, the greatest difficulty is experienced in the rinding of a house. I recognize that thfi War Service Homes Commission is under the disadvantage that only a token amount was appropriated for this department in the last budget. However, I know of cases in which soldiers, after being informed by the commission that no money was available, said that they could provide the money themselves with which to build. Can the Minister give an assurance that if a soldier provides the money himself the commission will, immediately it is in possession of funds, take over his obligations? I should also like the Minister to give favorable consideration to the proposal that a soldier on active service, or his representative here, should qualify for the benefits under the act, instead of having to wait until he is demobilized.

They had a block of land in Camberwell, a well-known residential suburb of Melbourne, and she applied to the Department of War Organization of Industry for a permit to build. The department said to her: "" We cannot give any one a permit to build a home without first being assured that the applicant can obtain the necestajis, &c."" She then set out on a tour deal of trouble found that she was able to buy a stove here, a bath there, and other fittings somewhere else.

Nevertheless, this woman was given a permit to build a home which was to cost not more than £400, despite the fact that it was impossible to build a home for that amount. Moreover, the department ought to have known of the existence of a building regulation in the municipality of Camberwell which precluded the building of a home at a cost of anything like as low as £400. This was pointed out to the department, which then said that it would give further consideration to the matter, but the applicant would have to submit plans and specifications, and an estimate of the minimum cost of the building.

The Minister also indicated that no information is available as to what is done by the Government of South Africa to promote migration of servicemen to that dominion. I believe that I express the view of honourable members generally when I say that we are completely baffled in our attempts to ascertain the migration policy of the Government, or to learn what is being done to stimulate interest in migration to this country, or to deal effectively with inquiries which are being made in various countries. members have received inquiries from relatives or friends abroad regarding the prospects of migration to this country. The indifference or casualness of the Government appears to indicate that there is no real desire"" on its part for any substantial measure of migration to Australia, yet to hear some honourable members opposite, and particularly some prominent Ministers, one would be justified in believing that they are convinced of the necessity to bring to Australia large numbers of desirable migrants. In many countries from which we could expect large numbers of migrants, vast areas have become devastated as the result of the war Industries and homes have been destroyed and families have been dispersed. Breadwinners have been killed, and children have been orphaned as ths result of bombing or other war causes. Many desire to make a fresh start in a new country, where they will be remote from the bitterness, tragedy and harshness of their experiences during, the last few years. Australia urgently needs large numbers of suitable migrants in order to strengthen us against external aggression. We should be the last people to be dilatory in a matter of this kind. Our very remoteness makes it all the more imperative that we should secure the mass migration to our shores of people from other countries. Europe has been devastated, and intense bitterness has developed-bitterness which is directed not only against an aggressive enemy who occupied countries that are now being liberated, but also against even neighbours in the same ""community, who took different sides as the Mr Holt. struggle developed. If we are not prepared to accept those who want to come here, we shall miss the kind of opportunity which does not occur many times in the life of a young nation. I have a feeling, and I believe that it is shared by many others, that the Government's lethargy in this regard is influenced largely by the attitude of insular and sectional groups in this country, who hold the unfounded belief that any movement of people from other countries to Australia may jeopardize the prospects of Australians obtaining employment Probably some honourable here. has no right to say that. patriation ( Mr Frost) denies that that is a factor. WhilstI hope that is the case, I am influenced by the public statements of men who represent important groups of workers in this country. I -am influenced also by a statement made by the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Hadley) a few nights ago, when he referred to the necessity to employ Ausr tralians before we induce migrants to come here. Knowing something ""of the record of Ministers, I cannot help feeling on this particular item of policy that that is an important factor which is retarding real progress iii this matter at the present time. I am glad that the Minister for Repatriation does not think so, because if that is his view, he shares my opinion that increased numbers of people in Australia mean more jobs here, and a greater consumption and a greater demand for goods. By proper and statesmanlike administration, we should be able effectively to place migrants in employment without difficulty. That the need exists, there can be no dispute. It is accepted by every honourable member. That there is need for action corresponding to the need is a matter which is also beyond dispute. We cannot see any evidence of it. We despair of obtaining from the Government any statement about what is being done to accelerate a movement to this country of people who can be an asset to it.

But they cannot get any satisfactory information as to what their prospects will he, whether they will be welcomed and whether transp o r t will be available for them. The Government should not delay making a clear pronouncement of its intentions. So far as I am aware no such pronouncement has been made-by this Government. Honourable members have been assured that a Cabinet committee is at work, but we know how futile Cabinet committees can be. ber must be speaking from his own ministerial experience. that when Ministers are fully occupied with the details of administration in their own departments, it becomes most difficult to assemble committees and from them to obtain a clear and definite indication of policy. Therefore, I ask the Government, if it has a policy, to disclose it. If it has a programme which can be communicated to its representatives abroad, let us see that it is conveyed to them. Let us also have adequate representation in countries where we may reasonably expect that efficient organization and an imaginative and enterprising programme will attract prospective migrants to come here. At the moment, that programme does not exist; and the Government has given no indication that it is doing anything to ensure that it will exist. Until honourable members on this side of the chamber get a proper pronouncement from the Government of what it has in mind, they must remain restless and dissatisfied. Repatriation and Minister in charge of War Service Homes) [10.38] -The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) sought information about local committees which have been appointed to assist in the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen. About 90 of those committees are in existence in Victoria, and 96 in New South Wales. I greatly appreciate their work. The honourable member declared that the committees need more encourageFor medical ment, and are dissatisfied. I have heard no complaints from them. They are anxious to do everything in their power to assist ex-servicemen.

The members of those committees say that they prefer to work in an honorary capacity. and petrol. assistance to some of them in that, respect; but every one, including the honourable member, knows of the serious shortage of tyres and petrol. Undoubtedly, these committees are obliged to work under disabilities. We recognize that fact, and, therefore, give them all the assistance we can.

Under the Income Tax Assessment Act great job is being done by the civilians to the pay and allowances earned outside whom the right honourable member refers, Australia by members of tbe forces are exempt from income tax. This exemption, however, does not extend to the earnings of civilians who are employed by the American Army outside Australia. Income earned by a resident of Australia from sources outside Australia is subject to income tax if it is not taxed in the country outside Australia in which it is earned. As the earnings in question are not subjected to American income tax, they are subject to Commonwealth income tax. I would, however, point out that civilians employed on ships of the American Army are entitled to tbe special deduction, which is allowed to members of the defence forces in Auschant seamen. The allowance of this deduction has the effect of exempting the of allowing a special diminishing deducdo not exceed £586. This concession is not enjoyed by Australian civilians other mentioned. I have, as requested by the right honourable member, reviewed the matter of the taxation of these earnings. The case for any exemption rests 'on the dangerous conditions under which the income is earned. Acceptance of this principle would, however, entail a complete departure f r om an accepted income tax principle, namely, that of taxation according to ability to pay.
