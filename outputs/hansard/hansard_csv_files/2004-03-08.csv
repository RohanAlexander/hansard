(2) What action is he taking to address these concerns. (1) Yes. (2) Australia has led efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Southern Ocean, including around Australia’s Territory of Heard Island and the McDonald Islands. Australia has successfully pursued a number of measures in recent years, both within CCAMLR and bilaterally with other nations. Australia continues to work closely with the CCAMLR Secretariat and CCAMLR Members to ensure that measures to combat IUU fishing in which Australia has been instrumental (such as a trial centralised vessel monitoring system and the toothfish catch documentation scheme) go ahead successfully. In addition, the Australian Government announced in December last year funding of $40 to $50 million to enhance the existing patrol program, including for the Australian Customs Service to lease an ice strengthened vessel which will carry a deck-mounted 0.50 calibre machine gun, an armed Customs boarding party and Australian fishery officers. This initiative is specifically to respond to IUU toothfish vessels in Australia’s Heard Island and McDonald Islands EEZ.

(2) In each of the last six financial years, how many appeals against those certificates were (a) lodged with the AAT, (b) successful, and (c) unsuccessful? (3) What are the case names of all the appeals lodged with the AAT in each of the last six financial years? Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) In the last six financial years, no Minister in the Industry portfolio has issued a conclusive certificate under sections 33, 33A or 36A of the Freedom of Information Act 1982.",154,Questions On Notice
192,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Superannuation: Contributions (Question No. 2952) Mr Ripoll asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, upon notice, on 10 February 2004: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2272, how many of the 1700 former government, defence personnel and employees of licensees have deductions for superannuation made at a rate of 5% of their former salary under the provisions of sections 20, 21 and 21A of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (SRC Act). (2) Are any monies deducted for superannuation purposes remitted to private superannuation funds on behalf of ex-officers under these provisions. (3) How many of the 1700 former government employees, defence personnel and employees of licensees are deemed to earn 10% on the government funded proportion of their voluntary redundancy package under sections 21 and 21A of the SRC Act. (4) Does the 5% superannuation deduction based on former salary accrue a benefit; if so, when is the benefit payable to the contributor. (5) How many applications for act of grace payments made by former public servants for monies deducted under the superannuation formula have been refused and on what grounds. (6) Is he willing to consider individual act of grace payments to former officers. (7) In respect of the Department’s review of the benefit entitlement provisions under the SRC Act, (a) when did the review commence, and (b) has it been finalised; if not, when will it be completed. (8) Does the operation of the provisions of the SRC Act currently result in outcomes or consequences which were unintended when the legislation was originally enacted. (9) Why were the changes currently being considered not included in legislative changes to section 21 in 2001. (10) Is he aware that under the provisions of the SRC Act some ex-officers have been further penalised by a reduction of up to 66% of their spouse’s Centrelink parenting allowance payment. (1) 1486. (2) No. The contribution is a ‘notional’ deduction only. Its purpose is to ensure that a former employee does not receive a higher net payment than they would have received if they are still employed. Weekly incapacity payments for retired employees are reduced by the notional amount to maintain appropriate incentives for workers to return to work and minimise reliance on the social security scheme following the cessation of employment. (3) 520. (4) The notional superannuation contribution is not an accrued benefit. (5) There has been one formal application for an act of grace payment in relation to the superannuation formula in the previous 12 month period. This application was refused as there were no special circumstances that warranted an act of grace payment. (6) The Government considers all applications for act of grace payments on a case-by-case basis. Acts of grace payments are made to redress inequities in special cases. (7) The Department began its consideration of the notional superannuation contribution and related issues in July 2002. I am expecting the Department to report to me by mid-year. (8) The intent of the SRC Act is that all employees injured at work should, from 45 weeks of injury and regardless of whether they retire, receive weekly incapacity payments at 70% of their pre-",156,Questions On Notice
193,Mr Andrews,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:injury normal weekly earnings. This is intended to promote rehabilitation and return-to-work and minimise reliance on the social security system. The Review of the SRC Act is considering a range of issues including any consequences or outcomes which were unintended when the legislation was enacted. (9) The issues surrounding the treatment of superannuation under the SRC Act did not come to light until after passage of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Other Legislative Amendments) Act 2001. (10) The SRC Act provides income replacement for Commonwealth employees who retire as a result of their incapacity. It does not define eligibility for parenting allowance payment. Nonetheless the Government is concerned to ensure that the interaction between workers’ compensation and social security payments results in fair and equitable treatment. Eligibility for parenting payment is strictly defined to ensure that benefits are distributed equitably, that appropriate incentives to work are maintained and that there is no double counting of benefits. National Security: Terrorism (Question No. 2964) (1) Did Australia participate in the drafting of the model counter-terrorism provisions by the Nasonini Implementation Expert Working Group; if so, who represented Australia on the Working Group. (2) Were the model provisions (a) considered and (b) approved by the Australian Government at a ministerial level; if so, (i) when and (ii) by which Minister(s).

(4) Have any countries requested in-country drafting assistance; if so, (a) when and (b) to which countries has Australia provided in-country drafting assistance. (5) Does the Government expect to be asked to provide such assistance in future. (1) Yes.
