0,"Friday, 5 October, Rood. A.m., And Read Prayers. Ing's Age The Following Paragraph Appears. The Minister Of Defence, Speaking On The Question Of Nationalizing The Tobacco In","dustrysuggested that Senator Pearce should take steps to put a clear-cut issue before the electors. The electors should be asked to vote on the question : Should a clause be inserted in the Constitution giving the Commonwealth power to manufacture tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes? .. The position the Government took up on the question of monopolies was this : The Government said that under the Anti-Trust Act it could prevent monopolies which restricted trade or became injurious to the public weal. If that Act did not prevent monopolies becoming injurious, then he (Senator Playford) would say, ""Show me a monopoly that is injurious, and I will help to nationalize it."" That was the position tbe Government took up on the matter. I wish to know from the Prime Ministeri f those remarks correctly indicate the attitude of the Government in this connection ? an abbreviated one, and the remarks do not appear in the Argus, though I conjecture that, had they been understood in the sense which the honourable member seems to attribute to them, they would have been published.

The South African Customs Union Convention embraces the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Orange River Colony, the Transvaal, and Southern Rhodesia. It divides its Tariff into six classes, with differing rates of duty, and a separate rate of preference upon each. Of the Articles of Agreement which follow the list of duties of particular interest to us, first comes Article 3, which saysA rebate of Customs duty shall be granted on any goods and articles, the growth, produce, or manufacture of the United Kingdom, imported therefrom into the Union for consumption therein to the extent following :(Â«) In the case of goods and articles charged with Customs duty under ClassI . , the amount shown in the column indicating such rebate.

Provided that the manufactured goods and articles in respect of which such rebate as aforesaid shall be granted shall be bond fide the manufactures of the United Kingdom, and that, in the event of any question arising as to whether any goods or articles arc entitled to any such rebate as aforesaid, the decision of the Minister or other Executive Officer, in whom the control of the Customs Department immediately concerned is vested, shall be final. Australia is admitted under the provisions of Article 4, under whichA rebate similar to that for which provision is made in the last preceding Article shall be granted in like manner, and under like provisions, to goods and articles the growth, produce or manufacture of any British Colony, Protectorate, or Possession, granting equivalent reciprocal privileges to the Colonies and Territories belonging to Union. not fulfil those conditions. members of the Convention it does.

The last shipthese proposals before the Parliament this ment arrived there a few days ago, and no session. Various suggestions were exfurther shipments are authorized. changed, the net outcome of which to us is shown in the schedule. The Convention gives varying preferences to Great Britain, and any Colony with which it may make an agreement, over the whole list of South African productions. Into that total preference, we appear to have entered; but we have submitted to Parliament, to show the advantages of our side of the bargain, only those classes of goods which we are now exporting to South Africa. There may be other exports which have escaped attention, or which may be developed, and call for inclusion in future calculations. I regard the interjection of the acting leader of the Opposition as ' a comment rather than a question. The concessions granted by Australia have been approved by the Convention as an equivalent to reciprocal preference within the meaning of the article which I have read. The members of the Convention are satisfied, and I hope that honourable members will be so, too. Article9 forbids the importation of prison and penitentiarymade goods, and of opium, except for medicinal purposes. In Article 16, alcoholic liquors and blasting compounds are coupled together; but those have only an indirect interest for us.

The amount of preference which we are to give differs according to the kind of South African labour used, in the same way that our Excise duties upon sugar vary. Instead of paying the duty of 6s. per cwt. which is levied upon sugar from everywhere else, the South African product, grown by white labour, will be subject to an impost of 4s. per cwt., whilst that grown by black labour will bear a duty of 5s. per cwt. The South African Colonies make no concession to us in regard to sugar. Thev do not at present produce enough for their own consumption, and therefore the export of sugar by them is purely a question of the future. It is with the deepest disappointment that I have to inform honourable members that our reciprocity treaty with New Zealand has failed to meet with the acceptance of the Parliament of that Colony^ I pass no comment upon the telegraphed reports, which are very brief, but take it that they represent the gist of the objections. From personal knowledge, I am in a position to say that these objections were in the mind of the late Mr Seddon, and that he mentioned them as among the sacrifices that New Zealand would make by entering into the treatv. It was with a clear knowledge and appreciation of the loss of revenue involved that he set his signature to our agreement, believing it to be a desirable one from the stand-point of the Colony which he represented so faithfull y and so well. objections ? No . to be unanimously against the treaty, some .body claiming to represent the farmers protested against it, the flour millers took exception to the propose'd preferences on their product, and there was the general objection to the loss of reT h a t will be convenue that would result. The late Mr Seddon had all these items clearly in his mind, and mentioned them as among the concessions that New Zealand was makunderstand ing. It was with a f u l l knowledge of all the facts that he threw the great weight of his knowledge and reputation into the scale in favour of the treaty. However, the difficulty was to draft a reciprocity treaty If the Committee will for two countries whose conditions and products were so similar. There is not an equal likeness, but a marked resemblance, between South Africa and Australia. We are practically in the same latitudes, we advantage each have a vast expanse of territory and great pastoral, minerail, and agricultural resources. In South Africa, however, the white population is not much more than one-fourth of that which we at present possess. We have now over 4,000,000 people, whereas they have a population of not much more than 1,100,000. On the other hand, the negro population of South Africa is 5,000,000, whereas our coloured population is not only small, but rapidly decreasing. The real difference between South Africa and Australia is that we have reached a further stage of development. As a consequence, they are still a great consuming nation. In spite of their comparatively, limited population, their imports range at about Â£ 9 , 0 00,00 0 per annum. They are large purchasers, not only of manufactured goods, but of agricultural products and frozen meat, and of many other articles which we have progressed sufficiently to be able to produce. Our exports to South Africa to-day represent a total value of Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually. I take their gross total from fhe last available returns for six months, doubling them upon the assumption that the other half makes no difference worth mentioning. _Our trade is already large, but not nearly as large as it might be. Our most dangerous competitors are in the Argentine. It is from that country that frozen and chilled meats are being received in large quantities, whilst grain supplies and other agricultural produce are commencing to flow in.

The only concessions made by us to which it seems necessary to call attention are those upon sugar, spirits, tobacco, and wine. It is proposed to admit spirits at the Excise rates levied here, plus 2 J per cent. I have already explained the proposals with regard to sugar, which will be subject also to, practically, our Excise rates. The principal reduction made is that upon wine. The present duty of 6s. per gallon upon wine in bulk is to be reduced to 2s., and the duty upon wine in bottles is to be brought down from 8s. to 3s. per gallon. We also, make a concession of od. per lb. Africa in these particular items is considerable, but the exports as yet are trifling. ' Sugar is, so far as I know, grown only in Natal. The total production last year amounted to 19,000 tons, and 15,000 tons were imported. Consequently, there will have to be some considerable development of local production before any sugar is exported to Australia. Tobacco is produced in three States, Natal, Cape Colony, informed that the preference of 9d. per lb. is not likely to lead to the importation of tobacco from South Africa to supply the needs of the small minority who prefer the peculiar flavour of what is known as Boer tobacco. The wine production of the Cape is 5,686,000 gallons, which is almost exactly the same as our country we are not likely, to have wine brought here, except it may be to meet the cessions from them on these articles.",15,William Lyne

But having regard to the circumstances of this particular case, it appears to us that none of the preferences that we are asked to concede are likely to operate injuriously upon Australian industry. No doubt there will be an importation of products which are at present peculiar to South Africa, but these are not numerous, and they come very little into competition with any established industry of our own. As time goes on they will probably become greater competitors in our market. naturally look forward to that. present time-owino to difference between our stages of development-South Africa is one of our most profitable markets. This reciprocal treaty will tend to make that market still more profitable. South Africans, having adiusted their Tariff with the intention of giving preferences, are perfectly prepared to see transferred to us from the Argentine, and from other foreign competitors, any share of their trade that we are able to gain. In a similar spirit we ought to be willing to concede an advantage to them over any of their trading rivals.

Any alteration which may be made in this agreement in future will, I hope, not emanate from South Africa.

In this connection I think that our experience in ehdiaavburfmg. to ratify a reciprocal Tariff agreement with New Zealand is a most instructive one. We are now told that we must raise our Tariff before we can obtain reciprocity with that country.

Mr ""JOSEPH COOK -Henry George does not advocate anything of the kind. Such a theory is not urged by anybody except protectionists. They appear to understand much more about free-trade than do free-traders themselves, and it traders are upon the public platform. At any irate the honourable member for Laanecoorie will concede that between New Zealand and Australia there ought to exist the closest possible relationship-tradin g relationship as well as any other. The honourable member for Bland is constantlypointing to the fact that the social condithe reciprocal tions in New Zealand are better than those which obtain in Australia. If the wages rates which prevail in the manufacturing industries there are as high as our own, and if the general standard of living is equal to our own, why should we have any fiscal barriers between the two countries ? I say that if we approach each other as protectionists in an attempt to make concessions as a matter of neighbourly feeling, it is not likelv that we shall succeed. Buti f we approach each other with the feeling that these fiscal barriers ought not to exist, and that they ought to be substantially reduced upon either side, I believe that we shall be able to make an arrangement which will confer lasting benefit upon all concerned. However, the logic of events alone will teach us wisdom in these matters, and experience is already showing the truth of what I said the other day, and of what all investigators have ascertained, namely, that by retaliatory methods we cannot lever down the Tariffs ofi other countries. Human nature will prevent that. As.long as we adopt a protective view we cannot expect to obtain a satisfactorv reciprocal agreement with New Zealand.

If ever a man has been kind to another, the Prime Minister has been kind to the Minister of Trade and Customs. He has been doing his work for him during the whole of the session, and supplying the House with information that he seemed incapable of affording us. Minister of Trade and Customs, therefore, had every reason for expressing, his unbounded admiration and love for his chief. I should like first of all to point out the anomalous way in which we proceed with the making of these treaties. Instead of arranging some intelligent and simple plan of preference, as the rest of the Empire is doing, we are adding all sorts of perplexities' to our Tariff. Canada, for instance, simply said, first of all. that her Tariff was so-and-so, and then made an all-round reduction to the rest of the Empire, conditionally on the rest of the Empire doing the same. South Africa has acted in the same way. Tariff for New Zealand, another for Great Britain, and still another for South Africa. those coming from South Africa are dutiThese several Tariffs must be mutually destructive, and the items will have to be revised. Senator Pulsford points out that the terms of the preference trade agreements with New Zealand and South Africa are contradictory that, whereas, under the New Zealand Tariff, we have a duty of 3d. per lb. on butter, and 4d. as against all other countries, the schedule now before us provides that in the case of South Africa the duties shall be 2-}d. Surely South Africa is ""another country."" Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The New Zealand agreement gives special rights to both contracting powers. that kind does not rectify the anomaly; it merely authorizes it . ' These anomalies ought not to exist. They must result in all-round irritation, and great confusion at the Customs House. Whatever we do for South Africa we ought to do for New Zealand, and whatever we do for New Zealand we ouglif to do for South Africa, Canada, and the other parts of the Empire. We ought to as much as possible, simplify the ; Tariff. The Government sesm, however, to concentrate their attention upon the making of one agreement at a time, regardless of the extent to which its conditions may affect others that have been made. For instance, under the New Zealand preferential reciprocal agreement, raisins from that Colony are free, and from all other countries are dutiable at 3d. per lb. Under this agreement, however, raisins from South Africa will be dutiable at i ^ d . per lb. And so with regard to currants-fre e to New Zealand, 2d. in the case of imports from all other countries, and under this agreeThe ment i d . per lb. in the case of imports from South. Africa. I suppose that South Africa is "" another "" country. New Zealand there is a special clause exempting South Africa from its terms. that does not rectify the anomaly. It merely authorizes it, and, by virtue of that authorization, the Prime Minister is pro-' ceeding to enact these anomalies. Let me mention a few other items which appear in the agreement with New Zealand, as well as in that now before us. Oats, for example, are dutiable at is. 3d. when they But the Commonwealth builds one come from New Zealand, and at is. 6d. when they come from other countries; but able at is. i i d .

If we continue in this waymaking conflicting treaties, we shall add to the confusion at the Customs House, and ultimately have a Tariff which will be the laughing-stock of the world. It is far better that we should proceed as other parts of the Empire have done, by granting a simple all-round, reduction of duties on imports f :om the rest of the British Empire. There are some strange anomalies in this agreement, and the only reason why one may consent to them is that the trade to which they relate is either one-sided, or does not exist. There are a number of items in the schedule as to' which there is no trade between South Africa and Australia. I do not know whether the preference will cause a trade in them to grow up, but I am afraid that it will not do much in that direction. There is no trade in fish between South Africa and Australia, no trade in currants, and hardly any trade in raisins-althoug h there is a. possibility, I should hope,'of one developing.

Nevertheless, it is well to point siderations have led to their failure to grant us any concession in respect of them.

This could be avoided if we followed the lead set us by Canada and South Africa, and made a simple mutual proposal for preference, instead of conflicting arrangements with various portions of the Empire. Still, we are now taking a step in the right direction. We are giving a preference to people who are on the same social plane as we are, who have the same ideals of civilization, and are, in fact, part of the race to which we belong. Therefore, I hail it as tending to bring closer together, by improving their trading relations, peoples of the same stock and of the same aspirations.

I support the treatv absolutely, and should be prepared to support almost any proposal for preferential trade with any other part of the Empire. Some honourable members seem to think that, in making agreements of this kind, we should get everything, and surrender nothing. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -We come as near to that position in the agreement under discussion as we shall ever be. are really in the nature of bargains, one country giving concessions to another in return for similar treatment. Unless the Commonwealth Parliament is .prepared to offer advantages to compensate for those that it asks for, we cannot get preferential trade. One cannot have his cake and eat it , and one cannot levy high rates of Customs duties on the productions of other countries and expect those countries to lower their Tariff against our productions. ential proposals were framed on that plan. MrM c WILLIAMS opposed to the spirit underlying those proposals. Their object seemed to be chiefly to increase our rates of duty. I would, however, rather accent them than have no preference. We shall never be able to make an agreement with anv other British communitv by which we shall gain more and lose less than under this agreement with South Africa. In manv items Tasmania, as I have already pointed out. obtains practically a free gif t of trade. It has been brought under my notice that the South African preference to the mother country, small though it was, was sufficient to affect the business of Australia, and led to the termination of Tasmanian contracts. It is especially desirable that our trading arrangements with South Africa should be on a satisfactory footing, because a large number of vessels call at the ports of that country on their way to England, and before the South African preference to Great Britain, many steamers taking cargoes of frui t from Tasmania shipped them with the right to land them at South Africa, if the market was likely to be more favorable there than in England. I am not discussing the proposal from a State point of view, but I mention this matter because I am more intimately acquainted with the affairs of Tasmania than with those of the other States. Tasmania will gain under the agreement in respect to her two primary I understood from the Minister of Trade and Customs that canned fruits are included under the heading of confectionery. cludes cocoa, chocolate, honey, jams, jellies and similar articles; fruits of a l l kinds, bottled, tinned, or otherwise preserved, including candied peel, form a separate item. In each case there is a preference of Â£d., although the rates of duty are not the same. MrM c WILLIAMS I regard this agreement as the first step towards securing preferential trade throughout the Empire. In my opinion, the Empire can provide for the wants of its own people, and I am prepared to give reasonable concessions to bring about the greatest idea of modern British statesmanship-a n Imperial Zollverein. I have no sympathy with the foreigner, whether he be German, American, or of any other nation, who shuts his ports against our goods. Believing this to be the first step in the direction of securing the Empire preference to which I refer, I I am altogether shall give it my hearty support, and I congratulate the Prime Minister on having brought to a succesful conclusion the negotiations in regard to it . Mr G. B.

It is impossible for us under present conditions to attain our ideal, namely, interImperial free-trade, and it is well for us to take what steps we can in the right direction. Until the social and industrial conditions throughout the Empire approach something like uniformity it will be impossible for us to bring about absolutely free commercial intercourse between its several parts. The methods of production depend so largely upon local conditions, and these are so diverse, that it would be impossible to have all at once a system of free-trade within the Empire which would not result most disastrously to every portion of it-wit h the exception, perhaps, of the mother country. I admit that these sectional agreements are objectionable, but they are better than nothing. It is well that we should make a start, because I believe that as we proceed many of the difficulties that now present themselves will disappear, and that we shall eventually be able to take down our barriers altogether. In my view, only a. protectionist can afford a real preference. sistently give a preference. I have always been opposed to the erection of Tariff barriers between the various States. I strongly resisted the stock tax in Victoria, because I regarded it as an interference with the freedom of intercourse which should exist between the States. Some ten years ago I brought forward a nroposal in the Victorian Assembly for a preferential arrangement between Victoria and Oueensland in respect to sugar, but constitutional difficulwas altogether apart from the suggestion ties arose, and my scheme could not be carried into effect. Prime Minister upon the successful result of his persistent efforts to bring about preferential trade. I believe that we are now entering upon a new era of commercial reciprocity within the Empire. agree with fhe honourable member for Laanecoorie that a free-trader cannot consistently vote for any preferential scheme, or join in a reciprocal agreement. When the Cobden treaty was introduced in 1861, it [213] was regarded as a step towards that complete free-trade the achievement of which was the ambition of Cobden. I was one of give a preference by imposing a duty. presupposing that free-trade is already in existence. We have to deal with the facts as they face us. The honourable member postulates an impossible position when he says that you can only give a preference by imposing a duty. We, as free-traders, can consistently vote for any preferences which will modify the existing conditions in the direction of free-trade. free-trade you cannot give preferences. place, it will be time enough to howl. So far as the Government proposal operates in the direction of reducing the duties, it can be consistently supported by free-traders'. I hope that the arrangement now being entered into will be attended by the substantial benefits which the Prime Minister anticipates. In any case, we ought to sympathize with the efforts of South Africa to bring about healthy reciprocal relations between the different parts of the Empire. It was at' the Convention of 1887 that Mr. Hofmeyer, the representative of Cape Colony, made the first suggestion in the direction of preferentia-I trade. He suggested, I think, that preferences might be A free-trader cannot congranted by reducing duties in favour of products imported from British Possessions.

This of Mr Hofmeyer that we might make a I congratulate the mutual reduction in respect of imports from various parts of the Empire in order lo encourage Inter-Imperial trade.

Between 1899 and 1904 the imports of dutiable goods from the United States increased to about the same extent as did the imports of dutiable goods from Great Britain, upon which a preference was granted.

Sydney) [12.14] I quite agree with those who say that some of the preferences proposed under this agreement are so slight that they are not likely to affect trade in any way.

That was declined, and the negotiations proceeded until the arrangement embodied in the schedule was arrived at. extraordinary and, from a business point of> view, inexplicable differences. I agree with the honourable member for Gippsland that the making of these separate agreements, the terms of which vary to a veryconsiderable extent, is likely to lead to much confusion. For instance, if all the reciprocal agreements that have been before Parliament this session were adopted, we should have four separate Tariffs and three different rates prevailing in respect of the same classes of goods. We should have one rate as against imports from New Zealand, another as against imports from Great Britain, still another appKing to imports from South Africa, and the ordinary Tariff applying to imports from other countries. :people to acquaint themselves with the complexities of such a Tariff system. Another objection is that one can never trace the effect of these rates; they are too complicated to follow. Under one Tariff agreement we grant a preference to a part of the Empire, and under another we take it away. Tariff schedule, instead of reducing duties as we have done in this case, we allow them to remain unaltered, so far as imports from Great Britain are concerned, and increase them as against the foreigner. Then [REPRESENTATIVES.] Commonwealth and under the preferential trade agreement with New Zealand we propose to grant concessions to that Colony by increasing duties, not only as against foreign countries, but as against Great Britain. pire. other parts of the Empire. Had the New Zealand preferential agreement been accepted, the duties as against South Africa, which we now propose to reduce, would have been increased. The Prime Minister must admit that this system must lead to confusion, and that we ought to deal with In the whole question on broader lines. South Africa has adopted a uniform system of dealing with all parts of the Empire, and is prepared to grant uniform concessions I do not know how these to all parts of the Empire that are ready to reciprocate. That is an understandable bargaining. We position to take up. It removes complications, and means really an Empire preference. But whilst we, on the one hand, grant a preference to Great Britain, on the other we impose penalties against her in order to give a preference to another part of the Empire. We are thus doing what is absolutely opposed to our professed policy, and are giving rise to extraordinary anomalies. From the Prime Minister's stand-point, it is fortunate that the New Zealand Tariff agreement has been rejected. Difficulties which he and the late Prime Minister of New Zealand created have thus been removed. We have freed ourselves from the raising of duties as against the rest of the Empire, and the lowering of them in favour of New Zealand. I would merely point out that we now have before us two preferential schemes, based on entirely different lines. In the one case the ordinary duties are retained against Great Britain, but are increased as against other countries, and inI t is almost impossible for the creased in respect of such items that the imports from Great Britain are not likely to be affected to anv extent. In this case, however, the ordinary duties are reduced in favour of South Africa. The Minister will find it difficult to defend this differential treatment. For instance, jams and jellies coming from South Africa will be Under the British preferential admitted at a rate 25 per cent, below the present Tariff, whereas the same commodities coming from Great Britain will have to bear tbe f u l l duty.

It has been found in consolidating our electoral law that the incorporation of an amendment relating to advertisements agreed to on the motion of the honourable member for North Sydney would give a meaning different from that intended if inserted without parentheses. Tlie Bill provides for the omission of the words originally inserted, and their' re-insertion in parentheses. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and reported without amendment; report adopted. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill read a third time. Sitting suspended from 12.43 to 2.30 p.m. are as follow : That this House is of the opinion that, as the introduction of the microbes proposed by Dr. Danysz for the destruction of rabbits in the State of New South Wales may prove inimical to human and other animal life of Australia, it should not be permitted except for laboratory experiments until such time as Parliament or the Government, if Parliament is not in session, is satisfied that outside experiments will be harmless. Dr. Danysz has been conducting his experiments in Dr. Tidswell's laboratory, and that it is considered desirable that Dr. Danysz should transfer his operations to Broughton Island. Dr. Tidswell .states that so far the virus that Dr. Danysz uses has proved to be deadly to rabbits, but not communicable by contagion, so far as is known, to any animals brought into contact with those that have 'received the virus. But it is dangerous, with inoculation, to two (ADVERTISEMENTS) or three forms of animal life. Dr. Tidswell concludes that under the circumstances sufficient is known as to the effect of the pasteurella that is being employed to permit of its use at Broughton Island, not absolutely without danger, but without any -but remote danger. The time has arrived when the experiments must be conducted out of the laboratory, and in the open air, if they are to be of any value at all. In the opinion of this independent and competent expert, it would be judicious to permit experiments to be carried on at Broughton Island. In view of the resolution which was passed by this House, it is only fair to remind honourable members now that their silence will be taken to give consent, if no opposition be raised to action being taken upon Dr. Tidswell's report. Dr. Tidswell, who is a man of long experience, and holds the position of Assistant Medicar Officer to the Government of New South Wales, and Micro-biologist to the Board of Health, saysThe work which has been done, and which isherein recorded and available for criticism > seems to me to afford reasonable assurance that",27,Machinery Bill

133,Mr Deaki N (Ballarat,"Minister ofthere would be no danger from such experiments iieing carried out upon Broughton Island. Then he goes on to give details of his work. He saysThe investigation of all possible agencies of .transmission being out of the question, a selection had to be made of such as would be most likely to come into practical operation. Experiments were therefore performed with representatives of carnivorous birds (crows, seagulls, magpies, and butcher-birds), and with the elusive . In most of these cases the precise conditionsrat, as being the commoner animals which could conceivably convey the virus from the island to the mainland. Additionally, observations were made upon fowls, pigeons, and sheep as types of animals whose interests specially needed watching; upon guinea-pigs, as test animals with familiar proclivities, and upon rabbits, as a matter of course. For specal purposes use was made of a monkey, and of small native fcirds. The experiments that were made were numerous and of great interest, particularly to professional men. guinea pig stand the test? in the inoculation tests, crows and rats exhibited a natural immunity, guinea pigs, -seagulls, and magpies behaved irregularly, and pigeons and rabbits died in every case, while the state of the fowl and the butcher bird was left indefiniteIt has already been seen that the animals which became infected by inoculation were not attacked when fed with the virus, nor when placed in contact with rabbits sick or dead of the disease caused by it. Nevertheless, it is -conceivable that a single individual here and there might become inoculated through a wound or otherwise; just as here and there an individual human being gets what is popularly known as "" blood poisoning"" through a cut or wound. Then he raises the question whether the virus would be altered , in character by 1 passage through the body of birds or animals. The conclusion he arrives at isIn view of the results recorded in this section, there would appear to be no reason to apprehend -chance a bird became attacked with the virus by inoculation.. He also saysAlthough birds of prey feeding upon the carcasses of infected rabbits did not become attacked, it might still happen that they could transport the virus by ingesting it and subsequently passing it out again with their excrements. Tests were also made as to whether flies could communicate the disease, but the season was not favorable for the purpose. were the most effective means of spreading the infection. The proof required of' infection of any of the animals under observation was their illness and death, together with the subsequent recovery of the virus from their bodies. Insistence upon this proof is necessary, because in any large series of animals kept in captivity, perhaps under conditions quite unnatural for them, some mortality is to be expected, quite apart from any experiments performed upon them. . . . previous resistance, long interval between exposure and death, obvious injuries, &c -were such that the death was clearly not attributable to infection. Nevertheless, the valid scientific negation-the lack of the microbes in the bodies-wa s obtained in all cases save as regards the butcher-birds, whose destruction was actually witnessed. Dr. Tidswell's report is summed up in two paragraphs on the first page, which read as follows:The whole course of the experiments, therefore, revealed the Danysz virus as one which, far as natural means of infection were concerned, remarkably innocuous towards the other kinds of animals exposed to it. Amongst these animals were those which seemed most likely to have opportunities for conveying the virus from the island to the mainland. In view of the total outcome of the observations, the chance of any such conveyance must be regarded as remote. In my judgment, there are many more observations needed before the virus could be pronounced safe for distribution broadcast over the land; many native animals to be tested, much time to be given to the question of modification of virulence. But it is unnecessary to go into these questions until the efficacy of the virus as a destructive agent for rabbits has been determined, a matter which can only be settled by properly conducted field experiments. The work which has been done, and which is herein recorded and available for criticism, seems to me to afford reasonable assurance that there would be no danger from such experiments being carried out upon Brouehton Island. I hope honourable members will understand that all that is proposed is to carry out increased infectiousness, if by these experiments to a further stage, and still under observation, upon Broughton Island. It is not proposed to permit them to be conducted upon the mainland. Dr. Tidswell says that before that can be done much more research will have to be carried on. After a careful examination, Dr. Tidswell has arrived at the final conclusion that there is reasonable assurance that there will be no danger from such experiments being carried on at Broughton Island. periments be controlled?

By increasing the value of our land we increase, to a very great extent, our national asset, and in a way that must be felt by every man, whether he is the owner or occupier of land or a worker. sincerely hope that the Government will assist the development of these experiments to the fullest extent, at the same time taking every precaution to safeguard the health of the people. I feel, with the honourable member for Laanecoorie and others, that one of the first duties of the Parliament is to guard the public health.

I , therefore, sire to again address to the Prime Minister the question which.I put to him last night respecting the regulations made under the Commerce Act in regard to the export of butter. I do not wish to be considered unduly persistent, but the season is just opening, and the necessities of the situation demand an early settlement of this question, since it materially affects the export ofi butter. Up to a certain point, the reply which the Prime Minister gave last night was satisfactory, but the honourable and learned gentleman went a little too far when he said, towards the close of his remarks, that the arrangement which we suggested would be allowed.to continue for only a certain time. Something definite is necessary. The understanding arrived at between the Minister and the exporters, as to certificates, is satisfactory. I wish to know whether the arrangement is to continue for a few weeks or for the season? If any alteration is to be made in future, due notice should be given, because this matter is a very serious one to exporters. Some of us have long ago made up our minds that it is about time to get back to our constituencies, and those who represent electoral divisions in the larger States must make their arrangements for visiting them at least a week or a fortnight in advance. Therefore, I ask the Prime Minister when the prorogation is likely to take place, and whether any new business of importance is to be brought forward this session? No one thought, a fortnight ago, that we should be here to-day, with so much unfinished business on tbe notice-paper. I am always loth to leave when there is important business before Parliament; but, much as we may desire to stay, we have now pretty well reached the limit. like to know from the Minister of Home Affairs when the electoral rolls for the State of Viotoria will be ready for distribution?

During the inquiry of the Hawker Board last year it was complained that the officer commanding at Queenscliff would not permit men reasonable opportunities to attend these examinations, and as a result, the Minister promised that men, on paying a reasonable discharge, fee, should be allowed to do so. I am told, however, that seventeen men'who applied for permission to present themselves for police examination were refused, on the ground that they had not had three years' service. I hope that the Minister will inquire into the matter. The regulations provide for men being discharged on paying a fee, fixed by the regulations, to cover the cost of training and uniform, and other expenses incurred on their behalf by the Government. If men are not permitted to present themselves for the police examinations, they, on arriving at; the age of twenty-five years, lose the opportunity of bettering their positions and obtaining employment for which they are eminently suitable. dent of the Executive Council) [3-14] I will make the inquiries which the honourable and learned member desires.

That arrangement is embodied in a provisional regulation passed to-day.
