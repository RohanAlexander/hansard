What results were achieved by the search mentioned in the report to which I have referred ? investigation officers we should have found by now the stolen or forged dc-cuuients about which so much has been aaid recently. The investigation service is much smaller than the report in the ' Sunday Telegraph suggests, [t is true that we have been trying to re-capture the escaped Italian and German prisoners of war and ex-internees, and we intend to deport them from Australia when we apprehend them. lowed to remain in this country. C gave ample opportunity tc those who had escaped to surrender themselves. I made two announcements that if they surrendered they would be sent back to It a l y or Germany, as the case required, and could then apply for re-admissicn to Australia as migrants, in which event their applications would be considered. A t the same time. I stated that those who did not surrender would be deported summarily and no application for their re-admission to this country could be considered. We are now seeking those prisoners of war and internees who did not surrender. Only yesterday the Acting Leader of the Onposition asked a question concerning two of them, Duerkop and Schmidt. I am referring not to the human bloodhound from New England, but to the particular C a n the Minister for persons whose arrest we desire to effect.

Government members may smile but honourable member must ccmplete bis -question. Minister prepared to consider further the matter of providing boat harbour facilities for the fishing fleets'? I point out that it is of no use to send a newsletter monthly to the fishermen in my electorate telling them how to catch more fish, which the Minister said should be done, if the Commonwealth is not prepared to do something to protect boats which they -require to carry on that work. -honourable member's question has said that increased efforts should be made to cateh more fish and has tried to advise them how to do it. honourable member must cease interrupting; when he asks a question he should -at least have the courtesy to listen to a reply. ally disturbed at the damage suffered by the fisherman in those storms. As I understand the situation, the responsibility for providing adequate harbour accommodation on the coasts of the various States is the duty of the respecprovided that they are in such contive State governments, and not that of the Australian Government. I understand that tliere is provision in the Pederal Aid Eoads and Works Act, which is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, whereby in certain circumstances mon^y may be allocated for the provision of shelters for fishing fleets. If the honourable gentleman were to direct a qnestion to my colleague regardingthat aspect of the matter, I am sure that he would be given a most satisfactory ;answer. from the Western Australian Onion Marketing Board a communication concerning the export of onions. Is the Minister aware that Victorian onions imported into Western Australia are being exported from Eremantle to Singapore, with the approval of the export division of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture? Is he further aware that, because these onions were pruned of quite lengthy shoots before shipment, they would continue to shoot during the journey to Singapore, where they undoubtedly would arrive in bad condition? As Western Australian onion-growers were financially affected last year as a result of the Ceylon authorities having placed an embargo on Australian onions, because the export of poor quality onions had -been permitted from the eastern States, will the Minister investigate this matterand ensure that steps will be taken to prevent damage to Australian markets, to the detriment of the Western Australian onion-growers ? would it be constitutional, for the Australian Government to attempt to prevent the shipment of onions from one State to another, and I am sure that the honourable member will agree that such action should not be taken. In view of the fact that the onions mentioned were Victorian onions, which have established a good reputation overseas, I see no reason to prohibit their free export from another State, dition as to be fit for export. But1 remind the honourable gentleman that inspection of onions to determine fitness for export is carried out. by officers of the Departments of Agriculture in the respective States. If there has been any remissness in this instance, it will be a matter for consideration whether it has been due to neglect on the part of the State officers. However, I should not imagine that there has been any neglect on the part of such officers. I shall make further inquiries into the matter.",14,Kscaped Interneesan D Prisoners Of War

I am ' also informed that that aeroplane left Australia empty. I ask the Minister for Immigration whether these are the true facts? statements are true. ""Was that aeroplane under charter to the Australian Government, and was it permitted to go empty to Italy to bring Italian migrants to this country? If so, can the Minister inform the House of the circumstances, and explain how it was that Italian migrants were brought by air to Australia ptjof to British people who are waiting in England to come here? Why was that aeroplane permitted to fly empty rather than carry passengers, or food parcels to Great Britain? a purist in language, but a statement is either a fact or not a fact. If a thing for Immigration say whether it is the is true it must be a fact, and the honourable gentleman has not got his facts right. I am sorry that he has raised this matter in such a way as to create the suggestion of xenophobia in the minds of some people in this country. No aeroplane has been chartered by the Australian Government to bring any foreign nationals or any British migrants to Australia. We have used the magnificent Convair aeroplanes which Trans-Australia Airlines purchased, to bring British migrants to Australia. I understand, subject to correction by my colleague the Minister for Air, that two Convairs are leaving Great Britain today with British migrants for this country. Aeroplanes do leave Australia under charter to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and other non-governmental bodies to bring people here. Those aeroplanes leave this country empty because the Australian Government is not going to allow charter flights to interfere with the ordinary activities of Qantas Empire Airways Limited and such organizations planes be used to transport food parcels to Great Britain? they are used for that purpose, but in no instance are they permitted to carry passengers. People who travel by those aeroplanes have their fares paid by relatives in Australia. No governmental assistance is afforded to them at all. It is purely a private deal. I am glad to see those migrants coming here. They are coming to relatives who have guaranteed them accommodation in their own homes and undertaken to And them employment in this country. Many of them are going to work in the sugar industry in Queensland. Others will go to the irrigation areas, wnere they will help to produce food which, if not needed in Australia, will be available for shipment to Great Britain. We want many more people in Australia. If the honourable member proposes to ask any more questions of this kind I advise him to come and see me first. intention of the Government to transport 100 migrants from Britain to Australia on the delivery flights of four of the five Convair aircraft that were purchased by Trans-Australia Airlines? Will each of these migrants be required to pay a fare of £260 sterling, or any fare at all? If so, will the Minister inform the House why the Government considers it to be necessary to turn the transport of migrants into a money-making venture for Trans-Australia Airlines, and why desirable migrants who cannot afford to pay such fares are not given first preference in the allocation of seats in aircraft travelling to Australia on delivery flights? reply to the honourable member for Parramatta a few moments ago, the Australian Government is using the magnificent Convair aircraft that were purchased by Trans-Australia Airlines for the purpose of bringing, on their initial flight to Australia, some migrants to this country.

This is not a nioney-nwiking venture. Trans-Australia Airlines? paid to Trans-Australia Airlines. If we can utilize seats in these aircraft to bring gate to the conference convened in more people to Australia, it is right and proper that we should do so. It would be ridiculous if the aircraft travelled from thc United Kingdom to Australia without passengers when they could be filled with people who can afford to pay the fare that I have indicated. The Australian Government is under no obligation to fly any person to Australia free of charge. The migrants who come to this country under the assisted passages schemes pay something, and the British and Australian Governments also pay something. There is nothing in the mistaken idea of the honourable member that we are trying to make Trans-Australia Airlines pay by bringing people from the United Kingdom in these four Convair aircraft. Trans-Australia Airlines is becoming a very profitable organization, and will shortly be paying its way. As a matter of fact, it will soon beat its competitors out of the skies entirely. We shall bring as many migrants as we can by air to this country under this scheme and T also hope, under another scheme that is at present being negotiated. I am sorry if the honorabie gentleman feels that we should work on such an equalitarian basis that, although a person can afford to pay for a passage from the United Kingdom to Australia by air, he must nevertheless take his place at the back of a queue of persons who are waiting for berths on ships. representing the Postmaster-General say whether it is true that Dr. Keith Barry, federal controller of programmes for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, has been nominated by the Australian Government to represent Australia at a meeting convened in Paris by Unesco of broadcasting experts representing eighteen nations?

In both cases those immediately concerned had expressed a preference to remain in the TJnited States and their respective governments attempted to force them back to their own countries. CalweU attitude any different from that adopted by the Eussians? Equally grave in the substance of the charges levelled by the Eussian women is that onr girls are this Minister of the Chifley Government against the TJnited States administration. The American authorities have been accused of breaking an agreement, but, so far, no evidence has been produced that such an agreement ever existed. As to tlie existence of an agreement we have only the say-so of this Minister of the Chifley Government. Yet the American State Department, the American Army and four other United States Government departments have been directly involved by these wild, unsubstantiated charges of had faith. No Minister of any Australian government has the right to sign any agreement interfering with the free movement of Australian nationals. This is not tbe Soviet Union, and thank God, we are not yet behind the iron curtain. So, if the Chifley Government signed any agreement with an officer of the American Army, it did so in complete violation of ihe constitutional rights of the Australian tralian girls were made not by the Parcitizens involved. That phase of this country's history ceased with the ending of the Kanaka trade. The liberties of Australian nationals are not to be bartered away hy a Minister or by a government as if our people were merely cattle. By recklessly accusing the American Government of violating the text of an agreement, and by directly involving responsible American public servants employed at the American Embassy at Canberra, without a scintilla of evidence to support these charges, the Chifley Government is destroying the goodwill developed between the two nations by the close association of war. Such action is a slur on Labour's own former leader, Mr Curtin, who offered the hand of comradeship to the United itr. Lang. States of America when he appealed for help in his broadcast directed to that nation when things looked black in the How can we South Pacific. He, too, made commitments that are being recklessly violated by the actions of the Minister for Immigration. The Chifley Government is repudiating the commitments made by the Curtin Government. If the Minister gets his way, and these women are dragged out of jobs in the United States, Is the it will be at the cost of the loss of American public opinion. The only difference between the Australian girls and typists and the Russians were teachers. These lime-lighting tactics of the Minister come at a most inopportune time. They happen at a time when grave doubts are being expressed by the United States Government whether Australia is a good security risk. Apart altogether from the source of certain documents produced in this cliamber recently, there is certain knowledge that their contents were authentic and that the Government of the United States has its doubts of us. The United States Government is fully informed of Communist activities in thiF country. Its congressional committee inf vestigating communism recently reported that some of the leading enemies of the United States of America came from Australia. The American Embassy in Canberra would be remiss in its duty if it failed to report to Washington that the decisions in relation to these Ausliament but by the Minister for Immigration and the Chifley Government. If these matters are not reported it is well that this Parliament should make clear to the United States of America that the Parliament as a whole does not approve of the Minister's actions. There is a feeling in the United States of America that Australia is not to be trusted and that the Australian Government and the Minister for Immigration are irresponsible. The Minister should be curbed immediately. His impetuosity should be restrained. He should be prevented from further injuring the good relations that exist between the two nations. He should withdraw his affronts to the American State Department. The Australian girls should be allowed to remain in the United States of America without ministerial interference. urgently, the Chifley Government should clear out the Communists, that it admits are employed in key security departments. Then the way will be clear to re-establish good relations with America. Finally, is the Ministerf o r Immigration in charge of the international affairs policy of Australia? I challenge the Prime Minister to say whether he endorses the Minister's action. Has the right honourable gentleman abdicated in favour of the Ministerf o r Immigration? If the Prime Minister remains silent, it is obvious that the Ministerf or Immigration directs the Government and that his policy prevails. The Parliament should be informed whether the Ministerf or Immigration consulted the Cabinet on this matter or whether both the Cabinet and the Prime Minister are dragged in as consenting parties to every brawl in which the Minister involves the Government. Finally, in particular, I desire to know whether the Prime Minister and the Cabinet endorse the following statement made by the Ministeri n this House last week:There would huve been no trouble if the United States Army si uthorities had honoured the obligation they had entered into . I see no reason why I should make it easier fur anybody, particularly the representatives "" f a great power, to escape the obligations which tbey entered into with the Government of this country. The Prime Minister must either answer that, or be silent. If he is silent, then the our relations with America by reprecountry will know the inference to draw from his silence. for Informatio n and Ministerf o r I m m i sentatives in Australia, should have effect gration) 111.30] -According to information that I have received, the motion which the cliamber is debating was intended to be placed before the House yesterday. It a]jpears, however, that the honourable meinber for Eeid( Mr Lang) was not able to obtain the necessary support from the Opposition to make it advisable for him to submit the motion at thnt stage. There has been a considerable amonnt of maiucuvring around the corridors of the House to ensure that there would be a sufficient number of members opposite who would rise to support such a worthless and ridiculous motion. Even more gestapo been at work again ? not one member of the Liberal party rose to support the motion, and that those members of the Australian Country party who did so were so ashamed of their action that instead of standing straight up like men they rose in simian fashion, using their hands to propel themselves upwards. H'onorable members inti rjv<;ting. j has been placed formally before the House, is without substance and i * designed, not to promote good relations with the United States of America, but rather to poison them. Those honourable members of the Australian Country party who have lent themselves to this man03uvre to-day have every reason to be ashamed of the part they have played. Let us consider the content of this motion. It deals with the question of the alleged impairment of friendly relations between the United States of America and Australia. The girls are dragged in only as an afterthought, the whole emphasis being placed upon the alleged impairment of good relationship. As I stated recently, Australia's relations with America are so good that we can afford to be perfectly frank in discussions relating to our mutual problems. Wc have not, damaged senting to the United States authorities that agreements, expressed and implied, which were entered into by their repregiven to them. one-sided. perfectly frank at all times, and the American authorities also have always been frank and helpful.

71,Mr Calwell,"AV e on our part areThere were both oral and other agreements between Mr John Minter and American army officers and myself. Everybody knew that the arrangement was that the girls should leave Australia for a period of six months to serve with the American forces and then be returned to Australia at the expense of the American army. An explicit undertaking was given that during that period of six months the American authorities would train their own girls to take thc places of the Australian girls. The Australian Government did not disturb that arrangement even at the end of six months, but allowed it to continue. Almost two years passed before the Government officially raised the matter of the return of the girls. There would have been no publicity in respect of this matter had it not been for the action of the Melbourne Herald in either ""cracking "" a cable or stealing a telegram and using it as the basis of a story. The information used could only have been obtained from a cablegram from the Australian Government to the Australian Embassy in the United States; or from one sent by that Embassy to the Australian Government. No other document Melbourne Herald could have based its story, and I may state that the Government has not completed its investithe United States of America. The gations as to how the newspaper obtained the information on which its story rested. The proudest day of my life will be that on which I see the editor of the Melbourne Herald in the dock charged under that section of tlie Crimes Act which provides for seven years gaol without the option. I personally would also like to see punishment meted out to other people who have used stolen documents which deal with our relations with the United States of America. As I stated, those girls left Australia with the full knowledge of the conditions attaching'to their employment by the Americans. If tbose conditions were not satisfactory to them they could have said that they did not desire to go. They went however, and they have no right to alter the conditions for the defence of Australia. The prewhich were made between the Governments of Australia and the United States of America, and which were not agreements Mr Calwell. themselves. They knew that the American army would return them in due course to Australia. The American army authorities at Guam returned about 100 Australian men and women who served there with them, and on that occasion, no attempt was made in this house by honourable members opposite or their de facto leader the honourable member for Reid, to drag the poison cart around this chamber and thus impair, or try to impair, our relations with the United States of America. The honourable member for Reid publishes in Sydney a newspaper known as the Century, which is the most violently antiAmerican publication in this country. .During the war, through the columns of this newspaper, the honourable member attacked General MacArthur to as great a degree as the censorship provisions would allow. Mr Deputy Speaker, called the honorahle member for Reid( Mr Lang) to order and declared that he must adhere to the terms of the motion. I submit that the Minister is now departing very widely from its terms. honourable member for Reid spoke of the impairment of relations with Minister is entitled to show that the honourable member's actions in the past were along certain lines, but he is not entitled to deal with that aspect at great length. So far, however, the Minister is in order. the police court tactic of showing the bad faith of the propounder of the motion which refers to the impairment of our friendly relations with the United States of America. The honourable member for Reid is the last person entitled to talk about friendly relations with America because he has never wanted them to continue. He, and others associated witb him, hate the name of America and hate to be reminded of what America has done text on which the honourable member moved his resolution does not exculpate him from his guilt over the war years made with the girls and up till recent times in the matter",22,Recall Of Austealia N Citizens From Oveeseas Formal Motion For Adjournment

74,Mr Calwell,"I have only adoptedof impairing friendly relations with the United States of America. The arguments which he used about a security risk are beside the point. The American authorities, on the ambassadorial level, the military level, the consular level or on any other authoritative level, have never aaid anything to this country restance, to which I have already referred, garding any of the matters canvassed by the honourable member for Reid. The Government has always been proud of its relations with the United States of America, and realizes that without that country's assistance in the Pacific in the year's that lie ahead Ausexpense. tralia has little hope of happiness or prosperity. Australia needs to shelter under the broad wing of the American eagle if it is to survive, and everything that has been done by the Government bas been done in good faith, and with the desire to reach a quick and satisfactory settlement of any problems that may exist between the two countries. The Government's action in asking the American authorities to return those girls to Auswhat the honourable member had in mind. tralia was reasonable and all the attempts made by the press and certain honourable members in this chamber, particularly-some members of the Australian Country party and the honourable member for Reid, to stir up trouble on the issue are damaging to Australia's good name and can only give satisfaction to those who are enemies of both America and Australia. The Government has done nothing of which it has reason to be ashamed. It certainly has not impaired friendly relations with America and has no intention of doing so. Only those who continue, either for political or other reasons, to talk! the nonsense that has been talked here to-day. the press campaign which has played up are guilty of impairing such relations or trying to do so. Mr Gur.LETT -""Will the Minister tell us why it was decided to bring these girls to cause trouble. In conclusion, I conhome? the honourable member that, in the first instance, an agreement was made that the girls were to remain abroad for six months, and, in the meantime, Americans were to be trained to take their places. We allowed those girls to remain abroad for two years. raised the matter now? matter settled because some of the girls now find themselves stranded and are appealing to the Australian Government to bring them back. In one unhappy inwe shall probably be involved in heavy expenditure in returning the girl to Australia. I have not the slightest doubt that ultimately all those girls will approach the Australian Government and ask to be brought back at its make a new agreement with them ? does. not run away from its agreements, and it accepts full responsibility for what it does. The honourable member is suggesting that the Government might very well adopt the attitude of saying to the girls, "" You are over there now, and it does not matter to us what happens to you"". I had in mind. I was thinking of the way in which service personnel are discharged after a war. authorities have not expressed any disagreement with or dissent from the action taken by the Australian Government. If there is any concern in the minds of American authorities it is at the matter, not in order to serve the interests of the girls or to, improve relations between the United States of America and this country, but in order gratulate members of the Liberal party on their sanity, political acumen and good sense in having refrained from associating themselves with the motion now before the House, which was initiated by the de facto Leader of the Australian Country party, and who may also be the de facto Leader of the Opposition.",23,Recall Of Austealia N Citizens From Oveeseas Formal Motion For Adjournment

83,Mr Calwell,"The AmericanLas been an interesting experience to hear the Minister for Information and Immigration ( Mr Calwell) defend the action of the Government, which has ordered the girls to return to Australia, and to listen to his assertion that at any time the Government of Australia or of any other country has the right to say to any of its citizens working abroad, ""Now is the time when you must come home"", because no honourable member has had more to say about human rights -than the Minister. It is ironical that the Minister should adopt such an attitude, because he is the Minister responsible for attracting people to Australia from other countries. How will the Department of Immigration function, and how will the Government settle this country, if governments abroad, act as be has acted in this matter? How we are going to attract people to Australia and keep them here if other governments are to be free to say to the Australian Government at any time. "" You must send all our nationals home""? example of that when the Communist Government of Yugoslavia arbitrarily recalled some 5,000 Yugoslav nationals who were living in Australia. As honourable members realize, their sudden withdrawal from our country was a serious matter for Australia. It is outrageous that the Government, and particularly the Minister for Immigration, should take the stand which they have taken in this matter. The only other countries in the world which adopt a similar attitude are Russia and Yugoslavia, which are under Comniunist domination. Furthermore. I consider that the action for Immigration and by the honortaken by the Minister, who has the supable member for Reid( Mr Lang). port of the Governinent, in this matter, The girls went abroad with the constitutes a breach of the fundamental United States forces to assist in rights of the people. Those rights are carrying out essential work after the expressly guaranteed by the Atlantic war. They were to return to Australia Charter and by the Charter of the TJnited after six months, and I admit at once that, Nations which provides that a citizen the Minister allowed them to remain of any country has the right to leave his abroad for a considerably longer period. country and work wherever he likes, proI t is true that most of them have returned vided that he engages in honourable emto Australia, but others have remained ployment and his action is not such as abroad. Undoubtedly, they had in mind to prejudice his country's security. I their right as citizens of a. free nation to remind honourable members that the go where they wanted and to work for present Government, and particularly the Minister, have paid lip service to that principle again and again. Not verylong ago twenty or thirty young Australians who were members of the Eureka Youth League, or some other youth movement, went to Yugoslavia to work on the construction of a railway line in thai country. It was revealed that their real purpose in going to Yugoslavia was to V indoctrinated in the techniques of communism, and that unfortunately they will seek to put into practice those technique? on their return to this country. The matter was brought to the attention of the Minister at the time, and in thtcourse of his defence of the attitude adopted by the Government in the matter he said, in effect"" This is not a Comniunist government. I will be quite honest about it "" . He also said"" We deplore young people going abroad l . "" learn Coinmunist techniques, but at tlie same time it is none of onr business where our nationals go provided they do not infringe the law. They have a right to go where they like "". The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley). In fact, we had a recent who supported the Minister's attitude on that occasion, made similar statements when he was questioned regarding thivisits of Mr Sharkey, the well-known Communist, to Malaya, India and other places. The present Government, whicli has stated repeatedly that it is not entitled to interfere with the freedom of movemem of its citizens, and has refused to do so in the case I have cited, did not hesitate to intervene in this instance and dictate to these girls. The circumstances surrounding the departure of these girls from Australia have been outlined by both the Minister",24,Recall Of Austealia N Citizens From Oveeseas Formal Motion For Adjournment
84,Mr Gtjllett (Henty) [11.43],"I ta country which had been onr ally. Of course, in refusing to return to Australia they defied the Minister. They apparently believed that they could go where they pleased. They had their passports extended, and went from the Philippines to the TJnited States, where they continued to defy the Minister. They insisted on their normal civilian right to live and work where they wished. But now is the Minister's opportunity. Now his opportunity has come. Those girls have 'defied him; now they shall suffer for it ! Look at the steps he has taken. First of all, he wrote to the Government of the TJnited States and asked that the.girls be dismissed from their employment. That is a nice thing for a governinent which has assured us, time after time, that people have a right r,o work wherever they wish! The members of the Government pay continual lip service to the workers. Let it apply the principle of freedom to these girls, ft is despicable for a Minister of tlie Commonwealth to write to a foreign government about a few unfortunate girls working for their living in that country, seeking to have them dismissed from their employment. The girls have passports, nothing can be said against them, and they are a credit to their country; yet the Minister has now begun negotiations to have them extradited from America. I cannot criticize his action too strongly. 1 also want to say something about the means which the Minister has employed to achieve his purpose, and the manner in which he has defended his action in this House. He has not hesitated to throw the blame on the Government of thc TJnited States of America. He referred to agreements and to breaches of agreements made with our war-time ally, the TJnited States of America. He deplored the friction which he alleged members of the Opposition were creating between the two Governments in this matter. The explanation is that the Minister found himself in a corner when he was called upon to defend his action in this matter, and he did not care what lie said. He knows that the differences between the Governments of the United States of America and this country have attracted great interest and have received considerable publicity aibroad. A great deal . of publicity has also beeu given to the matter by the Communist presses of Russia and its satellite countries. The Minister's conduct is worse than irresponsible and despicable; it is cowardly, because yesterday he reflected, by innuendo, on the girls. Yesterday, the lionorable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) asked him a question about a Mrs. Garrett, one of the Australian girls who married a United States lieutenant in the island of Guam. She was one of those ordered home. ""When she sent a reply-paid cablegram to the Minister, he did not reply, and she had to return. On her arrival in Australia, as the Minister told us yesterday, she was told, "" You can either go back to Guam to your husband, or he can come to Australia "". The Minister implied that this marriage had beeu broken up through no fault of his. The truth of the matter is that the man was a serving officer who could not come to Australia. He was ordered back to the United States. What was the use of this girl returning to Guam when her husband was no longer there? It is futile for the Minister to say that although he does not wish to go into the matter, he is acting in the best interest of the girls. It has been said that some of the girls were in trouble there. Eveni f they were in trouble, I hold that they have the right to remain abroad. If they get into trouble that, is their business. The Minister should not set himself up as an arbiter of morality and people's interests before issuing them with passports or permits to go abroad, and passports having been issued to them, they should be permitted to stay abroad.

87,Mr Chifley,"The honourable memAmerica and Australia, and between the United Kingdom and the United States of America, than has any other person in this country. During the war period, journals that he controlled indulged in a campaign of hatred of people from the United Kingdom. I rose merely to support what the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) said and not with the object of carrying this argument between Australia and the United States of America to international levels. The honourable member for Eeid asked whether I accept responsibility in this matter. I support the Minister. On one occasion the Minister came to me, accompanied by a representative df ' the American Embassy in Australia, who inquired on behalf of the American army authorities whether the Government would permit certain girls, who were then employed by them, to go abroad and work for the American army. The Government was averse to the girls going abroad for that purpose because difficulties had arisen from time to time, when girls who had gone abroad had subsequently become stranded, and all sorts of pathetic and sentimental reasons have been advanced why they should be repatriated at government expense. I discussed the matter fully with the Minister and the American representative. It was requested that girls should be permitted to go abroad for six months, at the end of which period suitable female assistance would be forthcoming from America to release them. At the time the American army authorities were experiencing difficulty in procuring female assistants from the United States of America. Despite what honourable members have said about a written agreement and other matters, I assure the House that the American authorities gave a complete assurance to the Minister and me .that within six months, the Americans would ohtain their own citizens to carry on the work when the Australian girls would be returned to Australia. That was a completely clear arrangement, with which the girls themselves were in agreement. It is only reasonable that an agreement of that character should be honoured. to the agreement? Ifr. Ohifle}/. understood the conditions under which they were going. agreement ? signing an agreement. The honourable member for Eeid suggested that the Minister has no right to sign any agreement, or to make any agreement involving the movement of Australian nationals. Frequently, however, the honourable member suggests that the Minister should refuse to issue passports to certain persons who desire to leave the country. Have honourable members ever before heard of such hypocrisy? That is entirely the reverse of what the honorahle gentleman is asking the Minister to do to-day. I wish merely to make clear what the Minister has already said about the girls. The understanding between the representative of fhe American authorities and the Australian Government was a gentlemen's agreement. I do not claim that the American Department of State knew all about it, but the representative of the American Embassy here, on behalf of the American army authorities, certainly entered into a simple gentlemen's agreement, of which the girls were fully conuizant. There is one thing I do like, and that is that people should keep their word. Nothing more than that is asked should be done in this instance. The whole matter could have been straightened out quite amicably if it had been left to the Minister and the American authorities to handle. The reason that this was not done is that there was something about it which could be used for political purposes. When some people talk ahout relations between America and Australia, they do not really care what the relations .are, so long as they achieve political publicity, which they hope will react to the detriment of the Government. I shall not enlarge on that except to make it perfectly clear that, in conjunction with the Minister, I was a party to the arrangement made in regard to tiis matter, which was a gentlemen's agreement-o r a ladies' agreement.

All honourable members will agree that this measure guarantees to aged couples possessing a little income of their own a reasonable degree of comfort in the eventide of their lives. In addition to the permissible income, a couple will be allowed to own property, ur assets, to the value of £219, in addition to their home, without suffering any reduction, of pension. f am pleased that the increase of the permissible income by. 10s. a week is also to apply to blind pensioners. 'Notwithstanding the fact that blind pensioners are already in a favorable position in that respect, this measure will permit a blind pensioner to have an income of £5 17s. 6d. a week in addition to the full pension of £2 2s. 6d. a week, making a total income of £S a week. As rhe Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) pointed out in liis second-reading speech, a blind married couple will be eligible to receive a pension of £4 5s. $ week between them and will be permitted to earn an additional income of £5 17s. 6d. a. week, making a combined income of £10 2s. 6d. a week. No one in the community will begrudge toblind people this concession in respect of permissible income. The property exemption has been raised from £50 to £100, and the property limit above which no pension will be payable has been .raised from £650 to £750. Those alterations are not spectacular, hut the new limit of £750 represents an increase of S7 per cent, on the limit of £400 which stood for 23 years up to 1946. [Quorum formed.'] I hope it will not be long before the Government is able to raise the property limit still more, so that aged persons with small incomes from property, who are now prevented from drawing a pension because the value of the property is just over the limit, may have their incomes supplemented by tbe payment of a partial pension. This Labour Government is the only one in Australia which has done anything for widows. It was a Labour government which introduced the widows' pension scheme in 1942, and since then it Mr Fuller. has steadily increased the rates of pensions payable to the various classes of widows. This bill provides that a class "" A "" widow, that is, a widow with one or more children under sixteen years of age, shall receive a pension of 47s. 6d. a week, an increase of 58 per cent, above the original rate of 30s. The new rate for a class "" B "" widow, that is a widow over 50 years of age with no children under sixteen, will be 37s. a week, an increase of 4S per cent, on the original rate of 25s. a week. The percentage increase is greater still for a class "" O "" widow; that is, a widow under 50 years of age without dependent children, who is entitled to a pension for six months after her husband's death if she is in necessitous circumstances. The bill provides that she may be paid 42s. 6d. a week, an increase of 70 per cent, on the original rate of 25s. I intend to make a. brief reference tn the limits which it is proposed to place on dual Commonwealth payments of war pension and civil pension. Upon a casual examination, it might appear fhat it is somewhat unjust to impose a special restriction on income comprising a war pension, when a similar restriction does not apply to income from other sources. However, when the proposal is examined more carefully, it will be seen that no injustice is done. I am certain that no honourable member who advocated an increase of the permissible income for civil pensioners ever contemplated that it might have the effect of substantially increasing'pension payments by the Commonwealth to any person. The intention of the Government was to enable a pensioner to earn a little more money without his pension being affected. The Government certainly did not contemplate the payment of pensions amounting to £7 5s. a week to married couples. In my opinion, the limits stipulated in the bill are reasonable for the time being, and I rely on the promise of the Government, given by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway). to have the limits further examined from time to time. The Minister has also given an assurance that in no case will there be a reduction of the combined amount at present being received by way of war pension and civil pension. As I have already indicated, the bill total Commonwealth budget in 1938-39 will give the people of Australia a further was less than £100,000,000, whereas for substantial measure of social security. this financial year it is approximately Since 1941, Labour governments have £500,000,000. doubled the amount of the age and which he cited cannot be accepted as a invalid pensions, and have eased the f a i r comparison between the provision means test. amount of maternity allowances, and Liberal party-Australian Country party doubled the amount of child endowment Government and the cost during the payments.

94,"Mr Turnbull (Wimmera) [12.20]. For The First Three Months Of The Current,","should be considered on a non-party basis. ""WhilstI agree with that view, I desire to indicate certain anomalies in the social services legislation. Only a comparatively small percentage of the people have any knowledge of the conditions of eligibility for pensions. The fact should be made known that a person is not entitled, to an age or an invalid pension if thc amount of his property, other than bis dwelling and other exempt property, exceeds £100, and that the property limit prescribed in this bill above which no pension will be payable is £750. However, a person who owns and occupies a hoii3e valued at £3,000 is eligible for a pension. Obviously, a person who has no house or any other possessions is in a worse position than a person who owns a house. Recently, my attention was directed to the circumstances of a woman who has a property in the northern part of Victoria, and is financially embarrassed. Being without any means, she applied for an age pension, but because her interest in the property exceeded the permissible amount of £750, her application was refused. At the present time, the property is unsaleable at any figure approximating the valuation placed upon it. The result is that she is disqualified from receiving the age pension, she cannot sell her interest in the property, and she is without means. The act should contain a provision to confer on the Department of Social Services discretionary power to alleviate such conditions of hardship. Then again, a person may sell his home before he moves to another part of the country. Although he may intend to use the proceeds of the sale to purchase another house for himself he is not permitted to receive a pension in the interval. to receive a pension until he buys another home, because he is in possession of a money in excess of the permissible amount. Social Services is allowed considerable latitude in such a case. lieve that the act does not provide'that such a person may retain the age pension while he is in possession of a sum of money in exces of the permissible amount. tain any specific provision to that effect, but the administrators of the department do allow a reasonable time. wife have a sum of money exceeding £1,500 they are not eligible to receive age pensions. Some of my constituents, for instance, hold amounts to enable them to build houses for themselves at a suitable opportunity when building costs decline. A person who desires to erect a dwelling at an economical price will not attempt to do so at present. I suggest to the Minister for Labour and National Services( Mr Holloway), who represents the Minister for Social Services in this House, that provision should be made to enable that class of person tc pay the money into a special fund, pending an improvement of building conditions and be permitted to receive an age pension. If those people proceed to build houses now, they will be eligible for age pensions. Why, then, when they are debarred by high costs from building a house at the present time, should they be disqualified from receiving the pension until they have reduced their capital to the maximum permissible amount? The establishment of the special fund to which I have referred would meet any possible objections to my proposal. I ask the Minister to consider the suggestions which I have made. I support the bill. There are many aspects of social services which do not have the complete approval of all honourable members. We desire that age and invalid pensioners shall receive the best possible deal that this country can give to them. Many of them have played their part magnificently in developing Australia, and deserve the most liberal treatment that the Parliament and the people can provide.

Last year, there was a very heated debate on the suhject in this House when the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) and I submitted an amendment to the consolidating bill for the purpose of removing that means test. A division was forced on the issue and, of course, it was conducted on party lines, with the result that the amendment was defeated. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) then said that he would seriously consider amending the legislation to meet our wishes. He said that, if I would ask a question on the subject when the House met again, he might be able to give me further information. Such a question has been asked, but he has not yet announced his intention to gratify our request. Obviously, the honourable gentleman must have reviewed the provisions of the act when this bill was being drafted, and I am. surprised, therefore, that he has not included any provision for the removal of the means test which I have mentioned. Our request is both reasonable and just. Everybody realizes that war pensions are granted to compensate persons who suffer from war disabilities. In other words, it is an attempt to "" make the left leg as long as the right"". Such pensions are a small token of Australia's gratitude for the sacrifices of the recipients. The Government's persistence in refusing to abolish this means test is beyond my comprehension. I hope that the Minister for Labour and National Service will re-examine the act and agree to introduce an appropriate amendment when this bill is being considered in committee. Unless the honourable gentleman does so, I propose to raise the subject again. I earnestly appeal to him and to honourable members who support the Government to give serious attention to this matter and remove from the existing law the horrible provision by which a means test is applied to a war pensioner who applies for sickness or unemployment benefits because of the effect of war injuries. support the remarks of the honourable disability may be, can obtain work. Howmemher for Swan( Mr Hamilton). The ever, when prices fall, unemployment will Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) is well acquainted with this subject. It was raised previously when the legislation providing for the payment of pensions to persons in sickness and unemployment was introduced into the Parliament, and the honorahle gentleman then expressed himself in favour of removing the means test. He said that he would consult his colleagues with a view to having an appropriate amendment made. I urged then, over three years ago, that immediate action be taken. The honourable member for Swan and some honourable members on the Government side of the chamber supported the amendment which I proposed when the matter was again discussed a year ago. In order that the situation may be perfectly clear, I again explain the unfair effect of the provision. If an' unemployed man happens to be an ex-serviceman in receipt of a pensionor, more correctly, compensation-for a war-caused disability such as the loss of fingers or a hand, the amount of his pension is deducted from his unemployment relief payments. Far from being an example of preference to ex-servicemen, that is a reversal of the principle of preference. Ex-servicemen are the only persons who can be penalized in this way. If an unemployed man draws union fees or lodge benefits, such payments are not treated as income for the purpose of assessing his unemployment allowance. But a man who has suffered in the defence of his country is not permitted to draw the full amount of unemployment relief as well as the pension to which he is entitled. to £1 a. week only are excluded from the means test for unemployment relief. honourable member will not deny that it is wrong that one class of persons should have the full amount of their pensions deducted from unemployment relief payments. Such discrimination is unjustifiable. High employment is a corollary of high prices, and there is little unemployment in Australia to-day. Therefore, this injustice is scarcely noticeable.",31,Holloway

104,Mr White,"That is so, but thebegin to stalk the land and these disabled ex-servicemen will be penalized. The Minister for Labour and National Service expressed himself years ago in favour of the removal of this injustice. H'e has been recreant to his duty in failing to amend the law in the meantime. Last year I quoted in this House a letter written by the Minister for Social Services (Senator McKenna) to an organization of disabled ex-servicemen stating that he favoured the removal of the means test from war pensions. He said, in eifect, that he had all the sympathy in the world for disabled ex-servicemen. But sympathy is not enough. The remedy is at hand. The Minister for Labour and National Service could draft a pencilled amendment now and pass it to the Clerk of the House, and I am sure that such an amendment would receive the support of honourable members generally. I thank the honourable member for Swan for having raised this matter again. It would have been overlooked if he had not done so. The Minister and some of his colleagues have expressed approval of our suggestion. They rejected it last year because, on principle, similar circumstances if they had been they could not support an Opposition amendment in a division of the House. But we do not care who gets the credit for removing the anomaly as long as it is removed. This matter is above party politics. It involves a high principle of human justice. Therefore, I exhort the Minister to draft an appropriate amendment now. I am sure that, if he does so, his party will spring to his support. [12.37] I support what the honourable member for Swan( Mr Hamilton) and the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) have said about the application of a means test to war pensioners who draw unemployment relief. It is a shocking anomaly. A similar injustice affects the widows of servicemen. I referred to an instance of such injustice in this House last year, and the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) took an active interest in the case. A war widow with two children, who worked in the precincts of this House, bad the amount of her earnings as an employee in the Parliamentary Library deducted from her income from the war widow's pension. Such wrongs should be righted without delay. I have been surprised at the tenor of the remarks of some honourable members in this debate. Political questions should not be related to social services, and many honourable members on both sides of the chamber have treated this measure, as I do, as being entirely non-political. However, the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) yesterday worked himself up to fever heat as though he and his colleagues had a mortgage on humanitarian principles. He went back into history in order to relate what Labour governments had done in the past and to declare that the honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) had deserted Labour principles when he was Premier of New South Wales. None of the honourable gentleman's remarks could be substantiated, and I was surprised that he dealt with this suhject in such a biased way. I believe that we are not here to criticize those who have gone before us or to condemn what has been done in the past. We should now he doing what we would have wished our predecessors to do in possessed of our present knowledge. That is, I think, the attitude that every honourable member should adopt in respect of this matter. I do not think that any honourable member can seriously criticize the endeavours of the Government.to alleviate the distress that has been caused to age pensioners by the deterioration that has taken place in the purchasing power of the £1. The position was mercilessly dissected yesterday by the honourable inember for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). In her brilliant speech, the honourable member showed that, although some people may regard the present rates of age pensions as generous, when their relationship to the basic wage now is compared with that which existed twenty years ago, the Government has very little to boast about. However, it will probably be generally agreed that it is on the right track in seeking to increase pensions by an amount that will, in comparison with the present basic wage, restore them to their previous comparative value. The Government is, however, by its policy of educating people",32,Holloway
105,Mr Blain (Northern Territory),"wlio are in their twenties or early thirties to rely upon age pensions to provide for tliem in their old age, undermining the morale of our young men. The longer it remains in power, the greater will be the deterioration of their morale and iheir will to look after themselves in their old age. The Government attempted to break down the morale of our young men lief ore World War II . by urging them not to fight if a war occurred. It is again doing so by destroying tlieir desire to make provision for their old age. We should urge every young man in Australia to hold his head high, to throw out his chest and to do something to help himself. In the great cities of the southern States the term "" self-help"" seems almost to be a foreign one. If one i a Iks to many people in the bigger cities about doing something for themselves, they reply, "" It is the ' Gov'ment's' job to do that"". 'Ihey have reached the stage when they cannot even pronounce rhe word "" government "" properly. They are so anxious to use it on every possible occasion that they pronounce it as if it were a word of two syllables. I propose to relate to the House one instance of what is occurring in my electorate in order to prove that the people of the Northern Territory are still capable of self-help. The Australian Inland Mission, under the leadership of the Eev. Mr Partridge, intends to build twilight homes at Alice Springs for the age pensioners Territory, who have given lifelong service to the back country. They have not asked the "" Gov'ment""-if I may use only two cf the three syllables, as do many honourable members opposite in their anxiety to articulate the word-to do it for them. The people are raising the necessary money themselves by public subscription. All that was asked of the Government was to provide the land and survey it. They were informed that no government surveyor was a vailable, so I _ travelled 3,000 miles in order to undertake the survey myself. When I arrived, I found that a young surveyor was engaged upon the task of subdividing the land for this home, which is about 3 miles out of Alice Springs. SiMing suspended from IS.Jid to £.15 p.m. to take. One should speak straight from ing the difference between the spirit of self-help and the modern tendency amongst many people to lean on the government. This dependence upon the government seems to have heen inculcated in the minds of a great many Australian people by this Labour Government. 1 have been induced to speak in this strain because, yesterday, the honourable member for Werriwa made some heated remarks and chastized members of the Opposition for allegedly trying to cadge votes frcm pensioners. the Opposition. orable member for Reid( Mr Lang) but, as I have said, I believe that that honourable member made out an admirable case, particularly by his reference to the position of retired engine-drivers, railway employees, schoolmasters, and the like. Undoubtedly, those people are penalized because of their participation in superannuation schemes. By paying taxes they are contributing to free social services, including pensions, for other members of the 'community, many of whom have made no effort to provide for their old age. In contrast to this dependence upon government support is the spirit of most people in the outback areas that I represent. They have not yet had their morale undermined as the Governof the Northern ment has undermined the morale of city dwellers, and as it endeavoured to undermine the morale of the young men of this country before the war by urging them not to fight for their country. opposite know that that it is true. Hansard proves it. Yesterday, the honourable member for Werriwa charged the honourable member for Reid with cadging votes from pensioners; but. the honourable member for Werriwa did not miss a trick himself. In fact, he did not miss a beat. He also crawled to the pensioners. He took very good care not to offend any of them. I am prepared to offend 20 per cent, of the pensioners regardless of how they may vote, because when duty calls there is only one road",33,Holloway

I liave the greatest sympathy for people who are genuinely in need of a pension. Many of them 3aved during their lives to provide for their old age, but were deprived of their savings by unfortunate circumstances. In the outback areas, many people who are eligible for an age pension do not seek it until they are well nnder which old people are sent to over 70 years of age, and are almost decrepit; yet, as I pointed out earlier in my speech, some young men in their thirties, or even in their twenties, are eagerly awaiting the day when they will be able to demand a pension. They are making no effort at all to provide for their old age. They have no pride. Government speakers have not painted a true picture of the present state of affair's. How many members of this House have heen courageous enough to point out that old people to-day are being neglected by their children? Only one, and that was the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). I could give several instances of this nature. Some of my sisters and nieces are in the nursing profession, and they come in contact with that sort of thing. rlerhert ( Mr Edmonds) seems to think it a joke that I should refer to this matter. Let him go to the Brisbane Hospital and ask the senior sisters whether or not what I am saying is true.

In Central Australia, conditions are vastly different. There, the spirit of self-help prevails. I have mentioned previously the twilight homo uow under construction at Alice Springs by public subscription and sponsored by the Reverend Mr Partridge of the Australian Inland Mission. So far. the Government's only contribution has been to provide the land and have it surveyed. I would have surveyed it myself had not an official surveyor been released for that work. Six designs were submitted by architects for the lay-out of the twilight home, which will occupy 20 acres on the Todd River at Alice Springs. The design which was finally selected will give the The honorahle member for pensioners the privacy of their own small comfortable homes separated by hedges.

In an outstanding speech the honorThe able member for Darwin made an appeal, not so much for a medical scheme, as for a health scheme. I was intrigued by ner remarks, which recalled to my mind the liealth .scheme v/hich I asked the Government to institute on behalf of the children of far western Queensland and the Northern Territory. As honorahle members know, the Bush Children's Health Scheme has operated in Queensland for many years. The small pastoralists of south-west Queensland have established a target of £20,000 to finance the scheme, the purpose' of which is to bring undernourished children from Boulia, Cloncurry, McKinlay and other western towns to Townsville, Emu Park and other coastal towns, or to the Lady Wilson Institute at Redcliffe, where I liad the honour some ten or twelve years ago to deliver some lectures in an appeal for funds to finance fhe scheme. One of the chief medical officers associated with the institution, Dr. Watson Brown, of Longreach, who was a member of the Queensland Parliament for some years, was a pioneer in research into the causes and cure of undernourishment in children. Honourable members representing constituencies in western and north-western Queensland seem to have been so uninterested in this vital subject that they have not even mentioned it in this House. Dr. Watson Mrs. Sterne is within the Brown trained two young ladies to make blood tests of children in areas extending from Longreach to McKinlay, Cloncurry and down to Dajarra and Urandangie. These women and Burketown, and good results are expected to flow from their work. I congratulate this Government upon having sent two trained nurses to the Northern Territory last year to conduct similar tests. I have not yet seen any repoTt of the results of their work nor, I regret, has any provision been made on the Estimates this year for the establishment of a nutritional service. When I discussed this subiect with mv constituents at Tennant Creek, a town throughout the areas under the control' far more remote than the towns in northof the Government.

People who receive these payments are j'ust a9 much entitled to them as they would be to receive payments from an insurance company in respect of contributions they had made to it. Age pensions are payments which are made as a return for the effort the recipients have made on behalf of the whole community. There is nothing to be ashamed of in accepting such payments and there should be no question of any one having to sink his pride to apply for an age pension. It ought, on the other hand, to be a matter of pride to people who have reached the retiring age, that they are able to draw some recompense for the productive effort-they made during their working lives, bnt I know that there are people who refuse to apply for an age pension, which could give them some modest comforts in their later life, largely because of the out-dated and mistaken ideas still being altered by such individuals as the honorable member for the Northern Territory. I hope that Iionorable members will hear that kind of statement less frequently and will give more encouragement to old people to apply for and receive the age pension as a matter of right. The honourable member stated earlier that matters of this nature should be regarded as non-political and be treated on a non-political basis. Again1 entirely disagree with him. Everything with which this Parliament deals is political, and none of the social service benefits already obtained by the community could have been obtained except by political action. I also disagree that this mutter ought to be treated on a non-party basis. I think that any honourable member who fails to point out to the electors that our social security legislation has been very largely brought to its present position, as a result of party activity would be failing in his duty to those electors. To suggest to the people of Australia that they have any hope whatever of obtaining equally fair and just treatment from a government composed of members on the Opposition side of the House as they would ohtain from a Government drawn from this side of the House would be to ignore completely the entire history of our social services. In fact, the great difference between the political parties in this matter is that the Liberal and Australian Country parties have continually given lip service to the principle of social service benefits, and the Labour party has consistently translated words into action. The Labour party, as every one who ha.= studied the matter knows, was the party that was responsible for the original introduction of age and invalid pensions. the Liberal party. would show any unbiased observer that my statement is true. Let us look at the political history of the last 25 years. In 1923, when the Bruce-Page Government was in its first year of office, the then Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, promised the people of Australia a full plan of unemployment, sickness and health benefits. On behalf of his party he made most elaborate and worthy speeches about it, but absolutely nothing was done by the government of the day to give effect to his promises. In 192S the present right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) who was then Treasurer, introduced, at least by word of mouth, a national insurance plan which he described as an honest, endeavour to combat want and misery in the community, and again long speeches were delivered but again absolutely nothing was done. In 1937 the anti-Labour government of the day, once again facing an election, brought forward a national health insurance plan and took it as far as the second-reading stage in this House before dropping it because, it was said, the community could not afford £2,000,000 of that year's revenue which it would have cost to implement. In fact, as far as I can recollect, the one contribution that the Opposition parties have made to social services legislation was the provision requiring those who received age pensions to sign away to the Government any small amount of property they might possess. The anti-Labour parties attempted to give effect to that legislation in 1932 but were compelled to withdraw it because of the pressure of public opinion. I give credit to the Minister of the day for an honest",37,Holloway

126,Mr Eraser,"A study of the matterintention in the introduction of the child endowment scheme, hut I know also that the support he gained from his own side of the House on tliat occasion was given only because the scheme was regarded as a lesser evil, involving a smaller cost, than an increase in the hasic wage would have been. I agree with the honourable member for the Northern Territory that every one in the community should realize that social service benefits can be paid for only in proportion to the community's productive efforts. Every £1 spent in social services means £1 levied in taxes. Expenditure on social services has risen from £16,000,000 in 1938 to over £S0,000,000 in the current year, and most people, whatever their politics, agree that the existing benefits should be increased and that additional benefits should be introduced. I think that that is very creditable to the people of this country because they have to find from their pockets and pay envelopes the cost of any increased social services benefits. Straight thinking is essential to solve the problems which confront the community in venturing into new fields of social serlagged behind New Zealand in some vice, and the most important thing to be realized is that social services cannot be financed from loans or central bank credits, but can be provided only to the degree to which the community, by hard work, can produce the physical goods and services necessary for any increased social service benefits. The provision of social services is therefore related directly and the provision of similar services to the working and earning capacity of the community as a whole. The cost of social services to the community in round figures in recent years has heen as follows:£ 1938-3!) 1944-45 1040-47 1947-48 During the present year more than £80,000,000 will be required for this purpose, and before long the expenditure will be £100,000,000 a year. Those sums relate only to national social services and do not take into account the expenditure on social services by the States, which amounts to £40,000,000 -annually. The Commonwealth is now spending as much on social services as Mr fraser. was spent by all governments, Australian and State, in the year before war occurred. When Labour assumed office, age and invalid pensions and the maternity allowance were the only social service benefits conferred by the Australian Government, and I remind honourable members that those benefits had been paid for 30 years. Since then, apart altogether from extensions of widows' pensions and child endowment, ten new kinds of social services have been provided. Those new services include funeral, unemployment, hospital and tuberculosis benefits, rental rebates and other special services. What honorahle member would dare to oppose, at any rate openly, the continued payment of any of those benefits? Who does not say that some of them ought to be increased, either hy increasing the rate of payment or by making the terms which regulate their payment more liberal? However, it is clear that we cannot stop at payment of the present benefits, and new and additional benefits must be provided within the next few years. Australia has been reproached for having aspects of social service. As an example, New Zealand now has a free medical service, a partial national superannuation scheme and other benefits which do not exist in Australia. I point out to honourable members that the provision of those benefits costs the people of New Zealand more than £40,000,000 annually, in Australia would cost at least £160,000,000 annually. The complete abolition of the means test would add another £54,000,000 a year to the cost, so that our total expenditure under these headings would certainly exceed .. 16,000,000 £200,000,000. I emphasize, however, .. 39,000,000 that the present Government has by no .. 57,000,000 means completed its social service pro.. 72,000,000 gramme. At the moment, it is considering the introduction of a national dental service, an extension of the national fitness service, a free optical service, the provision of greater ante-natal care, an augmented child welfare service and other projects. Those social services are in accordance with the ideal of a charter of economic freedom for the ordinary man and his family to protect them from the vicissitudes of life. The cost of such serhim. Finally, there should be a recognivices can be met only by a great redistribution of national income, or, in other words, by a transfer of purchasing power. [ am proud to support the present Government which has done so much to bring about a redistribution of wealth. In a sense such a redistribution is simply a transfer from the surplus of the rich to the deficiency of the poor. The money involved in the transfer is an excellent tonic for trade and industry because such a spread of purchasing power represents a guaranteed market for the necessaries of life. However, that process of transfer cannot be pursued beyond certain limits, and to suggest that £100,000,000 worth of social services can be financed in that way is merely to play with the problem. Although it is still possible to apply a heavier levy year. But how long will such a state of on unearned increment, the bulk of the funds required for social services must be supplied by the whole community and must cost every one something, whether they realize it or not. The new social services planI say "" new"" because it has existed only for the last seven years-should , in my opinion, be based upon certain denned principles. Because every one is required to bear the cost directly or indirectly, every one should have the right to enjoy social services regardless of their assets or income. For that reason the means test should be abolished as soon as possible, which is just as soon as the inpeople, no one should have to go short of creased costs can be absorbed. That is in accordance with the present policy of the Government, and I am pleased to support an administration which has taken two substantial steps towards the abolition of the means test, and is committed to further steps as soon as opportunity offers. Since contributions to social services should very in accordance with ability to pay, the services should be financed by direct taxes rather than by indirect taxes, which weigh as heavily upon the poor as upon the rich. Next, the formula for computing the basic wage should be varied to include provision for social services contribution. Every income earner would then pay directly his assessed share. He would have the benefit to which he had a right, and would know how much it was costing tion of the fact that the creation of social service benefits does not add anything to the total wealth of the community, and that the only way in which the living standard can be raised is by increased production and the efficient and fair distribution of production. The increases of social service payments contemplated in the present legislation will bring the provision fov social security to a higher mark than has ever been reached before even after making full allowance for changes in money values. Extremely buoyant revenues have enabled the Treasurer ( Mr Ohifley) to distribute tax and social service benefits this year without much difficulty, and they even leave him the prospect of being able to make a further popular distribution next affairs continue? As the cost of social services reaches £100,000,000, which exceeds even the dreams of a few years ago, there must surely be occasional doubts of the future, particularly if the present high prices for our exports tumble. Eor that reason social service finance must be placed on a secure basis. I do not suggest for one moment that Australia cannot afford to provide the full physical needs of all those within the social security charter. As long as this country is capable of producing all the food, clothing, shelter, medical services and other basic needs of the those needs, and the problem remains one of internal production and distribution. However, now that social service costs involve such a large proportion of national expenditure it is clear that they must be placed on a firmer and more permanent basis than is provided by the present social service contribution tax. I have already pointed out that the costs of social services are sure to rise more in the next few years than they have in the past few years, notwithstanding that the increase which has already taken place has been most extraordinary. The costs of social service benefits must rise with every increase of prices, and increases of prices are sure to occur. Costs must also rise through the further amelioration of the means test to which the Governmeut is committed. furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician show that tlie proportion of the community which is entitled to age pensions is steadily increasing. The Government's plans to establish new kinds of social services will increase the costs of the services. Finally, the public demand, which grows by what it feeds upon w ill demand still further social service extensions. As long as thc payment of important M.ifial service benefits, particularly the age pension, is dependent upon a means test of any kind, some people will object to making social service contributions on the ground that it does not give them a whatever assets they had been able to contributed accumulate during theii working life. right to a return for money or the right to enjoy the services for which rhey have to pay.

I hope that we shall eventually be able to introduce an effective national insurance scheme in Australia. He mentioned the fact that, under the New Zealand scheme, some people were able to draw as much as £7 a week, but we should remember that beneficiaries under the New Zealand scheme contribute to the national insurance fund. I should not mind if a man drew £15 a week under an insurance scheme if he contributed adequately towards it. Whilst the honourable member for Werriwa commended the New Zealand scheme, which is a contributory one, he opposed any suggestion that our social services in Australia should be placed upon a contributory basis. Moreover, under the New Zealand scheme, benefits are not paid upon a flat rate. The amount received varies according to the income of the recipient from other sources. In other words, a means test is applied there, but the honourable member for Werriwa is opposed to the application of a means test in Australia. As I have said, I hope that a national insurance scheme will eventually be put into operation in Australia, but it must be different from the one which was introduced just before the war, under which primary producers and the members of their families, while conhonestly make any other proposal. The tributing towards the cost of the scheme, wore debarred from benefiting under it. The national insurance scheme was lost mainly because of that provision. not get through the third reading. ment now. passed by the Parliament, why has not mean that the payments would not ho the present Government put it into operation ? Social services should not be made a subject for party politics, and when some honourable members have attempted to make political capital out out it, I have condemned their action. Certain anomalies still exist in the social services legislation and I hope that the Department of Social Services will carefully consider action to correct them. For years, I have advocated, with He referred to the little ' result, that a daughter who must remain at home to care for cue or both of her aged or invalid parents should be eligible for a pension. By accepting that domestic responsibility, she is not able to earn her own living arid perhaps carve out a lucrative career for herself. In earlier debates on social services I have cited the instance of a daughter who looked after both of her parents who were in receipt of f u l ! pensions. When one of the parents died, the income available to the home was immediately reduced by one half, and was completely inadequate to support the remaining parent and the daughter. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway), who represents the Minister for Social Services in this House, is invariably sympathetic towards people who are suffering hardship, and 1 urge him to give further careful consideration to the class of ease which I have cited. I contend that the daughter should receive a full pension, because she would never be able to earn her own living while the remaining parent was alive. The means test should also be reexamined. One honourable member who has spoken in this debate declared that the means test should be abolished by progressive stages. No one could immediate abolition of the means test ""would impose a tremendous burden upon Consolidated Revenue, necessitating substantial increases of taxes which the Australian people would not be prepared to pay.

142,Mr Holloway,"My answer did notmade retrospective. I meant that the increases could not be paid on the 1st July. not the interpretation which I placed on the Minister's answer. Perhaps Opposition speakers have caused him to change his mind. He stated that it was impossible to make the increased payment earlier than November because of a shortage of staff. that it was a physical impossibility. not get away from that. change my statement. from the hint that the Minister has given, that Opposition speakers have convinced him that the increased payments should be made retrospective to the 1st July. He certainly stated that, because of a shortage of staff, it was physimany Commonwealth departments' are cally impossible to adopt that procedure. have Commonwealth departments had such large staffs. Surely some of the officers who were formerly employed in the Prices Branch, could be assigned to assist other departments which are said, to be short-staffed. Only a few additional officers would be required to arrange for. the payment of the increased pensions to be made retrospective to the 1st July. The present proposal is that the increase shall not. he payable before November. If administrative difficulties are a real problem, the Australian Country party will accept the responsibility for making, the. necessary calculations, for payments, retrospective to the 1st July, and will not charge for its services. When the Prices Branch was issuing new orders almost daily, private businesses throughout Australia, from the small corner shop to the big wholesale and retail stores, had to make prompt adjustments, and shortage of staff was not accepted as an excuse for failure to do so. However, the Minister has made the excuse that because of administrativedifficulties, including shortage of. staff, the increased pension cannot: be paid until November. I contend that the payment must immediately be made retrospective to the 1st July. Shipowners, mine-owners and employersgenerally must adjust increases of wages from the date on which a court varies an award. They would not be permitted to wait for three months before making the adjustment. During World War II . , weexperienced government by regulation, and despite staff shortages, all private businesses had to comply promptly with alterations in orders, or he liable to a lieavy penalty. ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! The honourable member has carried that argument far enough and. I ask him to return to the bill. enterprise has to make prompt adjustments to comply with new awards, but evidently the Department of .Social Services cannot make an adjustment of"" pensions in three months because of the shortage of staff. As I have pointed out, already over-staffed and, if necessary,, Never before in our history additional clerical assistance could be supplied from the over-staffed departments to the Department of Social Services to enable pensioners to receive theincreased payments without further delay.

As the result of the consistent agitation of a small band of Labour men who were -elected to the. Parliament of New South Wales and another small band who subsequently were elected to the Parliament of the Commonwealth, the government of the day had to introduce the original 'Commonwealth pensions legislation in 1908. honorahle member for Balaclava ( Mr White) -the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) that it was the memhers of the Lahour party in the Parliament who were responsible for the passing of that wonderful act in 1908. That statement, however, was correct. There were then three parties in the Parliament. Two of them were loosely referred to as the Free Traders and the Protectionists. The other was the Labour party, which was at that time a minority -or cross bench party. It s members engaged in an agitation for the introduction -of legislation to help aged and invalid people. In return for the support of the Labonr party, the Deakin Government brought down the bill for the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act of 1908 and so was able to remain in office. The Deakin -Government was forced to choose between bringing the bill down and suffering defeat as a result of the withdrawal of the support of the Labour party. It may be -of interest to recall what was said by Senator Mulcahy. of Tasmania, in the Senate on the 3rd June, 1908. iman. Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) says, Senator Mulcahy was not a member of the Labour party. He left no doubt in the mind of any one as to who was responsible for the passing of the first pensions act. He saidI nm prepared to give the Labour party every credit in tbe matter, and I assert that if a scheme for the establishment of an old-age pension is approved, the whole of the credit will be due to the Labour party and not tin 1 Government. Other strong political opponents of the Labour party at that time contended that, it was due to the action of the Labour party of that day, small though it was, that the Old-age Pensions Act of 190S was passed. I think that answers the contention of honourable members opposite that the Labour movement, had nothing to clo with the passage of that legislation. In the years before the Curtin Government assumed' office in 1941, Australia was governed almost entirely by noninvalid and old-age Labour governments. Between 1908 ancl The 1941, a period of 33 years, age and invalid pensions were increased from 10s. a. week ridiculed the statement of to 21s. 6d. a week. Between 1941, when the Curtin Government came into power, and the present time, which is a. period of only seven years, such pensions were increased by 21s. 6d. a week. The Labour party increased age and invalid pensions by double the amount that they were increased by the non-Labour parties, and did it in a quarter of the time. Even the Opposition is prepared to say that this legislation is good. It contains anomalies, but that is inevitable in such a comprehensive measure. Although honourable members opposite are not anxious at the moment to make this matter a political issue, I thought it only f a i r to those who have gone before us to relate the facts that I have just outlined. Having regard to its record in the fields of health, education and social services, the Government must surely be returned to power at the next general election. In my opinion, the greatest insurance scheme in which anybody could participate is our present social security scheme. Thousands of our people who live on low incomes are receiving maternity allowance, child endowment, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, widows",44,Holloway

158,Mr Duthie,"As the Minister forpensions and the like, without making any direct contribution for them. Surely there is no greater insurance scheme in the world than that. It entails, however, that those people who enjoy financial independence must make a contribution to help those who cannot are not financially free to do as they like. 'Chat is a sound principle. It is the principle of the strong helping the weak, the rich helping the poor, those who ai'e well helping those who are sick, and those who have their sight, hearing aud the f u l l use of their limbs helping the blind, the deaf, the dumb and the lame. When I hear a person moaning because he has to pay social service contributions, my immediate reply to him is, "" W h y do you not regard the payment of your contributions as a thanksgiving to God that you have your health and strength?"" That is the way in which I regard my social service contributions. In the eight years during whicli I was a minister of religion, I visited many hospitals ancl saw many human beings who had been wrecked mentally and physically. Our social service scheme is a great insurance for broken humanity and the greatest practical expression of Christian beliefs. The main complaint of the rich people is that they do not receive anything in return for their social services contributions. They say it is always somebody else who receives help. As I have said, they should regard tlieir contributions as a thanksgiving that they are not in hospital and, therefore, have uo necessity to receive benefits that have been provided for hospital inmates. The aged, infirm, lame, blind and sufferers from tuberculosis and other diseases who are assisted by the operation of the social services scheme, many of whom are widows and many of whom are broken in mind as well as in body, are the victims of the ruthless economic system that was in existence wben World War II . began. Thousands of people have to receive the benefits and to be assisted by the Government because in pre-war years they were broken by that system. The system has been modified to some degree by the Government, but not as extensively as one would wish for. It is morally right and proper that a government should spend some of the taxpayers' money to assist the victims of such a ruthless economic system. I refer now to the attempt made by the Dnited Australia party Government in 193S to assist the people by introducing the National Health and PensionsI n help themselves, or those who surance B ill . That legislation provided for the contribution of ls. 6d. a week by all wage earners and contained provisions for medical benefits and a free medicine service-whic h honourable members opposite ridicule to-day-and for a pension of £1 a week for contributors who reached the age of 65 years. It also provided a payment of 3s. 6d. a week for each child under the age of sixteen years. That, in the light of present-day conditions, does not sound like a very generous measure of social security. It represented, however, an attempt to provide some measure of social security. In the legislation now before the House the Labour Government has offered the people something in finitely better than was offered to them by Mr Casey when he was Treasurer in 193S. Isi t any wonder that the Opposition does not wish to make this measurea party political matter? Any measure of social security should have some relation to the encouragement of the birth-rate. In his book, Women and Children First, D r . V . H . Wallace states that the greatest factor in the f a l ling birth-rate to-day is the economic factor. I do not entirely agree with him. J think that there should be some modification of that view. A t page 143 of his book, D r . Wallace statesAs economic considerations constitute by far the greatest single factor iu family limitation our social legislation should aim at removing all financial burdens which the rearing of children entails. In other words, society should be willing to pay for its ownsurvival. We, as a people, should be prepared to pay for our continued existence. I regard this as a fundamental principle which cannot and must not. be disregarded. It is tlie duty of each adult inember of tbe community to shareequitably in the cost of rearing children. No .self-centred., luxury-loving person should, be allowed tn shirk his economic responsibilities in this matter. Xo man or woman without children should evade making an adequatefinancial contribution towards tlie maintenance of the young generation. This just and fundamental principle is not accepted aswidely as it should be, but we must all recognize its survival value and introduce social 1 egi s 1 a t i o 11 a ceo rdi ngly. There are at least three ways in which we may help financially those young men and women wlio desire to marry and have children. We may assist them hy furniture and all the varied but essential goods necessary for them to set up house and start married life together. We may help them to meet the high cost of childbirth w it h its hospital fees, medical expenses and the purchasing of all those articles and supplies which where poverty is rife, children are most the advent of a baby entails. Finally, we may help then\ to maintain their offspring u n t i l where the people, far from enjoying any those children are old enough to earn a living for themselves. We must be willing to do all three if we, as a people, are to survive, and we should make the assistance generous enough to be effective. Some critics refer contemptuously to assistance as a "" hand o u t "" . They say that it is spoon-feeding young couples countries because of the social security and that such treatment destroys the spirit of independence. This criticism is evidence of a complete misunderstanding of the position. Dr. Wallace also says that mutual aid must be the underlying principle if society is to survive in this modern age. In that, I entirely agree ""with him. In a hook entitled Mutual Aid, Prince Kropotkin shows that only by co-operation and mutual assistance can social groups .flourish, whether 'they belong .to the human or to the lower animal species. The principle of mutual aid has never been fully established. The system under which w.e live, whether we call it a capitalistic or .an individualistic system, has been a selfish system, the fundamental principle of which is self first and others last. It is .difficult to establish and operate a system of mutual aid under these conditions. However, by legislation such as that now under consideration, Labour governments during the last seven years have endeavoured to imbue the people with the principle of mutual aid to the less fortunate members of the community. 'The three methods by which Wallace suggests we may assist the birth rate are, first, the provision of marriage loans; secondly, allowances; and thirdly, child endowment or family allowances. He deals with each in separate chapters, and he -covers his subject very well indeed. There are some aspects of the economic factor in family life to which I wish to draw some attention. During the depression years 30,000 couples who otherwise would have married did not do so. According to' the statistics, the fact that those marriages did not take place is one of the fundamental causes of the problem of the teen-age group in industry which Ifr. Duthie. is so handicapping our industrial progress. ""Whilsti t is true that the economic factors of the depression years did result in fewer marriages, I cannot, however, help feeling that the influence of the economic factor on the birth rate is somewhat over-emphasized. In places numerous. In many European countries measure of social security, have always been on the bread line, there are to be seen millions of children. It cannot be said that children are numerous in these afforded to their peoples. Indeed, the birth-rate is high in countries where poverty, bewilderment and misery are the lot cf the common people. In China, Japan and India, where poverty and malnutrition are rampant, the birth-rate is extra-ordinarily high. In OUT great cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane the largest families are to be found not dn the better-cljass suburbs, but in ""working-class suburbs and slum areas. In our poorest and shabbiest suburbs children are to be seen playing in the streets every day by the hundreds. I know that that is so because I have worked in the slums of Melbourne. I know that the largest families are to be found not in the best suburbs, such as Toorak in Melbourne, and at Darling Point in Sydney, where in general the people enjoy the greatest measure of 'social security, but in the poorer areas. iSo, in my opinion the economic factor in relation to the birthrate is definitely overrated. There are several factors which contribute to the lack of child birth in the middle and upper class groups in this country. That is where the failure lies, not amongst the maternity lower groups at all. The lowest average number of children in a family is found in the middle and upper class groups who cannot plead economic reasons for their faihrre to have children. They cannot plead that they are poverty stricken, or that they have not amenities in their homes because they have the lot, but still do not have children. They are more prepared, in many instances, to look after pomeranian dogs, to engage in social life and to try to climb the social ladder, and to indulge in sport and pleasure. -Order! The honourable member should confine his remarks to the subject of the debate. before the House to show that the economic factor is grossly overemphasized -to-day as a reason for the falling birthrate. Dr. Wallace stresses that encouragement could be given to increasing the birth-rate by the provision of marriage loans. However, we have discussed that matter in the caucus, but so far nothing further has been done in that connection. Before the war the authorities in Germany went thoroughly into the principle of marriage, loans and that aspect of the matter is dealt with fully in Women and Children First?. Although the birth-rate did increase following the granting of marxiage loans, other statisticsshow that that increase was. not: due entirely to that incentive. ber tell us how the Germans were treated ? the maternity allowance. On page 158 of that book the following appears as a quotation from the official Year-Boole for 1939 at page 232:Under the provisions of the Maternity Allowance-Act 1912-1937 a sum of. £4 10s. is payable to the mother in respect of each confinement at whicb a Hving or viable child is born, provided the total income of the claimant and her husband for the period of twelve months preceding the date of the birth did not exceed £247. Where there are already one or two children under fourteen the amount payable is £5, with an income limi t of £2G3, and where there are three or more other children under fourteen the amount payable is £7 10s. with an income Umit of £338. [ quote that as evidence of conditions in Australia in 1939. Dr. Wallace then commentsWhat niggardly parsimonious payments! And what caution is displayed! The Government seems to have been afraid of paying a few shillings too much. New life, the source of our future strength aud greatness, is involved. We are here concerned wit h tlie citizens of . to-morrow who w i ll develop this great country, advance its culture, defend it against foreign aggression and play a prominent part in the progress of civilization. If it was worthwhile suggested that there are mothers who spending many hundreds of millions of pounds on unproductive war-time activities surely it ie worth wliile investing a few modest millions in the removal of the economic disabilities of parenthood. T521 That was the maternity allowance provision when the present Government came into office. Now, when the first child is born in a family, £15 is paid I place these facts altogether as a maternity allowance. The siun of £5 is paid for the child, £5 to the mother before the birth, and £5 after the birth. Eor the second child £16 10s. is payable, and for the third child, £17 10s. This has been a tremendous help to mothers and the Government is to be commended for having trebled tlie amount payable to mothers at child birth, to help finance the coming of the baby into the world. It is important for honourable members to realize that motherhood is the greatest achievement of womanhood, upon which nationhood is founded. Upon that depends the very survival of' the nation, and anything that the Government can do to encourage parenthood must be of great service to the country. It may be that the maternity allowance will be increased in years to come. I hope that' it will be. All of the benefits provided are of tremendous assistance to families. In his reference to I shall now refer to child endowment, Dr. Wallace quoted the words of Miss Eleanor E. Eathbone, who wrote on this subject in TJie Case for Family Allowances. She says that there are three different methods by which family allowances should be paid. These are a State-paid system, a contributory insurance scheme, and themethod of equalization funds or pools. She shows that, the best schemeis undoubtedly a wholly State-paid national scheme covering the entire child population. That is the scheme this Government has adopted, and Dr. Wallace commends us for having raised child, endowment from 5s. a week to 7s. 6d. a week. Now this legislation is raising the amount payable to 10s. a week for every child after the first. The principle is sound. As a result of this increase, in a family comprising six children, the child endowment entitlement for five of them would he £2 10s. a week. That amount would come into the. home over and above the wages of the husband. Prom every point of. view the endowment scheme is good. It has been should be criticized because of the wastef ul methods they employ. Of course there are mothers, ancl also fathers aud.",45,Holloway

162,Mr Duthie,"members of Parliament wbo are wasteful iu their methods. There are members of every community who are wasteful. Perhaps we will never be able to teach them otherwise. Should we condemn thc thrifty mothers who wish to use this money for their children, merely because some other mothers may squander il. wastefully? In principle, the scheme is sound. The only change that will be made to it-while this Government is in power is that the amount payable will be increased still further. It will not be reduced. I have now referred to the main factors on the economic side whereby we can assist family life in this country and encourage an increase of the birthrate in Australia. As I said previously ihe economic factors can be over-stressed as the principal cause of the falling birthhe decreased while this Government rerate. Another matteito which I wish to refer was raised by the honourable memher for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) in the able speech she delivered yesterday. She suggested that we should relate pensions to the eost of living. Whilst that is an admirable objective, it is not easily done. I shall refer to the years 1919 to 1921. Was there any attempt by anti-Labour governments in those postwar boom years to relate pensions to the cost of living? No. provision in the act. to the second world war that any thought and a host of smaller benefits that the wa9 given to the desirability of relatpublic are not very conversant with. ing pensions to the basic wage or the Under this bill we propose to raise invalid cost of living. That was done at the rate and age pensions by 5s. a week, and to of Is. increases at a time. Though the increase from 25s. to 30s. a week the perprinciple may be good, the working out missible income which all classes may of it in practice is not easy. If the cost receive without pensions being affected. of living is high in relation to the value In the case of a blind pensioner the inof the pension, the actual value is crease of permissible income has been less than it would otherwise be. The raised from fo 7s. 6d. to £5 17s. 6d. a cost of living is not going to keep on week. The property bar is to be raised rising. It is inevitable that the cost of from £650 to £750, and the rate of child living will come down as production endowment has been increased from 7s. 6d. increases. A fall may be expected next a week to 10s. a week. year or the year after. I point out to honourable members that whilst the pento be done for the blind. Many blind sioners of this country may be feeling the persons earn a. considerable amount. The pinch in a certain sense to-day because amount of income which a blind person of the high cost of foodstuffs, and rentals, may earn without affecting the amount the time will most assuredly come when of his pension has been increased from the costs of those items will be lower. The amount of the pensions will not then be reduced. able member know? be in a serious financialstate if the Australian Labour party ever reduced pensions. should not commence electioneering already. cannot deny that fact. It is of no nse to try to get around it. The cost of living will ultimately come down and as it does the value of pension payments will increase. The pension itself will not mains in office. meinber guarantee that? has established a reserve to maintain pension rates, and the pensioners may feel happy about that aspect of the future. The benefits that the Government is providing to-day cover a very wide range indeed. They include funeral benefits, hospital benefits, tuberculosis benefits, pensions for the blind, free medicine, allowance for the wife of an invalid penmaternity allowances, child endowment, sickness and unemployment benefits I refer particularly to what is proposed",48,Holloway

In effect, this will mean that they may receive a total income of £8 a week instead of £7 os. a week as at present. Where hoth husband ancl wife are blind they w ill be permitted to earn between them £5 17s. 6d., and in addition will receive the full amount of pension. The total income they may thus receive will be £10 2s. 6d. a week instead of £9 2s. 6d. as at present. The total cost of all these recent increases will be considerable The increase of 5s. per week in pensions w ill cost the Government an additional £15,000,000 a year; the liberalization of the means test, for which this Government must be commended, will cost an additional £2,300,000; and the increase in the rate of child endowment w ill cost £6,700,000. Pension payments will increase by £6,000,000. Later on, the purchasing power thus released by these pensions w i ll have the full effect within the homes to which it goes, as the cost of living decreases. The real life blood of a nation is its purchasing power. To draw that off would mean financial ancl economic death. I claim that by the provision of £SO,000,000 for social services the Government is ensuring that the nation will be kept healthy, virile and happy. I have great pleasure in commending this legislation to honourable members. My comments on this bill w ill be short. They will be all the shorter, because I had intended to comment on the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini), and I have decided that he, as Mr Acting Deputy Speaker at the moment is either too well, or too unfavorably, situated to warrant my replying to him. age and invalid pensions by 5s. a week, and a pensioner's permissible earnings from 20s. to 30s. a week. Provision is also made for small increases to war pensioners. No one can object to the bill . The Mimster who introduced it ( Mr Holloway), and many honourable members on both sides of the House, did their best when discussing the measure to avoid party politics and electioneering propaganda. However, the debate was apparently going too smoothly, ancl it became impossible for some Government supporters to refrain from saying how marvellous the Labour party was, and from claiming that if it were not for the Labour party the whole world would collapse. Therefore, it became necessary for lionorable members on this side of the House to answer them. Some honourable members opposite speak of members of the Opposition as savages who would like to see people standing around the doors begging for crumbs. I remind them that there is as much humanity on this side of the House as on the other. I commend the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( MT . Thompson), who succeeded in keeping party politics out of his speech. He did not seek to give the Labour party credit where credit was not due, or to blame the Opposition when blame was not deserved. Later, some other government back-benchers spoke, and we have had to listen to some extraordinary statements from them. They have tried to convince the pensioners that the Government is really doing something worthwhile for them. Actually, the bill merely represents an attempt to keep pensions abreast of thc cost of living, and even in that it has not succeeded very well. However, to hear honourable members opposite, one would tliink that the millennium had arrived. After all, it is only proposed to raise age and invalid pensions to £2 2s. 6d. a week. Some honourable members opposite have attempted to paint a. false picture by saying that an old couple could draw between them £7 5s. a week, while livin g in their own home. To achieve this, each would have to earn 30s. a week. If they are unable to do this, they will have to be content with £4 5s. a week for the two of them, and. if out of this they have to pay rent for a homo they w ill not have much to come and go on. If the Labour party This bill provides for increasing is responsible for that, it has nothing much to boast about. I was disappointed in the speech of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser), who tried to discredit the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) because he referred to certain old people in the Northern Territory who still have the pioneer spirit,",49,Holloway
171,. Mr Bowden (Gippsland) [4.0],"and fiercely resent anything in the nature of charity, because tbey like to believe that they have the eapacity to provide for their own old age. I do not say that their attitude is always right. It is a pleasure for us to help them when they cannot help themselves. But to decry the independent spirit which made this country great, and. which built the Empire, is to do disservice to the nation. The Labour party has encouraged people to believe that they need make no effort to meet a crisis. All they need to do is to lean revenue. The significance of that has against the post and hold out a hand, confident that some one-the Government, most probably-wil l put something .in it. No one is encouraged to save in order to provide against old age or decrepitude. It would be a tragedy if the spirit of independence were to disappear from among the people. Some Government supporters have tried to create the impression that, but for the Labour party, there would be no pensions and no social services. As a matter of fact, it was the Deakin Government, which was non-Labour, that put the original Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act through the Parliament. members opposite claim, of course, that it was done under Labour pressure. was Treasurer in the Deakin Government, resigned over that issue. gest that a handful of Labour members were able to bring enough pressure to bear on the Deakin Government to influence its policy. If the Deakin Government had been defeated on the issue, fhe Labour party would not have been strong enough to form a government, and there would have been no pensions scheme. The present Opposition parties have, in the years gone by, built the bridges, and the Labour party is trying to claim credit for all the water that has run under them. It is time that the public knew and understood what hypocritical stuff is talked by honourable members opposite. At the present time, the pensions of ex-servicemen are not high enough. Indeed, they are a disgrace. Widows are complaining that they have not enough to live on. Yet, according to .honourable members opposite, everything is rosy, and no one has anything to worry about undei this marvel1 lous Government ! It is sickening to hear them talk in that fashion. If the Labour Government were to introduce a sound social service scheme on a permanent basis I should be happy to support it. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) declared that social .service payments, no matter how great, could not be met out of loans. They must be paid out of not, apparently, registered with backbench supporters of the Government. To every one else it is obviously unsound to base a social service system upon such a fluctuating quantity as the national revenue. At the present time, revenue is high because prices for our wool, wheat and butter are at an unprecedentedly high level. However, if prices for our primary products were to fall by 50 per cent., the national revenue would decline correspondingly, and where then would the Government get £100,000,000 a yeaT for social services ? Some honourable members opposite have referred to -the New Honourable Zealand social service scheme, which is a contributory one. Such a scheme 'may well be . sound enough, but it is uot sound to .rely upon revenue to maintain a social service system; yet honourable members opposite talk as if increasing the cost of social services from £17,000,000 to £100,000,000 was something clever. The whole system will collapse if prices for our export commodities should seriously decline. If there should be a general economic depression, the position will become even worse. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) claimed that, as long as the Labour Government was in power, pensions would not be reduced. It might be possible to maintain pensions at their present level, but if the national income falls pensions can be maintained only at the cost of other social services. A previous speaker cited figures which emphasized the ever-increasing number of pensioners in the community, and the decreasing number of those who are earning. It is estimated that by 1960 every four persons who are earning will be supporting an age pensioner, in addition to",50,Holloway

173,Mr Bowden,"It is absurd to sugwhitjh the community will have to support the blind, the halt, the sick and the maimed. It is a terrifying thought and the burden may well prove to be too heavy for the younger people to bear. Because of scientific discoveries, the average expectation of life is greater now than it used to be, but for some inexplicable reason the birth-rate is falling. I am glad that the honourable member for Wilmot demonstrated the absurdity of the guff that is talked about the birth-rate being influenced by economic conditions. He very properly pointed out that the birthrate was higher among people living in the slums than among those who live in big homes where they have every comfort. The birth-rate is higher in India ancl China, where economic conditions are generally low, than in countries where the standard of living is higher. Obviously, the raising of the standard of living is not the solution of the problem of the declining birth-rate. Every year, fewer children are being born, while every year more and more old people become pensioners of the State. If ""he means test were abolished, an extra £52,000,000 a yeai' would have to be found for pensions, and it is ridiculous to suggest that, this could be done all at once. However, no one can deny the right of those who pay the taxes to share in their distribution. I admit that the means test cannot be abolished in one, two or three years. We should need to make the necessary provision for it. The only honest and wise way in which we can help those who cannot help themselves is by adopting a scheme with a sounder backing than that provided by a fluctuating overseas market. We should adopt a scheme similar to that which is in operation in New Zealand, where the means test has been abolished and a contributory system has been introduced. been only partly abolished in New Zealand. had been completely abolished. However, we in Australia must evolve a permanent scheme which will stand up to any test. Instead of doing so, honorahle members opposite are boasting about the virtues of the present scheme, and are completely overlooking the fact that Commonwealth revenue is uow the greatest in our history. I should feel assured that social services will always be maintained at the present level. 1 should feel much happier in my mind that the people, of Australia were being less deceived ^ if a scheme were introduced that could operate in any economic circumstances. I do not, .propose to criticize any social services schemes which have been introduced by this or any previous government with that objective in view. Unquestionably, a scheme can be evolved which will remain soxmd under any economic conditions. Under the present system, that is not possible, and no honourable member can honestly pretend that it is. All that we are doing is to dig in a number of leaning posts. We are discouraging people from being thrifty and providing for themselves. I agree with the statement by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) that not all the people who are receiving pensions deserve them. I have in mind the "" boozers "" and "" guzzlers "", who, during their working life, did not save a penny but swilled away their earnings onalcohol. I would not care what happened to them. They did not contribute one penny to the development of this country. However, I realize that if we were to penalize them,, we should also penalize hundreds of thousands of worthy people. Therefore, on the principle of British justice that it is preferable that nine guilty persons shall go free than that one innocent person shall be made to suffer, I agree that all persons who conform to the conditions of the means test should receive a. pension. However, I do not wax enthusiastic about trying to help those who have never saved a penny but have squandered everything that they have received. Every citizen has the responsibility to do his best to relieve the nation of the obligation to maintain him in his old age, and when he is "" down and out "". An obligation devolves on him to help himself, and he should apply to the Grovernment for assistance only when he has not sufficient means adequately to provide for himself! Some honourable members opposite probably considered that this debate waa",51,Holloway

175,Mr Bowden,"I understood that itproceeding too smoothly, and that the Laboui party was not receiving sufficient 1 credit for its share in introducing or expanding social services. Therefore, they endeavoured to discredit the Opposition and to give all the credit to the Labour party. They reluctantly admitted that the Menzies Government introduced -jhild endowment, but they qualified that admission with the words, "" under pressure from the Labour party"". They sought to claim for the Labour party all the credit for every social improvement that had been in the country. They were, in effect, trying to claim all the water that had run under the bridges built by the political parties that now constitute the Opposition in this House. The Labour party adopted those tactics in regard to defence and later in regard to pensions. The purpose of honourable members opposite in doing so was to endeavour to convince the people before the nert election that the Labour party and not the Liberal party and the Australian Country party was their friend. The bill bas my approval, and the approval of every member of the Opposition, but the measure could have had a speedy passage, free from party bias, had some honourable member opposite not introduced party politics into the debate. Last night, the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) began a tirade. I am not able to deal with that speech, because, as Mr Deputy Speaker at the moment and not as the private memher for Werriwa, y.ou, sir, are in a favorable position to protect yourself. ( Mr Lazzarini) -The Chair has no scheme financed out of proceeds for taxaobjection to the honourable membev critition. If the honourable gentleman is argucizing the speech; he may go ahead. ber for the Northern Territory disposed is contributing to his future benefits, of the speech by the honourable membei as for Werriwa most effectively. In my contributing to an insurance scheme, opinion, it was a most objectionable he has made a statement speech, because an atmosphere of harit will be very difficult to, refute. But if mony existed in the House and no honorhe is trying to inform the country that able members objected to the bill. Indeed, contributions make a. sounder financial who can object to an increase of pension basis tban taxation to safeguard pensions amounting fco « miserable 5s. a week? in the event of an economic depression. Honourable members opposite scoff. AnyI advise the honourable gentleman to read pensioner listening to the debate can be a. report produced and signed by memexcused for thinking that, in the minds bers, of the two political parties which of honourable members of the Labour party, the increase of pension is sufficient to enable a recipient to buy a mansion. Honourable members opposite are scratching their hacks with pleasure because of a miserable 5s. a week. They should return to reality. I approve of the bill, but I hope that, in future, social sevvices will be discussed outside the realm of party politics and that members of one political party will not claim a. monopoly of all the charitable emotions in the House. During this debate, honourable members opposite have pretended that the menibers of the Opposition are like savage beasts, and want to grind the pensioners down at every opportunity. Some, educated gentlemen opposite should be ashamed of themselves for having fried to create that impression. T'he honourable inember for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) deplored the party political controversy on the subject of social services It would he true to say that there has been very little party controversy about the proposed increase of pensions, the nature of the pensions, and the classes of people who should receive them, but there has been a good deal of party controversy about the method of financing social services. When discussing that aspect, the honourable member for Gippsland suggested that revenue was not a solid base for the scheme. He did not really tell us what he considered to be a more solid basis, but I am not doing him an injustice when I say that he consider? that a contributory scheme will be a ing that it is sounder ethically for a per1 he would be if he were that",52,Holloway
176,Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Sounder Basis For Social Services Than N,,53,Holloway
177,Mr Bowden,The honourable memson to be directly aware that he,53,Holloway
178,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [4.22],"now constitute the Opposition. The principal signatory was a former member for Parramatta, Sir Frederick Stewart. That report made an exhaustive examination of contributory schemes throughout the world. If there is an economic depression or a serious fall in national income, a system of social services based on contributions is no safer than a system of social services based on tax contributions. Sir Frederick Stewart pointed out that when 2,500,000 persons were unemployed in Great Britain it was obvious that they could not contribute to a contributory scheme any more than they eould pay taxes to a. tax-financed scheme. The contributions that an individual can make are no more independent of his income than the taxes that he can pay are independent of his income. Quite clearly, under depressed conditions, a contributory scheme is as unsafe as is a scheme financed out of taxation. Sir Frederick Stewart pointed out that fact, and also dealt with the ethical argument in favour of a contributory, scheme, but I shall not deal with that aspect. Another matter to which I propose to direct attention is the pensions which are payable to sufferers from tuberculosis. At rhe Wooroloo Sanatorium in Western Australia a. brilliant doctor who was appointed not long ago has started occupational therapy. He has established some kind of industry within the colony of people suffering from tuberculosis, and they have developed it. Many of the patients are able to earn quite a reasonable income, and the interest which they have in their jobs helps to cure them. But the operation of the means test has the immediate effect of reducing their invalid pension. I am not making an attack on the Government, but am merely pointing out an unexpected anomaly. However, the reduction of pension acts as a deterrent to the sanatorium patients and authorities alike in relation to the earning of income and the expanding of the industry that the colony has developed. There cannot be a large number of tuberculosis sufferers in Australia, and I cannot believe that the abolition of the means test on their income, when earned under the control of a sanatorium for work done as a part of the hospital treatment, can make a significant dent in the Oommonwealth revenue. I am certain that it is possible to abolish or drastically modify the means test applicable to. the earnings of invalid pensioners in the circumstances which I have described. Tho honourable member for Gippsland complained that the community was becoming pension-minded and that the virtue of thrift had been forgotten. Tlie emphasis which members of the Opposition sometimes place on that point creates the impression that they are hostile to thc payment of pensions, and the emphasis which they also place on the necessity for abolishing the means test has caused their strictures to be regarded as an unfair attack on the Governmeut. That belief has led many members of the Labour party to defend the social services record of the Labour party compared with that, of the Opposition parties. I propose briefly to examine the subject of thrift. Savings are dependent directly upon the capacity to save. As a member of the Parliament, I am able to save more than I was able to save when I was a teacher but that does not mean that I am now more virtuous than I was then in that respect. The explanation is that I now have a higher income than I previously had. But I have not become more virtuous. The wife of a man in receipt of the basic wage, which, after all, is the wage computed to purchase only the basicneeds, can save only at the expense of her family. In those circumstances, the statement that thrift is a virtue is utter rubbish. But wise, intelligent expenditure is definitely a virtue. A person in receipt of the basic wage cannot possibly save a sum of money that will guarantee to him an income in his old age. When we talk loosely about thrift, and say that those who have happened to save are, ipso facto, more virtuous than those who liave not, we are talking utter nonsense, and obscuring the problem. There are other matters to be considered. Let us examine the child endowment. A person with dependants does not need to have a high income now before he finds that his social services contributions equal the child endowment payments that his wife receives. The exception to that statement, of course, is provided by the wage earner with a large family. A man in receipt af quite a moderate inoome can be making a social services contribution of 10s. a week and be receiving a similar -amount in child endowment. A great social advantage of child endowment lies in the fact that the expenditure is put into the hands of the woman. It seems to me to be true to say that in the main women make money go further than men, and insofar as child endowment makes a transfer of expenditure into the hands of women it is a great social advantage. Of course, in the case of large families it also has the great advantage of assisting in the bringing up of the children. The question of a contributory scheme has been raised on several occasions. I have dealt with the argument that it is more soundly hased than a scheme which is dependent on ordinary revenue. If there is a depression and consequent mass unemployment in Australia, it is quite clear that tax contributions to an age pensions scheme will not be kept up and :at some point the Government will be forced to revise all social service benefits downwards. That would apply as much to a contributory scheme as to one that was financed out of taxes. I feel that honourable gentlemen opposite, in dealing with this matter, ought at least to referto the existence of a fund, which now amounts, I believe, to £79,000,000 and which is intended to act as a reserve in a period when there may be a decrease of revenue. Since the National ""Welfare Fund is not, as it were, living from day to day or from hand to mouth, it at least provides a reserve that would cushion the shock of any sudden fall in government revenue in the event of a depression. T congratulate the Government upon the proposed increase of the age and invalid pension, but I agree that it will not do anything more than to offset the rising cost of living. The pensioners in Western Australia take the view, and it is a difficult one to refute, that the age and invalid pension should be fixed at 40 per cent, of the Commonwealth basic wage. Dame ENID LYONS -To'ris e and fall with costs of living? follow if it were always to be 40 per cent, his own home who is earning the same of the Commonwealth basic wage. The amount of money that pensioners would receive at the present time if that proposal were adopted is approximately £2 9s. weekly, or 6s. 6d. more than they are now receiving. An old couple would get £4 ISs. a week. To ask that pensions should be fixed at 40 per cent, of the Commonwealth basic wage does not seem to me to be making a demand for .something that would jeopardize the present fund. As I say, there is now a reserve of £79,000,000. If the cost of living fell, pensions would be decreased; if it rose, they would be increased. I realize that there are revenue difficulties. Governments liketo be able to anticipate expenditure for a year ahead, but I think that that is an obsolete concept. It is possible, in relation to certain items in the budget, to estimate expenditure for a period of more than a year ahead. It is possible to budget for a longer period than one year ahead and to allow for contingencies such as variations in the cost of living and in fact we are doing it by building up a reserve. The amonnt at present in the fund is £79,000,000, and it will, I presume, he increased further. If the proposal of the Western Australian people were adopted, it would help those people who are concerned ahout the rising cost of living. It is difficult to be dogmatic about pensions. . An old couple who are receiving between them an age pension of £4 5s. a week to-day are not badly off, if they have their own home. They are not involved in the clothing and travelling expenses that have to be borne by people who go out to work. If , however, from that £4 5s. a week they have to pay 25s. or 30s. a week for rent, their position is entirely different. We have to face the fact that 85 per cent, of age pensioners have no means other than their pensions. Some of them may own their own homes, but they are probably in a minority. I consider that at some time in the future the means test should at least be modified in its application to a pensioner who has to pay rent. The means test will operate in exactly the same way in respect of a pensioner with his own home who is earning 35s. a week and a pensioner without sum. but the position of the two people",53,Holloway
179,Mr Beazley,"Yes. That wouldis entirely different. In making modificawith a wife and one child. Honourable tions of the means test the question of dead loss expenditure, such, as rent, ought to he taken into consideration.

It is not possible to educate ignorance out of such people, whatever is done. I was particularly interested in the remark of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) that women make money go further than men. Like the honourable member, I have recently entered into the bonds of matrimony. I have had some breathtaking experiences. I do not want to dilate upon them, but I think that neither my heart nor my pocket will stand it if they continue for much longer. man should have married for money. time. For some years we concentrated upon fixing a basic wage, and later provision was made for the payment of child endowment. I have never been able to understand the purpose of child endowment. I hope to make that remark clear as I proceed. In the famous Harvester award the learned judge, having regard to the size of the average Australian family of that time, fixed the basic wage at a level which would provide for the needs of five people. I think that award was made in 1907. ""When another learned judge investigated the position in the early days of war he found that the size of the average Australian family had decreased, and his award provided for the reasonable needs of three people. The Harvester award was made on the basis of the reasonable needs of a man with a wife and three children, but the later award related to the needs of a man members opposite have explained that child endowment was not provided for the first child because it was covered by the basic wage. ""We can only conclude, therefore, that the purpose of child endowment was not to encourage the growth of family life in this country, but to implement the hasic wage hy making payments in respect of children other than the .first a charge upon the national revenue and not upon industry. If that is true, it is a sad commentary upon the decisions of the Arbitration Court in the years between 1907 and 1940 or 1941. I do not want to cast slurs upon judges, but AVC must take the facts as we find them. We can only conclude that, instead of child endowment being designed to encourage the growth of family life in this country, its purpose to-day is to implement the basic wage. There are fundamental differences between the two principles, and I shall endeavour to explain them to the House. The Commonwealth Statistician has supplied me withsome very illuminating figures relating to the number of persons in Australia who have dependent children under th* age of sixteen years. The figures are compiled to the 30th June, 1947. In round figures, in Slew South Wales there were at that time 176,000 families of one child, 121,000 families of two children, and 23,000 families of four children. It has been said that families of two children are not sufficient to maintain our Dooulation at its present figure. In thp 'nineties the average Australian family consisted of 6.2 children but to-day it consists of two children. If the purpose of child endowment is to encourage the growth of family life, we must approach the problem in a different way. If honourable members will consider the facts that led to the outbreak of the South African war they will find that it had its origin in a curious piece of legislation that was introduced by a South African Government many years ago. The Government discovered that if it extended the franchise to all the people who were entering South Africa, those people would be able to out-vote the native Boers. One of its actions was to impose intolerable conditions upon people who wanted to enter the country, to make it their home",55,Holloway

184,Dr. Gaha,"I may try the nextand to rear their families there. The Government disfranchised them because it realized that if they were given full voting power they would be able to outvote the native Boers. If there is a large influx of migrants into Australia over a period of years, it may not be long before they will be in a position to out-vote the Australian equivalent of the native another kind of problem altogether which has not been thought of, or at least which T have not heard discussed in this chamber. If , on the one hand, we have a steadily declining natural increase of population and on the other a gradually increasing population in consequence of our migration policy, the time must come, in the not-distant future, when the impact of the migrant on the Australian-born felt. I do not say that that would be a bad thing, but it is a sad commentary on our own people if we cannot maintain our own natural growth of population. Although the population is increasing it is increasing because of greater longevity among our people and by migration, and not by an increasing birth-rate. child endowment for that reason alone should be given an entirely new meaning. It should not be regarded as a supplementation of the basic wage, but as an encouragement of the growth of family life in this country. Honourable members can visualize some idea of the picture from these figures. Out of 392,000 families in New South Wales, there are only 23,000 families with four or more children. Of the 263,000 families in Victoria, only 14,000 have four or more children. In Queensland the comparative figures are much the same. In that State out of the 147,000 families only 10,000 have four or more children. The estimated figures for the Commonwealth are 9S7,000 families and only 58,000 families of four or more children. That indicates how little the Australian-born ultimately control the destinies of their country. be given an entirely different significance. on some of the political issues in this proposition because when party politics reach their full impact on the community reason seems to go outside the door. It Dr. Gaha. is no use to try to reason with people when the press chooses to cause them to panic. 1 believe that when the people at the last referendum rejected the Government's proposal to control rents and prices tbey did their country a very great disservice. Lf the Commonwealth has power to fix the basic wage it should also ha.ve power to control the prices of essential Boers. That may produce commodities upon which the basic wage has to be expended. It should not lie possible for the Arbitration Court to raise tue basic wage to, say, £7 a week, only to find that on the day after the judgment is delivered the prices of meat and bread rise to offset the increased wage. It should be possible for the Government to say, "" The court has fixed the basic wage at £7 a week; vve now fix the prices of bread, meat and other essential commust be materially modities within very narrow margins of fluctuation "". The basic wage would then mean something. In. criticizing honourable members opposite for advising the people to reject the Government';proposals at the recent referendum I do not do so merely because of party alinements. Results have proved that they So, did this country a singular disservice because after having agreed to allow the Arbitration Court to determine the minimum basic wage they refused to allow the Government to control the prices of essential commodities that that basic wage must be used to buy. I believe that the day will come when Unpeople will approach this problem, not with a mind biased hy party politics, but with sanity. They will apply themselves to the solution of this problem on rational lines because they will be forced to realize that it is of no use for them to hide their heads in the sand. Political change is in the air, and instead of trying to hold it back we would do better to attempt to guide it on rational lines. Just as the struggle for democracy, great and enduring as it was, ultimately will succeeded, so the struggle for newer thought in politics must win through. Child endowment should We must not be hidebound in our approach to this problem; rather must I do not want to touch we be prepared to adapt ourselves to the change with a considerable degree of flexibility. Rather than have things happen by a process of revolution we must achieve them by a process of evolution. The time has arrived when we should reconsider the whole subject of child endowment not as a supplement to the basic wage, as it is regarded to-day, but as a means of encouraging the growth of family life in this country. If the Commonwealth Constitution enables ns to do so, I should like the determination of the basic wage to he referred back to the Arbitration Court. We should say to the court, "" You must determine a basic wage which makes provision for a man, his wife and two children "". Some one may ask, "" What about the man who accepts no family responsibility?"" My answer is that we can look after the responsibility of such a man by taxation. If we did that and then said to the people, ""We shall remove from the field of legislation the need for providing for the second child; if you are prepared to have a third child we will give you 25s. a week; if you have a fourth child we will give you £2 » week"", we would encourage in this young country the growth of Australian-born population that is so urgently needed to ensure our future safety. During the last ten years, the whole Australian picture has changed. Ten years ago, we were a people living close to the .=outhern-most portion of Asia, carving (inf. our own destiny in our own way. To-day, we no longer enjoy that freedom. The world is becoming conscious that we liave vast open spaces and potential resources waiting to be developed. A population of 7,000,000 people, a large percentage of which is moving into the old age group, cannot adequately protect this country. It behoves us to admit that new movements are in the air. We should apply ourselves diligently to understand them. As a first step, granted that we have the necessary machinery and the necessary constitutional power, we should refer back to the Arbitration Oourt the fixation of the basic wage and direct thc court to fix a basic wage adequate to meet the needs of a man, his wife and two children. Next, we should provide for child endowment to be paid solely for the purpose of promoting the growth of fn milies. that. requisite constitutional power, but they would not be able to exercise it because of the operation of uniform taxation. That is not the only way by which the problem of our dwindling birth-rate could be tackled. There are many others. For instance, the efforts of the department administered by the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) have been directed towards making provision at the earliest possible moment for larger families. That avenue could be further explored. In terms of size, family life in Australia is deteriorating. We are maintaining our numbers by increasing longevity and by enabling an ever increasing flow of migrants to infiltrate our population. I trust that the migration policy of the Government will be continued. No honourable member of this House in my time has pushed with more vigor than I have the necessity for attracting migrants to Australia, for I realize that because of our geographical situation .and increasingly significant of the place we are taking in the scheme of world affairs the world is becoming far more conscious of our importance. I offer these comments in no carping spirit, but solely because I believe that I am suggesting the correct approach to our social services problem insofar as it is affected by child endowment. I do not wish to bore honourable members any more on the subject except to emphasize that it is indeed tragic that, of approximately 1,000,000 families in t.he Commonwealth only 5S,000 liave four or more children and only 2.11 have ten children or more. This problem demands the attention of every person in the community. I am aware that it would be an unpopular move for the Government to try to upset a principle that is well established as part and parcel of our social services programme. However, to provide for the second child in the basic wage would represent no innovation. Indeed, as early as 1907 the court provided a wage which was estimated to cover the needs of the second and third child. We should make the child endowment an inducement to people to have large families, a",56,Holloway

So complex, indeed, are some of these problems that they appear to be almost insoluble. For example, people in their 80's who suffer from comparatively minor ailments are now filling the wards of our public hospitals. What can we do with them? They have no other place to go to and many of them have no families to look after them. These people are occupying beds in our institutions and preventing the hospitals from functioning to full capacity. I agree with the honourable member ( Mr Beazley) should be cared are in reasonably good health provision should be made for them to remain together and they should he afforded such comforts as the nation can afford. In increasing numbers old men and old women' who have no homes and much needed bed space in our public institutions. Before the next election' the Government might well consider the desirability of providing in all capital cities inexpensive accommodation for old people in which they may spend the evening of their lives with some degree of comfort. I believe that this would be the cheapest and most effective way of dealing with the problem presented by these old people. I am sure that such a proposal would commend itself to all sections of the community. Its adoption would relieve the burden on our public hospitals and enable them to provide beds urgently needed for the treatment of acute cases. I make the suggestion for what it is worth and, as honourable members know, I have had some experience in this domain, having been Minister for Health in a State government for some . years. My suggestion sbould be given the consideration it merits.. I admit that the total capital expenditure involved .may be high but the problems must be tackled in. one way or another. I wish, now to touch on a highly controversial subject which I desire to approach in a non-party spirit. I refer Dr. Claha. to what are termed, for want of a better description, "" B "" class widows. A Increasing widow of that class comes into the pension field at the age of 50 years, but the wife of a worker does not come into the pension field until she .has reached the age of 60 years. I believe that that will Ihe admitted by all honourable members. I should not like .to tell a widow 50 years of age that she was 'decrepit and could not do a .day's work. Here is a field that requires a lot of examination by the Department of Social Services. One of the matters that is being discussed in thif country at the present time, and one concerning which I have a great, deal of sympathy, is that of home help. I do forFreemantle not know what can be done in regard to that old couples it. There are times -when a mother of for. If they three or four children expecting another child cannot obtain domestic assistance. T believe that an approach should be made to widows in their early fifties in something like the following terms:We shall have you medically examined, and if you are physically fit to perform such work no families are occupying we sliall provide you with a course of training Vou can perform home help duties for a portion of the year. We shall pay you a f u l l salary, and sO that you will not he taxed unduly we shall deduct from your total annual earnings the pension tliat you would have received as a widow if you did uot work. If that were done I believe that many of them would respond to the appeal. If such an inducemrant were offered and the women could be adequately trained in certain branches of nursing and home help generally, I am sure that the scheme would prove successful. I am referring not to the widow with two or three children, or even with one child, but to the widow who is receiving a pension and has no encumbrance of any kind. I believe that if the Department of Social Services offered an attractive salary, some degree of education, and a tax concession equivalent to the widows' pension in return for sendee for a part of the year, a number of these widows would agree to serve and considerable benefit would accrue to the community. I hesitate to believe that a woman would accept 27s. or 30s. a week as a widow's pension in preference, to performing a public service for which she: wonld .receive a reasonable salary, knowing always that if she were out of a job she could again obtain the pension without having to do a full, year's work, l'hat is. a field that should be explored. Mrs. receipt of widows' pensions would not like to start work again. give an opinion upon that matter; [merely suggest that the Department of Social Services give the proposal a trial and observe the result. It may be that only thosepersons who are decrepit seek rhepension and bhat they have not bhe physical capacity to do suchwork. If so, we should^ nofc achieve worthwhileresults. But if fchere are widowedpensioners in their fifties who could perform, this very useful service to the community-, such a schemeshould' be introduced isms "" in the world which will be detriis that they have lost touch with the commercial world. The honourable member's proposal would overcome that. introduce such a scheme in every country town in Australia. If , after an exhaustive examination, it were found that such pen^sioners were not physically capable of doing the work,, I should not press the matter. I make the suggestion because I cannot get out of my soul the conviction fchat it is grossly unfair to say to a woman of 50 years of age, ""Because you are a widow you are entitled to a pension "", and. to the wife of a working man, "" You must work until you are 6.0 years of age before you can get a pension "". That is not right. I was very interested to hear the claim of the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) that wool,, wheat, meat and other primary products enable the Government to provide to. so great a degree social services in Australia. In this connection, my mind goes back to the days of the depression. I recall having heard spoken the words, "" When wool prices go up everything will be all right in this country"". Yet in one of the depression years an exceptionally good wool crop did not improve our economy. The great value of social services, apart from the benefits conferred upon those who are pensionable, is the stability that they give to the consuming and producing community. The retailer and wholesaler are assured tliat. eve.ry. year they will be able to dispose of £100,000,000 worth of consumer goods. from the community, set aside, and not usedj the complaints of Opposition members would be justified; but every penny taken from the community atpresent passes back into, circulation immediately and is used to pay rents and buy consumer goods, thus ensuring stability to the producers. Tbat is anotheraspect of the matterthat should be explored. I have endeavoured to show that social services can confer very great benefits upon the community. I believe that we are entering a new era of social and political activities. There will be no new mental to the people as a whole ifwe develop an evolutionary capitalism. For the last 50 years we have stagnated in our capitalistic approach to many of our problems. That is why present-day social services appear revolutionary. Many honourable members will recall the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. Many people then claimed that, it was only a euphemeral experiment. Subsequently, a similar attack was made on arbitration. I was a member of a cabinet the Premier of which continually referred to"" the birth-pangs of a new idea "". Perhaps social services are experiencing birth-pangs. I . believe, the time is not far distant when all governments and allparties will endorse social services as the new, progressive and. evolutionary approach to a better system of capitalism and as a first-class antidote to some of the dangerous "" isms "" that now prevail in Europe in consequence, of the non-existence of a satisfactory social services scheme. Repatriation) [5.9]-It is pleasing that, generally speaking, the House has approached consideration of this bill in a fairly broad and non-party spirit. After all, whatever might be said about social ser/vices, every government in the past has played some part in the provision of social services for the community.

190,Mr Barnard (Bass,"-Minister forlonger period than have any other parties. I suppose that is because, in the main, the Australian Labour party has been more closely associated with the masses of tbe people who are not fortunately situated in the community. The honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha) has made a contribution to this debate which is entirely free from party considerations, and has made a wise approach to the problem as he sees it. One or two aspects of this matter which have been mentioned during the last day or two ought to be clarified. One was mentioned by the honourable member for ""Wide Bay( Mr will remember that very well because he Bernard Corser). I interjected at the rime because I thought he had inadvertently made reference to the National insurance Health aud Pensions Act when he spoke of the measure passed by tbe Lyons Government, but that the bill had never reached the statute-book of this country. I remind the honourable member. I said by interjection, that the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill was passed, in 1938 and thc National Health and Pensions Insurance (Employers' Contributions) Aet.and the National Health and Pensions Insurance (Employees' Contributions) Act were passed in 1939. T remember the occasions very well, and the lionorable. member for Wide Bay should also remember them because they provided some interesting debates, and they were very interesting sequels. Those acts which were all repealed by the Social Services Consolidation Act No. 26 of 1947 were placed on the statuteuook by the Lyons Government. The only matter that had to be attended to in connection with them was their proclamation. The machinery was all set up to deal with the subject, but it was never set in motion. The then Opposition, the Australian Labour party, said that it wa3 not possible to operate measures of that kind. Although the acts were passed by the government of the day, they were never implemented. I make that point because I wanted to correct the assertion of the honourable meinber for Wide Bay that the acts did not pass the third reading stage. I have a good deal of interest in social services, as have also some honourable Mr Barnard. members of the Opposition who were associated with me on the Social Security Committee which operated in this country for a period of about five years. It is particularly interesting to-day to see unfolding before our eyes the implementation of many of the recommendations that were made by that conimittee over a period of years. In all, the conimittee made nine reports, which were unanimous, except in one detail concerning the payment of certain unemployment benefits during the course of the war. The honourable member for Plinders( Mr Ryan) was one of the members. He rendered good service on that committee. ' Today, we see being translated into legislation the recommendations of the Social Security Committee. The committee, in he persisted in his attitude its first report dated the 24th September. 1941, recommended that a social security act should be passed. To-day, there is on the statute-book the Social Services Consolidation Act, which this bill proposes to amend. That act brought outsocial service legislation up to date, ancl the Minister for Social Services (Senator McKenna) is deserving of praise for his part in the framing of the. measure. Previously, social services were covered by a number of independent acts, which made the schemes difficult to administer. The Social Security Committee also recommended'l'hat the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908-1 !>40, and, where it applies, the Maternity Allowance Act, be amended to provide thatPayment of an invalid pension at the maximum rate be made to a permanently incapacitated person whose disability precludes the earning of more than 15 per cent, of a living wage, provided that such person would otherwise be entitled to receive an invalid pension. A former member for Bourke, Mr .Blackburn, attempted several times to obtain an amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act so as to remove the dissatisfaction arising from the fact that borderline cases arose in which the persons concerned were prevented from qualifying for a pension. That recommendation has now been adopted. Any invalid who is So per cent, incapacitated may qualify for a pension by obtaining the certificate from a medical officer. Regarding deaf and dumb persons, the committee recommended as follows:Deaf and dumb persons be granted similar income rights to the totally blind in the payment of invalid pensions. The deiinition "" deaf and dumb"" to include those who are so deprived of the ordinary faculties of speech and hearing as to be precluded from earning more than 15 per cent, of a living wage. That recommendation has been enacted to the great benefit of the persons concerned. maintenance, the recommendation of the committee was as follows:The basis for calculation of adequate maintenance in respect of invalids, otherwise entitled to an invalid pension at the maximum rate, be increased from £78 per annum per member of the family to £130, a half rate pension to be paid where tbe income per member of tbe family does not exceed £Y5fi per annum, with similar income allowances for children to those at present granted. The' Government considered that recommendation, and a measure of relief has been provided. As a matter of fact, I think the benefits at present in force are even greater than those recommended by the committee. Our committee considered the subject of vocational training of invalids, and submitted the following recommendation:The Minister be empowered to appoint a committee or board whose function it would be to investigate the disability of un invalid pensioner or a claimant for an invalid pension, who is willing to be, or is considered capable of being, trained for a vocation or physical rehabilitation. During recent months, I have ha.d great pleasure in visiting centres such as those at Mount Martha, in Victoria, and Victor Harbour, in South Australia.,, where invalid pensioners are receiving training to enable them to become self-supporting members of the community. When the Social Security Committee was in Queensland, we were told by a deputy commissioner of pensions that he old-age pensioner may receive without reduchad himself trained men and women pention of pension be increased to £1 per week. sioners until they were able to support That recommendation was given effect to themselves, thus regaining their indeand the Government now proposes to pendence and self-respect. I am able to raise the l i m it of permissible income pay a. high tribute to the officers of the f rom. £1 to 30s. a week. When that is Department of Social Services for their done by the passage of this bill the Gohumanitarian treatment of aged and vernment will have raised the l i m it from invalid persons. Nowhere else have I 12s. fid. a week to 30s. a week. seen a body of men with such a human approach to the problems confronting ment taxps in millions, and hands the them. In this regard I could say somemoney back in ten "" bob "" notes. thing about my own department, also, but to-day we are considering the Department of Social Services, and I confine my remarks to it . Throughout Australia there are carefully selected men who are doing an excellent job in the department, with great patience, sympathy and understanding. In every way possible, they help those who come before them for relief. the Minister who abolished the No. 1 War Pensions Entitlement tribunal. meniber for Balaclava ( Mr White) has an obsession on that point. Later on, he will have plenty of opportunities to discuss the subject, and I shall be able to explain satisfactory to the House, if not to the Iionorable member, my reasons for doing certain things. However, I am not going' to be led away from ray subject. I was paying a tribute to the men in the Department of Social Services with whom T came into contact as a member of the Social Security Committee, and also, as a private member for the Parliament. I have not hy me the figures regarding the number of persons who have been given vocational training by the department, but it is considerable. Those persons have become an asset to the community. They never had any desire to be pensioners. They wanted to be restored in health, and to become economically useful. Now, some of them have married, and have taken their normal place in the community. The department, without any fuss or advertisement, is doing a remarkably fine job. The Social Security Committee made the following recommendation on the subject of accumulated property:The amount of permissible income which an MrA WOK in CAMERON -The Govern-",60,Blackburn Man Y Women In If Fchat Money Were Merely Beingtaken

If the honourable member for Barker( Mr The Government adopted that recomArchie Cameron) had listened to the speech of the honourable member for -Denison (Dr. Gaha) on this subject, he would have had a better under^ standing of it. It is not a matter of handing back ten "" bobs"", but of providing a better standard of living for pensioners.

The Acting Leader of the Opposition should set an example in conduct to other -memhers on his side of the chamber. If he does not refrain from interjecting, I shall have to deal with him. ing to explain to the House that recommendations which had been made by the Social Security Committee had been incorporated in legislation. In its third report, the committee made a recommendation providing for the organization of labour, as follows:The organization created under the control -i the Director-General of Man-power provides ihe nucleus of an efficient system of employment exchanges which may be expanded to carry out any function associated with unemployment benefits. Under any scheme of protection against post-war unemployment, the principal day-to-day work would necessarily rest with the employment exchanges, upon whom would devolve the registration of all unemployed persons, and in the event of their failing to obtain work within the prescribed waiting period, the payment of tlieir weekly benefit. Whenf u l ly organized the national services offices in each State would be the appropriate agency through which to apply » work, test-on e object in establishing such ""'Rices being the fullest possible employment nf all labour. That recommendation for an organization to control employment in this eountry was another important feature of the work of the Social Security Oommittee. Last night, the Acting Leader of the Opposition stated that the committee's recommendation for financing social services was similar to the method advocated by the Liberal party. I inform the honourable gentleman that the Social Security Committee, in its -third report, proposed, as an urgent -war measure(n\ Tbe payment of a prescribed scale of benefits, financed by a graduated tax on incomes, to persons suffering distress from war-time unemployment, and (b) The appointment of a Central CommonChifley, J.

W. mendation, and expressed the opinion that it should be .applied to the peacetime set-up. It is now a feature of the -method of financing social services. Old-age pensions were introduced in 190S but, the invalid pensions did not become payable until later. For the information of honourable members, I shall place on record a table showing the increases of the old-age pension duriug the last 30 years. On only one occasion was the rate of pension decreased. The table is as follows:Pension. S. d. 1909 .. 10 0 1910 12 6 1919 .. 15 0 1923 .. 17 6 1925 .. 20 0 1931 .. 17 6 1937 .. 20 .0 1940 .. 21 0 1942 .. 25 0 -1943 .. 27 0 1945 . . 33 6 1947 .. 37 6 1948 .. 42 6 I have heard the opinion expressed thai we have not increased the :age pension in relation to the increased cost of living. Actually, the cost of living index cannot be applied to the age pension. When we used the Commonwealth -Statistician's figures to determine whether the pension should rise or fall in relation to fluctuations of the cost of living, organizations representing old-age pensioners asked the Government to discontinue that method. Their request was granted. I believe that tlie purchasing power of pensions bears a reasonable relation to the cost, of living. The Labour Government can justifiably claim .a great deal of credit for the improvement of social services, and the people appreciate increases of age and invalid pensions, dependents' allowances, maternity allowance, child endowment, unemployment and sickness benefits, and hospital benefits. In the social services field, the Labour Government has done an exceedingly good job not only in war-time but also in peace-time.

203,Mr Barnard,"I was endeavourthe interest that I have taken in social services for many years, I felt that I should say something before the motion, for the second reading was agreed to. My remarks do not seem to be appreciated by honourable members opposite. However, I am sure that they w ill agree with what I have said about my interest in these matters, even although I have had to say it myself. It has been a pleasure to me to see this scheme unfold, first as a member of the Parliament and later ,as a Ministeri n the Government that is responsible for it . I should like age and invalid pensions to be paid at a higher rate than is proposed. There are, of course, imperfections in the present system. As the honourable member Beazley) said, everybody is not in the same position and, undoubtedly, pensioners who own their own homes have an advantage over those who have to pay rent. Despite the anomalies that still .reof honourable gentleman opposite may main, the bill represents a great step forward in the provision that is made for our aged people. It is by no means an end in itself. Some of the anomalies to which reference has been made by honourable members on both sides of the House will have to be rectified later. subjects dealt w i th by the honourable member for Frementle, the honourable member Blackburn), the honourable member for Denison( D r . Gaha) and the honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Duthie) w ill be dealt with during the term of the next Parliament, when a Labour government will still be in power. The people w ill not dismiss a government which has done so much for them. Like the honourable member for Wilmot, I shall be very happy if I receive nothing in return for my social services contributions. The contributions are paid to help less fortunate members of the community, and should be regarded as a thanksgiving for good health and the strength to do something to help one's fellows. Although this bill has been endorsed by members of all parties in this House, four of the last five speakers are supporters of the Government. Although the people desire legislation to he passed only after it has been f u l l y discussed by the Parliament, they do not wish the time of the Parliament to be wasted by Ministers and other honourable members stonewalling bills. That is a reflection on the Ohair. spect, that it is not a reflection on the Chair. Your function, sir, is to call the first honourable member who rises to speak, and in this debate you have done so. It is a reflection on the Government, because it is the Government and not you, sir, that is stone-walling this measure. Y o u have not spoken in this debate. If you had, you might have been charged with stone-walling. I submit for Fremantle ( Mr that my remarks are strictly in order. It is urgent that the increased pensions shall he paid to age pensioners as soon as possible, but the stone-walling tactic? prevent that from being done. The pension increases that are proposed in this bill are sufficient only to compensate the aged and infirm people of Australia for the inflation and consequent decrease of the purchasing power of the pound that The has been caused by the .maladministration by this Government of the country's affairs. The purchasing power of the for .Bourke( Mrs. increased pensions will be equivalent only to the purchasing power of those that were paid in 1920. The Minister for Lahour and National Service( Mr. Holloway) has stated that a further four months must elapse before the increased pensions can be paid. The honourable gentleman said that, owing to a shortage of staff, it will not be possible to pay them earlier than that. The Department of Labour and National Service is a large organization. Its task is to find employment for unemployed people. Employers are crying out for men, but they are not available. During the war onr industrial effort was diverted from the production of the goods and services that the people required to the production of war materials. When the war ended, the shelves of our warehouses and retail stores were almost empty, and since then we have been concentrating upon building up stocks of the goods that the people require and which",64,Paibb

206,Mr Francis,"I submit, with rewere denied to them during the war years. Production is still not sufficient to meet the demand, although almost every available man and woman is in employment. As a result, the staff of rlie Department of Labour and National Service has very little to do. I ask the Minister whether any officers of his department can be loaned to the 1 department of Social Services to assist in the clerical and administrative work that must be completed before the in creased -pensions can be paid. Thei n creases were decided upon by Cabinet a considerable time ago, and, if the Government really wished, to give effect to them quickly the preliminary work could have been completed before the bill was brought down so that the proposals could be implemented immediately it was passed. The Government is only toying with the aged and infirm people of this country, and by its stone-walling tactics in this chamber it is endeavouring to delay the payment of the increased pensions to them. T say that the underemployed officers of the Department of Labour and National Service should have been set to work to prepare the ground so that the payments could have been made as soon as the bill was passed by the Purliament. that the Government proposes to yield to the pressure that has been brought to bear upon it by honourable members on this side of tbe HouseI f we had not "" punched "" at the Government, it would not have done so. The Department of Labour and National Service is supposed to find a job for everybody who is out of work, but nobody is unemployed. As a result, the officers whose task is to find jobs for tlie unemployed are themselves, in effect, without jobs. I contend that they should be used to do thc administrative work that is involved in giving effect to these proposals. useful outcome of this debate, during which the Minister has been "" strafed "" by honourable members on this side of the House, has heen that the Government apparently no longer proposes to delay the payment for .the increased pensions I am sure that the aged and infirm people of this country will thank honourable members on this side of the Housef or that. They have not much to thank the Government for, because the amount by which the pension is to be increased will only raise its purchasing power to the 1920 level. Although the bill proposes increases of the pensions that are payable to the aged and infirm., the children have not received the consideration to which they are entitled. Honourable members on this side of the chamber have stressed again and again that the taxes payable by family men should be reduced and that concessions in respect of their wives and children should be increased. I urge that the provisions of the bill which relate to children should be reviewed, because they are inadequate. There is a lot of make-believe in this bill. It has been suggested that because a pensioner is entitled to earn 30s. a week without affecting his pension, the total weekly income of a married couple may be £7 5s. One has only to look at many of our aged and infirm people to realize that they are not capable of earning any money at all. Sitting suspended from 6 to S p.m. sion of the sitting, I had been discussing the proposal in the bill now before us to increase invalid, age and widow's pensions by 5s. a week and also to increase the amount paid by way of child endowment. I had said that all parties in this House support tliese proposals. Indeed, they could do nothing less than that because what is proposed in this legislation represents only a stepping up of the amount of pension and child endowment to meet the increase of the cost of livin g or, in other words, the fallin g off of the purchasing power of the £1 caused by, or contributed to by, inflation resulting from the Government's maladministration of the affairs of this country, its One extravagance and the loss of production consequent upon the excessive taxation imposed upon industry. As this measure is designed solely to meet these conditions it should have had a speedy passage through this House, but the Goverument has stone-walled it.

209,Mr Francis,"Before the suspenI'mthe Army( Mr Chambers) also rose ID discuss the bill. It is remarkable to Hnd speaker after speaker on the Government side discussing a proposal with rhe principle of which all parties are in agreement. I rose mainly to protest against the delay in making available ro certain deserving sections of the Australian community badly in need of assistance the additional money that this measure will provide to enable them to meet the increased cost of living. Even now the Government proposes to give to invalid and aged persons and widows the purchasing equivalent only of the pension which: they received in 1920. There is nothing magnanimous in these proposals. I. protest at the delay which has marked the introduction of this measure into the Parliament. The inflation which the increased pension rates are designed to cover has already been in existence for a long time. I point out that payment of the pension out of the proceeds of revenue, and also from the social services contribution is a very insecure method of providing for the needs of these people. Indeed it is possible for the Government to increase the rates of pensions to the scale proposed only because nf the high incomes enjoyed by the people to-day, principally because of the high prices obtained for our exportable primaryproducts, such as wool and wheat, and the high prices ruling for manufactured goods. If the incomes of persons engaged in industry generally, particularly in primary industry, were to drop because of falling prices, the security of any pension^ schemefinancedin this way would be jeopardized. I urge the Government to completely re-examine these proposals. It is not the duty of the Opposition to frame the Government's legislation. Our task is to point out to the Government, the weaknesses of the legislation it introduces into the Parliament. We have done that in this instance hy pointing out how insecure is the financial basis cn which the increased pension rates are resting. Another matter to which I wish to in pension and permissible income. T'he draw the attention of the Government is difference between the total pension and the increasing number of pensioners, a permissible income allowed to the' widow subject which was dealt with early in the with one child and to a. married couple debate by the honourable member for each receiving the full age pension is Mr Francis. Dai-win (Dame Enid Lyons).. Probably the Minister, having heard so many speeches since the point was raised, has forgotten about it. In 1910, there were 65,492 pensioners. Ten years later, in 1920, the number had increased to 99,170. In 1930 it increased to 155,196; in 1940, to 272,896.; and in 1947, the last year for which figures are available, it had increased to 290,173. Analysing these figures in another way, for every 10,000 of the population in Australia, there were 150 pensioners in 1910, 1S9 in 1920, 240 in 1930, 38S in 1940 and 384 in 1947. Having regard to the rapid rise in the number of persons in the community in ' receipt of pensions generally, and to the dwindling number of persons who are to provide the funds from which pensions are to be paid, the whole basis of pensions should be reviewed by the Government. Por a long time honourable members on this side of the House have pressed the Government to give greater -consideration to the needs of a married man. with a wife and family. We have urged, among other things, that such people should be granted substantially increased tax concessions so that they may have available more money with which to meet their family responsibilities. Only now have we been told of the sudden acceptance by the Government of the vital principle that a .married man with a family should be granted further assistance. Another unsatisfactory feature of this legislation is the provision for widows and children. TJnder the present proposals an "" A "" class widow is to receive £2 2s. fid. a week. She is also entitled to receive os. a week for the first child, or a total of £2 7s. 6d. a week by way of pension for herself and her child. The total amount of pension and permissible income allowed to such a widow is £3 17s. 6d. a week. To-day, however, a couple each receiving the age pension are each entitled to receive £2 2s. 6d. a week and to earn 30s. a week or a. total of £7 5s. :E3 7-s. 6d. a week. I believe that tbe fixation of a permissible inoome for people in receipt of the age pension is entirely useless. Very few of them on account of their age are able to work. Yet the Government proposes to allow them a permissible income wbich, with theii pension, 1 will enable a married couple to enjoy a total income of £7 5s. a week. The principle' underlying the whole of these proposals is wrong. I focus the attention -of the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services on the weakness of the Government's proposals by citing some other figures which were -mentioned earlier in this debate. The total amount of income and pension for widows with children is as follows:Widow with one child Widow w i th two children Widow with three children Widow with four children Widow with five children Widow with six children Widow with seven children Widow with eight children A widow would have to have eight payment of pensions ' at the independent children in order to secure creased rate to be'made. Now we are for herself the same amount of pen-concentrating on the goods that the comsion and permissible income as is munity wants. The raw material which allowed to a couple receiving the age penwas being used for manufacturing goods sion. The Government, has obviously for war has only just become available given very scant consideration to these for the manufacture of goods required by -proposals. There is far too much makethe civil community. Accordingly, to-day believe in them. The whole of the legiseverybody lation as it applies to children should be demand. Based on claims that have been recast. If it were not for the need for made about full employment, the staff the aged, the infirm and the widows to of the Department of Labour and receive this additional money at once I National Service should be almost entirely would have moved that the bill be withunemployed, and available to be switched drawn and recast in order to give a over to prepare this data to enable these greater measure of justice.

The Minisstantly urged by Opposition members. ter by interjection last night made it clear that it was impossible to pay the -increased amounts forthwith because of insufficient staff to work out the details. The proposals contained in this measure have not been suddenly accepted by the Government. They have been known for a long while and there has beenample time to prepare all the necessary data to ensure that payment would be made immediately the bill was passed. The officers of the Department of Labour and National. Service cannot be fully occupied. To-day there is a great scarcity of men available for employment. The omcers of that department might well be made available for -this work. During the war almost the whole of the activities of industry and commerce were devoted to war producPer week. tion.

I do not intend toengage in a discussion of the arguments which have been advanced by honourable members on either side of the House about which party brought this or that measure into being, or failed to meet this or that particular need. all parties claim to believe in this principle. I shall leave it at that. I speak rather from the point of view of trying to make some practical contribution towards this debate and to put forward some practical suggestions. I shall also point out some anomalies which [ do not think have so far been mentioned in this discussion; or if they have been mentioned they will bear repitition. \. shall deal with one aspect of sickness benefits. Some months ago I and National Service( Mr Holloway) whether he would amend the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act to provide a longer term in which application could be made for sickness benefits. plied that he would do so if he considered that there was any necessity for such an amendment. Subsequently the Minister explained that he considered that the discretionary power vested in the officers administering the act was sufficient to meet all cases. I regret to say that that has not been so. In at least two instances of genuine illness, country workers were debarred from a major portion of the sickness benefits to which they would have been entitled had their applications heen made within the period of six weeks specified in the act. I point out that country workers are not in the same favorable position as those working in the closely settled areas who have the advantage of hospital facilities and the direct assistance of union organizers. Sliould they not be acquainted fully with the provisions of the act they can draw on the knowledge of their fellow workers, who will help them out. That does not apply in many instances to country workers. Frequently when workers take sick in sparsely settled districts, it isimpossible for the men concerned to lodge their applications within the specified time. I think it is general knowledge that many such workers are dependent on the advice of the flying doctor, and: it is impossible for such people, in many instances, to secure the attendance of a doctor. They have to make contact with the flying doctor by pedal wireless, obtain his prescription, and do the best they can. In circumstances where they have It must be recognized that only one mail delivery a week, or perhaps in some instances only one delivery a fortnight, these genuine workers in the sparsely settled districts are debarred from obtaining sickness benefits. I repeat that in at least two cases, notwithstanding that I inquired into them fully and submitted the facts to the officers who were administering the provisions of the act, for review, those workers were denied their rights. The facts were placed before the Minister for Social Services (Senator McKenna), but discretionary asked the Minister for Labour power was not exercised in those instances because the applications were made too late. I consider that an amendment should be made to the act to cover that situation. been provided for. those workers be denied a review of the circumstances I have outlined? Mr Poi.T.Ann -Thos e cases are out of date. Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) has apparently no concern for the workers who live in sparsely settled districts. I . on the other hand, have a great concern for those who live in country areas, and I make an appeal now that provision should be made, by an amendment of the act, for a. longer period in which such workers may lodge their applications. As long as a case is genuine, and supported by a doctor's certificate, a sick worker should be granted the benefits. Mr Po.T.r.ARD -That aspect has already been adjusted. cases, the wives of the sick workers know little about the provisions of the act, and in any case have their hands full bearing",66,Paibb

Irrespective of what the Minister now says, I repeat that in the two cases I have mentioned the sick workers were denied the benefits to which they were entitled. When I asked the Minister a question on this matter, he was quite favourably disposed and answered me genuinely, but his reply does not exactly meet the position. made to provide for such cases. parently subsequent to my question to the Minister. 1. wish to mention an anomaly concerning the interpretation of the provisions regarding the payment of pensions. TJnder the act a pensioner is entitled to. augment his income. To take advantage of that provision, many pensioners have taken in boarders. The total amount of hoard received has then to be regarded by the authorities as income, which is totally wrong. Everybody knows that if 30s. is paid for a week's board, the net income of the person who provides the board is considerably less than that figure. W it h the present high prices ruling for foodstuffs, in order to obtain a net income of 30s. a week, the pensioner would have to charge the boarder no less than £3 or £4 a week. Only the net amount should be taken into consideration. If that were done, and allowance made for the cost of the iroods required as food for the boarder, obviously the pensioner would not then he penalized, because the amount would be insufficient to bring about any reduction of his pension. I. shall now raise another matter for interpretation. Perhapsi t has been provided for already, hut I have had instances quite recently where a pensioner owns a residence within the stipulated value, hut has been forced by illness or other circumstances to leave the home and reside with one of his family. It may even be that he has to seek accommodation elsewhere because no other member of his family is able to assist him. Because of his inability to look after himself the pensioner is penalized because tlie value of that residence is assessed at. its full capital value, and the amount of the pension payable to that person is reduced accordingly. In such instances I submit that a doctor's certificate proving ill health should be accepted and the pension lef t intact. In any case the pensioner should have the right of a home, irrespective .of whether he lives in it or not. And so f a r as that one home is concerned, if the net value is taken into consideration, allowance should be made for rent less expenses by way of rates and other charges. That would mean that has been unless the pensioners had other income, their pensions would be unaffected. OnT h a t was apthe present rate, despite the proposed amendment to increase the amount that a pensioner may earn from £1 to 30s. a week, in most instances pensioners would not receive more than £1 a week net from the rent of their property. There is an anomaly in regard to the unemployment allowances, to which 1 shall draw attention. Unemployment allowance is not payable to any person over the age of 65 years. I point out. however, that many persons over that age prefer to work. According to the taxation schedule, they are taxed on their earnings, whatever their income may be. If unemployment or sickness should overtake them, they are debarred from securing any benefits for which they have contributed. ber must have an unfortunate position in his district. says that, I know that there is an alternative method by which they can draw the pension. made to such people to work. encourage everybody physically able, to work. Apart from .the fact that a man is better off, financially, if he is working. I think it is better for him from a health point of view that he should work. He would be permitted to work as long as he desires, provided that he is not forced to do anything against his will . Many such persons recognize that it is beneficial to their health to perform a certain amount of",69,Paibb

221,Mr Daly (Martin) [8.331,"I hadlieap should look after themselves as best they can; or, at any rate, they should be supported by social benefits financed by the lower-paid workers. orable members opposite have advocated the introduction of a contributory scheme of social services, as if that were the solution of all our problems. They also advocate a flat rate of income tax, irrespective of the income of the taxpayer. This would place the burden of social services on that section of the community least able to bear it, who are in receipt of the lower incomes, whereas the burden should be borne to a large extent by the wealthy section of the community who can well afford to do so. Honourable members opposite would have us believe that the introduction of a contributory system of national insurance would immediately lead to the abolition of the means test. They lose sight of the fact that, under such a scheme many retired people, including public servants, would not qualify to participate in its benefits unless they had been contributing for a certain number of years. That was the situation in Great Britain when the national insurance scheme was introduced there. To tell the people that under a contributory system every one would qualify immediately to participate in the benefits is sheer political dishonesty. As a matter of fact the scheme which was introduced into this Parliament in 1938, and which was not preceeded with for reasons best known to the Opposition, provided for the payment of benefits much below those which this Labour Government has provided. The present scheme may, in fact, be called contributory in one sense, and it has the advantage that the person who qualifies for a pension under the terms of the act may draw that pension irrespective of the period during which he has been paying social services contributions. interest of the Opposition in these matters is purely political. federation, non-Labour have had plenty of opportunity to put into, effect social service schemes. Labour' governments have been in office for only about seven years, during which time a better social service system has been introduced than obtains in other countries which had a big start on Australia. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) said that the HonParliament should not discuss Ihis subject on party lines, that honourable members should uot bicker about rises in the pension rate, but should co-operate in evolving the best social service scheme possible. Apparently, he overlooks the fact that, in 1941, an all-party Social Security Oommittee was set up upon which were representatives of the Labour party, the Australian Country party and what is now the Liberal party. That committee did excellent work. Its deliberations were most harmonious, and its recommendation were, for the most part, unanimous, and formed the basis of some of the legislation introduced by the Curtin Government and the present Government. However, after the. 1946 election, members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party refused to sit on the Social Security Committee. The Labour party has nominatedfour members to sit on the committee, and they are awaiting the co-operation of Opposition members. The Labour party does not regard social services as a subject for party politics, and we have invited the Opposition to co-operate with us to evolve a scheme for social services which will confer the greatest possible benefit on tlie people of Australia. I have no desire to delay the passage of this important bill, for which many people are waiting so that they may enjoy the benefits which it provides. However, supporters of the Government have an obligation to answer the false assertions of honourable members opposite on the subject of the means test. The Labour Government is committed to the gradual abolition of the The means test. We are not so foolish as to believe that we can substantially reduce Since taxation, and, at the same time, enter governments into commitments which would .involve greatly increased expenditure. It is estimated that, during the first year, the abolition of the means test would cost £54,000,000, in addition to the £S0,000,000 already being paid out in social service benents. We cannot have it both ways. Tne Opposition has also advocated the endowment of the first child of a family. When an anti-Labour government introduced child endowment-for which I give it due credit, bearing in mind the reasons which prompted it, it, could have endowed tbe first child if it had wanted to do so, but the honourable member for FawknerC Mr Holt), who was in charge of the measure, explained tliat to endow the first child would upset the formula for the assessment of the basic wage. If honourable members will read tbe report of his speech, they will notice that, hi? excuses for debarring the first child from receiving financial endowment occupy nearly a column in Hansard. However, his principal reason was tliat the payment of endowment in respwt of the first child would have resulted in a reduction in the basic; wage. If endowment were now payable in respect to the first child, the additional cost would be £24,000,000 a year. To adopt that suggestion and to abolish the means test would increase tht' total social services commitments to £166,000,000 a year. Honourable memhers opposite know that the whole proposition is fantastic, but they are endeavouring to gull the people into believing that the means test can be abolished over-night. In a deliberate attempt to gain votes, they are making all kinds of specious promises, and hoping rhat the people will fall for them. The Government believes in the honest approach. During the last seven years it. has modified the means test. The increased cost of social services is an indicomfort without pensions. The Lahour cation cf its sincere desire to completely abolish the. means test. Some people say that the Labour Government is not sincere in this desire. to them is that we should compare rhe scale of pensions that prevailed a few years ago with the present rates. The amount of pension has been doubled, and its purchasing power would be even greater than it is had the Opposition uot advocated a .relaxation of prices control. A man and his wife arc permitted to liave an income of £3 a week before their combined pensions of £4 5s. a week are affected. That increase of the permissible income is extraordinary when we recall that an anti-Labour governinent allowed ifr. Paly. only 25s. a week for a married couple. A man and his wife are eligible to receive age pensions even though their joint bank accounts may amount to £200. and they are not completely disqualified until their joint assets exceed £1,500. The fact that they own the house in which they live does not debar them from receiving a pension. The Labour Goverument has a .remarkable record in improving social services during the last, seven years compared with the barren record of anti-Labour governmeuts during a period of 30 years. I agree that even t.he increased rate of pension may not allow the recipients to live adequately, but, we must not forget that every increase of the pension by ls. a week represents a total cost of £1,000,000. That financial factor must be borne in mind when, we are considering whether pensions should be substantially increased. The Labour Government has done everything possible to modify the means test, to assist those people who urgently require pensions, and to ensure that justice is meted out to other sections of the community. Approximately SO per cent, of recipients of age and invalid pensions have no income other than their pension. The abolition of the means test would not assist the big majority of pensioners who are completely dependent on their pensions, although it would substantially benefit many people who are now disqualified but who already have sufficient means to live in reasonable Government has no apology to make, and does not need to offer any exeuses for its actions during the last My reply seven years in modifying the means test on age and invalid pensions. T do not desire to delay the deliberations of the House on this bill, and I shall conclude my speech with a brief comparison. In 1938-39, expenditure on social services amounted to only £16,000,000. In the current financial year, the expenditure will be approximately £SS,000,000, on the most comprehensive scale of social services that this country has ever known, including substantial child endowment, maternity allowance, widows' pensions, funeral benefits for invalid and age pensioners, allowances for the wives of invalid pen-sioners, unemployment and benefits, rental rebates under tbe Commonwealth-States payments to sufferers from tuberculosis and thciii' dependants, and an extensive hospital benefits scheme. has medicine scheme, but it is uot operating because of a strike by members of the medical profession aginst the democratic Pharmaceutical Benefits Act which has been passed by this Parliament. to disabled persons aud iu respect of mental patients in institutions, thus relieving their relatives cf that obligation. has achieved a magnifieient record in social servies during seven years compared of a period of 30 years. . the bill to the House. I am sure that the people will judge f a i r l y the great record of the Lahour Government, and recognize as insincere the criticism which honourable members opposite have levelled at it . Unquestionably, every honorahle member desires to support the Government in assisting invalid and age pensioners, provided the country can bear the financial burden. I desire to direct attention to certain interesting facts. In 1938-39, rhe total Commonwealth budget was approximately £90,000,000. In the current social services, including invalid and age pensions, widows' pensions, child endowment and unemployment and sickness henefits, £S8,000,000. Honourable members must he realists in these matters. We must recognize that the price of wool may return to an average of approximately ISd. per lb., the price of wheat to 5s. a bushel or less, and that of butter to Is. 3d. per lb. Some honourable members opposite believe that in the event of such serious reductions of prices, our secondary industries will enable ihe country to continue social services payments at the present high rate. That belief is stupid, and cannot be supported. Australia is u primary producing country, and a large measure of its sickness prosperity is dependent upon returns fro m the sale of its primary products housing agreement, overseas. The only sound method by which we can assure the continuance of an adequate social services scheme, in the Provision event of a decline of the prices' of our also been made for a free primary products abroad, is by the introduction of a contributory scheme. Employers, employees and the Australian and State Governments should contribute to a general fund. I am sure thar. the Minister for Labour and National Payments are also made Service( Mr Holloway), who represents the Minister for Social Service? (Senator McKenna) in this House, sincerely desires to assist the less fortunate The Labour Government section of the community, and that, in his heart, he agrees with my contention that the only sound system of financing with the barren record social services is by a contributory anti-Labour governments during scheme. For political purposes, however, I commend the honourable gentleman expresses the opinion that the wealthier sections of the community should support the recipients of social services. I am gratified to learn that, undei this bill, a person who has contributed to a superannuation f u n d for a small pension on his retirement w ill not be disqualified from receiving an age pension. In the past, a railway employee, for example, who contributed for two, three or four units of pension, was in a worse position on his retirement than a man who had not contributed to any funds, and who, being without means, was eligible to receive the f u l l age pension. In thifinancial yeai', expenditure on opinion of the houorable member for Martin( Mr Daly), the Opposition parties in this chamber do not desire tn assist the aged and invalid people. He will be . approximately likes to remind honourable members thar the Lyons Government reduced old-age and invalid pensions.

The inflation? The Minister knows ap. well Government had authority to continue as I do that that is the worse proposition, that could be put to these people. The Government needs to consider this matter very seriously and to decidewhat it wants. ""Does it want the people to work aud save to provide for their old age, or does it want them to depend solely upon the Government? Does it want to say to them, "" Never mind about the future. Spend your money, because you will belooked after. There are many wealthy people in this country. We shall tak« money from them and give it to you"". The honourable member for .Griffith. (Mi*.

The anomalous, unjust and iniquitous part of the scheme was that it had no application to any individual who derived his income from any medium other than the employment of workers. cians, medical practitioners in the higher ranks of the medical fraternit y earning between £2,000 and £5,000 a year, individuals owning 20 houses and deriving an income of'perhaps £20 a week from them, and investors with a weekly income of £20 or £30 a week who perhaps employed only a stenographer were not, under the Casey scheme, required to contribute a penny piece. On the other hand, a man who owned a factory in which 100, 1,000 or even 2,000 people were employed was required to pay ls. 6d. a week in respect of every employee. That was the scheme that was put forward by the government of the day, backed by the Australian Country party, as a satisfactory method of dealing with the problem of social security in Australia. Underlying it was the fantastic idea that in that way it was possible to accumulate a reserve funda mere book entry-so that after 20 years there would he sufficient in the "" kitty "" to pay to all those who needed it a certain sum each week in respect of the disabilities from which, they suffered.

By no othor means can it he provided. We may write figures in a book until we become blue in the face from the necessity for contributing. the system operated by the Government it is possible to finance the scheme of social service benefits without the necessity for everybody contributing on a flat rate basis. The flat rate basis was proposed in the scheme introduced into the Parliament by Mr Casey and supported by the honourable member for Bendigo. has amply demonstrated that it is posPolitisible to car© for the aged, the sick and the unemployed by imposing a graduated tax levied in accordance with ability to pay. Let us be honest about this. In respect of the last income year a man with a wife and two children in receipt of not more than £300 per annum, every penny piece of which he needed for the ordinary necessaries and amenities of life, paid no.t one single penny into the fund used by the Government to finance the aged, the sick and the infir m in the community, to finance hospitals to the amount of 6s. a day for each occupied bed, to relieve the unemployed and to pay the various subsidies provided by the Government. But what did the people pay who are in the position of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) and myself, with our parliamentary allowance of £1,500 a yeaa in addition 1 to an income from our farms? I am not. sure, but if my recollection is correct I paid approximately £160 in tax last year, and well I might have done so.

If that does not finance cbild endowment to-day, the present Government is the guilty party, not the Government which put it on the statute book. To hear the Minister talk about rich and poor one would think that there are hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of rich people in this country who are contributing to social services. Before we proceed to consider the comtributions of these people according to the official government returns, we should further consider social services. [ believe in the old conservative doctrine of self-help and thrift, and I contend that people should look after themselves, and only expect the Government to look after them in the event of misfortune overtaking them. Whilst that might he old-fashioned and out of date, nevertheless it is my view. For any social services scheme to be satisfactorily administered it must be based in very much the same way as a friendly society is based. I have been a member of a friendly society for many years. My parents arranged my membership without consulting me and I have remained a member ever since. thing the honourable memher did that his The cost is rising by leaps and parents told him to do? not say that it is the only thing, but we are and the cost of providing social services all responsible to our parents for many is gradually rising. things. The Government should be pretime the Government claims that the pared to found social services on a satis""golden age"" has arrived, that there is factory basis. The only fair and just 100 per cent, employment, and that so basis, is one under which a person long as this Government remains in who hopes to get something out of office that will continue to be the state the scheme will contribute to the of affairs. The Minister for Commerce fund during the times when he and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) may well able to contribute. But what is the posinod his head, but Ministers propose to tion to-day? At what stage of income do remain in office everlastingly people start to contribute at all? I have not the taxation returns before meat the moment, but I have other documents here which do not deal with taxation. ment members time after time suggest From memory, under the old taxing as a proposition that full employment scheme which will be out-dated in a few is going to be maintained from now on, days' time-or a few weeks' time judging and that the present Government is going by the present rate of progressa man to be in office to see that that happens. who with a wife and one child received The Government claims that, the present f531 £5 10s. a week was called on to contribute only 3d. a week .to the social services fund. If a man expects to get benefits out of the social services fund he should be prepared to pay something towards building up that fund. Every man in receipt of wages or salary ought to be compelled to contribute to the fund. That is the first matter on which I and the Government fall out in regard to social services. All wage and salary earners should contribute. That is the policy that I put into force at one time when I was acting as Minister for Health, perhaps in quite an unorthodox way, in this city. I insisted on every wage-earner in this city contributing for hospital benefits. In return they were entitled to free treatment in a ward of the hospital. I was told on Sunday last that that scheme has since been abolished. My informant was a gentleman who is a. supporter of the Ausbralian Labour party, and. he said that he considered the scheme should have been continued because it was well founded and based on common sense. Let us consider the size of the fund required for the provision of social services. Last year the figure approximated £70,000,000. Speaking from memory, this year the provision of social services will cost the Gobounds every year and the Government is taking a great credit to itself for the A t the same",79,Paibb

272,Mr Archie Cameron,"Governsystem of social services and pensions is the greatest aud most beneficial that has ever been introduced. I. pass now to the important matter of the sources from wh;ich the Minister expects the mouey to come. From what the Minister has said anyone would think that the great hulk of the income tax revenue of Australia comes from the wealthy people. The social services contribution to-day is based on income only. Let us consider the facts as disclosed by the Commissioner of Taxation in his report based on the 1944-45 assessments, the latest report that I have been able to get. The total number of taxpayers in that year was 2,049,000. Of those, only 17,958 had incomes of over £1,500 a year. I. stress this, because that figure is the salary which this Parliament provides for its members. out of a total of 2,049,000 taxpayers, the number of people who received an income of between £105 and £150 a year was 223,000-that is those who received just over £2 and under £3 a week. The number of people who had incomes of between £150 and £200 a year was 258,000. The largest group of taxpayers was those receiving incomes of between £301 and £350 a year, that is, under £6 a week to under £7 a week. There are .further graduations of £50 a year right up to £1,500 a year. The number of people who received over £1,500 was only 17,95S. The total income firom. personal exertion in that year was £714,000,000. Those people who received £1,500 a year received in all £4S,000,000. The property-income position was even worse. Of the total income of £69,000,000 from property, only £16,000,000 was received by people in receipt of over £1,500 a year. Without delving more deeply into figures which are a vailable to all honourable members, let us consider from what source the social services fund is to come if not from people who are in active employment. The idea that the money can be got from general revenue or from the employers is quite unsound. The moment a tax is put on the employer for this purpose, automatically the cost of everything manufactured by him is increased, and ultimately the burden /Ifr. Archie Cameron. falls on the primary producers, who are dependent on the returns from the sale of their products on the markets of the world. They get so much less of the value of their products than they received before this tax was imposed. If the burden is placed on secondary industry, the industrialist adds it to the cost of production, and the public ultimately pay. If it is placed on general .revenue, there are a multitude of ways by which the Government can raise the money, as we have learned in recent years. Thus, we get back to the original proposition that any social service scheme should be based on the contributions of those who are to benefit under it. The only alternative is for everyone to contribute to the eost, not according to what he hopes to get out of the scheme, but That is, according to his income, and if that alternative be adopted, there should be no means test. The Government says that it is moving towards that end. Perhapsit is moving at the same rate as it was once supposed to be moving towards itssocialistic objectives. When the Labour party, in 1921, included in its platform the plank that provided for the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange, the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), who was present at the conference, is reputed to have said that the party hoped to attain its objective in 100 years time. That, of course, is now out of date, and the Labour party has other plans. I have never concealed my opinion on the subject of social services. Until our social services scheme is founded on a contributory basis, it must continue to he unsound. When prices for wheat and wool and base metals come down to a sane level, for the present prices are not sane, but famine prices, there will be a reduction of the national income, and sooner or later this Government, if it remains in office so long, will have to face a very awkward situation. The Government has been in office now for seven years. We recall that Joseph, duriug his first seven years as governor of Egypt, had little to trouble him. His troubles came upon him during hif second seven years in oflice. Apart from the fact that I believe that Australia would be better governed by the Liberal party, I say that it would be poetic justice if the present Government should be in office when' the bailiff arrives and dement remains in office, which I hope it mands a financial .reckoning. The present Government has, by its policy, increased costs. It has fooled around with trust funds. ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! discussing finance, and it is one of the oldest privileges of the lower houses of parliaments in British communities to refuse to vote money for the use of the Crown until grievances have been discussed,including the way in which the money is to be raised. -That applies to budgets and estimates »nly. applies to all financial matters. -Well, the Chair thinks otherwise. prepared to admit that truth may sometimes be found upon the throne, but I am sure that a. study of the British parliamentary system will bear out what i. have said. I trust that the day is not far distant when the Parliament will take an objective view of social services. Otherwise, the time will come when a Labour government may have to reduce pensions again, as a Labour government had to do during the depression. That, as I have said, would be only poetic justice, because the policy of this Government has brought about the very conditions that made an increase of pensions necessary. The Chifley Government, by a deliberate although undisclosed policy, has brought about an increase of wages, costs, profits and prices in order to get out of the difficulties arising from its borrowing policy during the war. -The borrowing policy of the Chifley Lyons Government. Under the scheme of Government during the war has nothing that Act it was proposed that every adult to do with this bill. have a lot to do with the capacity of the in respect of the insurance of a wife. At Government to meet its obligations in the same time, no individual who was in the future. However, to borrow a term receipt of an income in excess of £7 a from the footballers, I realize that I am kicking against the wind. If this Governwill not, it will have to do something to rectify the follies for which it has been guilty under the guise of promoting social security. The Government ha been deluded, whether by itself or not .1 do not know. The worse form of delusion is self delusion, and I hope that the Government is not a victim of that kind of delusion. It must be enlightening to the public to listen to the present debate, because the speeches of members of the Opposition conclusively establish the truth of what we have been saying for years, which is, that it is the wish of the Opposition that the workers should pay for their own social service benefits. On the other hand, the Labour party believes that the burden of taxation should be borne by those best able to pay. The last two Opposition speakers are both wealthy farmerswho, in addition to their income from their farming operations are receiving a parliamentary allowance of £1,500 a year, but they do not want to pay anything towards defraying the cost of the excellent social services which the Labour party has introduced. \Q\iorum formed.] On a recent occasion, the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Padden). when dealing with social services, saidI n view of what has transpired in tlie international sphere we must regard ourselves nrery fortunate indeed that national insurance was not inflicted on the people.

[Quorum formed.'] Under that scheme a benefit of 3s. 6Q. was to be paid in respect of a dependent child of a married man whose income exceeded £7 a week. Any young man, or woman, under the age of 21 years, could qualify for a sickness or unemployment benefit of only 5s. a week. Yet. honourable members opposite who sponsored that scheme still advocate the contributory principle in respect of social have been placed on the reserve list. services. A contributory scheme means that each employee would contribute a certain sum each week and his employer would contribute a like amount, whilst the Government also would contribute a certain amount to the insurance fund. The scheme sponsored by the Lyons Government provided that any employer who contributed to the scheme could automatically pass on that cost. The burden of such a scheme would fall upon the worker and, ultimately, upon the Government. The social services established by this Government are proving a great boon to the people. To-day, a married man with a wife and two children, a family unit which is not covered by the Harvester award, is not obliged to make any contribution in respect of social services until his income as at least £7 a week.' Hundreds of thousands of people whom this Government is endeavouring to help come within that category. At present they make no contribution whatever towards social services. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) advocated a contributory scheme. The honourable member, who is a single man and has not contributed anything to this country, is typical of those who advocate a contributory scheme. remark just made by the honourable member is offensive to me, and I ask that he withdraw it. The fact that I am a single man enabled me to fight in two wars in defence of this country, whereas Mr Conelan. the honourable member did not have thr "" guts "" to serve in any war. ( Mr Lazzarini) -The honourable member for the Northern Territory has been offensive to the honourable member for Griffith, and so I think he has evened up matters. MrC GNELAN -The honourable member for the Northern Territory has just told an untruth. I volunteered for service in defence of the country and was passed as medicallyfit,but was placed on the reserve list. I suggest that the honourable member for the Northern Territory also, in view of his age, should Much has been said about the withdrawal of price stabilization subsidies, but the Government, to its everlasting credit, hatnot withdrawn subsidies in respect of tea. and sugar, the two commodities most essential to pensioners. So long as the Government remains in oifice it will continue to safeguard the interests of persons dependent upon social services. Unlike the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), I believe thai the Government will remain in office for many years to come. When the Government assumed office seven years ago, the honourable member predicted that it would be ejected within six months. In making that prediction he revealed himself to be a bad judge, and he is still a bad judge in such matters. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) dealt with the percentage variation of the pension in relation to the basic wage. When tlie invalid and old-age pension was established, it represented 22 per cent, of the then basic wage of £2 5s. 6d. Before the Labour Government assumed office that percentage had decreased to 19.5 per cent., and, subsequently, it rose to 20.7 per cent. The fact that the percentage relation of the pension to the basic wage was lowest during the regime of anti-Labour Governments reveals the weakness of the arguments advanced by honourable members opposite in this debate, because when the present Government rise to order. The assumed office in 1941 the basic wage was £4 Os. 6d. and the maximum pension was 21s. 7d. The increase of ls. wa? granted under pressure exerted by the Labour party in this Parliament.

289,Mr Holloway,"I have made thatearly yeans of the Commonwealth Parliament, must come to the conclusion that there was a bargain, or "" gentlemen's agreement"" between the Opposition led by Mr Fisher and the Government led by Mr Deakin on the introduction of the first social services legislation. It is true to say, as members of the Opposition have pointed out, that the Deakin Government was responsible for the implementation of the legislation. Before the Commonwealth Parliament assumed its responsibilities, the Parliament of New South Wales and Victoria had introduced old-age pensions in a minor way. higher than that prescribed in the present act. The historical record of social services is as follows:July, 1909 -Old-ag e pensions, introduced by the .Deakin Government. December, 1910 -Invalid pensions, introduced by the Fisher Government. Ootober, 1912 -Maternity allowances, introduced by the Fieher Government. July, 1941 -Child endowment, introduced by the Menzies Government. July, 1942 -Widows' pensions, introduced by the Curtin Government. July, .1943 -Allowance s for wives and children of invalid pensioners, introduced by tlie Curtin Government. July, 1943 -Fnnera l benefits for age and invalid pensioners, introduced by the Curtin Government. 1945 -Unemploymen t and sickness benefits, introduced by the Curtin Government. 1946 -Hospita l benefits, introduced by the Chifley Government. 1947 -Tuberculosi s benefits, introduced by the Chifley Government. 1948 -Pharmaceutica l benefits, introduced by the Chifley Government. That is the history of Commonwealth legislation in the field of social services. I put it on record so that honourable members opposite need not argue about it in the future. I do not think that any of them wish to cling to an argument that is not based on a firm foundation. The history of the relationship of the age and invalid pensions rate to the basic wage also should be placed on record. I have obtained the relevant figures, because I want to reply to the statements made by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), who opened this debate. The honourable member made a very fine contribution to the discussion and offered some useful suggestions, but, quite unintentionally I am sure, some of the things Mr TTolloiray. which she said were not founded on fact. She declared that a comparison of the basic wage established by Mr Justice Higgins in 1907 with the pension rate then, and a comparison of the present basic wage with the proposed new pension rate would show that pensioners in 1907 were at least no worse off than pensioners are to-day. In the first place, there was no age or invalid pension in 1907. Those pension were introduced in 1909 at the rate of 1.0s. a week. The age limit was considerably when the Harvester award came into operation. technical and tie the honourable member for Darwin down to the figure of £2 lis., her case would appear in a much worse light. The following table indicates the 'relationship of the rate of age and invalid pensions to the basic wage at variou;dates since 1909:Perccntaet of basic wapi year. Basic wnge. Pension rn.ee. represented by pension rate. f s. d. «. d. 1909 2 5 6 10 0 22 1916 3 4 0 12 6 19.fi 1920 3 12 6 lo 0 20.7 1925 4 5 6 20 0 23 1931 3 17 0 17 6 22 1937 1941 3 4 15 6 0 0 20 21 0 6 ic 25 1948 5 16 0 42 C 36.6 In 1931, during the depression, the basic wage had fallen and the pension had been reduced to the original comparative level of 1909. In 1948, under this legislation, the pension rate will be at the highest level in relation to the basic wage in the history of the Commonwealth. Those figures illustrate the position of unmarried pensioners. A married couple in receipt of pension will receive a combined income this year equivalent to 72 per cent, of the basic wage. Their conditions are much better now than they have ever been. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) and others have asked. "" Does the Government consider that",84,Paibb

293,Mr Holloway,"If I were to be£2 5s. a week is enough to keep a man or a woman iu decent comfort? answer to that is "" No "". I say that on behalf of the Government without any hesitation. That is why we must reconsider whether we should add to the in '-omes of those on the lowest rung of the social ladder. independent income and they need our help much more than do the people on whoso behalf members of the Opposition have made their sentimental appeals. I was also asked during the debate whether I. considered that 10s. a week was enough ro provide for the keep of a child under the age of .16 years. I answer "" No "" without hesitation. The Government does not declare that child endowment at the rate of 10s. a week is sufficient to maintain a child. Its policy is to make rhe income of the bread-winner, the father of the child, so high that he can keep his family in comfort. The endowment is a little addition to the family income to help the mother to save something, as many mothers like to do, for the higher education of her children. All rhese facts should be placed on record. The honourable member for Darwin made a good suggestion -which also was emphasized by the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn). Both honourable members asked, "" If we cannot provide free medical attention for everybody, cannot the Government establish <ome scheme which w ill provide free medical services for pensioners?"" The answer to that question should be well known to everybody. The Government has tried to establish a free medical scheme on a national basis. It has done its best, but so fa r has failed. It has provided for free hospital accommodation for the people. That scheme was first thought of because of the needs of pensioners who, more than anybody else, are likely to go io hospital when they f a l l sick because many of them have no homes and live only in rooms and have nobody to care for them. The fact that they cannot obtain free medical attention is not the fault of the Government. We overcame the constitutional barrier to the introduction of such a scheme by appealing to the people at a referendum, but we have vet to overcome the barrier raised by the Mritish Medical Association, which maintains an attitude of non-co-operation with The the Government. Perhaps we shall overcome that final barrier soon. A t any rate, we shall t r y to do so. These facts show that the suggestion made by the honourable member for Darwin is in Hue with the objective of t.he Government, Such people have no which will be achieved sooner or later. The honourable member complained that the Government, was doing much more for aged couples than it was doing for growing children and, in support of her argument, referred to the unusual case of a widow with eight children undei the age of sixteen years. She said that this woman was in a terrible plight and was having great difficulty in supporting her family. Naturally, everybody agrees with that statement. However, the honourable member's argument ought to be analysed. She said that the Government does more for aged couples than it does for this woman and her children. Let us consider the relative situations of a married couple drawing the age pension and of the widow and her children, assuming that they have no private r.ources of income. TJnder this bill, thc married couple will have a combined income of £4 5s. a week. The widoww ill draw a pension of £2 Ts. 6d. for herself and her first child, and w i ll also receive £3 10s. a week endowment fov the other seven children. She w ill therefore, have an income of £5 17s. 6d. a week, compared with an income of £4 5s. a week received by the married couple. Thus, there is little ground for the honourable member's suggestion that the Government is unfairly discriminating against a widow with a large number of children in favour of an aged couple. Both the honourable member fer Darwin and the honourable member for Bourke suggested that home* should be provided for aged people They asked whether special homes, cottages or centres could be provided for old people who are dependent upon age and invalid pensions, because many of them have no homes of their own. We are faced with two difficulties. The first is that, under the Constitution, the Australian Government is not allowed to build homes for people other than its employees and soldiers. The second is a physical difficulty, which it is almost impossible to ov.erconie at the pre<sent time. We have obtained plans Irom other countries, including New Zealand, which has in. the last decade made more progress than any other member nation of the British Commonwealth in the building and planning of new homes and villages. The Government intends to build homes for our old people and will do so as soon as possible. We have believed for a long time that one of the greatest benefits that can be bestowed upon age and invalid pensioners who have no homes of their ownand thousands of them have not-is to provide them with comfortable cottages, situated close to markets where they can shop cheaply. They should not he isolated from the rest of the community. Those who are not able properly to look after themselves should be accommodated in small groups of cottages and a trained matron should be employed to care for them. Although the Government plans to do these things, it must fiirst overcome the difficulties to which I have referred. The constitutional difficulty may be overcome by co-operation with the State governments, which will, [ believe, join forces with this Government, because the. objective is so laudable. in connection with economic, and. social Cf that problem is solved, the formidable obstacle of the lack of building materials will still need to be surmounted. The honourable member for Reid( Mr we must try to. see that it is done in all Lang) made one or two exaggerated statements that were not based upon facts. I am afraid that his dislike, almost hatred, of some members of the Government sometimes leads the honourable gentleman to indulge in reckless statements that do not do him justice. He referred to the unfair treatment of people who are in receipt of small superannuation benefits. He took as an example a head schoolmaster who is receiving weekly superannuation payments of £2 10s., having paid contributions to the superannuation scheme for many years* He did not say whether tlie schoolmaster was married or single. The majority of retired State and Commonwealth public servants such as schoolmasters, railwaymen and other who are in receipt of small superannuation payments are married. whom the honourable member referred is Mr nolloway. married, he and his wife are entitled to the payment of age and invalid pensions and, in addition, to receive £3 weekly from other sources. If , putting it at its worse, the schoolmaster is a single man, he may draw more than £1 a week of the age and invalid pension and still be entitled to receive a weekly superannuation payment of £2 10s. The position is not nearly so. bad as the honourable member for Reid made it out to be. He can see no good in this legislation at all. I do not know why he adopts that attitude. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) doubted whether the country could continue to carry the load that the payment of these pensions is imposing upon it. He further said that lie did uot favour the abolition of the means test because, in his opinion, the national finances could not bear the added burden. He went on to say thai Australia and other countries have learned that it is necessary to improve economic and social conditions if we wish to be freed from the fear of war. The right honourable gentleman pointed out that, whatever any government does security, it must be based upon international justice. In otber words, not. only must we do it in our own country, but. if we. are to escape from the fear of war, other countries. The policy of this Government is based upon social justice for all. On every occasion on which it has gone to the people, the first plank of its platform has been full employment for the whole of the year. Every time that we send a delegate abroad to attend an international, conference dealing with industrial or economic matters we instruct him to emphasize on every possible occasion that, whatever conclusions are arrived at, the principle of f u l l employment must be in tbe forefront. A policy of full employment involves social legislation. Social security will cost less as full employment becomes more of anaccomplished fact. Although there will always be the necessity to pay some sickness benefitsj full employment will, I am sure, result in less sickness. The cost of If the man to unemployment payments will fall. Indeed, they are costing practically nothing H i the present moment. It is only those who have heen unable to work except on odd days during the last ten or fifteen years who are now applying for unemployment benefit. That is the result of the Government's poliey of full employment, which provides economic security. To achieve social security, legisActing Leader of the Opposition should lation must be passed to deal, for instance, with people who are temporarily out of employment because they are changing from one job to another or because some accident has held up the work in whicb they are engaged. Legislation is necessary to deal with annual leave and holidays at Christmas-time ancl other periods. The granting of annual leave has bt'en made compulsory in all States of the Oommonwealth. The object is to dovetail all. these things together and to ensure that in some way or other every one in the community receives a regular income for 52 weeks of fhe year. If that objective can be achieved, it will be of the greatest benefit to the small shopkeepers of this country, who denend for their livelihood upon the money that is passed across their counters. They are beginning to appreciate the benefits of this Government's full employment policy, ivhich means regular incomes, and therefore regular spending power. claim that full employment is the result of the Government's policy and has not resulted from war conditions? question, but it is not put in a sensible way. What the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) asks is whether 'the success of the Government's policy has been due to the Government's good judgment and management, or to other factors. rhat full employment was the direct result >f this Government's policy. ihe Government's policy because it is stated clearly in all Labour's manifestos, lit is .full employment for the people: bat I admit quite frankly that because of the unnaturally high prices that are prevailing overseas for our primary products, it has been possible to implement our policy more quickly and more successfully. modities has bad something to do with it. that. This legislation is in accordance with the Government's policy, and the know very well that it is of no use to appeal to the Minister in charge of the bill to accept amendments. The Government's policy has been definitely determined. It is the policy upon which a majority of the people have decided. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) frequently appeals to the Minister in charge of a particular measure to accept an amendment of it. with my suggestion. .Clark) -Order! The Acting Leader of fche Opposition and the honourable member for Balaclava seem to be determined to interrupt the Minister's speech. Even at this late hour I shall not permit them to do so.

No matter how much a Minister may oppose a particular clause or provision in a bill, he cannot agree to alter it when the bill is before the House. He has had hi* chance to have the measure drafted to suit his wishes, but the majority has been against him. He has to abide by the will of the majority. If he does not do that, how can we have democratic government ?

I agreed to ask the Minister to re-examine the matter, and I did that. decided, however, that it could not alter its policy at that time. kept my word, and I do not know how any honourable member can say, year after year, that I did not. If I promise before this legislation goes through the committee stage to ask the Minister to reexamine any particular clause, I shall do so, but that is no guarantee that the Government will agree to amend the bill. The right honourable member for North Sydney suggested that our legislation should be based on the international concept of social justice for all people. That is the policy of the Government. It begins with full employment, and is completed by the passing of social legislation where it is necessary for social security. guaranteeing an opportunity to earn a living to everybody who is willing and able to work. Social security means security for those who fall by the wayside a'nd are denied employment because of illthe present system whether proposed in ness, injury or infirmity. Both social security and economic security are necessary to a successful society which will guarantee to every one an income suflicient to purchase the goods and services that are necessary for himself and his family. Having answered one or two outstanding criticisms and made clear how Labour's social services programme originated, and how each measure fits in with the basic wage and pensions-with out saying that pensions are adequateI shall reserve any further remarks until the committee stage. However, there is one matter that I should like to make clear. On several occasions it has been suggested that we should follow the lead set by New Zealand. If there is anything good in that dominion, we should be silly if we did not copy it ; but in the course of exchanges in this chamber, several honourable members have said that there is no means test in New Zealand. That is not so. In that dominion, a long-range plan is being followed. People over 65 years of age may receive a universal superannuation payment of £30 a year. That amount is being increased each yearby £2 10s. Person over 60 years of age may be granted an age benefit at the rate of £2 5s. a week, subject to a means test in respect of both The Government income and property. No person can receive both the universal superannuaI tion and an age benefit. Therefore, in New Zealand both systems operate. 1 do not believe that we should change our system. The method that we follow today is the cheapest and most efficient way of achieving our end. Taxes artimposed on a sliding scale and we meet our social service payments out of general revenue. This saves the enormous cost of collecting and tabulating statistics showing the amounts contributed by each person. That would mean employing double staff. The cost of administration of tintwo methods in Australia is as follows, age, invalid, and widows' pensions. 0.8 per cent, or 16s. per £100 paid out. while the total cost, inclusive of sickness, unemployment and maternity benefit payEconomic security means ments amounts to 1.2 per cent, or £1 4s. per £100. In the TJnited Kingdom, fluadministration cost of social benefits 4.3 per cent, or £4 6s. per £100 paid out. I would oppose any alteration of Cabinet, in Parliament or at any public meeting outside the Parliament. 1 believe that we should adhere rigidly to the system we have adopted. Unless1 am defeated in logical debate, I shall never support the abolition of the mean? test in its entirety. I believe that we have reached a stage now where we cannot improve the means test and at the same time do justice to the people on the lowest rung of the social ladder who have no income at all. Every member of this House undoubtedly wants to do his most for people in the greatest need There are 430,000 people to whom these additional payments must be made. An",88,Paibb

306,Mr Holloway,"When a similarhonorable member spoke about a ""flat rate "" increase of 5s., and asked how long it would take to work out such an increase. Criticism, of that kind is based on ignorance of the problem involved. There are no fewer than 430,000 adjustments to be made and the increase ranges from a flat rate of 5s. to 17s. In deed, a married couple may receive a joint increase of 34s. as the result of this believe that it should be cleared up. It is legislation. Scores of people will receive an increase of 17s. Many intricate adjustments have to be made. I had no intention to convey the impression which honourable members seemed to have gained from my statement that there was a physical difficulty involved in paying at the increased rates on a specified date. payments at the increased rate will be -(fleeted when this bill becomes law, but -hat it would not be possible to work out the increased rates in a few days.

Leader of the Opposition) [10.45] I was interested to hear the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr will bear out tbe accuracy of my Holloway), in replying to the second reading debate, skip lightly over some observations made by me last night relanve to the need for making the increases retrospective to the 1st July. Unfortunately for the Minister, he made certain interjections during my second reading' speech, and in doing so made it perfectly clear that there was no financial difficulty associated with the making of retrospective payments, but that there was some staff difficulty. I wish to deal with that aspect of the matter, because 1 most important that we should have a clear-cut statement of government policy. In dealing with the necessity for making retrospective payments, I pointed out that the Government had already agreed in the budget to make retrospective thc application of certain income tax reductions and that I could, see no reason why, WhatI said was that as the Government had in the National Welfare Fund approximately £28,000,000 more than it had last year, the invalid, age and other pensioners, who were to benefit from this proposed consolidation of the social services legislation, should not at least be given the same consideration as had been extended to companies and individuals in respect of income tax concessions announced in the budget. I based my argument on the fact that it was generally conceded that invalid and age pensioners were not getting sufficient to keep body and soul together. In his reply to the second-reading debate the Minister said that every member of this chamber agreed that the pension Avas insufficient to provide sustenance and a reasonable amount of comfort for ite recipients. I expected the Minister to add that the Government, having granted retrospective concessions to one section of the community, those whom it regards as comprising the most deserving section of the community would at least be extended the same consideration. The Minister having said that it is a physical impossibility to make the increases retrospective to the 1st July, I said that I could see no reason why there should be a existence of an amount of £28,000,000 standing to the credit of the National Welfare Fund in excess of that available last year. By interjection-and Hansard recollection-the honourable gentleman repliedI did not say it was afinancialimpossibility.",89,Paibb

309,Mr Hakrison (Wentworth,"ActingThat interjection gave us the impression that the finance necessary to make retrospective payments was available and accordingly that any delay that might occur in effecting payment had nothing whatever to clo with the nnanciai situation. When I took the Minister to task and pointed out that when he said it was a physical impossibilty, I assumed that he meant it was a nnanciai impossibility, he saidThe staff of the department could not possibly do it. Later, when I drew his attention to the great increase of the Commonwealth Public Service-and I shall return to that point later-the honourable gentleman said-I am speaking of the time in which the Acting Leader of the Opposition says the payment should be made. These were the interjections made by the Minister, who is gradually getting himself deeper and deeper into the mire. about it. I think this is all a waste of time. have an opportunity to answer my comments. In effect, he asks, ""What does it matter if the age and invalid pensioners have to wait four months for payment of tlieir pensions at the increased rate ?"" Honourable members will have an opportunity to show by their vote in division where they stand in relation to this matter. The Minister made it clear that there is no financial difficulty associated with this proposal and that the only difficulty in effecting retrospective payments is a staffing difficulty. I shall have something to say in regard to that. In the course of my answer to the last interjection made by the Minister, I saidf. an; not concerned with the time. The 60vurnment has the money. The figures that I liave given prove that. Expenditure on social services this yeaT will he£29,000,000 more than lost year. The Minister again saidIt is not a question of money. 1. propose to discuss that aspect of the problem for a few moments. The Commonwealth Public Service has expanded to an extraordinary degree. In 1938, Commonwealth departments"" employed 44,000 public servants. In Junej 1948. the total reached 169,200 in 25 departments, or nearly four times the number employed in pre-war years. It was upon these figures that I based my statemeni to which the Minister replied that staffing difficulties would prevent payment at the increased rates being made retrospective to the 1st July. Later, in hia answer to the second-reading speeches the Minister said that there were many complexities associated with making these payments which range from 6d. upwards. I say to the Minister that he can defer the payments and make them retrospective to the 1st July last. It is not necessary to make the payments immediately should he consider that hi? department is not sufficiently staffed to handle the necessary work. The amount? involved could be established as credifefor the age pensioners and might possibly become due for payment at the Christmas period when they would be like a Christmas box from the Governinent to each pensioner. That is a reasonable approach to the matter. Following the Minister's claim regarding the staff position I took it upon myself to examine it. I found that the number of person? employed in the age and invalid pension? and maternity allowance branch of the department was 311 in the year 1939-40. 591 in 1947-48, and in 1948-49 is to be increased to 636, which is more than double the 1939-40 figure. If by doubling the staff the Minister cannot at least ensure that he has the necessary administrative machinery, then I give him the logical answer which is, as I have already stated, to defer payments and create credits for the pensioners. By doing so the Minister will give age pensioners exactly the same consideration as is given to_ those who contribute to the country's revenue by paying income tax. The Minister has made it clear that finance is not the problem. As I have pointed out before, the Government has about £39,000,000 more in the ""kitty' "" than it had last year. There is no doubt whatever that in the minds of many honourable members of this conimittee and of people outside who take an interest in this matter, the difficulties mentioned by the Minister are purely a figment of",90,Paibb

Minister and Treasurer) [10.56] I think I should make it clear to the committee at the outset that the Government does not propose to accept any amendments to this bill. In saying that I refer not only to the matter under discussion but also to other payments provided in the bill. General principles have been laid down by the Government regarding the various types of benefits proposed in the legislation, which covers an annual ""xpenditure of about £20,000,000 for additional benefits. The Government does uot propose to depart from those principles. Whatever may be said, we believe we have made a fair judgment and a very liberal advance in the way of social -service payments. I heartily support the amenament but it appears, from what the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has just stated, that he is quite definite that no amendment will he accepted. That is the kind of barrier the Opposition has been faced with in this Parliament during the short time. I have been a member of it, and in fact, during the seven years the Government has been in office. Judging by what the Prime Minister has said it would not make any difference to the Goverament if an amendment were brought forward' that would be for the benefit not ouly of the pensioners concerned in the bill but of the whole of the neople. Even if the wisest person in the world were to put forward an amendment, the Prime Minister would stil] say that he would not accept it. That in its endeavours to improve this legislaseveral reasons, the first of which is that if the increase.? t.o he made under the bill are necessary because of the rising cost of living, then they are necessary from the first day of the current nnanciai year. If the Government believes it to be just to make the increases during the second half of the financial year, what argument can it possibly advance to justify its refusal to pay them for the months of the current financial year which have already passed ? Pensioners throughout the country will tell the Prime Minister or any one else who troubles to inquire that thcy regard the Government's action as a flagrant injustice. Indeed, one does not need to inquire of them because one hears it discussed wherever people congregate. T cannot understand why aged and invalid people, many of whom have done much for this country, should be penalized so unjustly. The date of payment of the increased rates will depend on the actual date of passage of the hill. The amendment proposes to correct that anomaly by providing that on the passage of the measure and signification of the royal assent thereto the increased rates shall be made retrospective to the 1st July last. If the Parliament had met early in July and the Government had then introduced the bill, the probabilities are that pensioners would have received payment of the additional amount two months earlier. However, the Parliament did not meet until the beginning of September and pensioners are, in consequence, debarred from receiving any increase in respect of the months of July and August. The explanation of the Government's attitude cannot be that the Treasury is financially embarrassed and that the Government is anxious to delay payment in the interest of the national finances. I again stress the fact, that Treasury statistics just ^released reveal that the national revenue for the first three months of the current, financial year is more than £22,000,000 higher than estimated. Instead of an anticipated debit of more than.",91,Paibb

The three points which I have made are 'dearly unanswerable. The Prime Minister stated a short time ago that he would not agree to any amendments which may be moved to the measure. He was obviously trying to raise a barrier to discourage members of the Opposition from speaking to the bill, and I object strongly to such an attitude. Even such an important person as the Prime Minister should realize that he does not know everything rhat passes tlirough the minds of members of the Opposition, and he cannot anticipate the nature of amendments that may be moved. not attempt to pre-judge matters by adopting such an attitude, and I consider chat he was acting in a dictatorial fashion. member that the decision which I announced was made by the GovernmentT am merely a cog in the machine. ister says that the decision is that of the Government, and now he is running for cover. orable member! tiven the right honourable gentleman realizes that my arguments have some merit.

The honourable member cannot have it both ways. Even at this late stage I appeal to the Prime Minister to give sympathetic consideration to my request. I think that even supporters of the Government realize that the suggestion that payment of the increases to pensioners be made retrospective has much to support it. 1 consider that the amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) should be agreed to, and 1 give it my whole-hearted support. course of the speech which I made on the second reading of the bill, I drew the attention of honourable members to the proposed differentiation between He should the treatment of the wealthy and the poor. I pointed out that the Government proposes to give to wealthy tax-payers full advantage of the reduction of taxes by making that reduction retrospective to the 1st July last, whereas pensioners will not receive the benefit of any increase of their pension until after the measure is passed. Withholding of the lowest increase of pension, which is a flat rate of 5s:, will deprive each pensioner of at least £4 during the financial year, and I asked what sort of a miser government it was that would deprive the poorest section of the community, about whom we hear so many sob stories from members of the Government, of their right while it had millions of pounds at its disposal. I raised that matter in all sincerity, and I raise it again now because I believe in. what ] am saying, and I shall vote accordingly on the proposed amendment. In the light of the speech v/hich I made on the The Minister has second reading of the bill, I consider that the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) showed by his speech in reply that he has no sense of social justice. Whilsti t is true, as he said, that some of the pensioners will receive an increase, not of 5s., but of think he.went so far as to say that the increase would amount to 34s. in some instancesmarried couples.",92,Paibb

It is evident that some of the unfortunate pensioners are to be deprived of 17s. a week for a period of fourteen weeks or more. Does that decision square with the statements made by the Minister and other members of the Government concerning the means test? Members of the Government have asserted that they cannot remove the means test because they must ensure that those who have the greatest need receive social service benefits, and Ministers are constantly speaking of those who receive the lowest incomes, the poorest people in the community. Because those pensioners are the poorest, the Government is going to rob them of a paltry £4, and its excuse is that payment of the increase from the beginning of the current financial year would involve some arithmetical difficulty. I point out to the committee that pensioners are paid fortnightly and the amounts which they receive are constant. Once calculations are made of the new amounts to which pensioners are entitled no further calculations will be required, and in the case of nearly all classes of pensions the calculations which will be made a fortnight hence could easily have been made before the first pension payment, day in July last. Therefore, the real reason why the Government has not paid pensioners their increases at the proper time is that it is deliberately withholding their money. I know from my association with many entitled. deserving people whom I meet that the matter of the increase of pensions was mentioned long before the 30th June Last, and that people who were drawing amendment. This is an indication of how pensions were expeGting that any increase the Government works; the Prime Minisof their pensions would be payable from ter ( Mr Chifley) made a dictatorial the 1st July of this year.

They will not be choked listening to the words of those who sympathize with them, because it will be on record who constituted the majority. The Prime Minister and the Minister in charge of the measure have stated what they think. The Ministei' says that what he likes is not always what he gets, but that it is the majority mind. The Government will not be able to shelter behind that excuse, because in division, this chamber -will show where tbe majority lies. It will very likely be found that that majority is a fairly uniform vote that some pensioners are to be deprived of at least £4, and other? fourteen or fifteen times 17s. That is not a small amount of money. It is not a small thing for those who need the money most, ,and who will suffer mostYet they are the people who will be deprived of it.

The chances are that, in a family of that size, the husband would not have been able to provide the price of a home seeing that he had to leave his widow dependent upon a pension. The Minister, [ understand, argues that there is not such a great difference between the position of the two aged people living on £4 5s. a week, and that of the widow and eight children living on £5 17s. 6d. a week. I can only express my great astonishment at such a suggestion. I can understand that the difference would not be so great, considered on the basis of pension payments alone, as if permissible incomes were taken into account, but even on the basis of pensions only the suggestion of the Minister is absurd. When persons attain the pensionable age, their needs become less. I speak with some experience. At the present time, my family relations are such that I nave to deal with four generations and their needs. I know that those at the lower end make certain demands upon the family's general financial position which those at the other end do not. Por instance, the latter do not require so much clothing and food, whilst the diversity of food they require is not so important. I again point out that the amount of rent payable by two old people is much less than that payable in respect of a house to meet the needs of nine people. Therefore, a very good case indeed can be made out for the claims of a widow with a family; and I suggest that the endowment payments he increased in respect of children who are dependent upon a widow. Again, I insist that in the light of every statement made on behalf of the Government by either the Minister or his colleagues, there is every ground for increasing the allowance of 5s. in respect of the first child either of men who suffer disability as the result a. widow or invalid pensioner need has been completely ignored under this measure. I spoke on the Estimates deliberately to draw the attention of the Minister to this position, and asked that my suggestion that the allowance of 5s. he increased be considered before this measure was introduced. Nothing has been done. I am perfectly convinced Dame Enid Lyons. that the urgency of my representations is not yet apparent to the Government. Is it fair to suggest that an allowance of 5s. even begins to cover the cost of rearing a child of any age at all? And the child of an invalid pensioner also is in exactly the same position as are the children of a widow pensioner. AgainI urge upon the Government the necessity to review this matter in the light of the real need that exists in relation to these children. As I have already said, if -we care for the aged as we must and should, we must also care for the young upon whom the whole future of thi? country rests. Clause agreed to. Clauses 15 to 19 agreed to.

At present the definition of ""income"" does not exclude "" w,ar pension "". This matter was discussed more than twelve months ago. At that time the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) promised that the amendment I now propose would be effected at the first possible opportunity. This is the first opportunity we have had since that time to discuss the matter, and I regret to note that no reference whatever is made in the bill to any proposal of the kind embodied in my amendment. Everybody is aware that a war pension is granted hy the country to This of service in defence of the country. That pension is paid with a view to making the recipient an even target on the labour market and it is also regarded as a measure cf compensation for loss suffered by the recipient during service in defence of his country.

In those cir-. f.umstances it is a disgrace to any government to apply a means test to such peiBons should they be obliged to apply for unemployment or sickness benefit particularly as a result of their war disability. with thc matter at length, because t believe that all honourable members T make. and just. I cannot see i'or the life of the why the Government w ill not accept the amendment. Some honourable members opposite have said that so few men would come into the category I have indicated that my proposal is not worth' bothering about. If that be so, why is the Government fighting shy of it? The cost involved would not be very great. When the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) stated that the Government would not accept any amendment to this measure, I believe that he was not aware of this anomaly. The matter raised by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Hamilton) was first brought up long before twelve months ago. When the principal act was under consideration in 1944, 1 moved an amendment along the lines of that now proposed by the honourable member. A t that time the Minister for _<abour and National Service( Mr Holloway), who was in charge of the bill, saidI ask honourable members to remember that this bill was introduced in the Senate, and that, as it is not my bill, I cannot accept the amendment, not because I do not think that there is justice iu it, but because it is not a matter for me to determine. I promise tliat I shall sympathetically submit it to the Treasurer and Cabinet so that it shall be discussed at the next Cabinet meeting, which will take place soon. T shall see that an answer is «iven. The then honourable member for Parramatta, Sir Frederick Stewart, interjectedThe Minister will not ask us to pass the bili until the answer has been given? The Minister repliedI do not say that, but I do say that it will noi and sickness funds. he put into force until this provision has been ex-servicemen know that no inserted or reasons against it have been given. Sir Frederick Stewart then interjectedParliament will adjourn to-morrow for at least four months. The House rested on the Minister's assurance. I again raised the matter in 1947 when I had the support of a number of honourable members opposite, including the honourable member for Parkes( Mr. I do not propose to deal Haylen) and you, yourself, Mr Deputy Chairman. It has been made abundantly clear that the Government is acting fully understand the point cruelly in ignoring the claim now made My request is reasonable on behalf of war pensioners. The deduction which is made from their war pension under the means test, should they be given unemployment and sickness benefit under this measure, is really a deduction from a dole. But when the honourable gentleman gave a solemn assurance in his characteristic, selfsatisfied, soft-soaping way, we accepted his word on that occasion. Last year, the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Harrison), the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) and others made strong comments on the subject. The honourable member for Swan saidThe duty of any government, regardless of its political colour, which subjects war pensions to the means test, is unworthy of being described as Australian. The Acting Leader of the Opposition made a similarly strong comment. He resented the manner in which the proposal had been shelved, and invited the Government to salvage its honour. The spirited discussion which took place on the amendment dragged on, as this debate is dragging on, until finally the committee divided at 2 a.m. I was sorry that a division was called, because I knew thai it would discomfit some members of the Labour party. I do not make that statement for the purpose of twisting their feelings on this occasion. I know that, their hearts were in .their words when they spoke in favour of the amendment. However, the discipline of the party was",97,Pairs
333,Mr White (Balaclava) [11.38],"too strong. Earlier this evening, the I'rime Minister( Mr Chifley) entered the -hamber and announced that the Government would not accept any amendments. I know of the fate that would befall a member of the Labour party who dared ro place his feelings and conscience before the iron discipline of caucus. Doth the Minister for Labour and National Service, and the Minister for Social 'Services (Senator McKenna) nave expressed their sympathy towards ""lie objective which the amendment seeks ro achieve. I understand that the Minister for Labour and National Service wrote most ingratiating letters to assure people tliat within a short period the -natter would be adjusted. Although1 raised the matter four years ago, the position has not been altered. I shall explain the situation clearly to the chamber -so that there can be no equivocation. When speaking on this subject last year, rhe Minister said, in effect, "" I am not -helving the proposal; it is not my --""ault"". He used practically the same words this evening. A soldier who has lost an eye or is otherwise disfigured is -inder a great disability when seeking emrectified. The Minister, by scribbling an ;jloyment. He may receive a pension of a few shillings a week. An ex-crviceman who bas lost a few fingers or a hand is also in that category. The pension which is payable is only -ompensation, and is less generous than my other form of social services. I propose to deal extensively with that aspect when repatriation benefits are 'inder consideration. Undoubtedly, the time will come when -omo of those unfortunate ex-servicemen will be unemployed. Australia's general prosperity is dependent on the cont inn a nee of high prices overseas for our exportable primary produce. Should a -flight recession occur, men will become unemployed. Many ex-servicemen have received treatment in hospitals and are now battling for employment. a.re undergoing rehabilitation courses, and are receiving mere pittances. Should nn economic slump occur, they will be on rhe labour market. Par from receiving preference in employment, they will be at a disadventage. A member of an industrial organization may receive unemployment benefits from his union or a .Ifr. White. friendly society when he loses his job. and this is not deductible from unemployment relief whereas that of a partly disabled ex-serviceman is deductible. What is the reason? [ ba^e been considering that question during the last four years. I speak with considerable feeling at this stage because previously, I accepted the Minister's assurance that an amendment to give effect to my proposal would be incorporated in the act. Now, the honourable gentleman is trying to fob us off with additional assurances, and he had hif leader enter the chamber to announce that the Government would not accept any amendments. If this amendment be rejected, the speeches of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour and National Service on ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day will be a mockery. They will give a new significance to "" Lest We Forget"". I speak with intense feeling on this subject because I say that we have been fobbed off with humbug and hypocrisy. Year after year, when we have raised this matter, we have received assurances that the position would be amendment, can meet our wishes now. man said last year that the position would l^e rectified and be gave an assurance that lie would discuss it with other Ministers.

If he refuses to accept the amendment, he must bear his share of the odium which will overtake the Labour party. Honourable members opposite are not unanimous in opposing the amendment.

On a previous occasion, -leveral honourable members opposite spoke just as vehemently in favour of the proposal as any member of the Opposition did. I am inclined to challenge the Government to submit the issue to caucus, ff it were to do so, I believe that the amendment would be carried. The Government cannot legitimately and with justice continue to, regard a disability pension as income. A government which pretends to be humane should not be less generous to ex-servicemen than it is to citizens in other walks of life. position. reading debate, members of the Labour party constantly boasted about the lavish expenditure on social services. They pointed -with pride to the increased expenditure from £17,000,000 to £88,000,000 in a decade. Nearly everybody is receiving social services in some form except those whose sacrifices in war-time made the collection and spending of that amount of £88,000,000 possible. Under the social services legislation, ex-servicemen have received a worse deal than any other section of the community. L' shall not say that they are in that plight because they are ex-servicemen, but because they have done their job and are no longer wanted. It is so easy to forget what the country owes to them. When the fighting was at its hottest there tears were shed. Now, All that is forgotten. It is so easy to forget immediately the fighting has ended. The Government has had four years iu which to consider this matter. I understood, when the proposal was originally made, that it might not have been practicable for the Minister fco accept the amendment immediately. However, he has had four years in which to consider it. Duriug this nnanciai year, othei social services will be considerably increased but ex-servicemen will continue ? to suffer injustice. That is disgraceful, and cannot be justified. If caucus were given an opportunity to consider this proposal, a majority of honourable members opposite would approve of it and tbe necessary amendment would be inserted in the bill I should like to know the names of the Ministers who are opposed, to it, and to examine their background. How dare they oppose a proposal which is so manifestly just? The purpose is to grant to ex-servicemen who fought for tlieir country a benefit at least equal to that enjoyed by those who did not fight for their conntry. Some of them would not have fought for their country under any conditions. Other men went away in the service of their country and lost limbs, and, foi their sacrifices, the Government consider they are entitled to compensation of a few shillings a week, according to the degree of their disability. Yet the Governmem has the effrontery to class such a pension as part of a man's income. Government supporters have been talking about removing the means test. Here is a mean.' test on unfortunate men who have lost limbs and some of the strength and vigour that might have enabled them to earn a comfortable living. Why not at least impose the same means test to other people? Apparently the ex-serviceman-does not count. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) said that he had heard that the Government would not accept the amendmem whicb we are considering because the men affected are only few in number. It seems that, because of their small numbers, they have little voting ""value and therefore are not important in the oye-",99,Pairs

Even though rhe Government refuses to accept the amendment, I should not like the discussion to end without the Minister for Labour and National Service at least explaining its attitude.

That does not mean that members of the Parliamentary Labour party do not examine, and discuss problems for hours, hut like loyal memhers of any other united party, rhey stand by their decisions once they have been made. tion is not exactly as the honourable inem.ber for Gippsland has described. He has accused the Government of discriminating between ordinary civilians and ex-servicemen. That is not correct. the unemployment and sickness benefits provisions of the Social Services Consolidation Act, and to nothing else. Under those provisions, the income of an ex-servicemen is exempt to the same amount as that of anybody else. Therefore, it is not true to say that the ex-serviceman is the subject of discrimination. The real point at issue, as I believe the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) will agree, is whether war pensions paid to disabled ex-servicemen ar«to be calculated as income for the purpose of assessing benefits under the Social Services Consolidation Act.

The real issue is whether pensions paid to compensate ex-servicemen for the loss of their ability to compete with their fellows should be regarded as income in the ordinary sense of the word for the purposes of assessing a social services benefit.

The reply of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) has disgusted me. He was quibbling when he said that the legislation dealing with unemployment benefits was not under consideration. I remind him that, when the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Bill was before the Parliament in 1944, we discussed the proposal embodied in the present amendment at six minutes past three o'clock in the morning.

On that occasion, the Minister for Labour and National Service undertook, in effect, to make a strong recommendation to Cabinet in favour of our amendment.

That principle of equality is one which honourable members on this side of the chamber will not accept.

Surely -some measure of justice should be extended to the men who fought for their country and lost what no one of the members of this chamber has losta limb or an eye. In return for their disablement we give them what is called a pension, but which in reality is compensation for their injuries and their loss of something r,he possession of which would make life comfortable and happy for them.

Why should a disabled ex-serviceman be placed at a disadvantage if he becomes eligible for the payment of unemployment and sickness benefits? I heartily support the amendment. WhatI have said has been amply demonstrated by the Minister earlier during the committee debate. When the honourable gentleman says that the Government cannot accept the amendment, he is speaking truthfully. It cannot be accepted because the decision has been made by the majority of tbe Labour caucus. Minister wants to accept an amendment or not he is in the position that he cannot the honourable member for Wannon( Mr accept it, and that is what the Opposition faces when it fights for better conditions for ex-servicemen. The honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) said that he was amazed that the Minister at the table would not accept the amendment. i am not amazed, because I expected that to happen, as the Prime Minister had already signified that the Government would accept no amendments to the bill. The Government's attitude cannot be regarded as being other than unsympathetic to ex-servicemen, in the same way as it is ago as 1944 were used against the Minisunsympathetic to anything put forward on behalf of former prisoners of war, as T pointed out some days ago. Any one would think that the Opposition had a monopoly of sympathy for ex-servicemen. I am just about sick of hearing such hypocrisy and I shall remind honourable members opposite of some general facts about ex-servicemen and the Government's attitude towards them.

When I first entered this Parliament as a member and even before that when I was on the hustings seeking election, I was charged, as was the Labour party, with offering bribes to ex-servicemen,..because the party had stated that its policy was to increase the miserable amount paid to them, which at that time was even lower than thai paid immediately after World War] .

I ask the honourable member for Wannon to say what it was I voted against, as I did not distinguish his words -I was astounded to hear him say that The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable gentleman has not raised a point of orcier. able member for Balaclava voted against the removal of the "" onus of proof "" provision. I have always taken any opportunity to help ex-servicemen, 80 per cent, of whom are workers whom the Government claims to represent. I warn returned soldiers that this legislation will a sum of money, on exactly the footing soon be removed from the statute-book if the Labour Government is defeated. At present an ex-serviceman is permitted to receive a payment from a friendly society of £ 1 a week and a pension of £1 a week. Honourable members opposite have tried to make some capital out of ex-servicemen, but let them examine their own murky past in respect of their attitude to ex-servicemen. I have not words strong enough to tell honourable members opposite my opinion of their record. While honourable menibers opposite were in office before the last war, they were more concerned about getting the last ounce of interest out of ex-servicemen. On many occasions. I have met men on the roads asking for jobs and I have had to tell thern that I had no job to give them because of the necessity to pay interest. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [12.37 a.m.] -As a rule I do not speak on matters concerning soldiers as there are so many honourable members who have a more intimate knowledge of such matters. The matter now being debated, however, is one about which I have felt very strongly ever since the experiences of a man in the district in which I live came to my notice. He was an ex-serviceman who became ill and was admitted to hospital. He applied for and received the sickness benefit, but while he was in hospital a decision was given on an appea! concerning his pension. As a result of that decision his pension was increased. When he was discharged from hospital he received a bill from the Department of Social Services for a few shillings that he had been overpaid. I hardly believed that such a thing could be possible until I heard the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) speak to-night, and there was no question of injustice to ex-servicemen as against any one else. The whole question revolves around the exact meaning of ""war pension"". A war pension is a compensation, or an attempt at compensation, for a disability incurred by the recipient on behalf of the people of Australia. It can never be complete compensation for a disability. Could any man ever be repaid for the loss of an arm or be replaced, by a payment of he would have occupied had he not lost his arm? He did not suffer his disability merely through an accident in industry, but because he went out into tbe field of battle either as a volunteer or at the behest of the Government. To pretend for a moment that that cau be placed on the same basis as any other kind of pension or compensation payment is sheet nonsense; indeed, it is utter hypocrisy. Any one who deludes himself into believing tliat that is so is false to all the decent instincts of most people. I wa surprised to hear the honourable meinber did. Honourable members on this side of the chamber have felt particularly sympathetic towards supporters of the Government who believe in doing justice to ex-servicemen and have spoken in favour of proposals similar to the present one. On prior occasions no vote was taken, and in this debate, which involves so much real sentiment and feeling, I should not have referred to any individual supporter of the Government, because I do not regard that as a decent way of conducting a debate. However, after listening to the honourable member for Wannon, I consider that the matter must be discussed. Until the honourable member spoke memhers on this side of the chamber were under the impression that the Government's attitude",107,Deputy Chairman Employed He Is Entitled As Is Any Other

383,For Wannon ( Mr Mcleod) Say What He,"was simply tlie result of a cabinet decision, but the honourable gentleman implies that the decision was made by caucus. L appeal to those members of the Australian Labour party, who supported uur proposal in caucus, in fairness to themselves, to stand up now and explain their position They should do that, not only to make their position perfectly -dear to the House, but also to enable the ex-servicemen of the country to know where they stand. I assume that they recognize the justice of the claim of service pensioners, and they should support the proposed amendment. I should not have spoken again but for Lhe wild and rambling utterance of the iionorable member for Wannon( Mr portance to those who will be affected by McLeod). The only question to be decided by the committee now is whether the anomaly disclosed in this clause should .be rectified. Honourable members -m this side of the chamber have brought the anomaly to the notice of the committee on previous occasions, and the Government gave some kind of undertaking that it would be removed. To-night the honourable meinber for Wannon alleged that when the matter was before the Parliament in 1943, I opposed the principle of casting the onus of proof upon rhe Eepatriation Commission. I point .'int to him that at that time. I was serving overseas with the Royal Australian Air Force. I support now, as I have always done, the principle that the burden of proof should lie upon the Eepatriation Commission. My views on the subject are well known, and I mention them nowonly to correct the mistatements of the honourable member, which will be reported in Hansard. He was hard-pressed to make out any sort of case, and. he resorted to making assertions which he Cannot substantiate. The dumb show made by the Minister for Eepatriation ( Mr of 24s. 6d., which is higher than a 40 per Barnard) falls in the same category as rhe remarks of the honourable member for Wannon. Is the Government now prepared to correct an anomaly which it admitted in 1943 needed rectification. The proposal contained in this clause will have a very direct bearing on the happiness of many people. I said before that I did not want to embarrass supporters of the Government who have previously expressed themselves with considerable feeling in regard to this matter. No honourable member on this side of the chamber is seeking to gain political credit by supporting the proposed amendment; all thai, we desire is to rectify an injustice. Tbe Government can promise now to rectify the matter, and consideration of the clause can be postponed. My impression is that caucus did not properly consider this matter, and that Cabinet unexpectedly rejected the proposal which had previously been supported by some honourable members opposite and is again supported by members of the Opposition. The matter is not one of major importance tc the whole community, but it is of imit, and I appeal to supporters of the Government to reconsider the matter in caucus and submit their recommendation to the Cabinet for reconsideration by thai body. I rise to correct what I believe to be a misconception by the Minister for Eepatriation ( Mr Barnard), who stated that when the present clause was drafted every consideration was given to ex-servicemen. Eeceipt of a war pension by an gx-serviceman simply places him on a level with -a civilian when he is seeking a job in the labour market, so that no special consideration will be extended to ex-servicemen if the proposed amendment be adopted. The reason why I spoke on the matter last year, and why I have raised it on this occasion, is that the Government has not honoured the promise which it gave twelve months ago. The ex-serviceman on whose behalf I spoke on that occasion was discharged from the armed forces suffering from arthritis of the feet. He was paid a weekly pension cent, pension. He was forced into unemployment because he could not continue working but had to rest. He did not enter the Eepatriation General Hospital at Hollywood because there was no occasion for him to enter hospital at all. His condition was such that he could not work, and he was paid unemployment allowance during the period he was unable to work. Later he attempted to",108,Deputy Chairman Employed He Is Entitled As Is Any Other

The terrible feature of his case is that after he resumed work he received a notification from the Department of Social Services rhat since he received a pension of 24s. 6d. a week and had drawn the maximum unemployment pension during the time he was unemployed he had been overpaid. The notification also informed him that the department had instructed the Repatriation Commission in Perth to deduct instalments from his war pension until the overpayment was repaid. The Repatriation Commission had to carry out a job which it did not relish, simply because the ex-serviceman had been paid more than he was entitled to receive under the act. I prefer that the matter should not be discussed on a party political basis. Indeed, I did not mention it to-night when Government supporters opposed the amendment which I have moved. I had an opportunity to mention this matter during the budget debate, but I did not desire to embarrass individual supporters of the Government. However, the clause now under consideration may have far-reaching effects, and it is my duty to put the case of ex-servicemen who are receiving a pension of more than 40 per cent. Those who receive less are not affected, and that is why I now do so. Repatriation) [12.49 a.m.] I should not have risen a second time but for the case mentioned by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Hamilton) name of the ex-serviceman concerned. have his name, but not at the present Order!

If the honorrhe ex-serviceman was suffering at the able member for Swan has stated tbe time of his discharge from the services obviously entitled him to admission to the Repatriation General Hospital at Hollywood. If he had entered that hospital he -was badly advised. The honourable member is trying to connect that case with his argument that the proposed amendment should be accepted. I poini out to him, however, that his contention is ill-founded, because the ex-serviceman was entitled to admission to the Repatriation Hospital at Hollywood, and had he gone there he would have received a pension, not of 24s. 6d. a week, but at the maximum rate of 100 per cenl. It is not a matter of only a £1 a week, but a rise from 24s. to £2 10s. Instead of the arthritis travelling up his leg, it may be that with proper attention the arthritis could have been checked and he would have been able to go back to work earlier. Whatever merit there may be in that claim, I contend that the case submitted by the honourable gentleman is not well founded. This former soldier was badly advised. Whoever advised him deprived him, by wrong advice, of the benefit to which he was entitled as a returned soldier, not of another £1, but of trea tin ent in the first place, and of 100 per cent, benefit while he was sick the honourable gentleman does not know anything about this matter.

394,Mr Barnard,"In this case theease exactly as it happened, this former soldier was entitled to the benefits I have outlined. I think that the honourable inember admits that. If that is the basis of the case that he is presenting to the -diamber to justify an amendment of this -ection, then his case is not well founded. quire more evidence? gentleman wishes to get these matters rectified, I remind him that my office door is always open to him. I like to deal with individual cases personally. They are not rectified by bringing them forward in this chamber. never refused to see anybody, nor have I declined to have a case examined on its merits. This applies equally to members of the Australian Labour party, and to Opposition members. No honourable member can say that I have not accepted facts presented to me and examined specific cases willingly. The case for the amendment has been presented on eutirely false premises. Whilst [do not want to detain honourable members unduly in connection with this matter, I wish to correct one statement made by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons). If I heard her correctly, she suggested that caucus had not considered this matter. When I was speaking earlier I said that this matter had been very fully considered by Oabinet, and also by caucuSj and that both Cabinet and caucus had decided it in the light of the fact that the Government had provided-unemployment benefits for people who were out of work. This is something that did not arise when honourable members opposite comprised the Government, because at that time nothing was provided for returned soldiers or anybody else vision for unemployed persons when the honourable member was in the Government except that made by some of the States. At that time. I saw many men, who were seeking jobs in order to earn money to keep theirwives and families, led by reother Australians, and particularly to turned soldiers. The honourable memher cannot deny that, because it is true. One tnass demonstration was led by a son of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). the amendment? with it. This Government has provided something for people who are out of work. It is a very good system because every unemployed man who registers is entitled to 253. a week for himself, a further 20s. for his wife if he is married, and 5s. for the first child, a total of £2 10s. a week. That is his right. The only qualification is that he must be out of work. I know that the honI have orable gentleman does not like this, but we say to the people who are out of work and who register "" Y o u can have an income of £2 a week before anything is held against you, whether you be a returned serviceman or a civUian"". That has been done for all sections of the. community by this Government. Had it not been for that provision,, this question would not arise at all. We say to the people in general that whether they are ex-service personnel or not, we will give them something if they are out of work. If the honourable member for Swan bases his case on the experiences of this particular ex-soldier, I say that his premises are false, and that the case is wrongly based. man was badly advised. There are any number of men in the community who could have given him some advice on such a matter. see my correspondence in the matter. memher bases his case on those premises, it is worse than. I thought. [1 a.m.] I rise to express the obvious. I think we might look upon it as axiomatic that there is no need to do anything unless there is a special reason for it. I was under the impression that it was obvious to the members of the Government, that this concession should be granted to a wounded soldier, and particularly to one",110,Deputy Chairman Employed He Is Entitled As Is Any Other

405,Mr Blain (Northern Territory),"who had lost a limb. To my amazement, however, I find that war pensions payable to ex-servicemen who have lost a limb, or suffer some disablement, are taken into consideration when assessing their eligibility for unemployment and sickness benefits, and may, in some instances, debar them from receiving such benefits, ft is shocking to think that such a thing could happen. The Minister has admitted that the matter goes back to caucus, but [ say it goes still further. I say it goes back to the pressure groups outside Parliament, which the Minister has not the intestinal fortitude to resist. The Minishas been inalienable and unattachable, ter refuses to accept the amendment hecause of the pressure brought to bear upon him, but if his heart were articulate, he would confess that he really agrees with the Opposition. However, I ask the Minister for Transport ( Mr The Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Ward) whether he, too, agrees with the Opposition on this matter. The question of preference to ex-servicemen is involved. When I was on Moratai Island, [ read in a volume of Hansard a most remarkable speech by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) on the subject of preference to ex-serviceThe serviceman's pension has been men. I also read the miserable exposition of the Minister for Transport. His attitude was that work would be provided for all, but that there would be no preference to ex-servicemen. The pressure from outside was too great. The attitude of the Government to this amendment is dictated by pressure from the Australian Council of Trades Unions. I know that I am right in saying that, because of the shamed-faced attitude of Government supporters. Very few of them have risen to defend the stand taken by the Government. Last year, the honourable member for Herbert( Mr the fair thing by ex-servicemen. When Edmonds) was guilty of a faux pas in defending the rights of returned soldiers, but although he was challenged to-night by another prisoner of war, the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull), to state his attitude, he has refrained from doing so. When this subject was discussed in the prison camps, I told my comrades that we could never hope for preference from this Government, but that when men returned they ought to be placed in the position that they would have occupied if they had never gone [54] away, [t is a disgrace that any government professing to have an Australian outlook should bring forward a measure of this kind. The amendment should be accepted. No ex-serviceman should be placed at a disadvantage because of the injuries that he received on service. I make a final appeal to the Government to reconsider its attitude to the amendment. At all times, the pension of a disabled serviceman has been regarded in the light of compensation for his war disability. It has been sacrosanct. It it cannot be garnisheed by any court. It is not regarded as income for taxation purposes. This is the first time that any government has grabbed at ex-servicemen's pensions, and it is a despicable act. Barnard) said that this legislation would not place the disabled ex-serviceman at a disadvantage when compared with any one else. I remind him that it will place the disabled ex-serviceman at a disadvantage when compared with a man who was not disabled. fixed by the Repatriation Department or by an appeal tribunal, yet the Government is grabbing at it in a way which the courts have refused to do, and which even the avaricious tax-gatherer cannot do. The debate ou this subject has been conducted in a temperate manner, but the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) entered the chamber and declared that no amendments to the bill would be accepted, although he did not know the purpose of the amendments which might be moved He instructed caucus that it would not be allowed to do this subject was discussed in 1947, some members on the opposite side said that it had not been considered by caucus. To-night, the Minister admitted that it had been before caucus, so that caucus must accept responsibility for the present attitude of the Government. Any government that breaks such well-founded traditions as are at issue in this matter will have a lot for which to answer. The Minister for Repatriation said that the soldier to whom the honourable member for Swan( Mr Hamilton) referred",111,Deputy Chairman Employed He Is Entitled As Is Any Other
406,Mr Fbancis (Moreton) [1.7 A.m.].,"had beeu badly advised. My only reply to the Minister is that before the next port-by leave-adopted . measure dealing with repatriation is introduced, he should table the report of No. 1 Entitlement Tribunal. I repeat that up till now the war pension has been considered, absolutely sacrosanct. I again appeal to the Government to honour that tradition. If it persists in its refusal to accept the amendment it will do a great disservice to the country as a whole. Question putThat thu clause proposed to he inserted ( Mr The committee divided.

The honourable member mentioned shipments of sugar to Launceston but it is understood that sugar for Midland Districts is usually supplied from Hobart, The following shipments from Sydney bave been made. The vessel Karuah sailed on the 7th October for Launceston and had on board 500 tons of sugmwhich it is understood is to be railed from Launceston to Hobart. The vessel Talune with 750 tons of sugar departed from Sydney on the Sth October an'd arrived at Hobart on the llth. Thc Colonial'Sugar Kenning Company Limited has notified that it will be able to make 1,500 tons of sugar available for Tasmania and the Anstralian Shipping Board iind the Central Traffic Committee are at present endeavouring to fix a special vessel to load this sugar at Sydney together with other cargo. The honourable member may be assured that the commercial companies engaged in the Tasmanian trades and the Australian Shipping Board which ie co-operating with them to supplement their tonnage arc desirous of maintaining regular services and are working to achieve this objective. It is essential that ships be run fully loaded to ensure that thexc arc used to their best capacity. This factor militates against complete regularity being obtained. Additional factors such as the bad weather at present being experienced,, congestion in ports and other matters not under the control of shipping operators are encountered from, time to time.

It is expected that, the draft bill will be completed iu the near future, and.it is hoped that it will be possible, tb introduce this legislation, into Parliament at. an early date. It. is proposed to set up a board to.be known as the. Australian Shipping Board, with, the power to operate, shipping services bothon the Australian coast aud in tliu overseas trades. The board would be empowered to carry on the general business, of ship-owner and in addition have such, ancillary powers as may be necessary. The legislation is not intended to prevent the operation of commercially-owned shipping lines on the Australian coast. The Government intends to place the Australian Shipping Board, BS far as possible, in the same position as a private company operating ships, and the various acts, e.g., the Navigation Act, Customs Act, Wireless. Telegraphy Act, &c„ which are applicable to private ship-owners will apply in like manner to the Australian Shipping Board. The board will be given no powers of control over shipping services conducted by the. private shipping companies.
