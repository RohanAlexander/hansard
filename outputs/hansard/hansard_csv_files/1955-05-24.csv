Petition received and read. Minister for Social Services when we may expect a new edition of the social services booklet? As he knows, the present booklet is quite out of date as regards the rates and conditions applying to the various social services. If the Government proposes to make a considerable alteration and increase of social services benefits in the forthcoming budget, I can understand the delay in publishing a new booklet; but otherwise I shall be glad to have news from him that a new edition of the booklet will be published soon. the present booklet is a little out of date, and that it should be brought up to date as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there were about 16,000 copies of the booklet on hand about eight months ago. [ did not think it would be correct to destroy them. I thought we should try to circulate them as quickly as we could. It has been decided to divide the new booklet into various parts, each relating to the various kinds of activities of the department. I assure the honourable member that considerable thought has been given to the matter, and that as soon as the number of booklets on band has been substantially reduced, I shall see that a new edition is published.

Certain further investigations are being made. I am not in a position to give the honourable gentleman any definite information on the matter now. to the Minister for External Affairs. It is reported that the Australian Ambassador to the United States of America last weekend had certain important talks with the Secretary of State for the United States. Will the Minister indicate the nature of these talks and whether implied or actual commitments were made? If so, when will the House be given an opportunity to review any of the matters concerned in what were spoken of as important talks between this country and the United States? Washington has frequent discussions with the American Secretary of State on many matters. This was one of a series of discussions. There were no particular matters discussed that involved commitments for Australia, although light was thrown on several of the matters on which we sought information, and on which we had certain attitudes of mind to put forward to the American administration. There is nothing in the confidential exchanges between the United States administration and ourselves that we should make public at this stage. With regard to a discussion of these matters of high policy, I can only say that I have not been encouraged to allow debates on these matters by reason of the experience we have had of the contribution of honourable members opposite to the last of the debates on foreign affairs.

I shall refer the question to him and he will give the honourable member a reply. question to the Postmaster-General. Can the Minister indicate the stage that has been reached in the provision of automatic telephone exchanges in Toowoomba, Queensland? The original advice received from the Minister indicated that, apart from the central exchange, two other suburban automatic exchanges would be installed. Is this plan still being adhered to, and can the Minister indicate the date on which the new work will commence? As a great deal of the preliminary work for automatic telephone facilities in Toowoomba has already been undertaken, will the Minister ensure that high priority is given to the completion of this urgent work, in keeping with the importance of Toowoomba as the second city of Queensland? matic exchange at Toowoomba, as well as one at Middle Eidge and one at Newtown, are proposed. The drawings are prepared for the Middle Ridge exchange and tenders will be called early in 1955-56. The Newtown building will be completed in the following financial year. The Toowoomba building is a project of some magnitude and the Department of Works is engaged at the moment in preparing drawings; it is hoped that they will be in an advanced stage very shortly. BEO ADC A STING OF tion is directed to you, Mr Speaker. I should like to preface it by saying that during my absence when I was home ill and I had the misfortune to listen a good deal to the broadcast of the parliamentary proceedings, I heard a number of interjections and audible conversations which I am certain you, Mr Speaker, did not hear, because had you done so you would have taken appropriate action. These interjections and audible conversations were most objectionable to me, and I regard myself as fairly hardened to these things. I can imagine their effect on the listening public. Is tbere any way in which the technicians could equip the Speaker's chair with listening apparatus which would give you the opportunity of hearing what is being heard by the listening public outside? I have now found from listening myself that listeners outside hear much more conversation and certainly many more interjections, over the microphone, than we hear in this chamber. It would not be necessary for you to make use of the earphones all tbe time, but I ask whether you could use them occasionally. In addition, have you any control over the microphones at the table? the Opposition and the honourable member for East Sydney ought to be separated. offenders in relation to the microphones at the table are the Vice-President of the Executive Council and some of his colleagues who, it appears to me-and I have seen them in action in this chamber-si t at the table deliberately muttering into the microphones, although listeners over the air would not realize that that was so. I ask whether you could switch off the microphones at the table from your seat when a backbencher speaks. switch off microphones. The mechanical control of broadcasting is with the officers of the Postmaster-General's Department who are allotted to this House for the purpose. I certainly do not want to switch off microphones. If I did, I should be in more trouble tban I am in now. I am pleased to hear the remarks of the honourable member about this matter. My correspondence reveals that it is not only the Vice-President of the Executive Council who participates, but also other members of the House who sit on my left, who participate, in private",10,Pearling

Mr Fisher indicated that Mount Isa Mines Limited was prepared to undertake the erection of such a plant, but that it would be necessary to ensure that sufficient reserves of suitable ore in the district to justify its erection so that the cupitai cost might be paid off during operations. That is as far as the matter has gone, but I believe Mount Isa Mines Limited would erect such a plant if it were justified. So far, we have not sufficient geological knowledge to ensure that the erection of a plant is justified, but I am hoping that that knowledge will come to hand in the not too distant future. I wish to supplement the answer that I gave a minute or two ago to the honourable member for Kennedy. One of the complications is that, in the Mount IsaCloncurry area, there are different kinds of ores which do not lend themselves to the same kind of treatment. One hopes that, as a result of recent arrangements that have been made between Bio Tinto and Australian Oil Exploration Limited in relation to the Mary Kathleen area, a plant will be erected to treat ores from the Mary Kathleen mine. Those ores are not necessarily the same as ores in other parts of the area.

Mr ""WHEELER --Has the attention of the Minister for Immigration been directed to a complaint against the calibre of immigrants who arrived in Sydney last week aboard an immigrant charter plane? If the Minister has investigated the situation, is he in a position to inform the House of the circumstances? when I saw the reports regarding this matter, and I found that the circumstances of the flight contributed very considerably to the impression which was gained by some of the air officers who I ask you, Mr were dealing with the aircraft in question.

32,Mr Holt,"I did make inquiriesstopping point. Under the circumstances, the facilities on the plane with such a large number on board and experiencing the conditions they ran into, were over-taxed. I think that contributed very considerably to the unhappy impression which was gained. On the other hand, our own immigration officer who met the plane reported that the examined passengers were clean and orderly. I may say that the immigrants in question had come from southern Europe-Greece, I think in particular. They had been processed, of course, by our own selection omcers. Many of them came from rural districts of Greece where the standards of hygiene are not as high as those to which we are accustomed. Normally, when these immigrants come out by ship, an opportunity is provided for training in this aspect of hygiene. However, that is not always so feasible wben an air flight is undertaken. We have discovered that, in other respects, immigrants of this type are very admirable and industrious people. These immigrants are the same calibre and type of Greeks as those who were such friendly and loyal allies in our time of need when our troops were stationed in Greece during the last war. We have found that they normally adapt themselves to Australian conditions once they are brought into contact with the amenities which obtain here. I would certainly regret if , as a result of a newsmonth, so we are still behind, whatever paper report, an impression was gained that this country was lowering its standard of immigration, and that these otherwise entirely admirable people were likely to be any other than the asset that I believe tbey will be to this country in the future. Civil Aviation inform the House whether the approval that he recently gave for the expenditure of £200,000 for further constructional work at the Adelaide airport included provision for the erection of a new main terminal building? Have tenders been called for the construction of this building? If tenders have not been invited, for that work, will the Minister speed up the matter in order to alleviate at the earliest possible moment the acute overcrowding of the present temporary accommodation for passengers at that airport ? £200,000 that I authorized the other day was for the terminal building, which will be constructed by the Department of Works. I am sure that my colleague, the Minister for Works, will keep his eye on the matter. ral aware that, although it is now ten years since the war finished, and six years since the Liberal-Country party coalition Government was elected on a promise to remove shortages, people are still waiting unlimited times for telephones, both public and private?

BOURKE I ask the Minister for Civil Aviation whether it is a fact that the major airlines are contemplating a further increase in fares.

The Government, however, has no intention of erecting treatment plants itself. The whole of its policy has been to encourage private enterprise to erect plants for the treatment of ores. As I indicated in answer to the honourable gentleman's previous question, Mount Isa Mines Limited is showing an interest in this matter as also are other concerns and I believe that in due course, other plants will be erected.

Standing Order ""106A provides that in tlie event of more than one matter being submitted for the same day, priority shall be given to the matter which, in the opmion of the Speaker, is the most urgent and important. I have considered tbe two matters proposed, and have accorded priority to that proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Anti-Communist Labour party, namelyThe renewed drive of the Communist party to recapture control of key trade unions following the attempted disbandment of and attacks upon Australian Labour party industrial groups. Is the proposal supported by eight lionorable members? Speaker, how can the House decide whether your action is right or not if you have not read to the House the letter which I gave you? If your decision is challenged, the House can have all the facts upon which to make a decision. sion in the Standing Orders for such a course. I shall read the relevant standing order to the honourable gentleman. It is as follows:in the event of more than one matter being presented for the same day, priority shall bc given to the matter which in the opinion of the Speaker is the most urgent and important. reason ? that your ruling be disagreed to. given a ruling. Mr Speaker, you have decided this 106A, which was adopted on the 28th matter, and have said which of the two, in (Hon. Archie your opinion, is the one of more urgent public importance. You have ruled in favour of the honourable member for Yarra. It is that ruling to whi'ch I wish to submit a motion of dissent. Surely, if you make a decision as between two matters, you rule in favour of one and against the other. I want to move that your ruling be disagreed with, so that I can test the House on the question of whether the matter that I wish to put to the House is of more urgent public importance, despite your opinion, than the other one. Again, I submit that, as on the occasion when this matter was raised a few days ago, the .House ought to have command of its own business. seems to me that this is a matter over which the House has no jurisdiction. The Standing Orders, which have been approved by the House, state definitely that in such a matter the Speaker shall give an opinion. Therefore, as you have given your opinion, Mr Speaker, it is not within the province of the House to agree or disagree with it. The House could be given an opportunity to express its view on the question at issue only if Standing Order 106A were amended. As be entirely wrong even to accept a motion of dissent from, not a. ruling, but au expression of opinion given by you under the authority of that standing order. points of order, Mr Speaker, one relating to your decision that this is a matter for you, not for the House, and the other relating to your decision to read out only one of the statements of the matters of urgency. With regard to the first point, I need only quote your statement that you are the servant of the House. Therefore, although it is your opinion that has to be given, in giving that opinion, you act, as in every other matter, as the servant of the House. I submit that you should uphold the point taken by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and permit the House to endorse or overrule your opinion.

While it is your able members opposite, I have got hold of some part of the bull. The arguments prerogative under the Standing Orders to that have been advanced so far have been determine which of those matters is of on the lines that the House, by accepting greater urgency, it seems to me that the the Standing Orders, conferred upon Mr Standing Orders place an obligation upon Speaker, among other things, the sole you, if the communication which you do right to determine which of two matters not regard as having prime urgency, is submitted to the House for discussion was in order, to read that communication to more important. I say that you, Mr the House.

73,Sir Eric Harrison,"It was to coverthat were the procedure, every time two matters of urgency were submitted to the Speaker, the House would be subject to unnecessary waste of time. The second point I wish to make is that the House has vested you with certain specific powers. I remember when Standing Order 48, which formerly dealt with this matter, was amended. The very thing now complained of was contained in Standing Order 48 which readIn tlie event of more than one motion being submitted for the same day, priority shall be given to the motion which, in the opinion of the Speaker, is the most urgent and important. whilst I am entirely in accord with the That has not been varied. The Standing Orders Committee was well aware that by giving that specific instruction to the Speakeri t would facilitate the business of this House. What sort of a position would you get into if , on every occasion you interpreted the Standing Orders and exercised the power which this House has given to you in this matter, you were to be challenged, as you are now being challenged? No honourable member would be prepared to accept the position of Speaker of this Housei f he could be subjected to that sort of treatment. The Standing Orders Committee is representative of the members of this House. Members of that committee are permitted, to submit, by way of recommendation to this House, certain standing orders which they think will facilitate the carrying out of the business of the House. Tbe committee came to a certain conclusion and it has given you specific power under Standing Order 106A, which has supplanted Standing Order 48. That being so, I submit that you have made your decision in accordance with the -powers vested in you, and that you should not depart from that decision. doubt, Mr Speaker, as to the correctness of your ruling on the Standing Orders. All fair-minded members of the House will concur in that; but the substance of the point which has been raised by members of the Opposition is that this House is master of its business. That is a point of view to which members on this side of the House also subscribe. However, tbe Standing Orders are laid down by the House after the adoption of the reports from those members who are appointed by the House to carry out that particular duty for it. The Standing Orders guide the House in the conduct of its business in a general way, but the House is always master of its business. If the House decided that, in regard to a particular issue it did noi. desire to , have the Standing Orders strictly applied, it is within the competence of the House, if a majority of members think so. to suspend the Standing Orders to enable the particular item of business to be dealt with. Therefore, Speaker's ruling, which in this instance is unchallengeable, I desire to reconcile it with the principle, which we have always accepted, that this House is master of its business. The proper course for members of the Opposition to adopt in this case would have been to test tbe opinion of the House, if in their judgment the item that they wished to bring forward had a higher priority and was one which members of the House would accept as being of a higher priority. Their proper course would have been to move for the suspension of so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition from bringing his item forward. when the honourable member for Yarra got the call? open at all times to the House as it is always master of its business. ter for Labour and NationalService and Minister for Immigration ( Mr Holt) made the point at issue very clear. You, Mr Speaker, have acted entirely within the jurisdiction conferred upon you by this House. can be no I desire to comment, however, on the fact that the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has suggested that you did not act in accordance with Standing Orders. If he disagreed with your opinion, there are other ways open to him to place his views before the House.

77,Mr Freeth,"I think the Minisoi order wben what you have done is entirely within the four corners of the Standing Orders. If honourable members opposite do not feel inclined to accept your point of view in this matter, there are other procedures vvhich they can follow. However, you have acted entirely iu accordance with Standing Orders and, therefore, to contest your action by raising a point of order is entirely wrong. placed upon you, Mr Speaker, of deciding which of the two matters proposed for discussion is the more important. matter now before the House is related to a by-election which is being held in one of the States. The other matter is of great national importance. It relates to flood relief, and affects a vast number -of people. Sir already dealing with one point of order. definitely of great national importance. It affects, a vast number of people throughout Australia, and particularly the people of my electorate, because it relates to flood damage and relief, and matterspertaining thereto. I suggest) Mr Speaker, that your decision should favour' discussion of a great national issue that concerns this Parliament, and not the discussion of an issue that has arisen out of a State general election. The election in Victoria has no particular interest in this' Parliament, but flood damage and reliefare of great and particular interest in this chamber. I submit that you should give your decision in favour of the discussion of the matter that directly affects the welfare of the people and isof particular concern fo this Parliament, which works for the benefit of the people. I ask you, sir, at least t'o submit your opinion to' the House. The fact that, in that opinion, you are supported: by so; many members on the.

The honoiable member for Lalor objected to that decision, and proposed a motion of dissent. I then ruled that as I had not given a ruling, but had exercised the authority vested in the Speaker by the standing order, a motion of dissent would not be in order. A motion of dissent from that ruling was then moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), and after debate, was negatived by the House. By this action, the House confirmed tbe opinion that, when the Speaker determined priority under the standing order, he did not give a ruling to which objection could be taken under Standing Orders 100 and 101. I say again that while Standing Order 106A remains in its present form, the opinion of the Speaker about the matter to which priority shall be given cannot be canvassed in the House. If the House desires an alteration of the standing order, it can be made after the acceptance of a motion of which notice has been given in the usual way.

These powers, which I exercised to-day, were given freely and unanimously and have been confirmed twice during my term as Speaker of this House. It ill becomes the House to raise objections of the sort that have now been raised. I ask whether the proposal of the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) is supported by eight honourable members. Eight honourable members having risen in support of the proposal, wonder that the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and his supporters do not want this motion to be discussed, because it is a very awkward one for them politically. Last evening, in the Camberwell Town Hall, the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) re-echoed the catch-cries which he has used during the past few weeks, and which have been used by the members of the party that supports him during the Victorian general election campaign. The right honourable gentleman described It is significant that the Sydney Com-",22,Earle Page I Rise To Order Interested To Hear Exactly What Matter
87,Mr Keon (Yarra) [3.41],"I do notmovement to march in the greatest display of unity in their history, and that the way was now opened for the Australian Labour party and the Communists to march in unity beneath the banners of Communist policy in opposition to the Australian Labour party industrial groups. The Communist Review, the theoretical journal of the Australian: Communist party, in its issue for November, 1954, expressed a similar view by stating that by bringing the struggle against the industrial leaders into the open, the right honourable member for Barton had "" acted in the best interests of the Australian Labour party and exposed the industrial groups as the dangerous and disruptive force they are "". There can be no doubt that in this House the right honourable member for Barton and all his supporters, particularly those who have been repeating his catch-cries in Victoria in tbe last few weeks, agree entirely and word for word with the publicity and policy of the Australian Communist party in relation to the industrial groups. That fact is indisputable. It is stated in black and white in the words of the Communists and in the Communist press. What has been the result of this united front between the Australian Communist party and the followers of the right honourable member for Barton in relation to the industrial groups? In every key trade union throughout Australia and in those organizations that have, in effect, completely controlled Australia's economy, there has been renewed hope, vigour and drive by the Communists in their effort to regain the positions of control that they occupied in those unions tmtil the Australian Labour party' industrial groups threw them out. That renewed hope and vigour appears because to-day the Communists are campaigning in the name of the Australian Labour party in common cause with the members of that party, not only with the right honourable member for Barton, but also with every member of the party who sits behind him. That is a result of a united front that they have formed with the Australian Communist party. What happened first in one of the key every key industry in Australia. On the trade unions, the Amalgamated Engineerwaterfront, in the iron and steel ing Union? The Australian Labour party industrial group candidate for office in that union was defeated by an Evatt candidate as a result of a campaign conducted on lines identical with those on which the right honourable member for Barton has conducted a campaign against the industrial groups, repeating word for word all the catch-cries, smears and sectarian innuendoes by which the Australian Communist party was able once more to gain control of the Commonwealth Council of the union through a stooge. That control had been lost to the Communists by the work of the Australian Labour party industrial groups. Elections will be held in the Victorian Branch of the Australian Eailways Union within a month, and the Australian Communist party has already submitted its team for that election. Its strongest claim for support against the industrial group candidates, who at present control the executive, is that its candidates are Evatt supporters. They are a bunch of Communists, but they are able to function because they are being supported by the party which is led by the right honourable member for Barton. The right honourable member for Barton, the honourable member for Lawson( Mr Failes), and other honourable members, who follow tbe right honourable member for Barton, are in the unenviable position of being banner-bearers in the Communist campaign to get rid of good, sound, trade unionists. So it is in the federated iron workers' association. Who is endeavouring to hand control of the steel industry back to the Australian Communist party? Have the Communists submitted their own candidates for election in the iron workers' union? Of course not! They have produced stooges, who have submitted themselves for election as Evatt Labour candidates, on a unity ticket in order to hand this union back to the Communist party. DoI need to remind the House of the position which existed prior to the time when the industrial groups threw the Communists out of key trade unions? The Communists had a strangle hold on industry, through the munitions workers, in the seamen's union where they still hare a hold, in the building industry and in the transport industry, they were able to control the economy of this country. The result was tremendous shortages and continual disruption of transport facilities, which caused people to walk to work every time Jackie Brown, the secretary of the railways union in Victoria, decided that they should do so. A hopeless state of confusion existed throughout our economy, because a few Communists could hold the whole community to ransom. The honourable member for Melbourne and other honourable members who support the right honourable member for Barton and who make common cause with the Communists, know that that was so. They know what will happen to the Australian economy if that state of affairs returns. They know very well that the stand that they have taken in support of tbe right honourable member for Barton and the fact that the good name of the Australian Labour party is being used by Communists in claiming support for their candidates and to justify the smear attack that is being made on members of industrial groups in Victoria, will enable Communists to renew their control of key trade unions in an even more critical period than that which existed in 1945. They must know that this scheme was part of a planned campaign on behalf of the Communist party. As Mr Dixon stated when writing in the Tribune in 1951Many Communists say tliat the Industrial will be able to eliminate the industrial Groups are small anrl that the workers w ill groups. In this election it will be the not have thein on Union elections, the Industrial Group canmunist party candidates, who will be didates have commanded n big support among the workers.

Moreover, he has stated that 1 make common cause with the Communist party. All of those statements are completely wrong and, so f ar as they refer to me, they are nothing less than foul assertions that I resent very greatly. I fought communism long before industrial groups were established, and long before many of the professional anti-Communists, particularly on the opposite side of the chamber, started to fight communism. I helped Short during the war period when he was a Trotsky-ite. I bave helped such people by providing money out of my own pocket. I am still helping people in the trades union movement who are fighting communism, and I shall continue to do so.

The measure that was introduced was not meant to be ignored, because it provided a penalty of £5,000 or twelve months' imprisonment, or both, for sabotage of the kind that the bill was designed, to prevent. Moreover, the Leader of the Opposition, in a pamphlet entitled Hands Off the Nation's Defence, made the following statement:Although the attempt has temporarily fizzled out, it constituted a very ugly incident aud it has undoubtedly opened many eyes to thc menace to Australia's defence interests involved in a facile acceptance of proposals put forward by members of the Communist party. It was the right honourable gentleman who, again as Attorney-General in the Chifley Government, brought down legislation to smash the Communist party conspiracy of July, 1949. The legislation was of Draconian severity. Paradoxically, many people who supported the Labour party in smashing that conspiracy voted it out of office later. Supporters of the Government, who at that time sat in Opposition, attacked the Labour Government for using the Army and Navy on that occasion, and stated that it should not have done so. But they stated that it should have used "" scab"" labour on the waterfront to smash, trade unionism. When the Labour party was in office, the right honourable member for Barton, as Attorney-General, successfully prosecuted leading Communists under the Crimes Act for subversive activities. Labour party has had with Government supporters, or with those honourable members who recently left the Labour party, have been in relation to tbe methods that ought to be employed to defeat communism. It cannot be stated by anybody that there is one Communist sympathizer in the ranks of the Federal Parliamentary Labour party to-day, and the McCarthy-like smears that are being uttered believe the honourable member. member for Yarra interjects that the Communists do not believe me, but I could not care less. The honourable member for Yarra did not always take such notice of the Communists, nor did he take as much notice of the Liberal party then as he is doing now. On the 19th March, 1953, when he was speaking in this House on the motion for the second reading of thc Supply Bill (No. 1) 1953-54, he said -as reported in Hansard, volume 221, at page 1435Honorable members opposite can tnke whatever credit they like for the legislation that was sponsored by this Government, but the fact remains that, when they claim credit for that legislation, they are admitting that it was the Australian Labour party which threw the Communists out of the trade unions. Therefore, if they attempt to carry on the campaign that they have carried on previously, . . . they wil] do so knowing f u l l well that tbey are not .telling the truth when they attempt to link the Labour party with communism, and knowing f u l l well that the victory over communism has been won by the efforts of the Labour party. The honourable member says "" If the Communists come along and assist, we will have a united front with the Labour party"". We told the Communists that we did not want their help. We want no united front with the Liberals or the members of the Australian Country party. We fight all the enemies of the people, whether they be the reactionaries on the right or the Communists on the left. If honourable members opposite want a test of our sincerity in regard to our attitude to communism, they will find it at next Saturday's State election in Victoria, when the Labour party is putting every Any differences that the Communist candidate last in its order of preference.

100,Mr Holt (Higgins,"Minister forbecause to-day we liave witnessed anotlier somewhat unedifying demonstration of the hopeless division that has riven the Labour party into a series of irreconcilable gulfs and has irremedially divided this political force. The honourable member for Melbourne, and those who sit behind him and the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt), describe the gentlemen from the corner as a bogus Labour party. The gentlemen in the corner describe the right honourable member for Barton, the honourable member for Melbourne and their colleagues as a bogus Labour party. So far as I am concerned, in the sense that these rival groups claim to speak for working men and women in this country, they are both bogus Labour parties, and are rightly regarded as such by the people of Australia at this stage, in that they both claim that they are fighting against the growth of Communist influence in this country. I turn my thoughts now to why the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) has seen fit to move a motion against a party which has shown itself determined to resist known Communist influence inside the trade unions. Those who came into this Parliament on the Labour side before 1949-and that excludes most of the gentlemen from the corner-know the unenviable record of communism up to 1949. After eight years of Labour rule here in Canberra, communism had reached the zenith of its power and influence in this country, and the Laboui: party which had the opportunity during those years by legislation, by administration, and by influence inside the Labour movement, to check the influence of communism, not only did so little about it that we reached that result, but also has since found it politically profitable to ally itself, in a manner which has been described to us, with the so-called leftwing and militant elements inside the trade union movement. It is well that the people of Australia should recall the situation in which this country found itself at the time when Labour was thrown out of office. The Communists were in control of what was virtually the key industrial union of this country. Do we want a return to the conditions of 1946, when we had in New South ""Wales a black Christmas, when transport and the Afr. Bolt. economy had been virtually paralysed, by the activities of Communist-controlled miners, waterfront workers, seamen, iron workers and other sections of industry at that time? Do we want a return to the situation in 1949 when Communist activities oh the coal-fields led to a complete cessation of coal production? There are other illustrations. There were the Victorian transport strikes in 1949, when Communists in control of the tramways and railways disrupted the transport services of our country. I am happy to pay my own tribute to the job which the Australian Labour party groups were doing inside the industrial movement to check this Communist influence. It took a lot of courage and a lot of energy to combat the Communist tactics, such as ballot rigging and the rest, which we have come to associate with communism inside this country. They had the courage to resist them. One of the charges which the right honourable member for Barton and some of those who sit behind him in this House will have to face in the record of history is that in a most wicked and unwarranted fashion they engaged upon a smear campaign directed against the people who comprise these groups, alleging against them that they were purely the product of some sinister sectarian influence. Those of us who know the groups .at first hand are aware that they have been made up pf men and women of all political and religious faiths. Quite recently, a statement was made by six permanent trade union officials, all of whom were members of the industrial group movement, and all of whom described themselves as members of the Protestant faith, who took part in this fight against Communist influence not because of a sectarian line-up. They were united with fellow Australians, irrespective of their politics and irrespective of their religious faiths. They were prepared to join together in the fight against Communist influence. Mr Short, whose stubborn, dogged, and courageous stand against Communist control of the iron workers union is well known by all loyal Australians-he , himself, is a man of Protestant faith-goe s on record as saying that in his own union in New South Wales, which ha.« 16,000 members, in an election on an industrial group ticket, five of the six officials of that particular union in ""New South Wales are Protestants. I take no pleasure in reciting these facts. I say that it has been one of the most wicked actions of a man so much in the public life of this country as the right honourable member for Barton-and associated with him in that charge have been many of those whom he is happy to drag along with him in this smear campaignto attack these groups on what has been a purely sectarian charge. As a result of the combination of the activity of men of that type inside the trade unionsand that is very important in this connection-in association with legislation passed by this Parliament, which provided a secret ballot giving the rank and file control, backed in a democratic way, of the members of the trade unions, during our term of office we have imposed a considerable influence. Although we were attacked when we introduced that legislation, the fact is that since 1951, when our legislation became law, no fewer than 90 appli; cations have been made by trade unions in this country for secret ballots under the provisions of the legislation. A t the time when we brought the measure forward, as honourable members will recall, we were bitterly attacked by honourable members opposite and, in particular, by the right honourable member for Barton. We were told that we were out to smash the trade unions. Instead of opposing the measure, the trade unions welcomed the opportunity we gave them to resume democratic control. In a similar period of four years, there were only twelve applications under the legislation which bad been passed previously by a Labour government. example, those whom it is politically profitable for honourable members opposite to attack to-day in the industrial groups, were the white-headed boys. They were the answer to the legislation that we were bringing forward. This was Labour's not 30 secret weapon in the fight against communism. The Leader of the Opposition, in March, 1952, addressing an Australian Labour party industrial group conference, 3aidA vindication of what has been done by president of the party, that illustrious thc Labour Movement in the industrial field non-unionist. Oh, shameful thing! And. is now apparent to all. It is part and parcel of democratic labour policy, opposed to totalitarianism of the Left as much as of totalitarianism of thc Right. The efforts of the ALP. Groups to combat communism, and its extremists who have attempted to dominate the trade unions have been completely justified by events. That was thc right honourable gentleman's attitude, when it was politically profitable to have the groups on side in 1952, but now that it is politically profitable to have the support of Communisiinfluenced unions and left-wing tradf union officials representative of them, hehas as bis purpose the liquidation of this, the one effective element inside the Australian Labour movement which was making an attack against Communist influence. The people of Australia have had demonstrated, only too clearly for them, that it is hopeless to look to a Labour movement which must rely so check on Communist heavily upon the support, financial and organizational, of affiliated unions which themselves are infiltrated with communism. If we are to have communism successfully combated in this country, there is only one element in Australia to-day which is capable of carrying on that fight effectively. The members of the Parliament who sit behind the Government on this side of the House, by their legislation, their administration, and their influence throughout the country, will do energetically what they can to carry out the nur pose which Labour has PO signally failed to achieve. feel very sorry indeed for the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). for I foresee the fate that is about to befall him.

Honourable members on the other .side of the chamber are not so naive as to think there is not a reason for it. The same thing applies to the honourable member for Yarra. Because the professional politics of the corner group is to smear, its members must be prepared to take it back. When we are considering the industrial groups, it is necessary for us to look at the fascist background that developed behind them. Having done so, one underI shall deal with thc stands why not only the Labour party, but also Labour people in this community, have repudiated them. As far back as the 3rd June, 1939, one, Santamaria, lined himself up on the side of Mussolini and Hitler by having great anti-war demonstrations in Melbourne at which resolutions were passed. That was only three months before the bombs fell on Coventry. At the same time, the Communists were saying, "" We do not want another Avar. It is an imperialists' war "". In order to understand why the Labour party had dissociated itself from the industrial groups, it is only necessary to examine the history of those who are still behind the groups. Much is made by the Minister for Labour and National Service of the martyrdom of one, Short. During the war he was a Trotskyite, a man of the Fourth International, who said that all wars were imperialist conspiracies. In existence in Sydney to-day are dodgers which were circulated at. the time, in which he said that the iron workers must not repair American ships "" because we do not believe inimperialistic wars "". Is that the sort of person we want to be-associated with the Labour party? Do we want such persons just because they have had an eleventh hour repentence, and are now anti-Communist ? Is it not obvious that the sweep has gone from communism to a temporary resting place with the industrial groups, and eventually to the camp of the I repeat those two Fascists? There is no mystery about why the genuine Labour party led by the right honourable member for Barton has denounced this insidious thing which destroys its own leaders. Immediately a man within a group shows some signs of organization, his immediate follower destroys him. There is no doubt about",32,Earle Page I Rise To Order Interested To Hear Exactly What Matter

132,Mr Haylen,"That. Communism is used by tbe honourable member for Yarra, the honourable member for Gellibrand-usuall y a much more gentle soul-and tbe bonorable member for Fawkner, whose, former habitat was among the hoo-ha birds of the Australian Country party, but who'has found, some other nest. Usually, there is a cuckoo in the nest. The Australian Country party does not want him over there but. might like to have him in the future if they require him to make up their numbers. The three honourable members in thc corner group whom I have mentioned all have a record, of smear. They line up people who disagree with them, and call them Communists. The honourable member for Yarra has made a life's work of attacking everybody who does not think as he does, and saying they are Communists. They used tbe groups to carry -out their policy. I have no doubt about the antagonism to communism of the honourable member for Yarra and his fellow members, but I take exception to his methods both inside and outside thc party. His methods are utterly detestable. They out-Communist the Communists. In essence, they are fascist, and that is why I abhor them, and why Labour abhors them. Communism has been used by him like a witch on a broomstick. For what reason? Merely in order to influence the coming election in Victoria. The honourable member for Gellibrand, who is not so subtle as his deputy leader pro tem, said, "" I ask you to vote next Saturday for the Barry group "". He was addressing the electors of Victoria, and he was called to order by Mr Speaker. Tbat indicates how meretricious and how paltry is this campaign. I should have thought that the honourable members would have brought something fresh forward. The tortuous workings out of the struggle witbin the Labour party have clearly demonstrated why we have rejected the fascist approach to the problems of democracy. As the Labour party has declared its detestation of communism it has, by implication, also declared its detestation of the fascist principles upon which the corner group works. We would have welcomed even one constructive word from that corner on the matters before us, but ""willy nilly"" -to coin a phrase : from the honourable member for Gellibrand however you describe it, they have come bumbling into this House, not to attack what should be their natural enemies, but the party that has thrown them out because of their sins of omission and, commission in regard to Labour policy. They have done this in the hope that they can hang on to the skirts of the industrial groups. Their deputy leader has tried to suggest that the industrial groups have swept aside the Communists and that, by implication, theirs is the only official Labour party. In fact, they are gradually being denied official recognition by the Labour party. If they have any gutsany vitality or sincerity for anything but slandering their opponents in the unions-the y could still do a job for Labour. Surely the imprimatur of Labour is not alone in what they claim to be their ful l strength. They can still go into the unions and do a job if they want to, but they know that they have become diseased and that within the industrial unions there is a cancerous growth. They know that they are at war with themselves and have been taken over by ambitious men who want big jobs in politics and the leadership of the Labour party. These men have no thought for the battle which they joined in the early days against the Communi.3t party. There is not a Labour member in this House who would not concede that in the early days, when Mr Cain was the Premier of Victoria, the objectives of the people associated with the formation of the industrial groups were not good, and that up to a certain point tbey were not also effective. able member's time has expired. sonal explanation. When I concluded my previous personal explanation, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), who sits at the table, made a statement relative to it, and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) interjected by reasserting the statement about my joining the Liberal party that had previously been made by the honourable member for",33,Earle Page I Rise To Order Interested To Hear Exactly What Matter

135,Mr Whitlam,"I rise to make a perGellibrand ( Mr Mullens). It is an interjection whicb was made a fortnight ago by the honourable member for Yarra, and ordinarily I would have ignored it in the circumstances. To put the matter completely straight, I must confess that last week I got a letter from the Liberal party, but I have never written to it , nor, as f a r as I know, or believe, has any one ever written to it on my behalf. I received a letter last week from the Queensland branch of the Liberal party of Australia, which readsDear Mr Whitlam, Knowing of your intelligent interest in political mutters. 1. am biking this opportunity ro brins* to your notice a political scliool which I denied it , and from his conduct at that the Young Lil.ierii.lw' Movement is conducting in June. used to be with them. happy to attend the school, as I would if any party in this House issued such an invitation. I take the opportunity of pointing out that I already have engagements for that date. sonal explanation. It is true that when an earlier personal explanation was being made by the honourable member for Werriwa( MrW h it l a m ) , I made an interjection. If the honourable member for Werriwa has regard for his reputation he will agree that last year I approached him and asked him if there were any truth in a statement that he had applied for membership of the Liberal party. He will agree that I made that inquiry from him. My information does not come from the letter that he has just read. A similar letter was, I think, sent to every member of this Parliament. It comes from events which, rightly or wrongly, were pointed out to me, as honourable members sitting here know, by the honourable member for Parkes. If the honourable member for Parkes, for his own reasons, decided to make those statements about the honourable member for Werriwa, that is his business and that of the honourable member for Werriwa. All I can say is that my statements in the matter, as far as I know, are perfectly true, and I am simply quoting the authority that the honourable member for Werriwa accepts-the honourable member for Parkes. a personal explanation. It is true that during the last sessional period, when I was sitting behind the honourable member for Yarra, and we were still speaking to each other, he told me of this allegation, and I said that it was not true. He did not say where it had come from . He seemed to accept my statement that it was not true and the first time that he has mentioned the honourable member for Parkes in the matter has been to-day. It is true that he said it . It is true that time. I took it that he accepted my denial. After hearing so much personal explanaI would, be quite tion, it is a change to get on with the motion. I agree with you very sincerely, Mr Speaker, that this matter is more important than any other that could possibly be brought before Parliament at this time. The motion deals w it h I also rise to make a perTha renewed drive of the Communist party to rc-capture control of key trade unions following the attempted disbandment of and attacks upon ALP. Industrial groups. The success or otherwise of communism in this country, as compared with normal democracy, is simply a matter of survival. If , in twenty or 50 years' time, Australia is still a country characterized by a free democracy, and a prosperous and advancing economy, it w ill be because the forces of communism have been defeated both within the unions, and abroad by diplomacy-possibl y by force of arms. Therefore, it struck me as especially unfortunate that the Australian Labour party-the Evatt Labour party or whatever its members call themselves-did not see fit to make a serious attempt to answer the grave charges of the Anti-Communist Labour forces. It is all very well for honourable members like the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), and others, to blackguard members of the AntiCommunist Labour party. object to the word "" blackguard "" and ask that it be withdrawn.",34,Earle Page I Rise To Order Interested To Hear Exactly What Matter

If that is so, the Opposition protests w i th all the vigour it possesses against the failure of the Government to make provision in the Estimates for the next nnancial year for increased payments to age and invalid pensioners, war widows and war pensioners. It also protests because nothing has been done since 1949 to increase the 10s. a week child endowment paid to the mothers of the community, and also the payments made to all the other persons who have a claim upon the community by virtue of the legislation which this Parliament has passed pursuant to the alteration to the Constitution made in 1.946, an alteration which was opposed by every member of the Australian Country party; although it was personally supported by the Prime Minister, it was opposed by so many of his followers. The amount of money which is being paid to pensioners is totally inadequate to enable these unfortunate people to exist. They do not live. It cannot be said, of course, that the Government is starving them to death, but it can be said that the Government is completely indifferent to their suffering, as is evidenced by the failure of the Treasurer, the Prime Minister, and the Ministerf or Social Services to give any indication during this sessional period of what the Government proposes to do to enable the 320,000 age pensioners who have no other income to eke out an existence in these days of terrific high prices. Pensioners are finding prices very high, as can b6 verified by anybody who knows anything about their conditions. The correspondence from pensioners makes very very sad reading. Minister McMahon), who is seated at the table as deputy for the Treasurer, of the letters indicate a condition of affairs which should not be allowed to Mr Calwell. exist in a civilized community. I received a letter to-day which reads as follows:I thought I would put my case before you and see what you and your colleagues think abuut it. My late husband was a member of the A.I.F. in the landing at Galipoli, and after his discharge lie took over a War Service home which we held for 34 years. During"" that time rent was not missed once. Altho my husband was in indifferent health and thro the depression also having reared 4 children. Now when my husband died in July, 1952, after my nursing him for Gi months my own health broke down. 1 came to the conclusion that I could not look after my home or myself, as my family were an married with families of their own. SoI decided to sell my home, but -before I could do so I would have to find £16(1 owing on the home. Andi t would have to be renovated for the wliole of these expenses. I had to borrow from a relative, which I had to repay on tlie sale of the home. I might state that I was in receipt of the old age pension and I notified the Social Service Department that I had to sell my home. Then they stopped my pension and sent ine an account for £21 paid to me since the sale of home which I am repaying at the rate of 10s. per fortnight. They also called in my Entitlement Card, which entitled me to free Doctor and medicine, for which I now have to have once a fortnight. Dr. visit and prescription 35s. 6d. £100 for agent who sold home. £350 for renovations. £]fiO to finish payments on home. Now £4 per week board, los. for woman to clean ray room and do my washing. £50 for a wheel chair as I am helpless with arthritis. This bit of money cannot last for ever. Why did they have to take my pension off me. T cannot expect people to look after mc and board me free. I have one and a half thousand pounds left. TJnder present prices that will not last lonsr. This Government should have done more than it has done in an effort to abolish the means test. I would t r y to abolish it within the life of one Parliament. I know something of the cost of abolishing the means test; it would not be nearly so great as the figure to which the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer referred during the last general election campaign. member referred that letter to the Department of Social Services?

162,For Social Services ( Mr Mr Calwell,"I referred it to thethe department, and allows this sort of thing to continue. However, the present Minister is no more hard-hearted than was his predecessor, the present Minister for Air( Mr Townley), who, when the Opposition proposed last year that age and invalid pensions should be increased to £4 a week, and that civilian widows' and war widows' pensions and war pensions should be increased accordingly, statedThis is absurd and could dual tbe national economy a body blow from which it might never recover. Every shilling increase in the age pension costs £1,300,000, and Mr Calwell promises a 10s. increase. It is just crazy. It will be just crazy if this Government does not do more for age and invalid pensioners, civilian widows, war widows and war pensioners than it has done in the past. Other correspondence that I have received demonstrates clearly how niuch the cost of living has increased since this Government took office. The Minister for Social Services is well aware that this Government and its supporters are not primarily concerned with the welfare of old people. They are concerned only with serving the class to which they belong. I know that Government supporters, in reply to the Opposition's criticism, will claim that everything is going well with the Australian economy, that there is nothing wrong anywhere, and that we are living in a state of prosperity such as has never been known before, with prospects of even greater prosperity in the future. The Opposition's indictment of the Government is supported by a statement made by the Treasurer last week-end when he addressed the Federal Executive of the Australian Country party in Canberra. The right honourable gentleman stated that inefficient production methods and high and uneconomic costs, sheltering behind artificial walls, would bring us again to the impasse that we faced in the depression of the 'thirties. That expression of opinion contradicted thc sentiments voir-ed by the Prime Minister the evening before, in Melbourne, during his participation in the Victorian general election campaign. The Prime Minister stated that we were enjoying unparalleled prosperity. One cannot enjoy unparalleled prosperity on Friday night and be facing depression on Saturday afternoon, but a comparison of tbe statements of the Prime Minister and of the Treasurer, who is Deputy Prime Minister, would lead one to believe that that is possible. I am sure that Australian manufacturers will not agree with the Treasurer that their production methods are ineffcient. In fact, in recent times, the Government has been criticized because it has not provided for greater depreciation allowances as taxation deductions, and because it has failed to encourage more investment of capital for each worker in industry in order to increase production. It has been stated that in the United States of America there is the highest capital investment relative to each worker in the world. That is one of the reasons why that country leads the world. It is the Government's duty to do something about high production costs in Australia, and not merely to criticize the manufacturers or the workers or tell the manufacturers in a patronizing and insulting manner that they are sheltering behind artificial walls. The Government must do everything possible to win back the markets that we have lost, and to protect, the markets for Australia's manufacturers that are now imperilled because manufacturers in other countries are able to manufacture goods more cheaply than comparable goods can be manufactured in Australia, and because, in spite of the protection afforded by the tariff wall, the competition of overseas manufacturers threatens Australian industries with extinction. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) has made a contribution to the public discussion of this matter by pointing out that in some industries, notably the textile and the clothing industries, unemployment is re-appearing. Unemployment must re-appear in present conditions, and Government supporters should not need to wait for Labour men to tell them that. I notice that the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Joske). who is missing from the chamber this afternoon, always enjoys his little laugh when any one talks about the possibility of depression appearing. The honourable member is probably appearing in divorce jurisdiction this afternoon, so that I shall uot be able to tell bim of tbe views expressed on Friday last, on his arrival in Australia from London, by the Honourable David Brand, the chairman of directors of the English, Scottish and Australian Bank Limited. This gentleman stated that there had recently been some indication that inflation was increasing, and that Australia was showing signs of overfull employment. He observed that the danger in that condition was that it could cause a dangerous ""leap-frogging"" in employment, with people changing from job to job seeking higher pay. Honourable David Brand stated, also, that he did not think that remedies such as the 1951 import restrictions had shaken the long-term confidence in Australia and its high standard of living which existed in England. He expressed the view that the individual investor from abroad who feared that he might be unable to get his money back when he wanted to, might be deterred from investing in Australia because of the danger of inflation, the danger about which the Treasurer warned members of the Australian Country party. Australia's economy is sick. The sickness about which we on this side of the House complain is made manifest by the following recent circumstances: First, the total of treasury-bills outstanding is dangerously high. This condition is always evidence of continuing and increasing inflation. Secondly, the growing adverse trade balance creates another crisis affecting the employment of many workers. Thirdly, the drop in both the volume and the prices of Australia's principal exports is the worse decline for years, and offers little hope for improvement. outstanding treasury-bills being reduced? has taken place only in the last few days, because the total has been increasing for a in-laws. Verification of this was provided considerable time. issue, which stood at £343,000,000 at the height of the war, was reduced to £80,000,000 by the time the Chifley Goliving quarters in which they can lead a vernment went out of office, but the prenormal life and raise a family, how can they sent Government has increased the total help issues, on occasions, to £420,000,000, and housing in adequate quantity-and quicklyhas about £200,000,000 outstanding at as it is to equip armoured divisions. To give present. The Opposition's fourth point is that the import restrictions which have been imposed are creating uneasiness and doubt among all classes of traders and workers. Our fifth point is that credit restrictions are being made more severe, with resultant harmful effects on homebuilding and industrial expansion. The sixth point is that hire purchase is thriving in the hands of private companies, and people are paying exorbitant charges for financial accommodation. This, too, will result in more inflation. The The Opposition wants the Government to adopt a more liberal financial policy. We consider that home-builders should receive financial accommodation at much lower charges than those that are now payable. Every co-operative building society in Australia should be given the money that it requires to provide homes for its members. We have been told that 80,000 is the maximum number of homes that can be provided in this country in each year. Honourable members opposite, and their friends in big industries, have said that Australia has neither the workers nor the materials to build more. If that is so, the result will be a new growth of communism is a short space of time. Not only must we build our current requirements of 80,000 new houses a year, but we must overtake the backlog of 300,000 houses, a legacy of World War II . and the depression years. A Labour government could do that. The Australian Labour party believes that every young married man should be helped to own his own home if he so desires. The Opposition contends that the Government of this country, whatever its political, colour, must help the young married worker in industry and the young married man who is employed as an executive. The Government must help these people to dismiss the landlord if they wish to do so. It is not good social policy to have young married couples living with their The treasury-bill recently by the former Premier of France, M. Pierre Mendes-France, who saidWJien young poople cannot hope to find despairing of the country in which they live? It is as important to construct good",39,Supply Bill No 1 1955 56 Second Beading

164,Mr Calwell,"If so, the reductionworkers Uie certainty that their wages wili increase as their productivity increases is to strike the sword from the hand's of the Communists. I do not think that any honourable member will disagree with that sentiment;, but the Government seems to be seized with an inexplicable inability to provide for the construction of more than 80,000 houses a year. Our population is increasing enormously. A million people w ill have come into this country in a period, not of ten years, but probably of eight and a half years. That number, added to the present population of 8,000,000, w ill make great demands on the community pool for all types of services. Although such a large influx of immigrants w ill have an inflationary effect temporarily, in the long run it w ill have a deflationary effect. Therefore, it is most important that the Government should state what it proposes to do to provide additional housing. The Goverament could tackle this problem in one of two ways. It could tell the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks to make more financial accommodation available than they are making available at present. Alternatively, it could provide the State Governments with enougn loan money to enable them to build all the houses that they want to build. Perhapsi t w ill be necessary to bring more labour to this country. Let us go about the problem in the proper way and recruit skilled tradesmen from abroad. We may need more raw materials. Let us obtain them. If more capital equipment is needed in order to produce, housing materials more cheaply and quickly, the Government should give priority to the importation of that class of goods in preference to a lot of unessential consumer goods, which are still entering Australia despite import restrictions. The Government is not doing all that could be done to provide housing for the young married people who constitute the most important section of the community. Biologically, they are our greatest asset. The Government should help them to build their homes and buy their furniture. B y increasing child endowment, the Government would help them to provide for their children in the way that they wish to provide for them. if. -[35 ] At present, if a married couple: have more than three or four children, they have to reduce their living, standards.. It , is a sad state of affairs that those who have families' should be penalized because they have performed tlieir natural functions. The Government has penalized young married couples by its failure to increase child endowment. Communism is in the air. A lot of people are talking about communism. A lot of people are trying to exploit communism. A lot of people have nothing else to do but think about communism. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) thinks in his sleep about communism. As a family, the Wentworths have been denouncing Communists since 184S. The great grandfather of the honourable member for Mackellar abused certain civic authorities of his time as being Communist. As a matter of fact, he denounced Henry Parkes, then a young chartist from Great Britain, as a radical. He even called h i m an anarchist. Australians now delight in regarding Sir Henry Parkes as one of the founding fathers of this great Commonwealth. In Melbourne, in 1877, Sir Graham Berry protested against an article which had appeared in the Melbourne Herald attacking his party. He was another 'English chartist who became Sir Graham Berry a.nd the Premier of a colony. In 1877, the Melbourne Herald published the following statement:The Government policy speech delivered at Geelong last night by tlie Premier, Mr Berry, will undoubtedly have the effect of disarming those political adversaries of the Liberal party who have tried to affix the objectionable nickname of "" Communists "" to tliose who are only a few degrees less conservative than themselves. If we view the subject of communism sensibly we shall not be upset by tlie Jeremiahs nor by the abuse which is being thrown around at present. Some honourable members opposite have said that communism is treason, and that the Communist is a traitor. That view does not agree with the view that was expressed by the present Prime Minister( Mr. Menzies) as Leader of the Opposition in 1946. In the Melbourne Herald of the 22nd June, 1946, tlie present Prime Minister was reported as follows:Our views are these. In time of war, a ban was placed on the Communist party on the grounds of national security. In time of peace it is a very, very serious step to prohibit the association of people for the promulgation of any particular political views. Therefore, in time of peace we do not propose to place a ban on thu Communist party, as such. We believe that, if the Communist party's views constitute a real danger to the public, they will be expressed through acts which will represent breaches of reasonable law. If the Communists arc, on investigation, found to be committing breaches of this law, then they will bu among the first people prosecuted. In other words, we should deal with the Communists as breakers of the general law of the land and not purely as Communists. And the reason for that is that in any country, in nor Mr Allnutt's statement. mal times, all doubts about freedom of speech, thought and assembly, ought to be resolved in favour of freedom. The Prime Minister abandoned that point of view long ago. He thinks it is a good thing to cash in on the fear of communism that exists in the community. It is proper that the community should have a fear of communism, and that it should adopt measures to ensure that the Communists do not take over the control of any instrumentality, and that they are defeated wherever they attempt to establish themselves. The Communist party is always struggling for power in various organizations, even in church groups. It does not confine its activities to the trades unions. universities and in education departments. Moreover, it is doing very well at present in its anti-American activities inside the Australian Country party. Communism seeks to obtain control of key trades unions because of its desire to bring about a revolutionary situation without which there can be no revolution. It seeks to form cells in peace councils, and even dissatisfied members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party sometimes, unwittingly or wittingly, do its work. I have before me a copy of the Communist party publication, the Guardian, which was issued in Melbourne on the 17th February, 1955. The article to which I shall refer has the following caption:US. policies making our farmers serfs, Country Party leader warns.. Mr Calwell. Labour statement. of the friends of the honourable member for Mallee( MrT u r n b u l l ) . If the lionorable member w ill listen, I shall read the article. It statesSlavish acceptance of American trade and international policies would turn the Australian primary producer into a serf, warned Mr A. G. Allnutt, M.B.E., when presenting his annual report us president of the Swan Hill District Council of the Country Party. The SwanH ill District Council of the Australian Country party is in the electoral division of Mallee, but the honourable member for Mallee has not repudiated tinuesMr Allnutt. . . expressed deep dissatisfaction with the Menzies' Governinent and called for an end to its aggressive foreign policy which is proving detrimental to the economic interests of primary producers. He further statedThe effect of the lack of interest by the Country Party in international affairs is now becoming apparent.

That is pure Communist propaganda It conducts its activities in fallin g from the lips of a member of the Australian Country, party. The motion for the adoption of the report was submitted by Mr Duncan Douglas, and he is reported as sayingIf we are to survive as a nation and make this country secure we can only do it by goodwill. Then the article continuesMr S. Storer seconded the adoption and said: "" I agree with its contents especially in respect to America's foreign policy in China and Formosa.""

If Mr Nock went onto that platform and spoke in support of the resolution, he has, in no uncertain way, committed the Australian Country party, which is always talking about its opposition to communism.

In the few moments that remain at my disposal, I wish to direct the attention of the House to the following statement by Bishop Sheil, an eminent Catholic bishop of Chicago:It is not enough to say that some one is anti-Communist to win my support. It has The been said that patriotism is the scoundrel's last refuge. In this day and age anti-Communism is sometimes the scoundrel's first offence. As I remember, one ot the noisiest anti-Communists of recent history was a man named Adolph Hitler. He was not wrong because he was anti-Communist. He was wrong because he was immorally anti-Communist. He countered Communist tyranny with a tyranny of his own and inevitably Herr Hitler was a dismal failure as an anti-Communist . . . Anti-communism is a serious business. It is not a game to be played so that publicitymad politicians can build fame for themselves . . . Congressional committees have done good W ill the honourable work, and are doing good work and will do more. But when they are cynically used to trap headlines rather than spies they mock I have just read it . themselves and they mock us too . . .

I know that there are many in my church who do not neree with me on this. So be it . Time will tell which of us is right. That is a statement which w ill surely be endorsed. If we intend to do something against Communism, let us do it constructively, and let us remove the evils out of which communism grows. Do not let us aggravate the evil that existed in the depression years, and which still exists for some unfortunates who have to live in slum homes. Let us t r y at least to modernize and equip industry so that the worker may have more take-home money than he has had previously. Costs have risen in Australia, and they have forced up wages.

The honourable member for Melbourne referred to Mr Allnutt, an ex-member of the Legislative Assembly iu Victoria, who, according to the Guardian which, I understand, is a Communist paper, made a statement at a meeting of the SwanH ill branch of the Australian Country party. I am informed, I believe credibly, that Mr Allnutt, an ex-member of the Legislative Assembly and a member of the Australian Country party in Victoria, was not a member of the Swan Hill branch of the party. Having had some knowledge of the kind of twisted propaganda in which the Communist publications excel, I am quite prepared to assure the House that the statement against Mr Allnutt is completely false and unjustified. accept the honourable gentleman's assurance on that point. been made to the Honourable H .

Let me say, with all the seriousness at my disposal, that the man who deliberately raises the sectarian issue in the public life of the country is going pretty close to proving that sectarianism is tbe last refuge of the political scoundrel. I say with deep regret that I find that those forces which, in the natural course of events, are lined against the real danger of our international existence, are being deliberately divided, not along the lines of ordinary politics or of economic discussion but along the lines of the worse possible passions that can be raised by injecting this old story of sectarianism into the scheme of things. With 65 years of Protestant life behind me, I deeply regret that this issue, which too often has given rise to false passions, distracting the people's attention from the real things which they require, is now being used to assist one cause, and one only, and that is the Communist forces of this country which are trying to infiltrate and destroy us. The only people who can gain by what is happening are the Communists. Communism is the only force that can benefit. If this question is to be approached in a logical, calm, and reasoned manner, we must look at the whole course of history, which shows that under whatever name a tyranny may flourish, or whatever guise it may take, something is always arising against which the human race must exercise complete vigilance. A while ago it was Nazi-ism and fascism. They raised their heads, and the forces of freedom were able to crush them. At one time, it has been the absolute king; at another time it has been the absolute priest. To-day, in this country, the balance of power in respect of the rights of the people is being disturbed by one thing only, and that is this rising force, the greatest and most powerful force for evil I believe that we have yet seen, international communism. The people who deliberately divide this country on an issue such as this ancl who deliberately split the forces which should be naturally united to reject this kind'of thing, must take their judgment not only in this House and before the electors but itself. That is my contribution upon this subject. I deeply regret that there are men who, while they uphold the Christian religion, are lending themselves unwittingly, and playing into the hands of this evil force, which seizes upon everything which can be used to mislead, confuse, and finally destroy the forces of freedom and the rigbts of democracy. On Sunday last, for the first time in many years, I walked through the Domain in Sydney, and listened for a while to a Communist speaker. I heard him quoting with tremendous approval what the Communist party and the Labour party were going to do by achieving certain results. He spoke with great approval of the destruction of the industrial groups and quoted with equal approval the remarks made by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) when, by a filthy inference, he attempted to disparage the integrity of the judges who conducted the Petrov inquiry. What was implied was given in great detail, and with great force, on that particular occasion. I know that it is sometimes very hard to shake off a mongrel dog, but anybody who does as the Labour party appears to be doing, and throws out choice titbits for such a dog, has only himself to blame for the consequences. I shall not pursue that line any longer, because I should like the House to direct its attention to the real problems that are associated with the Supply Bill. Thc purpose of the measure is to gralit £163,077,000 for the needs of the Government for the four months following the end of this financial year. The Parliament and the Government have to face some difficult problems in relation to the finding of this amount of money. The Parliament votes the money, but the money so-voted must be obtained from somewhere. It is derived from the taxes on our agricultural and mineral products, secondary industry and individuals. If the necessary amount could not be obtained from those sources, a vote of this Parliament would not, of itself, produce it. and therefore, would have no real significance. I have no fear about the ability of the Government and the nation to honour the promises which, in effect, are made when the Parliament passes this legislation. However, I have some reasonable doubt about whether this country can continue indefinitely to expend huge sums on its development without seriously tackling the problem of the need for additional production. There are different approaches to the problem of production. Some people approach it by urging the great task force of this country to give more time and effort to increasing production, in order to enable Australia to meet the challenge that is posed by its need for development. I am in entire accord with that approach. But that is not the whole story. We have to take a much wider view in order to be able to form a balanced opinion of what is required to enable Australia to function properly in the economic sense. I wish, therefore, to refer to a statement that was made some time ago by the president of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce during an address to that body. The statement throws into sharp relief certain matter which, I consider, should be the subject of discussion and review on such an occasion as this debate on a Supply bill. The major point made by the president is that we must increase our production. I am interested particularly in how that increase is to be achieved'. The president saidSecondary industries must be developed if were lagging, appealed to the great priwe arc to supply our own and growing needs. maiy industries to produce more. In On tbe otlier hand, it is the primary industries whicli provide our export surplus. ^Sitting suspended from 6 to S p.m. was suspended I was referring to certain organization and the means of carrying remarks, made notso long ago, by a -in the financial sense-the primary representative of the Melbourne Chamexports to those who wanted to purchase ber of Commerce on the subject of prothem, the extra production worsened a duction, and the part that it should play situation which had given us the cheapest in enabling us to function properly as a wheat since the reign of Elizabeth I . nation. The subject that we are dealing Naturally, when one sees the tendency to with is the proposal of the Treasurer increase primary exports though it is that we should vote approximately becoming more difficult to market our £163.000,000 for the purposes of the Gopresent primaryproduce, one wonders vernment during the next few months. If whether that is a sound solution. I may compress the statement to which I have referred, the first point stressed carefully the sagging tendency in our was that if we were to supply our own primary production markets. Australia growing needs; as a result of population is now stronger than it was inasmuch as increase and' immigration, secondary industries in this country must be developed':. The spokesman went on to say it was the primary industries that supplied our export surplus;. Elaborating, he saidThey are needed not only to enable us to buy consumer goods abroad, but to provide raw materials and semi-manufactured goods, which secondary industry needs and which constitute the bulk of our imports. It may well be that a commission of inquiry into the economy would find the need for a greater proportion of our capital acquisitions in the future to be devoted to those industries whicli produce goods for export-in thc main, primary products. A significant, but doubtless inadvertent, omission was the failure torefer to our debt service overseas. Australia must produce sufficient to enable it to discharge that debt and. maintain its solvency. That aspect must beconsidered carefully. So far, our secondary industries have been unable to make a significant contribution to the settlement of our export problems. On the other hand, I feel a cold shiver go through me when I read of a proposal to divert a greater proportion of our finance to the building up of our primary production for export purposes. I appreciate, the reasons advanced by the spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce, but have painful recollections that a similar policy was advocated before the great depression of 1929 and the 'thirties. The Government, finding that exportreturns actual volume the export figures of 1929-30 have, perhaps, never been exceeded. The net result was that, in a The Government will need to watch",47,Defence
201,Mr Drummond,"When the sitting world that was sagging through lack ofit has a greater home consumption, but it is still vulnerable in that 90 per cent, of its primary production goes to meet the demands of debt service. If the demand of the .secondary industries that they should receive greater protection from tbe wintry blast is heeded, there can easily occur further overbalancing, which, in the long rim, will undermine the secondary industries themselves. Certain of the smaller industries, such as the dried fruit industry, are already beginning to feel the impact. Other countries have taken action to meet such a situation. For a long while the United States of America has pursued a ""policy of propping up its primary production because it realizes that once it begins to collapse the collapse of the remainder of the economy will occur. I do not, for a moment, suggest that Australia should follow a policy of pricing its goods out of the local market. That happened in the case of butter, and consumption dropped by 00 per cent. Any policy which makes it harder to purchase the basic necessities of life is at one and the same time likely to undermine the national health and the strength of the national economy. Therefore, the solution does not lie there. Time will not permit me to follow that line very much further. I must pass on to another aspect that I tliink is important in this connection. One of the greatest weaknesses in Australia's finance is thc uniform taxation system. Its introduction placed the whole of the income tax of Australia in the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. It placed all the States in the position of mendicants and resulted in financial irresponsibility that is undermining the financial structure. It has led to the Commonwealth being blackguarded by the various States for, allegedly, not giving them enough money. On the other hand, the Commonwealth has robbed them of a responsibility to their own Parliaments for tbe expenses that they incur and the taxation that they impose. This Government is pledged to alter that state of affairs. It has intimated that it will endeavour to have appointed an all-party parliamentary eommittee to review the working of the Constitution. The sooner that committee is .appointed the happier will be the people who have trusted the Government to keep its promise in the matter. The sooner it brings about a proper and common-sense adjustment of the respective financial responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, the better it will be for the Treasury and the good government of this country. The present system is tending more and more towards centralization of power in the hands of the Commonwealth. That is bad for the Commonwealth, and bad for the principle of citizen responsibility in this country. It is one of the factors that is weakening our sense of democratic responsibility, which can be developed best under a system of local self-government. Let me refer to the Senate. At present, the Senate consists of 60 members, representing a population of 9,000,000 people in six States. In the United States, with 140,000,000 people, there are 96 senators. Apart from the creation of new States, are we to go on indefinitely increasing the number of senators in order to maintain the ratio of one senator to two members of this House? If so, we shall make ourselves a laughing stock. We shall destroy the Senate itself, and ultimately we shall cause a breakdown of the federal system. The federal system is weak for the simple reason that it has never been allowed to develop or function properly. I could speak at some length on this subject, but, I do not propose to do so now. I hope to speak on it at greater length on a future occasion. I think I have indicated some ways in which the weakness of the Constitution is affecting the job that the Treasurer is called upon to do. NowI want to refer to a matter that is causing grave concern to a great many people in Australia, particularly those in New South Wales. I am glad that the Minister for Defence Production ( Sir Eric Harrison) is here, because I want bim to hear me say that, so far, I have neither read nor heard a satisfactory reason why, in this atomic age, we should build a £23,000,000 munitions filling plant in a place that is vulnerable in the most dreadful sense of the word, a place adjacent to the City of Sydney. I have heard no valid reason why 'the plant should not be .situated west of the Great Dividing Eange, or at least 100 miles from the coast. I have heard no valid reason why there should not be four smaller plants in different places, instead of one large plant in one place. Surely we are not going to make the mistakes of the last world war. At that time, I asked the Commonwealth to join with the States in preparing an air training scheme for young men, but I was told that it was not a matter of interest to the Commonwealth, because it was thought that the provision that had been made was sumcient to meet the circumstances. I trust that that kind of *hing will not occur again. Adermann) -Order! gentleman's time has expired. Supply bill gives to members of the House an opportunity to review any aspect of public administration to which they believe attention should be directed. I wish to bring to the notice of the House a matter that is causing, serious concern to many of the new settlers from the United Kingdom. Some of those people, who came to this country several years ago, are being pressed, even to the point of summons, to pay sums which it is claimed they owe to the Commonwealth in respect of their accommodation in Commonwealth hostels. This matter is causing a great deal of agitation among these people, because they believe the Commonwealth's action to be unfair. If we want to get the best out of our new citizens, it is essential that we shall not seek to impose upon them unfair and unjust conditions, and that we shall not do anything to embarrass them in their efforts to become assimilated into the community life of the nation. Some immigrants from the United Kingdom are being pressed by a governmental authority to pay what the authority regards as debts incurred by them when they came to Australia two years, and even three years ago. These people came from the United Kingdom to make new homes for themselves in this country and, by their industry and good citizenship, to help to develop the great potential of this country and strengthen our security. But they have not received the encouragement that should be extended to immigrants from the United Kingdom, who are, I believe, the best immigrants that we can have. We want to ensure that a high percentage of the immigrants who are coming here will be people of our own kith and kin. We want British immigrants to be well satisfied with their lives in Australia, so that they will recommend other people from the United Kingdom to come here. The people about whom I am speaking were accommodated for a time in hostels provided by the Commonwealth, and they were required to pay the charges prescribed for their accommodation. Then there came a time when Commonwealth The honourable in increasing the charges beyond the figure originally agreed upon. In April, 1952, Commonwealth Hostels Limited in(Sturt) [8.14] A creased the charge for male adults by 17s. 6d. a week, making a total tariff of £4 7s. 6d. a week. The charge for female adult workers was increased by 14s. 6d. a week, making a total tariff of £3 17s. 6d. a week, and the charge for a female adult dependant was increased by 8s. a week, making a total tariff of £2 10s. a week. The immigrants greatly resented the fact that the increases were imposed without provision for them to be certified by some independent authority, or without negotiation with the people concerned. I understand that no action was taken to obtain a proper assessment of a desirable or justifiable increase of the charges made to residents in the hostels. The charges were made and it resulted in a very spirited protest. Any one of us would have made a similar protest if we had been subjected to an extra charge above what had beeu agreed was a reasonable charge for our residence in one of these hostels. This extra charge by Commonwealth Hostels Limited contravened the provisions of the price-fixing laws. Those who were concerned in this protest submitted a case to the High Court, challenging tbe validity of the extra charges that had been made. A decision was given in their favour to the effect that the price-fixation laws had been contravened. Subsequently, with a view to defeating the law and evading the implications of the ruling given by the court, action was taken by the State authorities to exempt Cominonwealth Hostels",49,Defence

If a law is made, even if by another government authority, we should observe it in the spirit and the letter. As this has not been done, I say that these immigrants have a perfect right to protest. They decided that they would pay the amount they were charged in the first instance and refused to pay that which the court determined was contrary to the price fixing laws. They decided to withhold that money as a protest against the action of the authorities. Two or three years have passed since this happened and these immigrants have left the hostels and become assimilated in our community life. However, they are still being pursued by dunning letters and debt collectors. A t a meeting of some of these people who live in South Australia, held last night in Adelaide, it was disclosed that six of them had been issued with summonses for non-payment of the excess charges. Last week, I asked the Ministerf o r Immigration whether he would consider cancelling th<j debts that were alleged to-be owing to the Government by these people in view of the time that has elapsed since they were incurred, and also w it h a view to securing the co-operation and help of the people concerned. Furthermore, if action were taken to settle the whole matter it would give these people peace of mind. the excess charge ? some of them did, but that does not affect the rights or wrongs of the matter. If some of them did pay, they are entitled to a return of the amounts they paid. man whether his statements reflect the official attitude of his party, because they ran entirely counter to the recommendations of an independent appointed by this Parliament. factual position in regard to these people and I believe that the matter should be examined by an independent authority of this Parliament in order to determine the merits of the case. This undoubtedly was pendent examination. evaded the processes of the law, and has sought to shelter behind its prerogative to exempt these people from the price fixing laws, then I think that sometliing else should be done for them because they would not have protested as they have done unless they had some justification for so doing. The Government should encourage these people rather than hinder them. I urge the House to recognize the justice of the claim that I have made ou their behalf, and I express the hope that the Minister w ill examine this problem which has caused so much difficulty aud distress to many of these people who are giving of their very best in Australia. I hope that they w i ll get the encouragement that this Government should rightly give to them. When the Minister does consider this matter further, I hope he wil l be able to arrive at a formula that will satisfy the claims of the Government as well as those of the immigrants concerned. The Minister indicated in his reply to tbe question I asked last week that the money in question belonged to the people, and as the Government was the custodian of public funds, it should see that it was paid. That may he true, but if these immigrants have a just claim, in accordance with the provisions of the law, some agreement should be arrived at which w ill ensure that justice shall be done to them. In view of t.he spirited protest that has been made, it is D i d any of them pay quite possible that much of the money concerned belongs, not to the people of AusI have no doubt that tralia, but to the immigrants themselves. That being so, I earnestly suggest that further consideration be given to the spirited protest that has been made, because, without doubt, it has been made. I ask the honourable gentlew i th some justification and these people should have a right to be heard. I wish now to mention again a matter that I raised at question time to-day. It committee is the great and urgent need to do more for aged and infirm people tban is being am giving thc done for them at present.

I have received a petition from approximately 80 aged residents in my constituency who also speak for thousands of pensioners who are being subjected, to the most serious trials and difficulties by the present high cost of living, which makes it almost impossible for them to satisfy the essential needs for their sustenance and the maintenance of life. It is unfortunate that the aged and the infirm are probably the only section in the Australian community that has not received anything like a propei"" adjustment of the pensions on which they depend for their livelihood. Theever-increasing cost of living has been clearly exemplified in the last year or two, and I hoped that before the end of this sessional period the Government would introduce legislation in order to reabout this matter later. He is well lieve this very urgent condition of affairs. acquainted with the events that took I take this opportunity now to support the earnest appeal of the honourable member for Melbourne to the Government to do something for the members of this most deserving section of the community and to increase their pensions-so that they may better, provide for their essential needs and so that they may be relieved of some of the pressure that bears so heavily upon them to-day. The two matters that I have mentioned are most urgent, and I appeal to the Government to give them immediate attention. I am confident that all honourable members consider that immigrants should receive better treatment and that the pensions paid to aged and infirm people should beincreased so as to provide more adequately for their essential requirements. honourable member, for Sturt( Mr Makin) has made seriouscharges about the treat ment of immigrants in hostels. Though the honourable member's charges may appear serious in his eyes, they are not completely justified. Some time agothe Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council was appointed to consider the matters to which the honourable member referred'. Itsmembers included. Mr crease throughout Australia. The popuJ. C. Neaglej the federal secretary of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, the secretary of the Australian Council of: Trades Unions, Mr R, R. Broadby, Mrs. F. G. Kumm, of the Young Women's Christian Association, and the honourable member for McMillan( Mr Brown)., who was appointed chairman. The committee investigated charges similar to those that have been made by the honourable member for Sturt,. and reported that they were without foundation. As a consequence, one would expect the honourable member to make further investigations and to consult his colleague, Mr Broadby, before renewing the charges; He has not bothered to ascertain the truth of the matter. Apparently he was satisfied to take only one person's opinion, and to rest his case on that opinion alone. I am sure that the honourable member for McMillan will have somethingto say place, and he knows that the charges that have been made were completely false. I wish now to refer to a document that was circulated among honourable members some days ago. It gives details of Commonwealth-wide expenditure on the national health scheme for each financial year since that which ended on the 30th June, 1949, with, estimated, figures for the financial year 1954-55. It sets out expenditure in each year in each State on hospital benefits, medical' benefits^ free life-saving drugs, medical benefits, to pensioners, benefits to sufferers from tuberculosis, free milk fbr school children, and the total expenditure; An analysis of this very important document, reveals that the people in some States do not receive the ful l benefit that they should receive, because in those States the national health scheme is not properly administered. The document shows that hospital bene1 fits paid annually throughout. Australia have increased by £7,123,435 since the hospital benefits scheme was introduced. Since the inception of the scheme in 1949, hospital benefits paid in New South Wales have increased by approximately £4,000,000 annually.

The Hospital Benefits Association, having had many years of experience, is able to appreciate what is happening in the community. It knows that greater benefits should be paid. People should be helped to pay for modern hospitalization and surgical treatment, and the association considers that they could be given additional assistance if this act could be altered. The balance sheet of the association shows that it has established itself in a sound financial position in a short period of time. Its assets take the form of investments in Commonwealth loans, State Electricity Commission loans, Gas and Fuel Corporation securities, Melbourne Tramway Board securities, and other gilt edged securities. These assets would enable the association to meet any great demand that might be made on its funds at any particular time. During the last ten months, the association has built up a surplus of about £220,000, but it is unable to increase the amount of benefit paid to its members and thereby entitle them to increased Commonwealth friendly societies in Victoria are permitted to do that, but they do not do it. The Hospitals Benefits Association is eager to do it, but cannot. It seems that discrimination is being exercised by the Chief Secretary between the friendly societies and the Hospital Benefits Association. The people of Victoria have been complaining about this discrimination. I am sure that the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) realizes that it is creating a bad situation in Victoria. The people of Victoria are not receiving Government hospital and medical benefits to the same degree as the people of other States. They are at a great disadvantage. refuse to allow them to insure for whatever amount they wish to receive. the Minister say that. Many people in Victoria are suffering, although there is no need for them to suffer. It has been possible for this Government to give considerable assistance to the people of other States in respect of the payment of medical and hospital expenses, but the people of Victoria have suffered because of the restrictive State legislation, which has prevented medical benefits associations from giving greater benefits. The people of Victoria can blame only one government for that state of affairs. The Victorian Government is prepared to allow societies to build up huge reserves for all kinds . of purposes. Eeserves are necessary in order to meet any large demands that are likely to be made on societies in an emergency, but any surplus that is held by a society over and above the amount required for that purpose should be paid back to contributors. In 1953, when a social services consolidation bill was before the House, I was rather perturbed about the possibility of medical benefit societies and associations building up huge reserves for some purpose which might never arise. On that occasion, I made the following statement:The Government must ensure that, in giving its blessing to medical organizations which are to be approved for payment of Commonwealth hospital and medical benefits, it is not providing tliem, at the taxpayers expense, with an easy means to enlarge and inflate their contributions. The financial strength to a degree that would enable them, and not Parliament, to control tlie future of the health scheme.

I continuedMoreover, the Government must, without delay, or as soon as possible, take legislative action to ensure that after safe periods, the reserves that these societies build up, through subscriber's contributions are handed back to members in some form of lower contribution or greater benefits. There are to-day, in every capital city, societies with tremendous capital resources, collectively running into millions which have been built up by contributions from people long since dead. One would have thought that the Victorian Labour Government would have been very concerned about the health of the people of that State, and that it would have sought to ensure that the workers, whom it was alleged to have represented, obtained the maximum medical and hospital benefits from the funds that had been made available by the Australian Government.

As he, apparently, is a close student of hospital systems throughout Australia, I assume that he knows that the Queensland hospital system, under a Labour government, is miles ahead of any other system. Honourable members returned to Canberra in April, after a very long recess, expecting that some really worth-while matters would be considered during the present sessional period. To my astonishment, the business paper that is before the House is the worse that I have ever seen, and it is probably the worse that has been prepared since the inauguration of this Parliament. Nothing of worthwhile value has been placed on it, although I think you, Mr Speaker, will admit that there is ample scope for the introduction of worth-while legislation. At no time during the history of this Parliament bave there been such vital and urgent problems awaiting attention. If certain matters of urgency had not been subbably the present sessional period would have come to a conclusion already. The submission of such matters assisted the Government to fill in time and to pad the programme. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), after having won three elections, not as the result of having presented a policy to the people, but as a result of accusing the munist sympathies, has become so arrogant, or lackadaisical or lazy, or has such complete control of the party of which he is a member, that he has not worried about bringing before the Parliament the important problems to which I refer. Where will we get to if we do not deal with those matters? Can the Government offer any excuse for not having submitted a worth-while programme to the I suppose that some of the Supply for which the Government is seeking approval is required to pay for Ministers peregrinating around the world at the cost of approximately £60,000. That is why a (Hon. Archie programme has not been presented to the Parliament. At times, a Cabinet meeting could have been held in Great Britain, or even in New York. One could not be held in Australia for quite a time because there were not sumcient Ministers in the country. As they returned, one by one, it was decided that it was necessary that the Parliament should meet again. But the Government has placed before the House a programme that does not take account of many matters that are of great importance to the country. Recently, the Government gave large salary increases to public servants. I have no objection to its having done so, but I cannot understand its continued callousness and failure to consider people who are on lower incomes or who are in receipt of the age pension.

Public servants wbo are in tbe bigber salary ranges bave greater responsibility, but, if tbey are entitled to large increases, surely tbose persons in the lower income groups, including the age pensioners, sbould obtain similar increases, because tbe cost of living affects everybody. I know that many supporters of the Government are kind-hearted, but they are more interested in unrestricted private enterprise than in helping the people who pioneered Australia, and who made it possible for private enterprise to become so prosperous. Such people have been left by the wayside, without having received any consideration whatever. Certain incidents have occurred in the House recently, during which certain honourable members have indulged in recrimination. I think that it has all been unnecessary. party was responsible for the introduction of the industrial groups in order to attack the Communists. It was a further application of our policy to defend Australia against communism. But, in due course, certain outside bodies conceived the idea of using those groups for an entirely different purpose. Instead, of their being a potent weapon against communism, they became a .grave clanger, not only to the Australian Labour party, but also to Australia as a whole. A gentleman named Santamaria decided that the industrial groups provided an excellent, means, not only of combating communism but also of forcing good Labour men to do certain things under threat that their future candidature woulcl not be endorsed unless they did those things. Such a powerful influence should not be permitted to continue in this country. I have shown that the original idea of the groups was prostituted for the purpose that, the centre party supports. I mako this point, that the centre party has only one plank in its platform. As experienced politicians, we know that a platform should consist of a number of planks. The only plank in the centre party's platform is to ""get"" the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt). A platform consisting of only one plank will drift along >on the ocean of politics. Occasionally, because it has no balance, Mr Bruoe. it will be 'diverted by strong currents, but ultimately, it will finish up amongst the driftwood from political wrecks of the past. The Prime Minister recognizes the ability of our leader, and he knows that as long as we have our present leader he will have to watch his step. Nobody appreciates Dr. Evatt's ability more than does the Prime Minister. of the Opposition should be referred to by his correct title. a very shrewd man, who acknowledges our leader's ability. But certain speeches that have been made in this House, as well as the whole of the press, have attacked the right honourable member for Barton. He has been the victim of numerous skits in the daily press. During my political life, I cannot remember The Australian Labour any other politician who has taken so much on the chin as our worthy leader. Nor has any man fought back so well. The right honourable member for Barton, after being submitted to a barrage of scandal and abuse, has displayed a degree of courage not equalled in the political history of this country. member had better stop there. necessary for me to say in that connection. I do not want to hear what a Victorian politician has to say about a New South Wales politician, or vice versa. I have endeavoured to show where the Labour party stands in this matter. It established the industrial groups for the purpose of combating communism. Yet the Prime Minister has won three general elections by accusing us of being Communists. Although men's relationships sometimes alter after they enter political life, they still, usually, observe^ a certain code of honour. The Prime Minister stooped very low when he accused me and my colleagues of being Communists, in order to gain, and retain ; office. The practice of supporters of the Government of continually accusing honourable members on this side of the House of being Communists is greatly assisting the Communists.

222,Mr Bruce,"I have said all that isat the instigation of the centre party, are encouraging communism. As I have pointed out, the Government's unduly enthusiastic encouragement of private enterprise has led to the establishment of monopolies. Only recently, the overseas shipowners announced their intention to increase shipping freights by 10 per cent. That is only one instance of the effect of the Government's policy. It is one that has come out into the open. Many monopolies are operating to-day. As the people are now better educated than in former time3, sooner or later they will revolt against huge commercial combines taking a rake-off in respect of every item of food and household requirements. To-day, young chaps have no opportunity-as they had in the past-to establish businesses and strike out for themselves. In the United States of America, probably the steel industry has more power than the Government of that country. It controls a very large proportion of American capital. In Australia, combines such as General Motors-Holden's Limited have done much to force up the cost of living. During the second-reading debate on the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement Bill 1955 in this House recently, we supported the introduction of a scheme under which money would be made available to persons to purchase homes on 5 per cent, deposit, to bear interest at the rate of 4-J per cent. The cost of a modest home to-day is approximately £3,000. Surely every member of this House realized the inadequacy of such a scheme. We can deal adequately with the housing problem only by bringing down the cost of building materials, and thus reducing the cost of housing. Why should timber, galvanized iron, and other materials that we need for housing continue to be exported? While the cost of houses continues to rise, young people will have very little chance of being able to pay off their housing loans. As matters stand, it will take a young couple the best part .of 50 years to pay off homes that they buy on terms at to-day's high prices. If they were overtaken by ill health, or suffered greatly reduced incomes due to an economic depression, they might not even own their homes then. They would then be 70 years old, and they would have the happy knowledge that a government in 1954 made a beautiful arrangement, whilst not keeping down the cost of .housing materials, whereby, paying off so much a quarter at 4£ per cent, interest, they could sit back and say, "" This is our home"". Of course, many houses being built to-day will probably need to be rebuilt 50 years hence. A wooden building, in order to be kept in condition, must be painted every five years. Whilst, in the. past, an average house could be painted for £50 or £60, to-day that cost is at least £200. If a house is to be preserved in proper order, it must be painted every five years. All the experts, all those people who are supposed to know, have been telling us that we should decentralize, yet we find, in the face of all that advice, evidence of what seems to me to be the craziest idea a government ever conceived, that is, the building of a munitions factory in the city of Sydney. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) told us of the necessity for removing people and businesses from Sydney in the event of an atom bomb attack. In the face of all the scientific information that is available, the Government is expending £23,000,000 on a factory there, not quite in the heart of Sydney, but certainly within the boundaries of that city. Irrespective of whether it is being done by a Liberal government, an Australian Country party government, or a Labour government, can anybody who knows the situation to-day and has heard or read the advice to decentralize explain why this is being done ? Can the Government tell us who are the experts who advised it to build this factory in Sydney? As the Government has done something for which it has been criticized, it would be logical for the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence Production ( Sir Eric Harrison), or whoever is responsible, to inform the Parliament and the people of Australia who gave the advice and the basis for it. I am sure that the people of Australia must be not only alarmed, but flattened. Every day they read in the newspapers of the necessity for decentralization and yet, after being told how terrible is the atom bomb, they find the Government putting an essential and important unit of war equipment right in the heart of a city. Great Britain and the United States quite capable and physically fit to do of America are going to take uranium their part and defend it on their own Erom Australia, convert it into atomic behalf. During the last war, while energy, and sell it back to us.

In the time at building equipment whereby we can fire my disposal, I have taken the opportunity back.

But are we going to have the position that British and Australian born boys are to fight all over the world to defend Australia for men who are this critical time. I suppose all times are critical to a degree, but perhaps the present is an especially critical time so far as defence and our economic situation",57,Defence
223,Mr Jeff Bate (Macarthur) [9.20].,"The Labour party seems to have thrown overboard its socialization policy. It had an economic policy, which it put to the people, and which would quickly have broken Australia. At present I think that this Parliament should give consideration to what is called the balance of payments, which is the phrase used to indicate our earnings position in other countries. This year Australia will probably have a deficit of £200,000,000 in export receipts compared with import expenditure. Our export receipts are largely from rural products, but also include income from some other minor items, such as investments, gold production, migrant funds and the like. Those things constitute our export income, which is less than the amount that we are spending on imports, freights and insurance, and so on, to the extent of £200,000,000. member for Grayndler asks me whose fault it is, I should like to outline some of the difficulties that this country is facing in keeping up its export income. Our exporters are probably concerned with rural industries mainly, with perhaps 10 per cent, of them engaged in manufacturing industries, and both primary and secondary industries are facing the same problems concerning their receipts from overseas. Competition is stronger overseas. We are receiving less income from wool and wheat, and we are finding trouble with other rural exports. I refer particularly to dairy products and dried fruits. In Australia we have built up an artificial cost of living and a high cost of production. Overseas purchasers are concerned with obtaining high-quality goods at the right price, and they have no regard for the cost of living or the cost of production in Australia. With a high cost of living and high cost of production in Australia, exporters are forced to sell their goods overseas at less than it costs to produce those goods. In the field of dairy products we are sell| and we are forced to sell dried fruits at the best price we can obtain. Certain overseas countries are assisting their export trade in various ways. I am informed that in West Germany the manufacturing interests can obtain assistance in three ways. First, the manufacturer can have refunded to him the cost of freight to the seaboard. Secondly, he can get the benefit of what are called export credits from overseas; in other words, he can be paid at once for his exports. Thirdly, he has a secret drawback from income tax to assist him. West Germany therefore is making itself felt in markets all over the world. In Australia we are fortunate with our wool industry, because we have almost a monopoly in that field. Australia is finding difficulty in selling its wheat overseas, but it has been sold. The same applies to our flour. I will touch on those items again later when dealing with the waterside problem. Our other industries are also finding difficulty in selling their products overseas. When we find that there is a deficit of £200,000,000 between imports and exports, then we should give close attention to this problem. This is not the worse year that we have experienced, because in 1951-52 the deficit was £582,000,000. That was the year in which import restrictions were first imposed in Australia. There are a number of reasons for this economic problem. Not the least of them is the system of financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. In 1945, some very distinguished economists in Australia produced some plans for Australia's post-war reconstruction. They were men of brilliant minds, whose opinions were quoted all over the world. One of them was Dr. Coombs, the present governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who was then head of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction. He suggested -and his suggestion was supported by the other economists-that , having in mind the years of depression when there was severe unemployment in Australia, full employment was a necessity. The suggestion was that full employment could be assured by increasing tbe scope ing butter and cheese on consignment, of Australia's manufacturing industries, and by having a programme of works that could be commenced whenever it was thought necessary. Some very spectacular proposals were suggested in that",59,Defence

225,Mr Jeff Bate,"As the honorableregard. There were various plans for irrigation works, and. for construction works such as those that are now being undertaken by the Snowy Mountains Hydro electric Commonwealth and the States embarked on these schemes. As a. result, the Snowy Mountains scheme is now in full swing, and there are a large number of other, irrigation schemes in course of construction throughout Australia, particularly ia New South ""Wales. Those works have been commenced,, but they have uot been finished. Many millions of pounds are being spent on works without any return being received for the money. I shall mention as an example the Warragamba Dam. It was originally estimated to cost £10,000,000. Later the estimate was. increased, to £23,000,000, and I think that it has now risen to £30,000,000. Some: of these other irrigation schemes will be as costly as that. The original estimatefor the Snowy Mountains scheme was: £250,000,000. I 1 think the estimate, now is about £400,00.0,000, and no one knows what will be. the. final cost. It' iswell known that Australia is short of water and electric power, and in the sacred cause of producing power and ensuring water, supplies we have, started too many schemes, at once. We should have finished some of the schemes'. We should have: concentrated on some of the. most important ones' and finished them-, and before starting' on otherswe should' have considered the servicing operations, such as railways, roads and shipping. should, have been done is to be found here in Canberra. Last week we had a debate: in this House on the subject of roads, during which honourable, members were told that the road from Canberra to Cooma is torn to pieces. We know that the railway from Queanbeyan to Cooma, which services the Snowy Mountains scheme, is very light and is not able to carry heavy loads. The Snowy Mountains, scheme was begun beforewe had the communications to copewith it. The G-uthcga-Munyang imit of tlie scheme', which produces some thousands of kilowatts of electricity has. beencompleted, and. the administrative buildings have Mr Jeff Bate. been erected. We-did aU that before w«had roads or railways suitablefor servicing such a scheme. A tremendous burden is being put on our existing railAuthority. The ways and roads wliile we are trying to finish, or are half-finishing, some of these spectacular schemes. Everybody will agree that, whilst big schemes like dams or irrigation projects, and projects like the Snowy Mountains scheme, take out of the community a great proportion of the goods and materials that we need for the building of many other things,, including defence projects, they do not put anything back into the economy until' they have been finished. In relation to this muchvaunted Guthega-Munyang power house we have a situation in which a small volume of water is held in a dam. The water level in the dam cannot, be. lowered because a lower level would reduce the head for the turbo-generator. Therefore, the generator can run for only short periods while the water is running into the dam, and' there is not much water being run into it. So, for a few hours a day, we get some thousands of kilowatts from this. first unit of the scheme. 1 do not think that that accretion of power will be noticed much, because the'thermal generating stations produce a great many hundreds of thousands' of kilowatts a day, which will be an important contribution to> ourpower' situation. In fact, after a number of years and the expenditure of many millions of pounds, we have finished a part of the Snowy Mountains scheme which could well have waited another ten years for completion. ProA good example of what bably it was a good thing> from an education al point of view; to get started on someproject, but there weremoreurgent works that could have been done instead'. The planners in 194J5 overlooked the fact that the strain of war had torn our railway facilities to pieces. It had worn out the sleepers and tracks, and had macknew rolling-stock imperative: I believe that in the States there TO a bias against railways. I remember that that was the position in the New South Wales Parliament. It: resulted from, attack by State poUticiansbased on. thelosses incurred: by the State railways, and from the fact that trade union leaders used to criticize the railway administration because tbe. rail.ways were making an interest payment of £7,00.0,000 a year. Tbe trade union leaders believed that the payment of that interest prevented members of. their unions from obtaining higher wages. Because of those two facts people were afraid, to put more capital into the railways. Actuallyj in a developing country ; like Australia, railways ought not. to be expected, to pay their way, because they areexpected to do so many important Things. I think that it is not even now too late to re-cast work on some of the projects I have mentioned, select some that ought to be finished, and in the meantime get on with work on. our railway, shipping and road services. We know that the volume of interstate shipping traffic in this country has decreased tremendously as a result of various factors on the waterfront. That decrease throws an impossible burden on the railways and the roads. The result is an enormous increase in freights and costs. The freight rate on a coastal ship operating between Sydney and the south coast of New South Wales, which used to be between 30s. and £2. a ton,, is now £10 a ton. Our present roads cannot stand up to the huge and weighty vehicles that now carry goods over them. We have a vicious circle, particularly in transport. We know that power in Australia costs three' times asmuch as it costs in other : countries. We feel, however;, that the worse, taxthat we have to face is: the inadequacy of ourtransport to. meet the situation. I wish now to quote a statement by Dr. Walker, a former senior. Treasury omciai who was engaged in the preparation of the Budget and also probably gave the Government advice about the. handling of credit in Australia. He. saidThefundamental reason for the present bad state of the roads is the inability of the coastal shipping services and the railways to handle the traffic which is most suited to those forms of transport. Consequently much heavy traffic has been diverted to the roads, at considerable extra cost to' the community and involving the virtual ' destruction of our highways. T believe now that the economists who planned all these projects in 19.45 made a. bad error of judgment. They were probably seduced by the spectacular natureof the proposals. I think that, in their view, it was not a. spectacular act to bring the railways up to the peak of perfection that we need. They thought it more spectacular to plan schemes like the Snowy Mountains scheme, or dams like the^ Namoi River dam, theMacquarie River dam or the Hunter River dam, which at present are only half finished, or less than half finished. It may Be many years before they make any contribution to. water conservation or any other of our great needs. In this connection I shall quote a statement by Dr. Strong. Only lately we have seen submissions that there ought to be. an increase of certain manufactures. I remember Dr. Burton of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization asking fortariffprotectionfor his cellulose mdustry because it had ahigh production rate per man-hour. Dr. Strong claimed that, rural industries, which now produce 90 per cent, of our export income; could not be expected to get us out of oui balance of payments situation.. He said tliat they were meeting strong competition abroad and that, while wool and wheat, were being sold at some profit abroad, we could, not. extend the market for. wool and wheat without damaging that market. He therefore claimed that we should have more protection for our industries here. We all agree that industries in Australia can makea tremendous' contribution to solving the present problems, but they must be efficient industries which will require tariff protection only for the first few years in order to enable them to get going. They must not expect tariff, protection to, keep them going beyond that time, because that would raise costs and affect our export industries, which are now in difficulty. In June,. 1952, Dr. Strong made a statement which I . regard as important. He spoke of the genesis of the crisis in food production. Addressing the Economic Society of Australia and New Zealand, he saidA programme of industrial development becomes unbalanced when the truly basic industries which provide the primary support for our national' incoine and our export income are starved for material resources and man-power. Honourable members w ill recall that in 1952, as a result of tbe war, of tbe Labour Government's policy and all this false planning and starting of ambitious projects which could not be finished, we were short of coal and steel in particular. Coal and steel are essential for the production of agricultural machinery and for the transport to carry agricultural products. That is to say, they are essential to our primary industries, which produce the greater part of our export income. Dr. Strong continuedThis raises the point of what are truly hasic made for that year. Government supindustries.

The Australian Government has to suffer the odium of raising money by taxation, but the States just come to Canberra and ask for the amount they think they need and the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) is so human, generous and decent that he cannot resist what he believes to be their just demands. As a consequence of these arrangements, there is financial irresponsibility among the States of Australia. The many demands that have been made for a reform of Commonwealth and State financial relationships are well founded, and we in this Parliament should do what we can to see that the States are made responsible for raising the money that they spend. If we do not take some action along those lines, the States will continually increase their demands for money, and waste more and more of it to the detrimeut of both the taxpayer and the country. Moreover, this type of financial irresponsibility increases costs within the community. High wages are not the cause of our high cost of living, but the consequence of it. In saying that, I except the foolish judgment of Mr Justice Foster who added a £1 a week permanently to certain wage3 as what he called a "" prosperity loading "". because of the high price of wool. I have heard people say that if the workers would work au additional four hours a week, or take less money for their work, we would soon ameliorate our cost difficulty. But it is obvious that tbe escalator wage increases under our arbitration legislation have beeu caused by high costs, and, therefore, the wages that are at present being paid are a consequence of high costs rather than a cause of them. Thi3 Parliament, which will rise in two or three weeks, should tell the Government that it must consider our financial problems, particularly those concerned with outbalance of payments and our costs of produetion. At this stage, it, is pertinent to consider certain remarks made during a debate in the New South ""Wales Legislative Council, initiated by Sir Norman Kater when he was retiring from the service of that body. Mr J. J. Maloney, a Minister of the New South Wales Labour Government, saidNo responsible trade unionist or trade union leader in Australia would disagree with the need for a reduction of costs. In my experience, the complaint of trade unionists has always been that costs are too high. The policy of the trade union movement for a considerable time has been to increase production, and ever since it came into being in Australia its policy has been a fair day's work ""for a fair day's pay and that policy has never altered. It has been reported that recently thu British trade union movement sent delegates to America to investigate the reasons for the high American standard of living, and why the productivity of American industry is so great. No doubt as a result of the investigations of those delegates, one of the great motor plants in England is now putting in an automotion line, by which automobiles will be manufactured almost wholly by machinery in huge factories which will be attended by one or two men. Therefore, honourable members will perceive that the British trade union movement is attempting to reduce costs. The Australian trade union movement would greatly benefit Australia if it attempted to do the same, and. incidentally, follow the principles laid down by Mr Maloney. I now desire to refer to the work that is being done on the Australian waterfront. Ship loading rates have been falling for a number of years. Figures compiled in about 1952 indicate that for the Port of Sydney interstate trips were reduced from 4,500 in 1928-29 to about 2,000 in 1949-50. able member's time has expired. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Fawkner) [9.50] I wish to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the Standing Orders to make some reference during the Supply debate to present events in Victoria, and to the events which led to some members of the Labour party sitting in this corner of the House. However, before doing so, I should like to make reference to one or two points that were raised by the honourable member for",60,Defence
226,Mr Speakee,"Order! The honorMacarthur ,( Mr Jeff Bate). touched ou ione of the real anomalies in our economy when he pointed out that many young people experience great difficulty in obtaining finance with which to buy a home, but no difficulty at all in obtaining consumer .goods for that home, such as refrigerators, washing machines, and radio sets. The correction of that anomaly is one of the most serious matters to which we could direct our minds. As a result of the operations of hire purchase companies, unlimited funds seem to be available for the purchase of these goods. These mammoth organizations, which have grown up in the last few years, seem to have tremendous funds at their disposal and seem, because of the high interest rates that they offer, to be attracting all the money available for investment. The Australian Guarantee Corporation Limited, one of the largest hire purchase companies in Victoria, is issuing £2,000,000 worth of first mortgage debentures. Just a few months ago it obtained another £3,000,000 from the public by way of mortgage debentures. Thus, it has obtained £5,000,000 from the public in the last few months. It is unfortunate that very little has been done to remedy this anomaly. It is high time that this Government did something about it, so that young people could buy homes on a small deposit. It is noteworthy that the ColemanBarry section of the Victorian Labour party has directed its attention to this very real and pressing problem. In the policy which it has placed before the people of Victoria it has set out positive and constructive methods of making available additional finance so that the average person may purchase that basic necessity, a home. A positive plan has been drawn up, largely as a result of the efforts of the energetic and capable young State member for Ivanhoe, Mr Ludy, and it is clear that the Coleman-Barry section will be able to do something pracessentially a body democratically contical, and provide finance for people who wish to purchase their homes. The same group has made another revolutionary advance in this field. Mr who are primarily responsible for send-Barry, in his policy speech, made-for the first time in this country-reference Mr W. M. Bourke. He to a home advisory centre -which would advise young people in the handling .of what is, in most cases, the largest financial transaction of their lifetime. The home advisory centre would provide an architect .and a master builder and they could advise intending home owners on how to obtain materials and finance. The home advisory centre might go a littlefurther and provide practical assistance for people who are building their own homes. In the newer suburbs of Melbourne, and probably in other parts of Australia also, energetic and capable young people may be seen overcoming lack of funds by knuckling down and carrying out a co-operative building effort. They include many new arrivals in this country and deserve the greatest commendation for their initiative and enterprise. They are making a worthwhile contribution to the community life of Australia. This revolutionary change, which Mr Barry and Mr Coleman have promised the people of Victoria, should be taken a little further, and follow the practice, in some Scandinavian countries, of building with government assistance. Such a centre could provide plans and detailed technical advice which woulcl help the amateur to build his own home. I should like now to refer to the reasons why we seven members of the Labour party are now sitting in the corner, why we have repudiated the blight of Evattism, ancl why we are carrying on here representing what we claim is the true and legitimate Labour party in Victoria. I think it is generally acknowledged that the Labour party has, in the course of its service to the people of this country, built up some fine traditions. One of these traditions, which was both attractive and a source of strength, was that it was a democratically controlled body. Until recent events in Victoria, the Labour party wasI use the past tense of the verb deliberatelytrolled by the rank and file, the ordinary members, those unnamed heroes who do all the hard work during elections and ing Labour members .to this House.

It was from that demogone conclusion. The federal executive cratic form of control, which existed in of the Australian Labour party has split the past, that the Labour party really and wrecked the party in Victoria. The derived its strength. In Victoria, the democratically elected Saturday, and I have no doubt that the State executive, which was elected at the people will express, in a very definite annual State conference of the Labour manner, their very strong disapproval of party last year, was summarily dismissed what has been done. In addition to from office some time ago.

Under the new procedure, there was no need for those people to be members of the Labour party. The federal executive, without authority, suspended that vital and important rule and said, ""Non-members of the party can sit"". In addition, the federal executive allowed unfinancial unions to send delegates to the conference. conference took the bit between its teeth Tbat was another step to ensure that the little group of left-wing militant unions would have undoubted and complete control of tbe new State executive, regardless of the wishes of the rank and file Labour supporters. unionists voted. Mr W. M . BOUEKE -On e of the members of the federal executive, who also sits on the Australian Council of Trades Unions, is not a trade-unionist. Although public attention was drawn to that fact, he steadfastly refused to join a union in Western Australia and, as far as I know, he still persists in his refusal to do so. We see the series of events. The rules were disregarded. A vital rule regarding membership of the Australian Labour party was thrown overboard. Unfinancial unions such as tbe Clothing Trades Union in Victoria were allowed to send delegates to the conrefuse to bow to the introduction of ference. Unions such as the Australian Workers Union, which has disaffiliated from the Australian Labour party, were allowed to reaffiliate at a moment's notice so that they could send delegates to the conference. Let me show the House what a farce was this special conference which elected the new Cain-Stout executive in Victoria and is now proceeding to wreck the Labour party. The Waterside Workers Federation, a Communist controlled organization in Victoria, sent delegates to tions that had previously prevailed in the the special conference. Those delegates were elected, not by the rank-and-file members of the federation, but by the Communist-controlled executive. A Communist body appointed and sent delegates to the Australian Labour party conference. But that was too hot for Mr Chamberlain, Mr Lovegrove and the credentials committee. They said, "" That is too hot altogether. We will not admit the six delegates appointed by the Communist executive of the Waterside Workers Federation"". They recommended that the conference should not admit those delegates, but the conference had got out of hand at that stage. The moderate people and the responsible people who were there to give it the cloak of respectability had lost control. The and accepted the delegates appointed by tbe Communist executive of the Waterside Workers Federation, in defiance of the recornmendaiton of the credentials committee. I have mentioned those matters to show was why nonthat the new Evatt-Stout-Cain executive in Victoria was brought into being as the result of a deliberate tearing-up of the rules, democratic traditions and constitution of the Australian Labour party. I put it to the House that that is a clear example of the use of totalitarian methods. It is a clear illustration also of the fact that a democratic body, such as the Australian Labour party in Victoria was, is being corroded and corrupted and whiteanted by totalitarian methods. It was essentially in the interests of this country that some people should resist these actions and make a stand on the principles of decency, justice, honesty, democracy and constitutional procedure, and totalitarian methods into what was once a great democratic institution. But that is not the whole story. The old, democratically elected executive was improperly dismissed, and, in addition, was denied the right of appeal to what amounts, in the Australian Labour party organization, to the high court of that body, the federal conference of the Australian Labour party. That was another flagrant disregard of fundamental principles and decency and democratic tradiAustralian Labour party. When the federal executive members walked into Victoria and ""sacked"" the old executive, the latter said, in effect, "" If you allege these things and you want to dismiss us, let us appeal to the highest tribunal in the Australian Labour party, the conference which is to be held at Hobart soon, and",64,Defence
227,Mr Keon,"Thatwe w ill be glad to accept the decision of that body "". That was a f a ir and democratic attitude; but these gentlemen decided that they had to deprive the old, legitimate Victorian Australian Labour party executive of even the opportunity of appeal, and they moved the date of the federal conference to a date subsequent to that upon which the new executive was brought into being. Thereby they effectively denied to the old Victorian executive the right of appeal which is laid down in the Australian Labour party constitution as a fundamental right in disputes of this kind. It is interesting to note in that regard that in certain litigation which took place in Victoria as a result of these matters, when Mr Woodhouse, one of the members of the Victorian central executive, was improperly and unconstitutionally dismissed from office and initiated certain legal proceedings which came before His Honour, Mr Justice Martin, in the Supreme Court of Victoriai n February last, H is Honour, in the course of a lengthy judgment, referred in a shocked tone to this denial of this right of appeal to these people who had been improperly dismissed. What the learned judge said in this connection is worth quoting. No one could suggest that he was in any way an interested party to these proceedings. His Honour saidSince, as I have said, the present delegates to Federal Conference were appointed by the Victorian annual conference and are not involved in any way with the acts or omissions of the Central Executive, the only feasible explanation of the resolutions to withdraw them and to substitute others chosen by the Special Conference and to postpone the Federal Conference until that has been done seems to be to deny the Central Executive the appeal which the rules provide them until it is too late to be effective. Those are very significant words from the learned judge-that the effect of these things seemed to h i m to deny the Central Executive thc appeal which thc rules provide them until it is too late to hc effective. In another part of the judgment, H is Honour said[ feci that a great injustice has been done to the Plaintiff by the resolutions postponing the annual conference of the Federal body and calling for the election of new Victorian delegates to that conference by the special conference. Those were important matters.' They involved the denial of natural justice; and the complete overthrow of constitutional and democratic procedure by a body which, in the past, prided itself upon its democratic procedure. As .1 mentioned previously, these matters were of such a serious nature that responsible people in the community could not allow them to go unchallenged in the light of the fate of other countries which enjoyed democratic rule until they became whiteanted and corroded by communism. I refer to some of those splendid little democratic countries of Eastern Europe, such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Czechoslovakia, which had a fine democratic tradition and enjoyed democratic institutions but which are now ground down under the heel of Soviet tyranny and w i th every vestige of principle and every right of choice to decide how to live and govern themselves all gone. I put to the House that those conditions have gone as the result of tbe introduction of totalitarian methods in those countries. I say also that it is important that the beginnings of those totalitarian methods, the first steps whereby the foundations of democracy are white-anted and undermined, are the vital steps which have to be resisted. I am confident that the people of Victoria respect and w ill support the attitude of members of the Labour party in that State and will not tolerate or support in any way the introduction of these totalitarian and undemocratic methods in the Labour party, I am certain thai the people of Victoria w ill support the stand which has been taken by members who sit in this corner of the House and by the Coleman-Barry group in their State.

That purpose was achieved. It was to set up a new executive of the Labour party in Victoria, a body dominated by .a little group of left wing militant unionists, who are all practising Marxists. They are the people who control and dominate the new Stout-Cain executive in Victoria, although there are some moderate members attached to that body. But those few people, whose names are respected, provide only a veneer of respectability. The real and effective c-ontrol of the new Stout-Cain Australian Labour party executive in Victoria rests with this little group of militan t Marxists, Communist rag who will determine the direction in which Australian Labour party policy will go in that State, because they are people who. unfortunately for the Labour party, have been recognized as members of the group which, in this House, sit behind the right bonorable member for Barton. member's theme song. Mr W. M . BOURKE -It may be, but this is a most important matter. I can understand the honourable member for St. George not being happy about having the facts placed before him. The honourable member's time has expired. Earlier to-day this House witnessed the spectacle of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-o r perhaps I should call him the acting leader, in the absence of the right honourable :member for Barton (Dr. Evatt)using this bill as a vehicle -to conduct <t smear campaign against two worthy citizens of Australia, who, I am happy and proud to say, subscribe to the policy of bhe Australian Country party. In orderto smear those two gentlemen, the honourable member for Melbourne, -who claims to abhor the Communists more than does any other man in Australia, used a Communist publication as his authority. When we look at that publication, we find Wben this how despicable and how untruthful are some of the statements it contains. Why is the honourable member for Melbourne conducting such a campaign? The answer, I think, is very clear. It is because he is adhering to the policy adopted by the Leader of the Opposition and determined originally by a non-unionist gentleman outside this Parliament. That gentleman has been referred to by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M . Bourke). The honourable member for Melbourne has placed himself in a position from which it is mos-' diflicult to extricate himself. I repeat that he has used this Supply Bill as a vehicle to smear two gentlemen who have not the opportunity to reply to him in this chamber. What do we find ? This member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) says, it is the bible of the honourable member for Melbourne. It claims that a Mr Allnutt, a former member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Mildura, and a respected leader of the Australian Country party, joined in the criticism of the Government. I am most reliably informed that Mr Allnutt has not lived in that part of Victoria for a considerable number of years; that he has never belonged to the SwanH ill branch of the Australian Country party; and that he is not the president of the party in that area as this rag claims. The honourable member for Melbourne also used this publication as his authority to drag through the dust the name of one of the finest men in the wheat-growing industry in Anstralia. I refer to MrH . K. Nock. The honourable member said that Mr Nock had been at a meeting with Jim Healey, the notorious waterside",68,Defence

I am more than surprised that the honourable member for Melbourne should adopt this attitude, particularly when i e has repeatedly, to your own personal knowledge, Mr Deputy .Speaker, claimed 'in this House-and outside of it-that his abhorrence of communism is as great, if not greater, than that of any other person in Australia.

Because of his adherence to the policy laid down by Mr was during the war. I am not going into Chamberlain, a non-unionist, and by the right honourable member for Barton, he now finds himself in a position from which he cannot extricate himself.

In the final analysis, the inauguration of that scheme was held up for nine .months. The honourable member stated that £3,600,<000 had been spent by the Labour Government on defence; hutwhen we tried to nail him down, by way of interjection, as to how that was spent, he brushed the matter aside. 'The only time that money could liave been spent a discussion of defence expenditure during the war, -but if that figure relates to war expenditure, there is every reason why is should have been spent.

That was the time when one of the honourable member's colleagues, now the honourable member for Lalor( Mr tion. The proof of the pudding is in the Pollard), stated that he would not give a threepenny bit towards the defence programme, and that comment was supported by the whole rank and file of the Australian Labour party. They fought the government of the day in all its moves to get the defence programme under way. Let us look at the figures and see how much money was expended. I have looked through the budget papers for the years from 1946 to the present day. When the honourable member for Melbourne referred to sums of £1,000,000,000 and £1,500,000,000, he was lumping together the whole of the expenditure on the services, including expenditure in connection with defence production, and war and repatriation services. sums of money which had been expended on the defence programme, as he would have the House believe. The honourable gentleman, in his research, did not take the trouble to check thosefigures,because the actual position is that in the years between 1946 and 1950, the Labour Government expended £329,000,000 on defence, including the services connected with the forces. This present Government, including the estimate for the current year of £200,000,000, will have expended £763,000,000 on defence. If honourable members opposite want to lump the whole of the expenditure together, as the honourable member for Melbourne did earlier, it will be found that this Government has expended £500,000,000 more than the previous Labour Government exnended between the years 1946 and 1949, the years in which Labour was defeated. ment got for it? something better than the Labour Government had. Going back into the past, I find that General Blarney, as he then was, as Chief of Staff, and other heads of the services, as late as March, 1949, told the government of the day, and also the people, that our defences I do not care who were in a shocking state. Nevertheless, the government of the day did not l if t a finger to do anything about the posieating. When this Government endeavoured, soon after its election to office, to introduce national service with the idea of training a reserve of men for defence, the Labour party refused to support it. The hostile, Labour-dominated Senate held up the Government's legislation, as I said earlier, for sixteen weeks, until the members of the Opposition in this Parliament were advised by their bosses outside to support the legislation. Their lack of support in the early stages had the effect of holding up the defence programme for a period of nine months in all. I thought that it was rather strange that the honourable member for Melbourne should have picked on the subject of They were not defence in this debate. I was expecting him to deal with repatriation, or some such subject. The records show that when the Labour party had the opportunity, during that wonderful golden age which they talk about, to do something for the defence of the country, they did absolutely nothing. In the first year after this Government came to office, it raised defence expenditure from £40,000,000 to £1S0,000,000. tion of the currency? into consideration, if the honourable member wishes, but working on the Labour party's own figures, it will be found that the record of this Government, in relation to defence expenditure, is far better than that of the Labour Government in the four years between 1945 and 1949. orable member is referring to the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt).

During the past two or three years it has been the aim of the Government to encourage trade missions to visit the Far-East Asian countries with a view to increasing trade where trade is already established, or to look for new markets where none exist at present. I have had the pleasure of talking with the members of some of tbose missions and they have told me that one of the big problems, as far as South-East Asia, particularly, is concerned, is finance. Importers in those countries who wish to buy our goods are not able to meet the terms that the Australian exporters see fit to lay down. I have in mind the case of a big firm in Thailand which acted as agent for the Thai Government. It wanted five-year terms, but the Australian manufacturer concerned could not see his way clear to grant such terms. I understand that there is in England an organization known as the Export Credits Guarantee Department, which Ls conducted by the British Government. I have not bad much opportunity to study this matter, and the only literature I have looked at. has been a very small booklet, but it appears that tbe British Government has a scheme whereby exporters are guaranteed against any fall in the currency of the importing country owing to internal trouble, or market restrictions that may be applied, and other matters that may concern very seriously the exporter, should the position in relation to the market country change after the mailing of the agreement. I understand that the Australian Government is considering this matter. Thp sooner a decision is reached, the better it will be, particularly for some of our secondary exporting industries. As we all know, so far as the Australian primary industries are concerned, a branch of the Commonwealth Bank makes advances to primary producers, hut nothing along the same lines is provided for the assistance of the secondary industries. Those industries must rely wholly on the financial arrangements which they are able to make with organizations, such as insurance companies and private banks. I hope that the Government will give this matter if it is able to help the exporters, it will make an announcement in that respect as soon as possible. The practice that has been followed by the British Government over a period of years should be an example for us to work out a formula. I do not propose to take advantage of the scope given in this debate to refer to some of the matters that have been dealt with by honourable members opposite. freights ? be handled quite well by the people who are dealing with it.

I s it a fact that approximately six small coal-mines in the Newcastle-Cardiff area have closed down and that 500 to 1,000 mine workers have been thrown out of employment? 2. Isi t a fact that the then chairman of tlie Joint Coal Board (the late Sir Norman Mighell) adopted a policy during the period of World War II . of mixing the Greta series of coal with tbe Newcastle or Borehcle ieam of coal, and that, by this method an adequate supply of coal was kept up for war purposes and all minewovkers kept in employment? 3. W ill he direct the Joint Coal Board to adopt this policy of mixing the Greta scries of coal with the Borehole seam of coal in order to re-open these closed mines and also to conserve the valuable Greta series of gas and oil coal? 4. I s it anticipated that in 30 years the Greta series w i ll be exhausted leaving only the Borehole seam which was the only coal used prior to the exploitation of the Greta coal in 1901? N a t i o n a l Development has f u r n is h e d t h e f o l l o w in g replies to the honourable member's questions:1. Six small coal-mines in the Cardiff area of the Newcastle field recently closed due to lack of trade. Approximately 90 men were displaced tlie majority of whom have since started work in other mines in the district. Every effort is being made to find employment for tlie remainder of the displaced men who desire to continue in the coal-mining industry. There is ample scope for their employment in other industries. 2 and 3. Coals from the Newcastle and Cessnock districts have been and are being mixed from time to time for bunkering purposes and to meet other orders. The extent to which it is possible for coals to be marketed as a mixture depends at any time both upon the availability of the coals and the coal quality and type required by the consumer.",73,Shipping

261,Mr Casey,"The Minister foi4. It is not possible to accurately forecast tlie life of mining in the Greta seams but large tonnages in solid and pillar ooal and in virgin areas still remain to be extracted. senting the Minister for National Development, upon notice1. Is it a fact that geochemical prospecting techniques are being used by the Bureau of Mineral Resources for mineral prospecting in certain areas in Australia? 2. In what areas has this type of prospecting cation in other areas. In 1954, geochemical been carried out and have successful results been obtained to date? National Development has furnished the following replies to the honourable member's questions:1. Yes. Geochemical prospecting has been carried out by the Bureau of Mineral Resources since Dr. Sokoloff of the United States Geological Survey made geochemical investigations on some Australian mineral fields in 1948 and 1949. This work was sponsored by the bureau, the South Australian Mines Department and Zinc Corporation. 2. Geochemical surveys by the bureau have been carried out principally in the Northern Territory. In 1950, at Brock's Creek zones the surface and low-grade mineralization wag found at depth by drilling . Geochemical testing was of value here in quickly locating the most favorable sections of a mineralized outcrop. In 1953 and 1954, surveys were made over areas of known and suspected uranium mineralization. Both plants and soils were sampled and a technique established for applimethods were used at the Namoona lead prospect in the Northern Territory and these were instrumental in rapidly delineating a long Minister for zone of lead mineralization which was largely under soil cover. Further work w ill be required before an assessment of the prospect can be made, but there is no doubt thc survey was a success. In 1952, a geochemical survey near Mount Isa, Queensland, was successful in narrowing down the area of interest on a long line of generally low-grade lead and copper mineralization. An area of previously unsuspected mineralization was also located.",74,Praser Asked The Post 1953 Two 1954 Four Since The 1st July
