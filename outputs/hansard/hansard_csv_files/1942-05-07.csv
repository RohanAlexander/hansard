COAL-MINING INDUSTRY. Minister read in to-day's Sydney Morning Herald the report that the seventh stoppage on the northern coal-ifields since the visit of the Minister for Labour and National Service, just over a fortnight ago, occurred yesterday, when the Millfield-Greta miners, for the fourth time in ten days, went on strike? Has the right honourable gentleman seen the further report that 'the secretary of Northern Collieries Limited has forwarded to the Coal Commissioner the names of the Millfield-Greta strikers, with the request that action be taken against them under the National Security regulations which render them liable for labour service under military discipline? What attitude will the Government adopt towards this request? next week a complete statement covering the whole of the coal situation. The Government knows what IB occurring on the coal-fields. A report in regard to Millfield came before the federal executive of Australian Coal and Shale Employees Federation at its meeting yesterday. That is the executive government of the union throughout Australia! It ordered the men to resume work. I am that the men did not commence work. The federation was to have dealt further with the matter this morning.

Another mine has ceased to produce today because the men insist that means shall be provided which would enable them to enter the adjoining mine in the event of a shaft in the mine being so damaged hy an air raid as to make it impossible for them to escape from it. Some little time ago, the workers employed in the mine which it was proposed to enter objected to this being done, on the ground that it was contrary to the mining law of New South Wales. That is correct. Those are the only mines which to-day are not working because of what may be described as industrial disputes. I am conscious of all the difficulties, and understand the situation thoroughly. I accept the responsibility of the Government to obtain supplies of coal. In respect of that aspect of the matter, I have to say that more coal has been produced during each week since I acted in the matter than was produced during any week in the previous ten years, f ask the House and the country to bear with me. I am doing my very best, and my best is not inferior to the best that any one else has done. for Commerce been informed of the decision of the High Court of Australia, given to-day, under which a sum of £320 was awarded to a plaintif named Tonking against the Apple ?-.d Pear Board, being the difference between what was paid to the plaintiff by the board and what was obtained by the board from the sale of his fruit?

The whole matter will be fully considered, and a decision made at a. later date. ney paily Telegraph published an article workers, and whether the Premier of that dealing with the advisability of amending State, Mr Playford, said that the only the Defence Act along the lines discussed material condition was that sales tax in this House last week. Is the Prime should not he charged in respect of the Minister aware that a censorship instruction was given that no issue of the Sydney Daily Telegraph of yesterday's date was to be sent overseas by the proprietors? Was that a ministerial instruction? If given by the censor, under what authority did he act? In either event, for what purpose was it given? not the result of any decision by me. There has not been any interference with the censor in the discharge of his duties. I shall ask that gentleman why he issued the instruction, and I have not the least doubt that he will furnish an adequate reason. statement published in the press a few days ago, that 153,000,000 bushels of wheat had been received into the No. 5 pool, will the Minister for Commerce state whether that quantity will participate in the £26,750,000 guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government, thus reducing the uet price received by the growers; in other words, making the estimate of total cost approximately ls. 4d. a bushel? made available under a guarantee given by a previous government to cover 140,000,000 bushels. The quantity received has been greater than had been estimated. The distribution of the amount of the guarantee over the 153,000,000 bushels received into the pool would considerably reduce the guaranteed return per bushel. The whole matter will be reviewed by the Government, and a decision will be reached with regard to the excess quantity of 13,000,000 bushels.

Was that condition refused, and why was such a discrimination' made between States? made for the construction of 500 houses for munitions workers in South Australia. Some of the houses were to be built by the State Government and some were to be erected on behalf of the Commonwealth Government through the Workers' Mousing Trust in South Australia. A request was made by Mr Playford that i lie Commonwealth sales tax legislation should be amended so that tax would not be collectable in respect of the materials necessary for the building of those bouses: The Government pointed out to Mr Playford that, if he desired to obtain exemption from sales tax in respect of the materials, as in the case of the Victorian Housing Board, all he had to do was to secure an amendment of the State Act which specifically declares that the Workers' Housing Trust in South Australia is not a Government body. If that trust were declared by law to be a government body, no sales tax would be chargeable on the ford refused to do that, hut asked that Section 74 of the Commonwealth Sales Tax Act be amended to exempt from -=ales tax charges a body which was specifically declared in the South Australian act to be not a government body. The Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) wrote to Mr Playford, stating that the Government was not prepared to amend Section 74 in the direction desired by him. He said that such action would involve the remission of the sales tax now being paid hy several semi-governmental bodies, and therefore he could not agree to the exemption from sales tax of materials purchased by one body in South Australia. As the Government was anxious to have these houses built, the Prime Minister told Mr Playford that, although sales tax would be collected as provided in the act, the Commonwealth Government would rebate to the Government of South Australia, or to the housing trust in that State, the full amount of sales tax chargeable on the materials required. Therefore, the houses could have been urected without any alteration of either Commonwealth or South Australian law, if Mr Playford had been prepared to accept the Prime Ministers offer. Since then a review of the position in South Australia and other States has shown that sufficient labour and materials are not available for a full-scale housing scheme, and, in consequence, it has been decided that it will be necessary in all States, except Tasmania, to erect temporary accommodation for munition workers. for the Army)-by leave-Yesterday the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) asked a question regarding the number of Australian soldiers engaged in. Java, Amboina and Timor, who had noi been accounted for, and whether the next of kin had keen supplied with any particulars regarding them. I am now in a position to advise the honourable member that it is not in the public interest to disclose information as to the number of Australian personnel still unaccounted for in these areas. The names of missing personnel, however, in accordance with advice sent from General Head-quarters to District Records Oifices, are to be communicated to next-of-kin, and it is anticipated that, if letters of advice have not yet reached the next-of-kin they should arrivewithin the next few days. In the meantime, next-of-kin have been requested to forward particulars to 'General Headquarters of any information whatevei which may be received by them from any source. It is hoped by this means to gain some information of value to supplement or verify the results of official investigations which arc being made. Steps have also been taken to obtain statements from all personnel who have escaped from enemy-occupied territory, and this information also is communicated to District Records Oifices for transmission to next-of-kin.

"" BROWN-OUT REGULATIONS. Minister read the statement in the Melbourne Herald following the announcement that a report was to be submitted to the Prime Minister by the Commander-inChief of the Allied Land Forces, south-west Pacific area, with regard to brownout conditions, that some relaxation of the conditions will be authorized? In view of the conflict that exists between the statement by the Minister for Home Security and the action taken by the State authorities, will the Prime Minister make a statement to the House setting out clearly the Commonwealth Government's wishes on this matter? under consideration for some time, and the whole of the arrangements between the States and the Commonwealth have been made as the result of the decisions reached in the interests of security. Them has been a re-assessment of the measures that are required to effect that purpose. The Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Land Forces in Australia has furnished a report to the Government. It has just been received, and it is under consideration. The States have been asked to do, and the Minister for Home Security directs that they shall do, only those things which the military authorities regard as essential for civil protection. stated that brown-outs are instituted in each State upon the advice of the military authorities whose directions are conveyed to the State authorities by the Minister for Home Security. I should like to know whether the State authorities consult with the military authorities in the respective States as to the degree of brown-out considered to be necessary. In Victoria, brown-out conditions are wasteful, unnecessarily irksome and dangerous. man certainly did more than to ask a question on this matter. I can only say that we have just received a report upon the subject from the Commander of tin; Allied Land Forces. ties in the respective States confer with the State authorities as to the degree of brown-out? plained that what has been done has been as the result of directions given by the military authorities to the Minister for Home Security and communicated by the Minister to the State Premiers. We came to the conclusion that this matter should be reconsidered, but only by the man most competent to deal with the matter. He has now done so, and the Government will give effect to his report at the earliest opportunity. grave and urgent need of aluminium, can the Minister for Supply and Development indicate whether, and when, the high-grade and valuable deposits of bauxite in Tasmania will be developed? several occasions that the progress possible in the development of bauxite deposits in Australia for the production of aluminium is dependent on the quantity of the necessary equipment that can be obtained from overseas. making much headway in getting equipment. the secretary of the Department of Supply, who went to Washington, regarded the getting of this equipment as one of his special jobs. I do not think that we can do more in the way of pressing our claims. I remind the honourable member that we are confronted with many difficulties, particularly in regard to obtaining electrical equipment necessary for the production of aluminium. Frankly, this equipment is not obtainable. ibut I want to know what progress is being made. taken to obtain additional rolling machinery for the plant already in Sydney.

If so, will the Minister have an expert investigation made in order to determine whether it is possible, by means of Dr. Murphy's formula, to recover aluminium in commercial quantities? the statement, but, as the demand for aluminium is so great, I shall have an investigation made. CO-ORDINATION OF WAR ister observed that the British Government has now followed .the example ol the Government of the United States of America by setting up a directorate of production with a view to co-ordinating effort and expediting war production? If so, will the Pgime Minister consider the exploits of the Royal Australian Air setting up of a similar organization in Australia ? Will he state whether the direction which he recently gave with a view to increasing the authority of the Sydney Area Board of Management in regard to 1 payments for war contracts has been acted upon in accordance with the recommendation of the Joint Committee on War Expenditure? According to my Information, nothing has yet been done in the matter, and Mr Nixon, in Melbourne, still retains control over such payments, thus hampering production. honourable member has said, that the Governments of the United States of America and of the United Kingdom have set up production authorities quite recently, all I can say is that such an authority waa appointed by the Commonwealth Government a considerable time ago. The matter is under the direction of a production executive consisting of a group of Cabinet Ministers who have officers working under their authority.

If the Commonwealth Government will not buy the entire crop, what will become of the surplus? Supply agreed to purchase 6,000 tons of blue peas next year at 15s, a bushel. That is the only undertaking which, to my knowledge, has been given. that the Minister for Commerce had announced that the whole crop would be purchased by the Commonwealth. monwealth Government has agreed to buy 6,000 tons, that decision should not be interpreted as implying that it wishes the crop to be restricted to that quantity.

I am now in a position to advise the honourable member that no person is National enlisted in a unit of the Australian Military Forces, including labour units, unless the military authorities are fully satisfied that he is a fit and proper person to serve therein, and that no risk to the safety of the nation is involved in his service in the forces.

GOLD MINING INDUSTRY. MAN-POWER IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA. War Organization of Industry) -by leave -The Government has decided upon the policy it intends to apply to the goldcountry generally will support the Gomining industry in Australia, and I take this opportunity to inform the House and the country so that those concerned may know what lies ahead of them. The Government's decision has not been taken without full inquiry into every aspect of the matter. I was deputed by the Prime Minister to visit Western Australia, and to confer with the Government of that State, the representatives of the mine-owner3, the employees in the industry, and any others whose interests would be affected. All the points advanced by the various parties mentioned were fully considered by the Government before a final determination of policy was sessional period before last, I approached reached. The paramount consideration, however, must, be the most effective use of the nation's man-power in the prosecution on the gold-mining industry. During tion of the war. Because of this, I now announce, first, that no protection can be confidential facts concerning the future given to the industry from the call-up for of that important industryI say "" i m military service of men directly or indirectly engaged therein. Exemptions on a very limited scale of key men responsible for maintenance of safety in the mines will continue. Secondly, the indusStates. In Western Australia, goldtry must be prepared to have withdrawn from it, for service in connection with allied works projects, a proportion of the men remaining after military requireotherwise exist. Because of this I was ments have 'been satisfied. Whether this proportion will be large or small depends, disclosed to me by the Treasurer. first upon the scale on which these projects are developed, and, secondly, upon the extent to which labour can be released from other non-essential activities to meet the requirements. The method of withdrawing these men will be a matter for consultation with the mine owners and the union so as to ensure that as little disturbance as possible is caused to the industry. I want to pay a special tribute to the attitude adopted by the workers in the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is connected. The Australian Workers Union informed me, categorically, that the retention of men in the mines was, for them, a question of secondary importance in the present crisis; that they supported wholeheartedly the Government's proposal to use the man-power in the mines in the way which would most effectively secure the successful prosecution of the war. I hope that the House and the vernment's proposals in the same spirit that the workers in the industry have done. I lay on the table the following paper:Ministerial Statement of Policy in relation to tlie Gold-mining Industry. I welcome very much the statement by the Minister for War Organization of Industry particularly because of the effect of the many vague statements thai have been made recently regarding the future welfare of the gold-mining industry. While in Canberra during the the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) on taxation matters, and discussed the effect of taxathat interview, I was informed of some portant "" because it is to-day the major industry in Western Australia, although if cannot be compared with the gold-mining industries of the other mining has been responsible for the establishment and maintenance of many important towns which could not deeply impressed with the information I had three courses open to me as the member representing the constituency of Kalgoorlie.

81,Mr Johnson (Kalgoorlie),"by leavethat attitude I should have received wideSoads Board, the local governing bodies, spread support. I had 110 doubt, however, that my duty lay in taking the unpopular attitude with the people concerned, and in advising them'that there was every possibility of the gold-mining industry being called upon in the near future to release the major portion of its man-power for defence works. Having made up my mind to take that attitude, I went to see the Prime Minister before I left Canberra. I said to him, "" I have been given some information of a most important nature affecting the gold-mining industry. How much of it can I use ?"" The Prime Minister's reply to me was, "" You will not be using the press or the radio, and when you are talking to responsible people tell them the truth "". I carried out that advice. I met the executive of the miners' union on the night I arrived in Kalgoorlie, and representatives of the Chamber of Mines the next day, and of local governing bodies and various organizations that evening. The persons I saw were representative of Kalgoorlie and Boulder municipalities, and of all the people affected. I explained fully to them, as far as I was able, the position of this country. I said that the defence authorities were calling out for every man that could be made available. "" To-morrow I stressed, ""may be too late. Efforts have to be made, and they must be made immediately "". I had to appeal to miners who were receiving substantial wages to give up their mining work and to leave their wives and families in order to work in the labour corps for the basic wage. Both the men and the Chamber of Mines unanimously responded, ancl I have yet to believe that the chamber has repudiated the promise given to me that morning. I met the full executive of the Chamber of Mines at Kalgoorlie, and representatives of the men throughout the mining towns. Later decisions, I understand, have been made by the chamber, but not by its full executive. I am sure that the chamber will never repudiate the undertaking given to me. I was careful throughout the campaign to see that no politics were introduced. T approached every section of the community. My telegrams convening meetings were sent to the chairman of the [34] and the union, appealing to them to cooperate so that there would be representative meetings to hear my story. I did the job throughout the Kalgoorlie electorate. On my return to Perth, I met the available members of the State Parliament who represent the goldmining districts, and they, too, agreed to co-operate. My task had been done, and in every centre I had visited the meetings carried resolutions, not only unanimously, but also enthusiastically, instructing the chairman of the meeting to telegraph to the Prime Minister that "" This centre is behind you in any effort that has for its object the defence of this country"". The whole of the industry displayed a co-operative spirit, and showed that it was prepared to help by coming to the country's call, despite any sacrifices that might have to be made. The miners realized that the call was to them, and they showed in every place I visited that they were ready to obey. After the work had been done, Senator Allan MacDonald, who had not been out of Perth and had not worked in the industry, went to Kalgoorlie, but at no inconvenience to himself, for he got off the train on his way from Perth to Canberra. He said, "" This will spell ruin to the gold-mining industry. Your towns will collapse, one after another. You must fight against this demand. You must protest against the Government taking any men out of the mines "". That was a very easy attitude for any one to adopt. I could have filled the role of the hero of the hour, but it was not my purpose to do that. My duty was to do something in the interests of this country, and I did it. I resent the attitude of Senator Allan MacDonald in going to Kalgoorlie. He was responsible for a deputation that went to Perth to endeavour to get the unions and the Trades and Labour Council for Kalgoorlie district to co-operate with him, but he failed. What is thought about the matter by the workers is shown by the following letter dated the 28th April, which I received on Tuesday from the Eastern Gold-fields District Council of the Australian Labour party:At a meeting of the above council held last night I was directed to convey to you the message that this council placed their fullest know why we are doing this work. We confidence in you, and were steadfastly behind ought to leave it and clean up the Japs you in the action you took with reference to the gold-mining industry, and we sincerely hope that the resoluteness which you displayed whilst placing your case before the workers will long be remembered. The ""workers of Kalgoorlie know that they are no longer entitled to live as formerly in a state of false security. They are aware that the sword of Damocles hangs above their heads. They are ready to go out of the gold-mining industry and to give of their best in order to create whatever defence works are necessary. urgently necessary in many districts of Western Australia. I appealed in vain to the former Minister for the Army( Mr statement regarding the gold-mining Spender), and to the former Government for the completion of many works which are essential to the defence of the State. Eor instance, I appealed to him to order the construction of a strategic road from Meekatharra to Marble Bar, the completion of the half-constructed concrete bridge built by the Roads Board over the DeGrey River at Port Hedland in order to destroy a bottleneck, and a strategic road between Alice Springs and Halls Creek. On the north-west coast State shipping cannot go beyond Point Sampson. The people in the north-west will be starved, even without action, unless facilities be provided to replace the sea route for the carriage of foodstuffs. According to newspaper reports the Treasurer, after I had done the job on the gold-fields, said that only sheer necessity would compel the Government to take men out of the gold-mining industry. The sheer necessity exists. It existed when I went to the gold-fields. So great was the necessity that I braved the floods in order to keep my appointments. „I am proud of the co-operation which the people on the gold-fields offered; but I am distinctly upset at the trend which affairs have taken. Senator Allan MacDonald has raised a hornet's nest in order to derive political kudos. In the Parliament of Western Australia certain members have adopted a parochial attitude for which they will not be thanked by the people of Kalgoorlie in time to come. The defence of this country is the greatest need, not parochialism. A man in Geraldton said to me, "" I do not Mr Johnson. so that we can return to it later."" Much more can be done towards the defence of this country than is being done, and the Government should stand up to the job regardless of what interests it may for the moment injure in doing it. National security regulations which, in normal times, would be abhorrent to me, come into being every day. I remain silent because I realize that, however distasteful they may be, they are necessary for the effective defence of th» And defence works are country. able, gentleman obtained leave to make a industry. have trespassed beyond the scope of the leave given to me, but the whole matter is wrapped up in the transfer of manpower from the gold-mining industry. My reputation as a member of the Lahour movement and as a citizen of Western Australia is at stake. I am proud that men, whatever else they may think of me, say "" Johnson has always taken up an honest attitude in whatever he has taken on "". I do not want that reputaenemy tion to be destroyed. The policy stated in the paper tabled to-day by the Minister for War Organization of Industry will consternate the gold-mining and business interests on the gold-fields, and they will thank me for the early warning I gave. The gold-mining industry is of major importance, not only to the Commonwealth Government but also to the State Government and the various State instrumentalities, because of the wealth it yields. Consequently, 1 am deeply interested in the welfare of the industry. In order to show the attitude of the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia (Incorporated), I shall read an excerpt from a letter sent to me by that body on the 11th March lastMy Executive Council fully appreciates th« seriousness of the present position, and I have to confirm the assurance given this morning that those responsible for the direction of the gold-mining industry in Western Australia arc not only willing but eager to co-operate to the fullest extent with the wishes of those directing the war effort. In fact, the Chamber of Mines, which has for",20,Aliens

83,Mr Johnson,"I am sorry if 1many months past been anxious to have a definite decision from the Government regarding the position of the industry, appreciates the action of the Government in permitting you to make this, confidential information available at the earliest possible moment, so that the various gold-mining companies can give immediate consideration to the preparationof the steps which will have to be taken when the Government's scheme is put into force. That was handed to me two hours after the meeting was held.. A copy was sent to the Treasurer. In a covering letter to him I gave all the information I had as to the number of men employed in the gold-mining industry. I flatly contradict the suggestion that I represented myself on the gold-fields as having been deputed hy the Government to do the job. I was not the representative of the Government, and at no stage did I suggest that I was. NTo such interpretation could have been placed on anything I said. I considered it my responsibility to warn the industry to avoid dislocation by making itself ready to meet the position when it arose and not to wait until regulations were promulgated. A matter of great concern is the number of enemy aliens employed in the gold-mining industry, and in my letter to the Treasurer I had this to say:New developments, however, in the war -ituation had altered the position and a greater supply of labour in tlie near future would be required to complete a defence works programme, and the mining industry would be called upon to release its quota. I dealt with ihe help that was coming to the aid of Australia and explained that labour was needed to provide defence works that would permit the quick movement of our troops and equipment from point to point as the occasion demanded. The spirit of the people was wonderful, in fact the only complaint being that the move was overdue. Kegarding the enemy alien question, I found a deep concern of the peuple in connection with this question, and there is the definite possibility of friction arising out of racial differences if this important fact is overlooked. Numbered among those employed in the gold-mining industry arc men from almost every European nationality, and even in normal times some ill feeling simmers underneath what appears on the surface to be desirable relations. Having the above in mind, I feel that it is imperative plex in regard to the rural industries, and that enemy aliens, neutral aliens and naturalized foreigners should be adequately represented in the initia l drafts of labour drawn from the gold-mining industry. If the aliens are allowed to remain in tration. Another warning was issued the industry and the other men are transto the Government by the Chairman of ferred there will be great agitation and the Rural Industries Committee, which trouble. If the Government will take advantage of the local knowledge of the mine-owners and the miners in order to draft these aliens out of the industry, it will find that it will have their f u l l support, so long as it treats all industries, both essential and non-essential, alike.

I say this in spite of the statement by the Minister for Labour and National Service earlier this af ternoon that the labour twenty milking cows. But that decision problem in rural industries had been solved. The action which the Minister has taken so far has failed to produce results. I shall show that some of the Minister's orders had not been acted upon by his subordinates even a month after they were issued. If that be the kind of administration which is supposed to be protecting the vital food industries of the Commonwealth, it is time that this House heard all about the matter. The old dictum that "" an army marches on its stomach"" is still true, despite all the changes that have occurred in methods of warfare, and, without proper food supplies, our armies could not hope to be successful. An indication that the Government is at last giving recognition to the serious danger of a food shortage was given on Sunday night last when the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Beasley) gave a broadcast in which he drew attention to the depleted man-power of our rural industries. The declarations and promises of the Monday last farmers were still being Minister for Labour and National Sertaken from their farms for war work. Mr Anthony. vice have not been borne out by the actions of the man-power officers in rural areas. On the 12 th March last, the Minister published a list of reserved occupations in rural industries. Managers, foremen, wool appraisers, farm hands singly of all ages, were to be exempt from the month after that date, the list was being completely ignored by man-power officials what use are such decisions if they be not implemented? Early in April, representatives of primary producers' organizations waited upon the Director-General On of Man-power, Mr Wurth, in order to impress upon him the seriousness of the labour shortage in the rural industries. Mr Wurth has been consistently sympathetic to the needs of the primary industries and has been as helpful as it is possible for him to be with his limited powers. On the 6th April he wrote a However, my representaletter in which he gave a ruling that one fit male must be left on every dairy farm with twenty milking cows, and two fit males on every farm with more than is not being implemented. Only to-day, I received letters complaining about this matter. I have here a letter, dated the 4th May, from a farmer in the Lismore district. It statesI have received your letter of the 15th April, stating that my best plan was to appeal to the local Police Magistrate, which I did, results of which they allowed ine from the above date (4th May) till the 30th June. 1942, to sell my going concern. As the stock and plant are under mortgage of £535. and at this time of the year it is very hard to sell a going concern with the approach of winter. It would be a great help to me if you could get in touch with the military authority and see if I can get an extension of time to sell my going concern. P.S I am the only male on the farm.

HaveI to go to camp while these publications prevail in Primary Producers Union paper and other newspapers? Is my exemption refusal in accordance with your rules as Director-General of Man-ipower ? Is effect being given to government decisions in country districts? It is the responsibility of the Government to decide how many primary producers shall be left on their farms to produce essential commodities; how many shall go into munitions factories; and how many shall be called up for military service. An adequate food supply is a necessity, and its production should be left to men who have had experience in the primary producing industry all their lives. There would be no ground for complaint if an over-abundance of foodstuffs were available, or if the position were so safe that producers could be taken from their farms for war work after th-jy had killed or otherwise disposed of their stock. Buti f the position be as I believe it to be, that we are fast approaching the stage where there is likely to be a serious shortage of foodstuffs as a result of the short-sighted policy adopted by the man-power authorities in country centres, then instant action should be taken to rectify the position. honourable member that there is likely to be a shortage of foodstuffs in Australia ? subject more fully when I am dealing with the Department of War Organization of Industry. The position has arisen that while the man-power officers in various centres may make one decision, officers of the Department of War Organization of Industry may make a conflicting decision, and the position is becoming intolerable. In January last representatives of the food distributing trades in Sydney waited upon the Deputy Director of Man-power Priorities, Mr Funnell, and urged that key men in the food distributing industry should be -granted exemptions. They pointed out Four that it would be useless to produce food on the farms and then rail it to the capital cities, where it would rot on the stations unless the distributing organization were available to deal with it when it arrived. The Deputy Director of Man-power sympathetically received the requests of the distributors and granted temporary exemption to key men. The Deputy Director of War Organization of Industry then intervened ani representatives of the distributing industry had to repeat the process. Who is supreme in this matter, the Department of War Organization of Industry, or the man-power authorities? It is a responsibility of the Minister for Supply and Development to ensure adequate food supplies, and the Minister for Commerce is also directly involved. A chaotic condition has arisen, and in an effort to determine who shall accept the responsibility for the adequate production and distribution of foodstuffs I have brought this matter before the House. The trouble seems to be that, although reserved occupation lists have been drawn up they have not been regarded by the authorities as final. Men in exempted categories are still being called up for service, and the decision of whether the reserved occupation lists shall be applied in individual cases is left to the judgment of local man-power officers or police magistrates, and not to the Government itself. It is apparent that there has been a lack of finality in transmitting to the appropriate authorities the decision arrived at by the Government. The Director-General of Man-power has been very sympathetic and helpful, but I believe that his powers are limited. He has certain demands made on him for priorities which must be complied with, and he is required to find men for allied works, a section which is under the charge of Mr Theodore. He is also required to allocate men for munitions works, for aircraft production, and for the Army, and so far as I can gather he has been given very vague instructions. As to the primary need of food production. T ask the Minister to inform the",24,Industries Formalmotion For Adjournment
89,Mr Dedman,What proof has the,25,Industries Formalmotion For Adjournment
90,Mr Anthony,"I shall refer to thatHouse what authority the Director General of Man-power has to return men from the Army to the important work of producing sufficient foodstuffs for civil and military use. In the selection of man-power officials little effort has been made in country centres to appoint men with practical experience of the job they are expected to do. No attempt seems to have been made to co-opt the services, even in an advisory capacity, of men who have had experience in. primary production. Usually a public official, a bank manager, or a business man has been appointed man-power officer in a particular area, often with little practical knowledge of farm problems. As a consequence, there has been little sympathetic understanding of the national need for maintaining an adequate food supply. The man-power officer, in many instances, says to an applicant for exemption: "" I s it not your duty to go into the Army?"" If the applicant states that he has other responsibilities his position is made so uncomfortable that he is virtually branded as a shirker. Various Ministers have stated from time to time that the production of a particular foodstuff is necessary, and that the commodity will be protected. foodstuffs are inter-related. If there be an over-production of potatoes, while the public are eating more potatoes they are eating less of something else. If there be a shortage of potatoes there is a demand for some other vegetable. One claBS of foodstuff is substituted for another in times of shortage, and when the principle of granting a blanket exemption is being considered it should not be .the aim of the authorities to grant the exemption only in respect of certain selected commodities. The Minister for War Organization of Industry asked, by way of interjection, what proof I have that there is likely to be a shortage of foodstuffs in the near future. ,So far as I am aware Australia has not heen able to meet its contract with Great Britain for the supply of 60,000 tons of butter for the year. The Minister for Commerce is more familiar with that matter than I am, but so far as I know butter production for the first eight months of the year has not been sufficient to meet the conMT. Anthony. tract that has been entered into. In the first eight months of the financial year 1939-40 butter production in New South Wales totalled 720,000 cwt., and in the corresponding period of 1941-42 it had dropped to 483,000 cwt. In Victoria production dropped from 1,171,000 cwt. to 1,002,000 cwt. in the same period, whilst in Queensland there was a reduction from 829,000 cwt. to 488,000 cwt. [Extension of time granted.] Those figures indicate that the production of butter is a serious problem to-day. New South Wales has never been self-sufficient in butter production. For eight or nine months of the year butter has to be imported from other States, as local requirements can be met only during the peak spring period. I represent a district which is responsible for probably one-third "" f the total butter production of New Scuih Wales. There is increasing difficulty in securing interstate transport for goods, and in the near future it may not be possible to carry produce from one State to another. In view of that possibility it is desirable that every State should be as self-supporting as possible. The position in regard to young stock is also very alarming. It has been reported to me from All many parts of my electorate that the number of young stock being offered at saleyards is much less to-day than it was two years or even twelve months ago. The full adverse effects of that decline will not be felt until two or three years hence when the young stock of to-day will be the milk-producing cows. The position in the sugar industry also warrants examination. In 1940 we produced 804,984 tons of sugar, half of which was exported, and I am informed by Mr Curlewis and Mr Muir, of the Sugar Producers Association, that by the end of 1943 Australia will be barely selfsufficient in regard to sugar, and that within two years, should the present decline continue owing to the shortage of fertilizer and scarcity of labour, we shall not be growing enough sugar to meet our own requirements. The foundations of primary production have to be laid a long time in advance. Production of a crop of any kind requires months of preparation. If butter is to be produced, then years of preparation are necessary. That is why I am raising this matter at the present juncture. Already we have seen what dire results can be caused by the shortage of labour. To-day there is a scarcity of many essential commodities, but it is nothing to the shortage that will exist if corrective measures be not taken immediately. Shortages are upon us now, but how much more acute will they be if the matter he neglected We must eat to live, and to fight, and unless we retain sufficient men in our rural industries to ensure the production of sufficient food to meet the requirements not only of our troops, but also the civilian population, serious difficulties may occur. It is just as essential to feed the people as it is to enlist men in the fighting forces. Oommerce) [4.5] I am surprised that the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) has seen fit to submit this motion to-day, in view of the fact that yesterday the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr the primary industries in respect of Ward) announced that a blanket exemption had been granted to men employed in primary industries. Whilst the Government does not dispute many of the facts stated by the honourable member it seems that he is not yet fully aware that this nation is at war, and that 1 conditions to-day are far from normal. Tf the men who arc being called up from the primary industries for military service were being wasted then there might he some excuse for this motion, but we are passing through the most critical period in the history of our nation and every man is vital to the protection of our soil. Man-power is being depleted not only in rural areas, hut also in every other avenue of employment, and I see no justification for this attack upon the Government. In fact I consider that the Government is to be commended for doing everything possible to meet the demands of the defence authorities for recruits. The Government is not pursuing its present policy haphazardly. It is doing what it considers to be best in the interests of Australia, just as its predecessor did what it considered to be best. To-day we are dependent on our armed forces for our very existence, and I am sure that the honourable member for Richmond'does not realize the significance of the position. Does he suggest that, contrary to the recommendations of its military advisers the Government should accept the responsibility for withdrawing men from our armed forces? Honourable members can visualize what chaos there would be if men were withdrawn from the forces in large numbers. This is solely a matter for our military authorities, and it would be unthinkable to attempt to interfere with our national defence at this stage. Had this motion been made prior to the statement made by the Minister for Labour and National Service yesterday, there might have been some justification for it. I assure the honourable member for Richmond that the Government is just as alive to the position of the rural industries as are honourable members opposite, and every effort will be made to overcome the drift before it reaches danger point. The honourable member claimed that many local man-power officers had no practical knowledge of which they were called upon to give decisions when applications were made for exemption. The Government realizes that, and after a lengthy discussion, the Cabinet eub-committee, which was appointed to examine this problem, decided to overcome that difficulty by granting a blanket exemption to all rural industries. able gentleman mean by "" blanket exemption""? gaged in those industries is exempt from the call-up. Those industries are the production of dairy produce, wool, wheat, meat, pigs, sugar, potatoes, rice, vegetables, tobacco, fruit and several other commodities.

The Government has. acted upon its recommendations in the decision it has made. No government' could do more than is being done at. present.

93,Mr Scully,"The man-power enimportant part in the defence of this country in the critical period through which we are passing. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) has adopted the procedure of moving for the adjournment of the House in order to direct the attention of the Government to a matter that he regards as of outstanding importance to our national well-being, namely, the serious decline in the production of foodstuffs, consequent upon the depletion of labour in the rural areas. am chairman of the Rural Industries 'Committee, which is composed of members of all political parties in both branches of this legislature. That committee has made a number of representations to the Government on this subject. The first was on the 17th September, 1941; and the committee regarded the matter as so urgent that further representations were made on the 25th March and the 29th April last. Those representations were made unanimously, in the belief that it is imperative that we have in Australia three armies. First, there are the fighting forces. Secondly, there is the industrial army which produces clothing for those forces, and arms and equipment to enable them to fight. Thirdly, it is equally important to have an army of food producers, to provide what is needed in order to feed the fighting forces and those who are engaged in the manufacture of munitions. Adequacy of food supplies must also be maintained for the civil population; and a very im' portant obligation rests upon Australia, which hitherto has been regarded as one of the granaries of the world, to produce those foodstuffs which we undertook to make available to Great Britain and our allies. There is a special obligation to see that, so far as may be practicable, the food army shall be adequate to meet all those requirements. Having regard to these considerations, the Rural Industries Committee considers that the number of persons engaged in the production of food in Australia is far from adequate. I pay a tribute to the rural industries for the extraordinarily large number of voluntary enlistments they have furnished to our fighting forces. Any one who has been in the slightest degree associated with enlistment and recruiting within recent years knows that the percentage of recruits in rural districts has been infinitely higher than in metropolitan areas. Despite this, in the call-up proper regard has not been paid to what rural industries are producing. The owners of farming properties belong to the army of food producers. Young men in country districts are remote from the attractions of the cities, and have not available to them picture shows and all other forms of organized entertainment. They do not I wish to be away from their homes every night, as do many young men in the cities, but listen to the broadcasts of war news and commentaries on the war position. Practically alone in their rural work throughout the day, they reflect upon what they have heard or read. Their minds are daily concentrated on the war, and the position in which Australia is placed. They have responded to the call to the colours as has no other group, and to a dangerous degree the country districts have thereby been denuded of man-power. I pay tribute to the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully), who has given the utmost consideration to the representations of the committee of which he was at one time a valuable member and deputy chairman. But I still affirm that notwithstanding such consideration, and the representations of the committee, the Government is not regarding the matter as seriously as it should. If time permitted, I could read at length evidence that i i attached to the report of the committee, which proves overwhelmingly that the primary producers, who are well aware of market requirements, realize that they are unable to produce anything like normal supplies. Our fighting forces to-day are exceptionally large, and in addition an ever-increasing number of allied troops is coming to Australia. I shall quote one or two pertinent extracts from the evidence given to the Rural Industries Committee. John Henry Cavanagh, general president of the Agricultural Bureau of New South Wales and a member of the Australian Wheat Board, saidI agree that if steps are not taken within the next three months to offset the shortage of man-power there is a very real danger that",27,Industries Formalmotion For Adjournment
94,Mr Francis (Moreton) [4.12],"we shall experience a shortage of foodstuffs. That is not an overstatement of the position. There will certainly be a shortage of dairy products. The Economic Adviser to the Department of Agriculture, New South Wales, and Economist to the Rural Bank of New South Wales, John Grenfell Crawford, saidThere are many signs that the danger point has come in many areas. Discussing the shortage of man-power, Mr Cavanagh saidThe shortage of man-power is becoming acute in the rural areas . . . as the result of heavy enlistments and the call-ups, it has plies will become hopelessly depleted. 1 now become acute and many farmers are able to carry on only with great difficulty. We have lost many of our skilled men by enlistment and in the call-ups . . . Further, quite a number of workers in the industry have entered munition factories. Most of these were of great value in the rural indusable. They need food f u l l of vitamins, tries as machinery experts. Mr Albert Alexander Watson, chief of the Division of Marketing in the Department of Agriculture, New South Wales, saidI have been seconded for duty with the Director-General of Man-power in relation to the man-power requirements of rural industries. We elicited the information that vegetable-growers in the County of Cumberland, which is the principal producing area in New South Wales of bunched vegetables and salads, are experiencing a shortage of 1,000 employees. Mr George William Gordon, general president of the Primary Producers Union of New South Wales statedMan-power is another real problem. The dairying industry has largely depended on family labour to meet its needs. Since the war this type of labour has been seriously depleted, due iu the first instance to heavy enlistments and also to the fact that farm labourers, and in some cases farm families, have found other avenues of employment with very much brighter prospects than dairyfarming. Furthermore, up to date, those entrusted with the responsibility of granting exemptions from military training do not appear to have appreciated the serious depletion of man-power in the dairying industry, and hosts of farms have been left without adequate labour. This has resulted in a decrease in production and the neglect in many instances of essential work on the farm. A striking case came under my notion a few days ago. A man who had invested his life's savings in a valuable property, on which there were 4,000 sheep, had put his son in charge of the farm. He had built up in recent years a herd of 40 stud Jersey cattle, and he also had 180 pigs. One employee after another enlisted, and others were called up, until finally his son only was left to look after the property. It was impossible for the son to attend to 4,000 sheep, 40 cows, and the calves and the pigs. Consequently he had to sell the pigs at a great sacrifice. He could not carry on with the dairy herd, and he reduced the number of the sheep by half. That is a picture of what is taking place in many areas, and it seems certain that our food supfear that Australia will be unable to meet its obligations in providing the foodstuffs required by Great Britain and our allies. The fighting forces must be supplied with adequate food of the best quality obtainin order to help them to carry out the important job ahead of them. member has exhausted his time. JAY. BAKES (Maranoa) [4.25] Like the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Rural Industries. As Napoleon said that an army marches on its stomach, the contention that our fighting forces will not do their work properly unless they are well fed needs no elaboration. The man-power of the nation may be divided into three divisions-thos e engaged in actual warfare, those employed in the munitions factories and those growing food and other requisites for the fighting forces. Perhaps we should place first in order of importance those who grow foodstuffs, second, those who make the munitions, and, third, those who do the actual fighting. Honourable members will recall that when war broke out and particularly when the Japs joined in the struggle, a great cry went up in Australia for the enlistment of men. A psychology was developed which led people to think that those who did not get into uniform were shirkers and cold-footed. Many of those who, greatly to their credit, joined the colours, were young men from the dairying, grazing, fruit and wheat farms, and from the mines, and, in my opinion, men",28,Industries Formalmotion For Adjournment
95,Mr Speaker,"The' honorableof that type make the best soldiers. They have initiative, and the environment in which they have lived makes them hardy and well fitted to carry ont the strenuous activities of warfare. Later, the Area Officer became the pivotal point of enlistment, and naturally he was prepared to grab as many able bodied men as he could. The lads who remained on the farms were described as shirkers, and white feathers were sent to many of them. The result, naturally, was that enlistment was stimulated. This happened six or eight months ago before the present Government assumed office. It was said at the recruiting rallies that Australia had a surplus of primary products such as sugar, wheat, meat and butter. We certainly have a surplus of some commodities, but most of them are stored in coastal areas in what may be regarded as danger zones where they oould be quickly destroyed by enemy action. Owing to the arrival of allied forces from the United States of America, and the return of many members of the Australian I m perial Force from the Middle East, conditions have changed, and, instead of a surplus, we are likely to experience a shortage of foodstuffs. Our inability to obtain phosphate from Nauru and Ocean Island has resulted in a shortage of fertilizers, and that will seriously reduce primary production. The farmer must work according to the seasons. The land must he cultivated and fallowed, the seed sown, the crops tended, and the harvesting done. All this involves the employment of workers over considerable periods, but where are we to get the men who are needed for this important task? I maintain that the Government has taken, and is taking, active measures to meet the position. It has appointed committees to go into the matter, including the committee charged with the control of food supplies. Recently, I received the following communication :Owing to the strong representations made to even if shipping were available, we the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman), we are informed by the Minister that no more men employed permanently in rural production are to be taken into the Army for the present, but the' position will be reviewed from time to time in accordance with the war position. Mr Baker. I have faith that the present Government will do its work, and the work before it is not easy. Men must be found for the fighting forces, and it is also necessary to leave sufficient men in the primary industries to ensure adequate supplies of food. That can be done only by the careful planning of primary production. I congratulate the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) upon having raised the question of depletion of labour in rural industries. In spite of the opinion of the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) that, in view of the statement of the Minister for Lahour and National Service( Mr Ward) yesterday, that "" blanket"" exemption would now be given to workers in primary industries, there is no longer any need to discuss thi# subject, I believe that the honourable member's action is fully justified. I am convinced that the harm is already done and that the calling up of rural workers for military service, particularly during thp last few months, will make it necessary to ration butter next year if we are to continue supplying our civil population, our military forces, and those of our allies in this country, as well as sending supplies to Great Britain. We must remember that it i? becoming increasingly difficult for Britain to obtain materials for the manu facture of margarine, so that the futurr demand for butter is likely to be greater rather than less. In a good season, Australia produces approximately 200,000 tons of butter, of which about one-half is consumed here, and the other half is exported to Great Britain. Our expori quota to Great Britain has now been reduced to 60,000 tons, but I understand that we could not supply even that quantity during the current season. butter, but there is a shortage of shipping. should be hard put to it to find 60,000 tons of butter for export. In all the dairying districts of Australia, the size of the herds is being reduced, not because the farmers do not want to produce butter, but because they cannot obtain labour to",29,Industries Formalmotion For Adjournment

98,Mr Paterson,"I understand thai,work large herds. approaching a position in which we shall not have enough butter to supply civilian needs, the needs of our military forces and those of our Allies in this country, and also fill our export quota to Great Britain. The Government mus decide what quantities of the various food commodities are needed, and then ensure that sufficient labour shall be available to enable such quantities to be produced. I realize that all industries will have to go a little short of labour; every body must work a bit harder, but there is a limit beyond which labour supplies cannot ha cut down without seriously endangering the country's food supply. I have in mind the case of a man who, with a delicate wife, has been left to milk 78 cows, and the military authorities have refused to release his son from the Militia to help him. I join issue with the Minister for Commerce when he says that it is unthinkable that the Government should suggest to the Army authorities that certain men now in training might be better employed' in the production of foodstuffs. I am one of those who would like to see as many young men as possible receiving military training, but we are faced with the possibility of a serious food shortage unless more labour be provided for the rural industries. Even in the fishing industry, there is a shortage of labour. In one fishing village on the south coast of Gippsland, twelve men were formerly employed fishing. The number has now been reduced to six, and another man, who had been exempt, was recently called up, reducing the number to five. Fish is an important item of food, but there is likely to be a shortage of it unless a sufficient number of fishermen be left on the coast. The motion before the House refers not only to foodstuffs, but also to other essennow protest so much paid equal attention tial commodities. One such commodity which I have in mind is wattle-bark for tanning. In years gone by, the tanners depended largely upon supplies of bark and tanning extract imported from South Africa. A certain amount of bark has been gathered in Australia from wattle trees that have sprung up after fires, but the industry has never been organized. There is no need to stress the demands which the war is making upon our tanneries for We are rapidly the production of leather for military purposes. A situation might arise at any time when it would be extremely difficult to obtain supplies of tanning material from South Africa. A few years ago, a small company, with commendable foresight, planted the right kind of wattle trees on Sunday Island, off Port Albert, and it is expected that, within the next eighteen months, this company will be able to supply substantial quantities of wattle-bark to the tanning industry. The company was employing 27 men. It has now only twelve, and the directors are afraid that some even of those twelve will he called up, thus making it impossible to carry on. An industry such as that should be protected against further loss of staff, so that supplies of tanning bark may 'be available if imports from South Africa should be cut off. I urge the Government to recognize the great importance of this matter, and the fact that we are morally obliged not merely to grow sufficient food for ourselves, but also to do as much as we possibly can for the Mother Country which is now in dire need of all we can supply. for Labour and National Service) [4.40]. -This is another instance of the Country party missing the bus. Had successful representations not been made to the Government by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) for relief to be given to the primary industries in respect of man-power, I am perfectly sure that this move would not have been made by members of the Country party in this chamber. No member of this Parliament has been more conscientious or active, or more persistent, in his advocacy on behalf of the country interests than the honourable member for Wimmera. Had honourable members opposite who to their duties as representatives of primary producers, probably much more would have been accomplished in the past on behalf of our rural industries. This motion means nothing more than a sheer waste of the time of the Parliament and the Government. Honourable members opposite who talk so much about not playing the game of party politics, have submitted the motion merely in order to try to save face with their constituents.",30,Industries Formalmotion For Adjournment
99,Mr Ward (East Sydney,"Ministe rLet us examine tbe position. Only a few days ago these honourable gentlemen advocated that every man should be flung into the Army. conscription. They wanted the military authorities to reach out and drag every man into the fighting services. To-day, however, they protest that too many men are being thrown into the fighting services. They say that men are wanted in the country districts to stem the fall in the production of food. Evidently, they believe that the Australian people as a whole are so foolish as to think that could readily produce figures to show we can put every man in the fighting services, and, at the same time, supply the labour requirements of industry. Whenever the Labour party has put forward proposals to establish and maintain a proper balance in the distribution of man-power, they have declared them to be unsound, and, despite the fact that the Army could not feed or equip them, have contended that every man should be in the fighting services. They described the Labour party's proposals in this respect as disloyal. Here are the facts: Yesterday the Government announced to Parliament that certain definite action had been taken in order to relieve the acute shortage of man-power in primary industries. Now, within 24 hours of that announcement, honourable members opposite submit a motion of this kind. Thus the House is called upon to waste two hours of valuable time in discussing the need for doing something that has already been done by the Government. this motion has been submitted for no other purpose than to enable members of the Country party to save face with their constituents. Government has constantly kept this problem under review. instance, the matters raised by the honourable member for Gippsland Paterson). I do not deny that cases of hardship have been caused in country districts, as well as in cities. However, it will be recognized that the Government has done everything possible to retain sufficient men in essential industries, and, at the same time, has given special attention to cases of hardship arising from this policy. Unless we immediately cease altogether the call-up Mr Ward. of men for the Army, it is impossible to prevent cases of hardship. Practically every man who is called to the fighting They proposed services suffers hardship in some degree. But ou this ground alone, the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), who submitted the motion, declared that the Government had lacked foresight, and had been guilty of maladministration in handling this problem. The honourable member for Gippsland stresses the need for building up food reserves. The Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) that our reserves of food of the classes mentioned in this debate are now greater than before this Government took office. The Government may leave itself open to criticism in respect of some of the primary industries which it has declared to be reserved occupations, because some people are bound to hold the view that those particular industries are not indispensable. The wheat industry is included in the list of industries which are to be given complete exemption under these regulations. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Marwick) raised no objection to that decision. At the same time, however, he advocates conscription. The facts in respect of the wheat industry are that we now have in store sufficient reserves for three years. But whilst the honourable member is worried about what might be the position three years hence, the Government is concerned with what might happen within the next three months. The honourable member wants Obviously, I repeat, man-power made available to certain primary industries for the purpose of building up reserves to meet possible requirements ten years hence or for some The uncertain period. The Government has taken a very liberal view in dealing with Take, for this problem. It has gone out of its way to assist primary industries. Events of ( Mr the past show that the needs of primary producers have invariably been met by this Parliament through the efforts of honourable members who are not members of the Countrv party. The honourable member for Richmond read the list of reserved occupations which he said was issued on the 12th March last. He declared that the list was not strictly adhered to by the man-power officers. I have had many complaints that the decisions of those officers do not conform with the Government's general policy in this matter. It is only to be expected that occasionally such decisions will be given. that a proper balance must be preserved Our man-power organization is entirely new. It has been established in record time, and must be administered by officers ing from the Opposition as to what many of whom are not acquainted with the general policy of the Government. Therefore, it is inevitable that mistakes will be made. However, I cannot recollect one single instance in which the honourable member for Richmond has complained to me that decisions of the Government in respect of reserved occupations have not been strictly adhered to by man-power officers. If an honourable member does not bring to the notice of the Government complaints of the kind which he now mentions, how can he expect them to be remedied ? That is the position. The honourable member also said that whilst Mr Wurth, the Director General of Man-power, was disposed to deal sympathetically with applications made to him under these regulations, his powers were limited. No doubt the honourable member implied that the Director General was hampered by some higher authority. It is true that the regulations provide that the organization of man-power is primarily the responsibility of the Minister, who determines what decisions shall be implethe munitions industry, and thirdly, by mented. That is as it should be. In my opinion, no government organization should be removed from the control of Parliament. What do members of the Opposition, particularly members of the Country party, who seem to be playing a prominent part in this particular drive against the Government, hope to achieve? The Government has already decided to grant a measure of protection which probably exceeds their expectations, due, to a large degree, to the logical case submitted to Cabinet by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson). The Government also resolved that the exemption shall be only temporary, and it appointed a committee to examine the whole of the requirements of primary industries for the purpose of enabling it to obtain a proper estimate of the personnel that must be retained in them in order to continue production. Ministers recognize that the fighting forceB must be properly fed and equipped, and between the various industries. The Labour Government requires no promptshould be done in the interests of the people, whether they reside in the cities or in country districts. Prowse) -Orde r 1 The Minister's time has expired. -Although the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) has just assured the House that the Labour Government requires no prompting to look after country interests, I remind him that he has just informed honorablr members that if it had not been for the logical case presented by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson), the country people would have been neglected. The Minister cannot have it both ways. If one of his statements be right, the other must be wrong. Prohably both of them are wrong. People tend to overlook the fact that the man-power of country districts has been depleted, first, by voluntary enlistments, secondly, by a steady stream into the compulsory call-up for military service. In my opinion, primary production should be classed as one of the essential services. The best-equipped army in the world will not defeat its enemies unless it is adequately victualled. If the Government fails to act, we may discover, in the not distant future, that we are unable to provide sufficient food to meet our own needs. Evidently the Minister was not aware that only last week, arrangements were made to transport from Queensland to Victoria 1,000 tons of butter and a large qua.»-"".«y of cheese. In 4 normal times Victoria produces more butter than any other State. A member of the Dairy Products Control Board assured me on Tuesday that before long, Australia will be obliged to import cheese from New Zealand. When that become* necessary, something will obviously be wrong with our primary industries. T",31,Industries Formalmotion For Adjournment

With the ply Great Britain with large quantities of butter. ping difficulties. the butter until we produce it. l t is because we have not produced the butter that we are unable to ship it. member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) pointed out earlier that Great Britain will require, in future, a larger quantity of dairy produce than hitherto because the fact that certain products from the islands are no longer available will seriously affect the manufacture of margarine. Another factor which must be borne in mind is that the productivity of large areas will he greatly impaired as the result of the lack of adequate supplies of superphosphate. Some of the country in areas with a high rainfall, which has had an excellent productive capacity, will revert to its virgin condition and will barely keep a snake to the acre. Lack of superphosphate will have a most adverse effect upon the production of essential primary products, which the Army requires just as much as equipment and munitions. The time may not be far distant when men now serving in the Army will have to be diverted to produce food. That will be one more step in the conscription of man-power. To date, the Government has introduced conscription in the military and industrial spheres. What is the objection to extending it a little by diverting experienced men to grow food? The Minister had no justification for complaining bitterly about the advocacy by the Opposition last week of an amendment of the Defence Act in order to permit the Australian Military Forces to serve in distant theatres of war. In my opinion, the Government wilfully misrepresented the attitude adopted by the Oimosition. Honourable members on this side of the chamber did not suggest that the Labour Government should introduce conscri-otion, because it has alreadv done so. We merely suggested that the Govpmment should remove the impediment which would prevent the despatch of the Australian Military Forces from AusGovernment rested the decision whether to use the authority that the Opposition urged it to take.

A. month ago, in order to cause the Army to realize that there were limitations to the enlistment of manpower for the fighting services, Cabinet appointed a special sub-committee to examine the problem. The personnel includes some of the most competent members of the Commonwealth Public Service. That was the first occasion, since the outbreak of war, that steps were taken to bring the Army close to the representatives of the departments that are associated with supply and primary production. No honourable member will deny the tendency in Australia has always been for people to adopt a pioneering attitude toward most of their problems. For example, when they require wood, they take an axe, go out to the countryside and obtain the timber by their own efforts. Never before, have we faced any serious problem in obtaining food, but that position has now changed. Really, everything centres in time, and the calendar. AlthoughI do not wish to blame previous governments for the present position, it could be said that the Menzies and Fadden Administrations did not expect the present situation to arise and, therefore, made no preparations, perhaps because they did not know that large -bodies of Allied troops would be despatched to Australia. men have been called up since Japan entered the war. the Australian Imperial Force have also increased during the last six months. of Japan threw us hack on to our own",33,Industries Formalmotion For Adjournment

109,Mr Beasley,"Before the advanceresources, we did not regard these matters in the same light as we do to-day; hence my observation that time and the calendar determine our course. the present time, man-power is a real problem. Unfortunately, this continent has only a small population. Perhaps the debate should centre upon the reason for our lack of numbers. worthy of mention at this moment, because, in our efforts to preserve the country for the white races, we now realize the difficulties which are caused by a shortage of population. House appreciates now, if not ever before, the importance of this problem, and a month ago the Government set up a special committee. The Army was brought face to face for the first time with certain realities that had not previously been properly understood. It was the first time that there had been such a meeting of representatives of the different fighting forces-the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force-roun d the tame table. I am not blaming them for their previous lack of appreciation of the problem; the matter had merely drifted. The committee has brought forward some of its conclusions and we propose that it shall become a standing committee, because we regard its work as being of the highest importance. The Supply Department's task was to feed the fighting forces. It was not called upon to provide for the needs of the civilian population, but it realized that it could not continue ad lib. to take food from the reservoirs of the peopk without having regard to their needs and the need to maintain production so that the contents of the reservoirs could be kept at a safe level. That question exercised my mind when the Americans arrived in this country, and we saw them buying on our markets at prices we thought they ought not to pay. This was seriously affecting the general supply without compensatory methods being applied to replenish the goods. That is why the Allied Supply Council was first suggested. We were not letting the business slip from our grasp, but were watching it at each stage. The activities of the Allied Supply Council have developed beyond the supply of foodstuffs, but the council actually had its origin in the case I submitted to the Government regarding foodstuffs. The Americans were bringing into this country 60 days' rations per At unit, and we thought that if we could supply those rations there would be so much more shipping space available for fighting equipment. The Americans do not want to sit round a table to discuss That point is food-supply questions only, and therefore the Allied Supply Council will now deal with all problems connected with the needs of the fighting forces in Australia. ThisI realized that, in order to meet the problem of supplying foodstuffs to the fighting forces, the Supply Department must ally itself with the Commerce Department, which has activities connected with production. Last week, that matter was finally resolved, and next Monday the first meeting of the Central Food Council will be held in Sydney. The object of that meeting will be to tie together the civilian and services needs in regard to foodstuffs. It will include the Department of Commerce, the Prices Commissioner, the Department of War Organization of Industry, the representatives of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, and an allied services representative of the American Government. I have made provision for the chief ordnance officer of the United States Army to be present. A civil emergency control organization was set up in each State by the Department of Commerce some time ago, probably during tbe regime of the previous Government, and a representative from this body is included in the council. The object of this body was to arrange for the storage of emergency supplies of food in different parts of the country. Steps were also taken to secure the co-operation of the States, which have important local organizations dealing with agriculture. They have in the service of their agricultural departments competent men, and it behoves the Commonwealth to make use of them. As I said last night, we are anxious to use such bodies, particularly in such a State as Western Australia, which is far removed from us. In each of the States,therefore, we have set up an advisory committee, of which the Minister for Agriculture in that State will be chairman, and which will have representatives of the canning industry, meat interests, and trade unions. The latest State to complete this arrangement was South Australia. I am referring to this aspect because I want the House to know that the subject has not.been neglected. .WhilstI recognize that it is the duty of honourable members to raise this question to-day, I am anxious to let the country know that the Government has not neglected the problem. The discussion to-day may help me to fulfil the ideas behind the broadcast I made a few nights ago, and may bring the public to realize its duties in adequately meeting the many problems that must arise. Most of the arguments have centred in the man-power question, which is a serious one. quately dealt with, all else will be useless. a responsibility, I sanctioned the asking and even demanding man-power meat.

I had to deal with a problem recently when I found myself unable, because of the requirements of our own allied troops in this country and ourselves, to comply with Britain's order for 20,000 tons of jam. My main reason for speaking to-day was to bring to the notice of the House and the general public the fact that we are mindful of the importance of the food problem and are evolving practical means to safeguard the country against food shortages. -This country owes a deep debt of gratitude to the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) for bringing this matter up for discussion. What was said by the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Beasley) interested me greatly. It is late in the day to bring his plan forward, because only last Saturday the Canberra Times contained the following report of an interview with one of his colleagues:DRAI N OF LABOU R OPPOSED. "" The rural industries, wit h regard to manBritish blockade. I should not say power, have been cut more than they could possibly bear"", stated the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully), yesterday, who viewed with alarm any further attempt to call up men from the industries for military service. Mr. Scully was commenting on a statement by the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr Dedman), who said that the rationalization of industry plan his department was handling would reduce man-power to the barest possible operational minimum. "" An y further drain on this man-power"", said Mr Scully, "" would cause the collapse of the necessary forms of primary products that were essential for the maintenance of our civil population and also for supplies to the services"". So far, there had not been any collaboration between the Department of War Organization of Industry, the Department of Labour and National Service, and his department to t r y to solve the situation that had arisen. The Cabinet Man-power Sub-Committee now had the matter under survey, and Mr Scully was hopeful that it would evolve the solution. pretation of what I said about collaboration was incorrect. Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) that the Government had taken a liberal view of the needs of primary industries contrasts strangely with the view of the Minister for Commerce that those industries have been bled white. I fully realize, with the honourable member for Richmond and the Minister for Supply and Development, that all sorts of plans can be drawn and all sorts of machinery created, but that nothing can be accomplished without man-power. The man-power of the Commonwealth is limited. Not only the armies, Australian and Allied, but also the people must be fed. We also have the duty to supply to Great Britain as much food as we can spare. I put our needs in this order: Fighting forces, armaments, food, and the maintenance of public morale. Food, however, is not less essential than men or munitions, because without it armies cannot fight and public morale collapses. I well remember marching 240 miles on the heels of the beaten German Army in 1918. When we reached the Rhine, it became apparent to us that the collapse of the armed resistance of the German Empire had heen largely owing to the collapse of the spirit of the people as the result of the food shortage brought about by the that a similar collapse could occur in this country, but it is conceivable that it could occur in other countries which are fighting on our side unless they he supplied with sufficient food. The Minister for Supply and Development has told us about the appointment of the Central Food Council. The scheme seems sound, but I hope that the council will get on to the job quickly in order that the primary producers may learn what is required of them. The general secretary of the Primary' Producers Union, New South Wales, Mr J. L. Shute, is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald to-day as having saidThe position has become so serious that primary producers must have an authoritative statement about future requirements of essential foods. If normal production of dairy produce, pig meats and vegetables is necessary, the Government must make adequate manpower available, and guarantee farmers an equitable price for the goods produced. If these products are not required in normal or increased quantities, producers should be informed.",36,Position Of Export Of Primary Produce From Australia

If that be the case, the Government which the honourable member supported must take the blame. The fact is that the butter position is very much better now than it was last year. One of the great difficulties in planning butter production is that of trying to comply with the wishes of the British Government, which has changed its demands from time to time. In the first instance, it asked for a certain quantity of butter. with figures at the moment. The British Government first asked for a certain quantity of butter.

The honourable member for Richmond, by interjection , mentioned potatoes. Last1 year there was a record crop of potatoes, and we did not know .what to do with them. Now, simply because there has been an abnormally bad season this year, there is a very small crop of potatoes. It is impossible for a government to order weather conditions to suit its requirements. With such a large crop last year, it was inevitable that some of the people who had grown large quantities and received low prices for them should decide not to grow potatoes this year and to switch to some other crop. The Government is confronted with many difficulties in planning the production of foodstuffs. First, it must assess the scale of production which it requires to be carried out. It must take into consideration the size of the civilian population, the numbers of Allied troops who have come here in order to assist in the defence of Australia, and also the demands made by the British Government. In peace-time we had a surplus of primary products for export, but the British Government cannot take all that surplus now, which means that the is generally outlet for a large proportion of our crops is considerably restricted. Having decided what scale of production is required to meet these various needs, the Government must decide how much manpower shall be left in the primary production field in order to enable that scale of production to be reached. That decision eventually is given effect by the granting of exemptions from military service. ing general decisions. Each man-power officer has been making his own decisions. The Minister for Supply and Development has mentioned the various authorities that have been set up to examine this matter. I wish to make it abundantly clear that the Government has to deal with a very difficult problem. Having assessed the scale of production that will he required, it must estimate what exemptions from the military callup will permit sufficient men to remain on the land in order to achieve that scale of production.

Some of the claims for exemption from military service which have been brought to my notice are of such a nature that it is obvious that those honourable members who support them are not endeavouring to use the man-power of the nation to the best advantage, but rather are endeavouring to secure favours for some of their electors. A case was brought to my attention not long ago in which a member of Parliament wanted an exemption to be granted to a primary producer. This man was leasing 100 acres of land on which he had 22 cattle, 40 sheep, and 3 horses. If exemptions were granted to all persons operating on a similar scale throughout the field of primary production the Government would not nave enough men in the Army to meet the military requirements of the nation. able gentleman's time has expired.

Those statements by Mr Wurth justify the submission of the motion now before the House. This matter has been forced upon the attention of the House by the demands of consumers. Since the beginning of the war the primary producers have protested without avail against the lack of consideration shown for their man-power requirements. I first raised the matter when I wrote to the then Minister for Labour and National Service on the 27th February of last year, and I have been persistent in my efforts ever since, but very little has yet heen achieved. However, governments are paying more attention to the problem now, because the general public is beginning to realize that there is likely to be a severe shortage of food products in the near future. What is the use of urging people to produce dried fruits, vegetables, and other foodstuffs if they are not provided with the labour necessary for production? Every body knows that the man-power resources of all branches of primary industry have been whittled down until only owners of about 60 to 65 years of age and youths are employed on most farms? I introduced a deputation to the Minister for War Organization of Industry in Melbourne in January, asking him to provide internees or prisoners of war for fruitpicking in the river Murray irrigation areas. Some internees were made available to work in Victoria but, unfortunately, not in South Australia. Apparently our loss was Victoria's gain. Despite the many protests that have been made to date very little has been done, and what has been achieved has been the result of the silent and slow but very effective pressure of public opinion. The people generally realize that neither for the troops nor for the ordinary civilians of this country, has adequate provision been made for the future supply of foodstuffs -thin k that because of this provision, Debate interrupted under Order No. 257B. Debate resumed from the 30th April (vide page 709), on motion by Mr That the bill be now read a second time. matta) [5.42] -Despit e the curiously held opinion of some members of the Government that they have a monopoly of consideration for the interests of invalid and old-age pensioners, I wish to say quite clearly that honourable members on this side of the House share the enthusiasm of the Minister for Social Services( Mr Holloway) in regard to this measure. We are pleased indeed that, amidst all the turmoil and financial stresses and strains of the war, the Government has seen its way clear to finance this measure. At some time or other, almost all the belligerent nations have claimed that they are fighting for a new social order and that unless there occurs a change of social relationships, the sacrifices that are now being exacted of the peoples of the world will be very largely in vain. I know that there are some people who will say ""Amen"" to that, but hold the opinion that the commencement of this new social order should be deferred until the sound of battle has died away. I do not agree with that view. I believe that we are more likely to succeed in this conflict if we are able to maintain the.morale of the people by giving at least an instalment of this new social order by eliminating those inequalities which are most obvious and blatant to-day. The Minister was quite justified in pointing out in his second-reading speech that that has been the attitude of quite a number of the belligerent nations, particularly those which are included in the British Commonwealth of Nations. It is true that in our invalid and old-age pensions legislation, provision is made for increases of pensions in accordance with rises of the cost of Jiving, and, no doubt, some honourable members-the y are not all on this side of the chamber if rumour be correct Standing no further enhancement of the pension",40,Position Of Export Of Primary Produce From Australia
147,Sir Frederick Stewart (Parra,"rate should be made until the termination of hostilities. equally true of the whole of our industrial wage system. There is specific provision in Arbitration Court awards for increases of wages to offset increases of the cost of living; yet, are we not hearing, ties which arise from time to time in oui day by day, of war loadings being granted to various workers, quite apart from automatic increases of the basic wage? If these loadings are presumed to be compensation for the anxieties and stresses of war exigencies, surely the invalid and old-age pensioners who share these anxieties and stresses with other sections of the community are also entitled to some consideration. a pension of 25s. a week will not allow very much riotous living on the part of the recipient. Therefore, I wish to make it quite clear that I find no difficulty whatever in concurring in the increase of pension provided for in this measure. However, whilst that increase and the improvement of other conditions, are very satisfactory to the limited number of people who are able to qualify for the invalid and old-age pension, they are not quite so satisfactory to that very large body of people who are unable to fulfil the qualifications relating to property and income. So long as the social services of the Commonwealth depend for their continuance upon the provision of treasury funds, so long must there be a means test. I appreciate that; but the time has arrived-in fact it is long overdue-when treasury provision should be supplanted by some other system which would enable the means test to be forgotten. Security in old age will be a grossly incomplete thing in Australia until it is available to all, and no*, merely to the few who are ahle to conform to certain tests. Even the most sympathetic administration cannot overcome the difficulenacted during the regime of the Menzies ties which are inherently associated with a pensions scheme such as that operating in Australin to-day. Por instance, take the case of a person who, through care and thrift has been able to aggregate a sum of, say, £400, and has invested it in war l^as which give a return of about £14 a year or a little more than 5s. a wrek. That individual is automatically excluded from participation in the penSir Frederick Stewart. sion scheme, whereas if he had not made But that argument is any effort to save that money, he would have been entitled to 25s. a week, paid fortnightly through the post office. It if not necessary for me to cite to honourable members instances of the many inequali pensions legislation, but I express the hope, which I am confident is shared by many honourable members, tha< very soon we shall see the present system of social services superseded by one which is more universal in its application. It if true that we have on the statute-book today, national insurance legislation which is designed to do the very thing which I At any rate, am now advocating. Why is that measure not in operation now? Because the Government of the day was told by financial advisers that it would be impossible to provide £2,000,000 per annum to financithe scheme without seriouslv disturbing the financial structure of the Commonwealth. I wonder what these financial advisers are thinking to-day. Since thai time, the Parliament of the Commonwealth has passed legislation providing for the expenditure of up to £13,000,000 a year on child endowment, and expenditure on the war has reached the colossal figure of approximately £1,000,000 a day. I am afraid that . far too long has the treasury view that social service? can be financed only by means of surplus funds, prevailed. The care and sustenance of the aged and infirm is as much a charge on the national that system of finance by pool as is the wage of the workers in the community who are fit and well. Whilst the increase of the pensions rate is undoubtedly one of the most important features of this bill, that, of course, is not the only aspect from which it should be considered. Of the present increase of ls. 6d. a week now proposed to be given to pensioners, 6d. is due to legislation Government, and of the total increase of 4s. since the rate was fixed at £1 ls. a week, ls. 6d. a week is due to legislation enacted at the instance of that Government, 2s. 6d. being due to legislation brought down by the present Government. Other features of the bill are also important. I am glad to know that this measure will remove what has been a blot on our social legislation ever since the passage of our pensions legislation. I refer to the removal of the disqualification for the pension of Australian aborigines. I am glad that I was a member of the Government that established the precedent of recognizing the right of aborigines to participate in the benefits of our social services. They are now obtaining the benefit of the child endowment legislation passed by the Menzies Government, and I am glad that that principle is being followed in the present bill, which will enable aborigines, at the discretion of the Commissioner of Pensions, to receive the pension. I am also glad to know that provision is being made to pay the pension to those persons who are described in this measure as ""Kanakas"", being the residue of imported labour used in Queensland many years ago in the production of sugar. There may be some danger in leaving the definition of ""Kanaka"" as it now stands in tbe bill, and I suggest that the matter should receive consideration at the hands of the Minister. It is gratifying to know that provision is being made to increase the permissible income of blind persons. The present legislation provides that all grades of pensioners may earn up to 12s. 6d. a week without affecting the pension, but there has always been a special provision with regard to blind persons. law stands at present, they may earn up to £3 17s. 6d. a week. I understand that that limit was fixed when it represented the amount of the Commonwealth basic wage, and the bill proposes to take that wage as the figure representcontemplated the removal of the discriming, the permissible total income of blind persons. That is also a feature of the bill with which I am in hearty accord. Another provision of the measure, however, is not so acceptable to me. I refer to the method of computing the payments to pensioners who find it necessary to enter hospitals. The present practice under the statute is for pensioners who enter hospitals to have their pension susaffliction as compared with one suffering pended entirely for four weeks, after which they are entitled to a special hospital pension of 7s. 9d. a week, the other 1.5s. 9d. a week being paid direct is really against the pensioners' children. by the department to the hospitals concerned. It is now proposed that the answer (o that would be that the pension department should take no cognizance whatever of the entry of pensioners into hospitals; in other words, the pension will continue, leaving the pensioners to niak<such arrangements as they desire with the hospitals. ""When I was Minister for Social Services. I received many complaints from hospitals that they wer*> being unfairly dealt with because during the first four weeks in hospital the pensioner received no payment from the department. Of course, the pension is payable on the patient leaving the hospital, but the hospital had then lost its opportunity to secure the portion of the pension to which it was entitled. If discussion* have not already begun with the hospitals on this matter, I suggest that they should be consulted before such a serious departure is made from the present practice. Whilst some hospitals have not been keen on taking even that portion of the pension to which they are entitled under the act, seeing that hospital finances are affected, they should have been consulted regarding this proposed amendment of the law. It is not proposed to alter the arrangement whereby inmates of benevolent homes are paid a partial pension and the balance of the pension is paid direct to the homes. I regret that the long-standAs the ing discrimination against patients in mental hospitals is not to be removed under the bill. The present provision has never pleased me, and if an opportunity such as this bill provides had heen presented to me, I should have seriously ination against those patients. Even when this bill has been passed, patients on entry to mental hospitals will lose their pensions altogether, and these will not be restored until they leave the institutions, whether the time be two, four, six, or even eight weeks or years, later.

The joint committee has dealt with the matter, and has recommended that certain allowances be paid to the dependants of pensioners. inmates of mental hospitals have to maintain the elderly patients, even thougn they be 70 years of age. mental hospital authorities are a great deal more insistent on payment being made for the maintenance of inmates than are the hospital boards in respect of the maintenance of the inmates of ordinary State hospitals. I hope that the Minister will consider whether it is possible to remove the discrimination. If , as I believe it to be, the many other ways. The claim that the explanation is that the care of the physically afflicted is the responsibility of the State, that is equally true of the mentally sick; but, under this bill, it is 'proposed that the pension shall continue while the physically sick are inmates of hospitals and the pensions of the mentally sick shall be stopped immediately. that the Parliamentary Social Security Committee recommended that a consolidation of the Commonwealth social security legislation should be undertaken. his second-reading speech the Minister indicated that it was the intention of the Government to proceed with the consolidation of the social security legislation. For too long have the artificial barriers of State boundaries created disparities in the treatment of persons living in different States. I hope that the Government will pursue its policy of taking over the various social services throughout the Commonwealth so that citizens in each part of Australia will be able to share equally in the benefits of the legislation. [ trust that the present system of social services, based as it is on Treasury benevolence, will soon be supplanted by a system under which every member of the community will contribute during his working years and be able, in time of affliction or old age, to obtain the benefits provided for him. with much of what has been said by the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) who has spoken on behalf of the Opposition members. It was with pleasure that I heard him say that some Opposition members shared the enthusiasm of Government supporters for this measure. I am also in agreement with his remarks in regard to the need for a new social order, and the reasons he advanced for improving our social services. Althoughi t may not be generally accepted, many leading thinkers of the day are advocating social reforms at present rather than at the end of the war. He also subscribes to this view. In my opinion, we should proceed systematically to improve social services, not only old-age pensions, but also in time is not opportune for the Commonwealth to deal with social legislation has always been used by those who are opposed to such reforms. There are still many anomalies in the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act, and I am not unmindful of the fact that previous governments did something to rectify some of those anomalies, particularly while the honourable member for Parramatta was Minister for Social Services. Had he had his way on all occasions probably many other improvements would have been made. The anomalous provision of a £400 property limit has prevented many people from obtaining old-age pension. Because of their thrift, they have been able to accumulate a small amount of property and have thereby been precluded from participation in the benefits of the act. I have been interested to hear of the fate of the National Insurance Act. It is not permissible at this juncture to discuss that act at length, but when the bill dealing with that subject was before the House Opposition members of the day, particularly the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn), persistently and effectively pointed out the anomalies in that measure which would prevent it from functioning as a satisfactory national insurance scheme. Proper provision for social services is as important as wage rates, and I am in entire agreement with the honourable member for Parramatta on that subject.",43,Holloway

154,Mr Barnard (Bass) [6.2],"I agreeLt was with pleasure that I noticed that aborigines are provided for in the bill. I commend the Minister for Social Services and the Government for their prompt action in honouring the promise of the Labour party that invalid and old-age pensions would be increased to £1 5s. a week. Even in the present critical 3tage of the war, when all the resources of the nation are needed for the war effort, I believe that the increased benefits to be granted to pensioners under this bill are fully justified. Nothing less should be granted. In his second reading speech the Minister gave a broad outline of the social services policy of the Government, of which this bill forms part. The Government regards the social welfare of the people as of secondary importance only to the demands of the war, and there is nothing incongruous in its determination to put its policy into effect concurrently with the nation's war exertions. The urgent need for consolidation of our social security legislation is appreciated by all members. The Parliamentary Social Security Committee, of which I have the honour to be chairman, dealt effectively with that question in its first interim report presented in September last, when it recommended that the consolidation should be undertaken as soon as possible and that a Commonwealth Social Security Act administered by the Department of Social Services be passed, the scope of the act to be sufficiently comprehensive to embrace all Commonwealth social legislation. Any legislation passed in the future should be included from time to time as part of the social security plan -for Australia. I trust that the Minister will take early action to have such a measure drafted, and that it will be presented to this House in tbe very near future. In its first interim report, the Joint Committee on Social Security drew attention to the advances in social legislation that had been made in other countries, particularly the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United States of America. It stressed the need for Australia to make up the leeway by a plan of social development, incorporating protection of the family against poverty and hardship. spected some of the homes of old-age Implementation of the policy underlying pensioners, and found that, in many in a Commonwealth Social Security Act would be a first step in this direction. In urging its early introduction and adoption, I wish to make it clear that I fully appreciate that the first call upon our resources must be for the successful prosecution of the war, and that during the present critical stage of the struggle, we cannot hope to introduce all the social security measures that we regard as necessary to the contentment of the Australian people or the provision on their behalf of essential safeguards against social insecurity. A number of these must be deferred until the war situation and economic circumstances permit their introduction. It is important at this stage, however, that a legislative framework of social legislation be introduced, embracing basis principles, and allowing for the incorporation of security measures as they are adopted by Parliament in the future. If this be done, a contribution will be made towards post-war social security, which, as time goes on, will prove increasingly beneficial and provide an essential basis upon which to develop post-war security. The Government has already gone a long way by removing objectionable anomalies that existed in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, under the measure now before the House. This represents a considerable liberalization of our pensions legislation. 1 should like to have the Ministers assurance that administrative action in regard to a number of important constructive proposals in relation to social security development will not be deferred. First, there is the matter of homes for pensioners. I realize that the shortage of v labour and materials, in conjunction with the man-power question generally, makes it very difficult to give effect to these proposals at present; but I put it to tlie House that pensioners are grossly exploited by unscrupulous land-lords, who charge extortionate rents for single rooms with the most meagre and even crude conveniences. Silting suspended from 6.15 to S p.m. Joint Committee on Social Security instances, there was a total absence of those",44,Holloway
155,Mr Babnabd,"Members of theamenities which, should' properly he enjoyed by the pioneers who now, in the evening of their lives, have fallen on hard times. The bill also provides for the vocational training of invalid pensioners, and for the training of invalids who have not yet reached the age of sixteen years, when they become eligible for an invalid pension. There is also a provision for the engagement of trained social workers to assist in the administration of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and other social legislation. These are positive measures which will confer important benefits, psychological and economic, upon the sick and indigent. The bill provides for an increase of the maximum rate of invalid and old-age pensions to 25s. a week, and the Government U also to be commended upon having prodded that the pension shall not fall below 25s. without the express approval of Parliament. I am glad that the Government has retained the provision for the automatic variation of the rate of pension in accordance with the cost of living index figure, because this will entitle pensioners to an increase should there be a rise in the dost of living. The benefits of this far outweigh any additional administrative cost that might be involved. Eor the first time in the history of Australia provision is made for the provision of social benefits to aborigines. ' Sir first time; child endowment has been paid to aborigines. aborigines have not, up to the present, been eligible to receive invalid and old age pensions. This measure, therefore, represents an improvement of our attitude to the original owners of Australia, and confers upon them a measure of justice which has been too long delayed. Surely no one has a greater right to he protected against destitution than has the Australian aboriginal. Because of the extremely primitive conditions under which most aborigines live, it is necessary to restrict these benefits for the present to those whose living conditions are more or less similar to our own. This measure will, I believe, help to inculcate a higher standard of citizenship in large numbers of aborigines. I believe that the Government is justified, particularly in view of the comparatively small number involved, in providing for the payment of pensions to Kanakas who settled many years ago in the northern part of Australia. I am convinced that the action of the Government in thus providing greater benefits for invalid and old-age pensioners will meet with general approval in this House and throughout the country. Australia is a country blessed with great natural resources, and we must move forward-perhap s slowly at present-to wards the provision of improved social conditions for every one as a guarantee against hardship and poverty. We must ensure that every adult is physically and mentally equipped to assume the responsibilities of citizenship, and that every child has sufficient food and clothing, and the opportunity to fit itself to take its proper place in the community. To this end we must plan for the future so that, as we approach the period of post-war reconstruction we shall have schemes developed for the re-employment of the large number of men and women who will be released from the fighting services and from war-time industries, and who will be seeking to re-establish themselves in the economic life of the country. There is a real danger that, owing to the gravity of the war situation, we may he tempted to overlook this important aspect. In conclusion, I cannot do better than quote Roosevelt to the recent International Labour Office Convention at Washington. He saidIn the process of our working and fighting for victory, he said, we must never permit ourselves to forget the goal that is beyond victory. The defeat of Hitlerism is necessaiy so that there may be freedom; but this war, like the last war, will produce nothing but destruction unless we prepare for the future now. We plan now for the better world that we aim to build. If that world is to be a place in which peace is to prevail, there must be a more abundant life for the masses of the people ol all countries. In the words of the document that you know of under the name of th* Atlantic Charter, we ""desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, for all, improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security."" There are so many millions of people in this world who have never been adequately fed and",45,Holloway
156,Mr Barnard,"That is true, butclothed and housed. By undertaking to provide a decent standard of living for these millions, the free peoples of the world can furnish employment to every man and every woman who seeks a job. And so we are already engaged in surveying the immediate post-war requirements of a world whose economies have been disrupted by war. We are planning not to provide temporary remedies for the ills of a stricken world; we start now on the work of filling it in, and are planning to achieve permanent cures-to help establish a sounder life. [ hope that this hill is the forerunner of other social legislation designed to improve the living standards of the people. I hope, also, that we shall not allow ourselves to be deceived by assertions that we lack the money necessary to improve social conditions. The theory that things cannot be done because of a lack of money has been exploded during the last year or two, and the people of Australia and of the other democracies will never again be content with things as they were. On the foundation of their democratic institutions they will build a fuller and better way of life. bill will meet with general approval throughout Australia. I do not propose to discuss -the measure in detail, but content myself with suggesting that the amount which old age pensioners are allowed to earn without disqualifying themselves for a pension should be increased beyond 12s. 6d. a week. I say that in spite of the fact that such a provision would increase the number of pensioners. As against that, it would have the advantage of releasing for war work a large number of men who, though not representing first class labour, would be able to make a valuable contribution to production. I should like to see the amount increased to at least £1 a week. I desire to address my remarks particularly to the part which this bill will play in the general scheme of our social services. Naturally enough, the winning of the war comes first at present, but after that our programme is very vague. It has been said that we should put our own house in order before setting out to establish a better world order. Victory is essential, but victory alone is not enough; we must decide what we want, economically and socially, and then set out to achieve it. The Atlantic Charter prescribes the four freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of religious observance, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Those are the four sides to the square, but the square has to be filled in in greater detail. We should we should encourage other democratic countries to do the same. Hitler's new order has been long proclaimed, and Germany is making war, not only with the sword, but also with ideas which are, in many instances, stronger than the sword. Hitler's new order cannot be bought for 6d. at the bookstalls, but its principles are more clearly understandable than are those of the new order which the democracies talk about. His new order is founded on a very low estimate of human nature; it has its roots in the Nazi conception of the State, namely, that the State is the only thing that matters, that the individual lives only for the State, and that the spiritual outlook and morality of the individual can be moulded by compulsion. That order is being broadcast to-day, not only in Germany, hut also throughout the world, as one of the highest ideals of humanity. The state of affairs which that particular order has brought into being in Germany has actually produced much of positive value in that country. The worker has been given security of employment, reasonable stability of prices, housing, and amenities during leisure; and he has been promised a people's car. The industrialists in Germany have been given new industries and security of markets. Under this order, Germany as a whole has recovered self-respect, and a considerable measure of prestige in the eyes of the world by force of arms. On the economic side, Germany's plan means the domination of Europe, the breaking down of all trade barriers, and control of finance, industry and markets. Supply will be provided by the countries subject to German domination, and Germany will be the consumer. This new order has attained wide acceptance in not only Germany but also in other countries, for instance, South America. If we are to fight Germany we should fight it not only with arms but also with ideas. We must",46,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President
157,Mr Ryan (Flinders) [8.10],"Thiswork out these ideas ourselves. What has happened in Germany is this: While, no doubt, hundreds of thousands of Germans hate the new order, at the same time, hundreds of thousands-and this is undeniable-are imbued with fanaticism in the carrying out of Germany's new order, not only inside, but also outside, Germany. The latter see in that new order a messianic mission; and it is this fanaticism which represents the main difficulty we are up against to-day. We must, therefore, evolve ideas which will capture the mind of the world to a greater degree. It cannot be denied that Germany is achieving a large measure of success by force of arms. It is our duty to do something to counteract, not only Germany's arms, but also its ideas. Whatever we may say about Germany's new order, and the fanaticism which that order produces, it is nevertheless true that, to-day, there is to he found among the people of Germany an inspiration which far transcends anything that is to be found among the democratic peoples. The Germans have ideas for which they are fighting. Our ideas, apparently, are still negative. I repeat, therefore, that we must set about working out ideas of our own new order to counter-act Germany's ideas and in order that we may carry our mission throughout the world, as we have done in the past. In this country, to-day, many people do not realize the imminence of the danger that confronts us. It has been truly said that the strongest urge within man is the urge for existence. However, thousands of people, either because of their remoteness from the scene of conflict, or because of their inability to understand the implications of present events, are unable to comprehend the danger in which our country stands. Many of these people are obsessed by the difficulties which they have experienced in the past, and are imbued with the new theories which have swept through the world during the last twenty years. They are discontented with the present social order. They are fearful that when this war comes to an end they will still be faced with the same old order. Moreover, they are unconvinced by the pious platitudes which fall from the lips of politicians, and are published in the press. What these people require is some itr. Ryan. indication that something definite will' be done to alter the present social order, and that their leaders are planning a better future for them and their children. I do not think that we can expect to go forward with brave and hopeful hearts to the conflict if we think that we are going to come out of it as destitute as we went into it. It has been said that the present is not the time to plan; that, in the turmoil of war, it is impossible to lay down foundations for any future order, because such foundations would be unstable. The bricks are lying about us to-day; but these people argue that the site for the proposed construction has not yet been surveyed, and, in many respects, no site at all has been decided upon. Therefore, it is impossible now to plan for the future. I cannot agree with that contention. I believe that now is the time to plan for the future. Unless we start to do so immediately, we shall not be able to give the inspiration essential to the development of a strong and healthy society in the future. The sooner we start to plan comprehensively for the future, the greater the scope of our planning, the greater will be the likelihood of its acceptance by the people as a whole, and the greater the measure of inspiration we can hope to impart. History shows that ideas are stronger than the sword. Whilst in the last war, we triumphed by force of arms, it is certainly true that that triumph was accelerated to a very great degree by the ideas put forward by the democratic countries, in particular, Wilson's fourteen points. They had an enormous effect upon German opinion. It is something of that kind that we should put forward to the world to-day. So far we have not done so. The second point I wish to make is in respect of social legislation in this country. So far, this legislation has been dealt with in piecemeal fashion. The first step was to institute the old-age pension in 1908. That has been followed by a number of other measures; but these have been entirely unconnected, and, so far as I am aware, they have emerged as the result of bargaining by political parties endeavouring to outbid each other. The result has been that our social services are not connected, and are not based on a scientific plan. ""Whilst twenty years ago, Australia was able to make tbe proud claim that it led the world in social social system to which he belongs. legislation, to-'day we have fallen far behind many countries in that respect. I mention, for instance, Great Britain, the United States of America, the Scandinavian countries and New Zealand. The time has come when we should make up that leeway, and set to work to devise a coherent and comprehensive plan to coordinate our social services in an efficient public are now far greater than they and practical whole. The sooner we start upon that work the better. During the last two decades the greatest cause of social insecurity has been the fact that so many individuals have been filled with a sense of frustration and anxiety. This has produced political and social instability and unrest. These causes have been mainly responsible for the rise of Nazi-ism in Germany, and Communism in Russia. We must realize that it is the business of a democratic country to ensure that not one of its citizens shall fall below a certain standard of health and economic security because of forces over which he or she has no control. That can, and must, be done. Many people strongly object to the institution of any large scale social service system. They urge that such paternalism on the part of a government will breed a race of irresponsible citizens; that the principle of giving too much for too little will destroy initiative, and regratulate the Government upon introducduce the resourcefulness of the individual. E suggest that two principles should be applied to every individual in respect of social services. First, every citizen has with certain rights, certain obligations. To-day; we hear too much talk about the rights and far too little about the obligations. However, I believe that it is possible to establish a broader system of social services which will not produce the evils which certain people fear. This system can be established on two principles. The first is that every individual who comes under such a scheme must bear a financial responsibility in respect of the benefits he receives. He must make contributions towards the scheme. The second principle is to broaden our educational methods in order to teach the individual not only how to earn his living by the acquisition of technical and material knowledge, but also how to become an effective unit in the If those two principles are preserved, the evil which many people fear will not eventuate. In Great Britain and in other countries it has been found, after social services have operated for many years, that this evil has not occurred. Great Britain has a large range of social services, and the savings of the general were before the introduction of social services. I recommend the Government to formulate, without delay, a comprehensive scheme of social services. As I stated earlier, our objective, which is total victory, when it is reached, will be barren unless we find some way in which to achieve a total peace. The democratic countries seek no territorial gains; they do not propose to enslave other nations. But many thousands of people are longing for some form of security in the future and look to their leaders to show them the path that they should follow. Our road is well defined. The only way in which we can obtain a full realization of our aims is through the gates of victory. If we formulate our plans now, we shall produce that inspiration for the people which, at present, seems to be lacking. ing this legislation for improving the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and I am gratified that the Ministry has honoured its promise to increase invalid and old-age pensions to 25s. a week. Although the amount is not a princely sum, it will assist pensioners to meet the cost of living which has risen sharply from month to month since the outbreak of war. It is pleasing to note that 25s. a week is the minimum pension, because provision is made for the rate to increase automatically as the cost of living rises. I welcome the clause that entitles aborigines, who live under civilized conditions, to receive an invalid or old-age pension. This provision will remove a hardship that had been inflicted upon a considerable number of persons. Before they were granted a pension they",47,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President
158,Mr Clark (Darling) [8.33!],"I conhad to prove that they were not predominantly of aboriginal blood. The proposed benefit should have been granted to certain aborigines many years ago and though belated, it is most welcome. In respect of other social benefits, the practice has been followed, where the recipients live in mission compounds, for the money to be paid to the authorities, who administer it on behalf of the aborigines. In my opinion, any 1 person of aboriginal blood who is considered to be capable' of handling, the money wisely, should receive the pension personally. The equivalent should not be doled out to them in the form of rations, tn their active years, they contributed to live from day to day in fear of the development of the country, and are entitled to receive a pension on the same basis as any other citizen. At present, an old-age pensioner is permitted to earn up to 12s. 6d. a week before his pension is affected. En my opinion, that amount should be increased, as I believe that the maximum permissible income, added to the pension , is little enough to 1 pay for rent,, clothing, blankets and the necessaries of life. applies particularly to invalid pensioners, ence great difficulty in providing from upon some of whom this restriction has intheir combined pensions rent for a flicted considerable hardship because of 'the need of medicines, &c. An invalid pensioner is permitted to receive 12s. 6d. a week, provided the money comes from a source upon which he is not required to expend any effort. If the amount of L2s. 6d. is a gift, or income from property, the invalid pensioner is permitted to draw the full pension. Buti f by some slight effort he earns 12s. 6d. a week, the department deems him not to be totally and permanently incapacitated. no longer required to be totally and permanently incapacitated before becoming eligible for a pension. partment now allows 85 per cent, incapacity; but if the invalid pensioner earns a small income, his pension is reduced. He is placed on a different footing from that of an old-age pensioner. I should like to see an extension of the pensions scheme on the same basis as family endowment. Endowment is paid in respect of all children of a family with the exception of the first and regardless of the income of the parents. That is an excellent idea, because it removes the impression that a person must be almost a pauper before he may receive a social benefit In my opinion, the pensions scheme should be extended to all persons in the community. Regardless of their earnings, they should be entitled to participate in the national dividend. If they became unemployed, they would still share in the national dividend and would not be compelled to apply for the miserable dole, as people were during the economic depression. One of the greatest fears in life is economic insecurity. Many people what the morrow will hold for them. I recommend that 25s. should be paid to the husband, 25s. to the wife, and 5s. in respect of each child. That would be a guaranteed income to a family whether or not the husband had employment. The adoption of this plan would represent a remarkable social advance. Wages would be affected accordingly, and industry could be taxed for the purpose of providing this national dividend. This contention At present, an aged couple expericomfortable and respectable dwelling. Government housing schemes should include homes for invalid and old-age pensioners at reasonable rentals, and I hope that in the very near future, legislation will be introduced to achieve this objective. Another matter to which I desire to draw attention is most important. A husband might be receiving an invalid pension, and his wife might decide to seek employment in order to augment the family income. If the husband is receiving the proposed full rate of pension of £1 5s. a week, his wife will be permitted to earn a similar sum before his pension is effected. If the wife should earn £2 a week, one-half of that amount would be charged as income to the,husband and his pension would be reduced accordingly. He would be permitted to receive an income of 12s. 6d."" a week but because of the wife's earnings, his pension would be reduced by 7s. 6d. a week. That ia definitely an anomaly. If the husband and wife were",49,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President
159,Mr James,An invalid pensioner is,50,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President
160,Mr Clark,"I believe that the deeach receiving a pension and one of the parties were earning £2 a week, each of them would be entitled to £1 17s. 6d. a week, which includes the pension and earnings, and their combined income would be £3 15s. a week. If the husband alone receives a pension and his wife works, the combined incomes would be reduced by 17s. 6d. a week. ' I am sure that the Minister will rectify that anomaly, now that I have brought the matter to his notice. I join with other honourable members in stating that, although war expenditure has increased the Commonwealth budget to £350,000,000 a year, this is the appropriate time for Parliament to increase social benefits. As I stated earlier, £1 5s. a week is not a princely sum, and pennioners are not likely to be accused of being guilty of extravagant spending upon non-essential goods, thus absorbing man-power that is required for war industries. The invalid and old-age pension is one of the most important payments that Australia is making to the people. Aged persons, during their working life, contributed to the national wealth. For their great pioneering work, the country owes them a substantial debt, and the pensions which they are granted are something to which they are justly entitled. The payments are definitely not a charitable gift to them from the nation. [ hope that the Minister will cover the points that I have raised regarding a wife and invalid husband, the payment of pensions to aborigines, the income limit and provision for housing and other social benefits for pensioners. 18.44] -My views upon the subject of invalid and old-age pensions are well known to honourable members. The title of this bill is wrong. It should read ""Bigger, better, brighter and more beautiful pensions for everybody"". There must be some limit beyond which even this Government cannot go in the payment of pensions and when I refer to ""this Government"" I do not confine my remarks to honourable members opposite. There are quite a few honourable gentlemen, who, somewhat mistakenly, remain on this side of the chamber. No doubt their true judgments will bring them some day over here, where they belong. The argument that now, when this country is struggling for its existence, and when the Japanese are threatening a major invasion of our coasts, is the time to talk about a new order and to increase the burdens on the shoulders of the taxpayers, is an argument to which I cannot subscribe. It is only in a community like this, which is pervaded by a sense of complete and utter irresponsibility, that such a proposal could be made. There is no sense of reality about these matters in this Commonwealth. There are many problems facing the nation, and there are many obligations that this Government and this Parliament can honour. I know that the Government carries many obligations, and later it will carry many more. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) has been pressed in such a way this afternoon that I am sure the Government will have to attach a label to him, so that he will know himself. tive, not destructive, as the honourable member for Barker always is.

When the honourable member for Wimmera and the Minister for Commerce( Mr Scully) sat on this side of the House, important contracts-if I may use that term in this place-were entered into between the Opposition, my friends, and the wheat-growers of Australia. As the expenditure of public money is involved in this bill, may I ask the honourable member for Wimmera to stand up and say what he intends to do about those contracts? It is time some one in authority stated what it is intended to do to honour the obligation freely and publicly entered into between the present Government, its supporters, and the wheat-growers, who were asked to do a certain thing at a certain price, but who have not received their money.

I am one of those who believe in doing my bit overseas, and not at home. Some of my friends think that when we are engaged in war we should bomb and blast our own territory, but I believe in bombing the other fellow. The Labour party cannot expect to increase social benefits while terrific burdens are being placed on the people by the war. It is doing certain things, the effect of which will not appear for a little while, and it is my earnest wish that when those effects do appear, it will still be in power to deal with the difficult and delicate proCom mou wealth ? blems that it is now, with the assistance of one or two members on the Opposition side of the House, creating. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) likes to talk about the new social order, but that does not help when we have an overdraft of a few millions and have more millions to pay than the overdraft limit permits. We cannot divert man-power, materials, and other elements of production into destructive channels and, at the same time, give everybody better and more attractive benefits. T am not one of those who say that the world order is perfect; nothing in this world is perfect, but I agree entirely with Ryan) that a definite relationship should be established between social benefits and social obligations. There is too much talk in this House about what people are entitled to receive from the Government, hut too little about what people are expected to do, not for the Government, but for themselves. If there were a greater measure of thrift and self-help, there would be less necessity for a bill such as we have before us to-night. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) has talked on this subject, and I am amazed that he has not, with his usual eloquence, suggested that where an old age pension is granted a brand new bright house should be added. That suggestion could be further improved, and if the Government wishes me to do so I will make further suggestions in committee. In that event even the Government might say that the cup of benefits was full to the brim, or even overflowing. I know that the numbers are against me. I realize that certain people in the community, and a large majority of members of this House, have decided that the Government is an everlasting Father Christmas, who can come down the chimney every night, it necessary, so that everybody can live happily for 24 hours.

It is all very well for the Government to say that the money can be obtained by a wonderful method of juggling with the currency, but there is an old saying that The cards heat the player "". If the Government juggles with the money system, the money system will beat the Government before it has gone far. There are aborigines in my electorate, and I do not agree that the Government should extend benefits to them. I know something about them, and, taking them as a class, they are not over-enthusiastic in doing a little toil. If social benefits are handed out, there is a strong suspicion that much of the money will not be used in a desirable way. Therefore, £ have to take my stand with the small majority of members of this house and say that the Government has gone too far. The time is coming when we should have inspections of the areas where the benefits are to be paid in order to find out what is being done with the money. For that purpose, we shall require persons with a clear insight, who do not accept statements on trust. I have no doubt that there are members in this House who, if they would state what they know, could cause the House to pause and think before it agrees to the proposal before it. This Parliament is proceeding in a happy, carefree manner, hut we await the day of reckoning. When that day comes, there will be a few members on the Opposition side who will have an account to render, for which I at least will accept payment in the only coin that is politically recognized in this place. My friends on both sides know what that is. commend the Minister for Health and Social Services( Mr Holloway) for bringing down this important proposal for social legislation. I do not agree with the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) that it will fill the cup of social benefits for the people who are helped. If is in some respects only [35] a very small contribution to their amenities of life, but it will be welcomed by them pending the introduction of a wider measure of social security as advocated by the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard), who dealt with the various matters recommended by the Joint Committee on Social Security, in the work of which he took a prominent part. There ia no need for us to take the negative attitude adopted by the honourable member for Barker. It may be appropriate for him to lament the cost of social legislation, but there is a more effective way to meet the situation. The time is approaching when some constructive proposal should he presented to provide a plan for social security, and for something in the nature of national insurance. National insurance legislation was passed by this Parliament, but, except for insignificant parts, never proclaimed. The cost of social services is increasing considerably. This year invalid and old age pensions will absorb about £20,000,000, repatriation pensions about £10,000,000 and child endowment about £12,000,000, a total of more than £40,000,000. As the result of this war the cost of repatriation pensions will rise greatly, and I dare say that it will not be long before Australia's annual social services bill will amount to £100,000,000. Honourable members will remember that the first war-time budget introduced by the then Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) contemplated the expenditure of about £100,000,000 on normal need's and on the war. The only way out of the situation is a system of national health insurance under which the people will in their working years contribute to a fund which will enable them in their declining years to receive somethingcall it a national dividend or anything you like. The aged people would much rather receive the pensions as a right than as charity as at present. 1 agree with the honourable member for Bass and the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) that now is the time to prepare for the new era of social justice. The honourable member foT Flinders appropriately contrasted our approach to the lot of the lesB fortunate people of the community to the approach of our enemies.

Social Services introducing legislation which will add £500,000 to the purchasing power of a section of the community and increase the demand for civil goods. Is this then an appropriate moment to increase pensions, not in accordance with the rise in the cost of living, for pensions have already risen in that respect, but in order to increase the spending power of the pensioners by an extra 2s. Gd. a week? That cannot square with the Government's policy to reduce the consumption of civil goods and it is completely out of accord with the general war policy of the Government. Every member on this side is in favour of granting to the pensioners all that can be granted, but, if that means more than the country can carry, the ultimate effect will be to do injury to the very people whose support is being sought by this specious means. It is necessary to take a long distance view, not a view of to-day or to-morrow, but a view of what will happen in, say, 20 years' time. Having been a president of a hospital board for a number of years and knowing, therefore, something about the needs of hospitals, I dislike the protion, those people who were brought to posal to remove the necessity upon pensioners immediately they enter hospital to contribute a substantial part of their pension to meet the cost of their maintenance. have refused to accept payment for treatment given to pensioners. any such hospital committee, but I am aware that most of the hospitals throughout Australia are in a dire financial posiThey are members of a fast-diminishtion.

If pensioners are to be treated free, where are the hospitals to get the finance that would normally come from that sourcesand it amounts to a considerable sum in the aggregate throughout the Commonwealth. The burden of financing hospitals will be placed on the State governments because they will have to make up the deficits. It means that the Commonwealth Government at the present critical juncture in the nation's history is placing a burden upon the States which, I hazard a guess, will amount to approximately £250,000 annually. guess. amount will be involved. When the question of increasing invalid and old-age pensions was being considered sometime ago, I directed attention to the plight of many old South Sea Islanders in. the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales, and in Queensland.

In that category, the Government has included aliens; Asiatics, except those who are British subjects; or aboriginal natives of Australia, Africa, and the islands of the Pacific or New Zealand. The bill then provides, further that nothing in the preceding sub-section which I have paraphrased shall apply to "" an aboriginal native of an island of the Pacific known as a Kanaka"". realize that the Minister is faced with great difficulty in this matter. ber should not attempt to make the difficulty greater, because the bill might embrace a broader interpretation than he desires.

I do not believe that a "" Kanaka"" who comes to Australia at present should be entitled to an invalid or old-age pension at the expense of this country. I do believe, however, that South Sea Islanders who come within the category I have previously mentioned should be granted an old-age pension. The difficulty could be overcome by providing that any aboriginal native of an island of the Pacific known as a "" Kanaka"" who was not in Australia prior to, say, the 31st December, 1915, which is 27 years ago, should be entitled to a pension. have come to Australia in the last 20 years ? WhilstI appreciate what the Minister has endeavoured to provide for in the bill, I am suggesting a qualification of the class of "" Kanaka"" who should be granted this privilege. They are provided for in one'clause of the bill, but are disdone. I regard an old-ago pension as dequalified in another clause. The Government must accept all responsibility for this measure; undoubtedly it will take all the credit, but I hope that the time is not far distant when Opposition members, as well as Government supporters, will see the wisdom of placing the whole of our Bocial security legislation on a contributory basis, which would give a sense of security to all who may expect to become beneficiaries. congratulate the Government and the way) upon the introduction of a measure that will give effect to a promise made by the Lahour party to the people before the end of last year. Opposition members have asked me if the promise would be honoured and I have replied that the I Labour party always carries out its promises. 1 added that if the party's promises were not carried out on this occasion, I would leave the party; but I did not say that I would cross the floor of the House. It is with much satisfaction that I find that the increased payments are to be made retrospective to the 2nd April, 1942. It reflects great credit on the Government that in a time of national crisis it has introduced legislation that will have the effect of making the Commonwealth a better place to live in, and a country to which the members of our fighting forces will be proud to return. Those who have borne the heat and burden of the day should have the sunset of their life made easy. It has been suggested that people should save for their old age; but I should like to know how a worker on the basic wage, with a wife and family to support, can hope to save sufficient to provide for his needs in his old age. It is the anxiety caused by the likelihood of need in their old age, when they are no longer able to work for their living, that causes many people to fail before their normal time. Aged parents who have given their sons and their grandsons to fight for the defence of democracy must he cared for by that democracy. They have spent the best part of their life in pioneering and building up a great Commonwealth, and have received little remuneration for the work they have ferred pay for services rendered to the nation. I hope that this measure is a forerunner to a long line of amending social legislation to be introduced by the Government. We have already in existence a child endowment scheme, and widows' and orphans' pensions and pensions for soldiers who have suffered the privations of war in the defence of Australia are being considered.

188,Minister For Social Services ( Mr Hollo,"we shall provide what should be the birth right of every person in this country-the right to work. One effect of this measure will be to quicken and stir the moral conscience of the people. We should be ashamed to think that in a land of plenty there are destitute people in our midst. After all, we are our brother's keeper and there are certain obligations in life from which none of us can escape. We have a duty to perform to the aged, the young and the helpless. I do not agree with the bogy raised by the honourable member for Barker( Mr to the people of this country. Archie Cameron) and the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), who have claimed that the time is not ripe to increase pensions. When will the time be ripe for us to bring about this muchneeded reform ? It should he the aim of ""very body to leave this world a better place than when he came into it. The honourable member for Richmond has stated that the economic system of the country cannot carry this added expense. That is typical of the viewpoint of certain members of the United Country party. If the present economic system cannot carry the burden, let us get a new one. We are gradually discarding the system that will not carry the load. The honourable member for Richmond has claimed further that we should take a long-distance view in these matters. I am afraid that he took such a long distance view of this matter that he could not see anything at all. He is like the Pharisee who passed on the other side of the road and did not see what was wrong. However, in this world of plenty, shame will make us ensure that changes are made in our social order. More and more we are recognizing that there is no wealth but human life, and no values but human values. I am confident that when this measure becomes law it will be administered in a sympathetic and humane manner. The Minister will be bound not only by the letter, but also by the spirit of the law. I hope that in due course the minimum age limits will be reduced from 65 years for males and 60 years foT females to 60 years for males and 55 years for females. It has been suggested that we cannot afford to increase invalid and old-age pensions, but I point out that a nation is wealthy only if it has a contented and happy people. One of the outstanding lessons of the present war is that if money has to be found then it can be found. We are spending approximately £1,000,000 a day on the war, and no doubt even this huge sum will be exceeded in the near future. If we can find such a colossal sum for war purposes, surely we can find a few hundred thousand pounds to benefit our aged and helpless. I am glad that the Labour party has been able to introduce this bill, and so to carry out its promise A discordant note in thisdebate was struck by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) who suggested that in legislating for au increase of 2s. 6d. in invalid and old-age pensions, the Government is doing something sinister or with an ulterior motive. Such a suggestion is unworthy of the honourable member. If I gave bread to a hungry child, would it be suggested that I had an ulterior motive or was acting in a sinister manner? I regret exceedingly that the honourable member made that suggestion. I am proud to be associated with this measure. dealing with the main object of this bill, I should like to congratulate the Government upon one special feature of it, namely, the further extension of social services to the native people of Australia as recommended by the Joint Committee on Social Security. One realizes that the management of theae people and the granting of assistance to them involves extremely complex problems such as distinguishing between tribalized and detribalized natives. Nevertheless, 1 am very glad to see the Government continuing the process of remedying some of the defects in our social legislation which have cast a reflection upon the Commonwealth ever since it assumed control of the Northern Territory in 1911, and began to introduce nation-wide social services in 1909. Dr. Charles Duguid, a very skilled and experienced worker among aborigines, presented an excellent summary of the case for them in a pamphlet published last year. Dr. Duguid says that our treatment of the aborigines during the",56,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President
189,Dr. Price (Boothby) [9.34],"Befor epast 150 years has been cruel, thoughtless and selfish, as has been the treatment of the Red Indians in ""North America, ithe difference being that during comparatively recent years the Americans have -spent tremendous sums in a successful -endeavour to redeem past errors. HG -goes on to pay a tribute to the work cf some of our past governments and ministers for improvements which they have effected in the conditions of aborigines, and mentions particularly the honson) and the honourable member for Indif aining exemption from the Aborigines 'rotection Act, many natives have acquired the white man's freedom and are receiving from the Commonwealth Government, regular payments under the child endowment scheme, but he goes on to point the finger of scorn at an anomaly which, I am glad to say, this measure will remedy. He says, "" Why any people born in Australia, who have accepted the responsibilities of full Australian citizenship, are still denied invalid and old-age pensions and the maternity bonus is a question no logic can answer. Colour is no bar to these benefits if it is Asiatic or African, but if it is Australian, one has to prove to the satisfaction of government officials that the Australian blood does not predominate "". The writer adds that, in his opinion as a medical man, the fact that so many aborigines fall victim to the terrible scourge of tuberculosis and oth«?r white man's diseases is not because the aborigines have not established immunity, but simply because they are undernourished. Sub-nutrition among our native peoples, he says, is the main reason why they are dying off, and he supports his case by citing reservations such as Swan Reach and Ooldea Soak which he declares are wholly inadequate. It has heen hinted during the course of this debate that at least part of the money which is to be distributed under this legislation may be paid through the various mission authorities and no doubt some honourable members will want to satisfy themselves that the money will be well spent. There need be no misgivings on that score because anybody who has read Bleakley's report on the appalling Dr. Price. state of the aborigines in the Northern Territory, will realize that these missions, Roman Catholic, Anglican, and of other denominations have stood out like a beacon light in helping these unfortunate people. No one 'can doubt that the missions will use the money in the best interests of the aborigines. The cost of extending these benefits to aborigines will be very small. There are only 50,000 full-blooded aborigines, of whom 25,000 are migratory. If the pension were granted to one-twentieth of the nonmigratory aborigines, the cost would be only about £30,000 a year, in a total pensions expenditure of about £19,000,000 a year. I hope that some day when the war is ended, we shall go further in this matter and copy the magnificent work that is being done in Americawork that I was i::v titrating prioT to the outbreak of the war-and that we shall see in Canberra, a separate Aborigines Department similar to the Department of Indian Affairs at Washington which, with the advice of scientific experts, doctors and so on, cares for the native peoples in the United State; of America. I should like to see our aborigines and the native peoples of our territories outside Australia, handled by one department which, with the assistance of experts, would undertake the task of raising these unfortunate individuals from the degradation to which they have been debased, in many cases by the white people. While one can have nothing but praise for the-extension of social services to the aborigines, I contend that the main proposals of this legislationI am not opposing them-requir e very careful examination, not because we are at war, or because other sections of tbe community, such as the wheat farmers, also have claims, but because we must examine thi? bill as part of our system of social services, and see how far that system is adequate. Can Australia be satisfied with its federal system of social services, consisting mainly of invalid and old-age pensions, maternity allowances, and tbe child endowment scheme which was added by the previous Government? Surely we cannot satisfy ourselves that our system, which the Joint Committee on Social Security called a system",57,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President
190,Orable Member For Gippsland ( Mr Pater,,58,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President
191,( Mr Mcewen). He Notes Also That By,"of piecemeal development, is satisfactory when we compare it with rhe systems of other countries which have made more progress. For instance, not only has Great Britain all the social services that we have to-day, hut also it has medical benefits, optical and dental benefits, unemployment insurance and widows' and orphans' pensions. In 1935 the United States of America passed its Federal Social Security Act, which provided for a tremendous scheme of social benefits. The system in that country is rhat the Federal Government supplements and assists the work of the states, and the adoption of a scheme of that kind in Australia was recommended by the Joint Committee on Social Security in its first report. The American system also emphasizes the importance of having its social workers trained in social research. I was very glad to see the Minister for War Organization of Industry( Mr schoolmasters, the lower grades of the Dedman) moving in that direction in an address which he gave recently to the universities. In America, highly expert organizations such as the Rockefeller In will ensure social security. One notices stitute are beginning to realize that in rhe past far too much money has been spent on medical and physical science, in proportion to that spent on social science. No doubt some honourable members believe that the hour when a nation is fighting for its life is not opportune to of the community, young and old, are improve social services, but there is a great deal of argument against that view, because in war-time, more than at any other time, men and women are thinking, and demanding improvement and progress. That has been the experience of Great Britain, as the Minister for Social Services indicated in his second-reading speech. Since the outbreak of war social services in Great, Britain have been improved by means of emergency powers covering national health insurance, contributory pensions, unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, invalid and old-age pensions and widows' pensions. Britain has done wliat the Joint Committee on Social Security recommended to this Parliament: It has made arrangements to cover temporary unemployment and to assist old-age pensioners and widows in the existing state of affairs. T need hardly stress the truth of the remark made by the Joint Committee on Social Security, that social services are important to our war effort in respect of morale and a willingness to work. In spite of terrific taxation, Britain has heen prepared to improve its social services system. There is taking place in that country an immense social change, which is expressed in a spirit of co-operation and service among all classes of the community. A tremendous wealth of literature is being published, which shows tha* this is happening. The change is due to mutual danger, community life in the fighting services, hospital work among the victims of Nazi savagery, home defence organizations such as the A i r Raid Precautions, and community life in the shelters and the munitions factories. That sense of service and co-operation is bringing to the forefront in Britain a new class of skilled persons-technicians , public services, -junior officers of the fighting services, and members of the women's se: vices. These, and thousands of others, are thinking about social changes that a similar spirit in our services and among the people of Australia. Members of the Australian Imperial Force who have returned to Australia, members of the Australian Military Forces, workers in munitions factories, and all other sections beginning to think about this subject. We should not be misled into the fahe belief that the desire is to supplant individualism by socialism. The people want to see what English writers call "" a people's minimum "", which will provide social security to a certain level, above which individualism and private initiative may still operate. I agree with those views. It would be tragic if we destroyed individualism and enlarged a defect that has been apparent in some degree during the course of the war. It has been shown that the great majority of the people have magnificent qualities for co-operation, service, and sacrifice; hut there is no doubt that some others have been turned into selfish slackers and leaners against posts. A study of the bill will disclose two grave faults. The first is that it consists of a part only of a complete system. No one will say that our social services, so far as they go at present, provide a complete plan for a "" national That will not be attained until we provide services that are already in operation in Britain and the United States of America. In many respects, one agrees with the critics who say that, in respect of social services, Australia has fallen behind the times. In addition to the gaps in our social services, there are other faults. For example, in regard to State services, the percentage of attendance at our universities is lower than in England, Scotland, or the United States of America, and our free library development is infinitely below the development of other countries. But there is another great danger, apart from the faults in our social services; that of social services, which are being is that, as at present constituted, they may extended in what the Joint Committee on destroy initiative, individualism and thrift, because the federal services are wholly dependent upon State help, charity and relief. It was stated to-night that they are paternal in type. I admit that it is right that the general revenue and the general taxpayer shall be responsible for the provision of the greater part of social services; hut, as has been stated hy the honourable member for Richmond( Mr growing expectation of life in the AusAnthony) and others, in certain instances, such as the receipt of pensions, help should be claimable not as a State charity only but in some degree as a return for payments made, either under a contributory scheme or by means of a special tax-which the Joint Committee on Social Security recommended in its third report on unemployment relief during the war. Its wholly paternal and charitable character is a fundamental fault of our social services system. That view is supported by leading authorities in the United States of America, where there is the same conflict between paternalism and thrift. The same difficulty is recognized in Britain, in which, in respect of old age pensions, a contributory scheme and a State gift scheme are operating side by side. In general, according to most authorities, it would seem that any plan to gain the national minimum security that we need should be a combination of both systems. For that reason, I consider that there were advantages in the scheme passed by this Parliament in 1938, which partially included a contributory Dr. Price. system. I do not want to see any plan which would impose unfair burdens on minimum"". the lower incomes, or would not give every consideration to those who might meet with misfortune; but it would be a tragedy if our national character were made to suffer because of a system which allowed even well-to-do people to waste their resources and then fall back on public relief. waste! knows perfectly well that a large number of those who receive pensions were not basic-wage earners. Consideration of old-age pensions raises the vital matter of the future cost Social Security has described as a "" piecemeal fashion "". In 1919-20, there were 134,000 pensioners in receipt of £4,500,000. In 1939-40, there were 332,000 pensioners in receipt of £16,500,000. It is estimated that in 1978 there will be 1,250,000 pensioners in receipt of over £32,000,000. This enormous estimate for 1978 is due to the tralian community which, whilst an excellent thing, will throw an increasing burden on the citizens of the working agegroups, who will have to support an increasing number of aged persons. Even before the war, with its toll of casualties, the declining birth-rate was making the. percentage of younger income-earners and taxpayers relatively smaller. In 1938, it was estimated that there were 1-00 wage earners supporting every 26 pensioners. Et has been estimated that in 1978 there will be 100 wage^earners supporting every 54 pensioners. If we continue to meet the cost of each new social service, and to increase the present social services from ordinary revenue, the burden will be higher than, the estimated Treasury contribution of £32,000,000 in 1978. The United States of America has done a lot of work in regard to this problem. At present, about 8,000,000 of a total population of 140,000,000 in that country are of 65 years of age and over. It is estimated that in 1980 there will be 22,000,000, or one-seventh of the total population, in that age-group, and that.",58,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President

The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Baker) has just said that he hoped to see the time when men will be able to retire at the age of 55 years, and women at the age of 50 years. The Americans are looking forward to the time when they will have to re-adjust their economic system in order that the older people may be able to continue to do light work for a longer period. There is another point of very great importance, and it is the last that I want to mention: The danger of political .pressures evolving as the result of a noncontributory pensions scheme. political pressure groups always seem to evolve in a democracy under such schemes. The classic example of a pressure group is the war veterans' organization, which is one of the strongest political forces in is also evidence that progress is parthe United States of America. When1 was in America some years ago, I was told that they still have on their list dependants of veterans of the Civil War of 1861-65. It was also stated that there were still left a few dependants of those who took part in the British-American War of 1813. [ found that this was possible. Americans are very anxious, because the old-age pensions groups in the United States of America have already begun to exert political pressure. The position had become so serious that the Social Security Board had heen forced to file formal charges and withhold federal assistance until political abuses by old-age pensioners had been remedied. American experts say that the outlook for the future is ominous. One authority says that the political strength of the old-age movement in the United States of America has been amply demonstrated during the last few years, both in the Federal Congress and in many of the States. But this is only a beginning. It is said that in 1980 those citizens who are 50 years of age and over will command nearly as many votes as citizens who are under 50 years of age. One authority has written that without exaggeration it may be said that the aged of that day will be able to dominate the political situation so completely that the only limitation on their power will be that of their self-restraint. One can fairly say that signs are not wanting that in this country, with its declining birth-rate, the increasing length of life of its citizens, and its increasing number of pensioners, the same thing may take place. It would be tragic if the increasing political strength of the pensioners led to competitive offers hy rival political parties, or induced members of Parliament to vote, not according to conscience, but in the interests and under the pressure of any group. Even in war-time. I am in favour of improvements in our social services. Indeed, I believe that progress is necessary. This view is held by other members of the Such Opposition, as is shown by the fact that the previous Government, which we supported, introduced the child endowmentscheme now in operation. The bringing in of this bill by the present Government ticularly vigorous in periods of violent upheaval such as war-time. Nevertheless, I believe that our present methods of providing social services have fallen behind best modern practice, in that they are so ill considered and piece-meal in character that they may bring us face to face with grave dangers in the future. The The present Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) in 1938 moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill introduced by the Government then in office. It contained the following words:The hill should be withdrawn and redrafted and a more liberal bill decreed from the defects now enumerated should be introduced without delay. Those words could be applied to this bill. My argument in this connection is in accord with the findings of the Joint Committee on Social Security, which has recommended the Parliament to pass a social security act and to develop Australian social services on an organized plan, which would provide us with an adequate and up-to-date system. tribute to the Minister for Social Services( Mr Holloway) for having introduced this bill. His action is consistent with his record over a long period of years, during which he and",60,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President
194,Mr James (Hunter) [10.2],"I payother members of the Labour party have endeavoured to effect reforms in our pensions system. I also congratulate the Government for having drafted the liberal conditions set out in the bill. The honourable member for Boothby (.Dr. Price) seems to fear what might happen in this country in 50 years time. He told us that 50 years hence so many million people would be in receipt of pensions, and so many million pounds would be required to foot the bill. He need not disturb himself about the situation in half a century. I do not think that his prophecies will he fulfilled. I hope that ive shall be living under a new order of society long before then. But even if the present order of society be continued, many workers will continue to make provision for their old age, as they are doing"" to-day. I am a believer in a proper system of contributory pensions. The previous Government introduced a bill to give effect to a contributory pensions scheme, but its basis was not equitable. The members of the Miners Federation have been agitating for a pensions scheme through their organization for many years. member for Barker Cameron), the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), and the honourable member for Boothby are not aware, of the facts, I take pleasure in informing them that the miners, by arrangement with the Government of New South Wales, are paying as much as 4s. a fortnight to a pensions fund. The workers are often condemned for not making provision for their old age, but, as I have shown, many of them have taken appropriate steps to this end. The miners pensions scheme, which is in force by arrangement with the Government of New South Wales, is designed to enable miners to retire at the age of 60 years on a pension of £2 a week and £1 a week for their wive3. The 'honourable member for Barker had a little to say about the financial difficulmothers and fathers of the men who are ties of certain hospitals. He may not be aware that for many years the miners on the northern coal-fields have paid regular contributions to the Newcastle, Wallsend, Cessnock, Kurri Kurri, Maitland, and other district ""hospitals, and that the hospital committees in those localities do Mr James. not take any part of the pension of pensioners who may enter those institutions for treatment. The miners contribute 6d. from each pay to a hospital fund, in consideration of which they are entitled to treatment for themselves and their families. I have retained my membership of the Miners Federation, and 3 also pay my fortnightly contribution. The funds accumulated through these payments have been sufficient not only to maintain the various institutions which benefit from them, but also to build new hospitals. If the hospitals in localities which the honourable member for Barker had in mind are in such financially straitened circumstances I recommend honourable members to take steps to organize a contributory scheme for them such as the industrialists have organized in the coal-fields districts of New South Wales. Unfortunately, considerable difficulty has occurred at times in obtaining refunds of pensions for pensioners who have had part of their pension improperly deducted in consequence of their entry In case the honourable to hospitals for treatment. I have ( Mr Archie written many letters to the Pensions Department on this subject, and I trust that the amendments now being made to the law will overcome these troubles. The hospitals that have been built in some coal-fields areas are a monument to the workers. The system in operation or. the Newcastle coal-fields is also in operation at Lithgow, and there is no reason why it should not he applied in many other districts. The honourable member for Barker ha* said that this liberalization of our pensions system is inopportune. It appears to me, however, that as millions of pounds can he provided for war purposes it should be within the capacity of the nation to proyide at least £1,000,000 more for pensions. Who will be helped by this liberalization of our pension? legislation? None other than the to-day fighting to retain our liberties. It might be assumed from the remarks made by the honourable member for Barker that he is hard-icarted, but I do not believe that his speech reflects hie true feelings. He would have us believe that he is a ""tough guy,"" but from conversations I have had with the honourable gentleman I have concluded, that he is not nearly as hard-hearted as his words would suggest. If we cannot do something to make the lives of our old-age and invalid pensioners more comfortable we ought at least to take steps to put them out of their misery, and not starve them to death. It would be preferable to provide a lethal chamber in which they could be put out of their misery. The increase in the rate of pension about to be sanctioned is in fulfilment of a promise made by the present Prime Minister in the policy speech he delivered prior to the last election. The proposals contained in this measure have been placed before the people and have been endorsed by them. The honourable member for Barker is associated with a party that supported a government that reduced the old-age pension by 2s. 6d. a week, and also placed a lien on the properties of pensioners, to enable the department to recover from the estates of pensioners on their death, money paid to them by way of pension. reduced the old-age pension first. helped in the reduction of the pension when he "" ratted "" on the Labour party. the party to which the honourable member belongs than "" r a t "" on the country. least has never tried to recover money paid to the pensioners. I remember some of the supporters of the honourable member warning the anti-Labour Government, which brought down legislation to deprive pensioners of their right to their own properties. The old-age pension was introduced in 1908, at the request of the Labour party, which was then a third party in the Parliament and bartered its support to an anti-Labour government, and a former member for Darling Downs, the late Sir Littleton Groom, piloted the measure through the Parliament. Various members of the Labour' party, such as the late Mr Andrew Fisher, congratulated the government of the day on having introduced the bill, and the late Sir Littleton Groom often recalled that the pension had been given as a right and not as a charity, but he pointed out that, unfortunately, it had come to be -regarded as a charity. It was actually a loan on their property because the Lyons Government provided by law that when a pensioner died the amount of pension paid would be recovered when the property was sold. The old-age pensioners have blazed the trail in Australia, and have handed down to us an inheritance of which we are proud. In the evening of their lives, they are entitled to at least a reasonable standard of comfort. Even though they are now to receive improved pension conditions, this legislation will not be perfect. I should like it to be taken a little further than is now proposed. I believe that an old age pensioner should have the right to earn, in addition to his pension, f l 10s. a week, if a single man, and double that sum if married. I pay a tribute of praise to the old-age pensioners in South Australia, where there is a dearth of labour for the munitions factories and annexes. In that State, many of the pensioners have given up their pensions, and have accepted employment in munitions works. These patriotic elderly citizens are entitled to public appreciation, particularly in view of the fact that their sons are equally patriotic and have taken their places in the fighting forces of this I would rather "" rat "" on country. When a pensioner has property apart from the home in which he resides which is non-revenue producing, it is assessed against his pension as if it were revenue producing. If a property is worth over £50, for every £10 in excess of that sum the pension is reduced by £1 a year, despite the fact that it may not be revenue-producing. The ordinary citizen is taxed only on income derived from personal exertion or other sources, but an old-age pensioner is taxed on property that is non-revenue producing by reducing his pension according to the improved value of the property. Often an elderly couple spend the evening of their lives in the old home in which they have reared their family. The house, however dilapidated it may be, has a sentimental value to them, recalling to their minds the struggle that they have undergone in raising their family. Naturally, they",61,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President

198,Mr James,"The Labour party atare disinclined to leave the house. When one of the old couple dies, the remaining partner probably agrees to reside with a son or a daughter. The property is then assessed against the pensioner. Thi3 is unfair as it is not tenanted or revenueby promising to raise their pensions. I producing. Often the valuation is an inflated one, and if the property is valued at £400 or more, the pensioner is deprived of his pension. There is also the case of the wife of an invalid pensioner, or a man with an invalid wife. Take, first, the case of a wife who is looking after an invalid husband. She may be able to go out and work. If she earns £2 a week, the pension of her invalid husband is reduced. If he is so incapacitated that he needs her attention day and night, she has to live on his pension. Surely some provision should be made for a wife in such circumstances. Then there is the other case in which the wife is an invalid. The husband goes out to work, while a daughter stays at home to look after her mother. I know of one such case in which the man earns only the basic wage, and the daughter, who is 35 years of age, devotes all her attention to looking after her bed-ridden mother. No pension is payable in respect of the wife because the husband is earning the basic wage, and no taxation relief is given to the father in respect of the daughter whom he supports. When the act was amended to increase the permissible family unit income from £1 10s. to £2 10s. a week, it was never expected that the provision would apply only in the case of invalid children. I moved that amendment and claim it was intended by me to cover all invalid wives or husbands. I trust that the Government will rectify these anomalies in the near future. It has already done a great deal for the pensioners. have often protested against the way in which pensions are doled out as the result of promises made at election time. Social services, including pensions, should be removed altogether from the sphere of politics and placed under the control of an independent commission or tribunal. I now protest against this proposal for honouring still another election promise. honourable member believe in honouring election promises? pandering to old people at election time am not opposed to improving social services, but I do protest against the manner in which it is done. The Government has been extremely generous this week. In fact, its generosity is astounding. This is the second measure of the kind presented this week. I read in the newspapers some days ago that unemployed persons are to receive pay for a period of three months. I do not think that anybody should be out of employment for three months, but I admit that that has something to do with the bill. I have in mind one promise that has noi EO far been honoured, namely, the promise tofchewheat-farmers. They delivered the goods months ago, but the promise made to them has not been honoured. Within the next three weeks, we shall be asked to provide means to meet the cost of improved social services. The Government, we have been assured-, is in such dire need of money that Parliament will be asked to pass legislation to take from the States certain rights that they have enjoyed since federation. The fact that the Government has brought in these measures to grant greater benefits to pensioners does not seem to indicate that it is in dire need of money. Our present approach to this matter of pensions is altogether wrong. The man who, during his working life, has been industrious and thrifty, and saved up a few hundred pounds, which he was patriotic enough to invest in Commonwealth bonds, is debarred from receiving a pension in his old age; but the person who has been a spendthrift all his life is entitled to receive a pension of £1 5s. a week upon attaining a certain age. It is not right that a penalty should be placed on thrift. I am glad that provision has been made in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act to adjust pensions according to variations in the cost of living. I welcome that provision, and I believe that it will have the approval of the great majority of pensioners.",63,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President

201,Mr Marwick,"I do not believe inI wish now to say something about the aborigines, whose welfare, I consider, should be the concern of this National Parliament. I believe that it would be better if, instead of paying them a pension, the money were allotted to institutions that would look after them properly. It is of little use giving an aboriginal £1 5s. a week and leaving him to shelter under the trees in the cold. A considerable number of aborigines live in the district where I reside. I know the conditions under which they live. Many of them obtain work for two or three weeks and then go bush, to live for a consupport the measure. I was particusiderable time in the open. That happens very often in the winter. I do not think that this payment of 25s. will help those people. I should prefer to see the money used to provide commonages on which these people could live in comparative comfort and peace in their declining years. Since the outbreak of the war, they have been able to render a service to the community by trapping rabbits, and by engaging in seasonal work. However, since the institution of child endowment, many half-castes do not want to work. endowment? MJ?. HOIXOWAT -Endowment has been paid in respect of very few children of half-castes who are not inmates of some institution. York and Quairading will substantiate my statement. At those places families are living under the conditions I have described. The nation has shirked its responsibilities to the aborigines for too long. Instead of providing financial assistance to them in this way, the Government should construct commonages in order to enable these people to congregate in an environment similar to that which they have been used to all their life. Under such an arrangement, they could be given proper medical attention. We have been content to leave this responsibility to religious bodies; but it member for Hunter( Mr James) and is time that the Government shouldered it. empowers the commission'er to pay the over and above the amount of their penpension direct to institutions. that he will exercise that power in cases' of the kind I have described. I do not think that the present is an opportune time to introduce legislation of this kind. Australia is struggling for its very existence; and we shall require every available penny for expenditure on defence requirements. The attitude that Parliament should at this time worry about honouring election promises made two years ago under entirely different conditions is wholly unrealistic. larly pleased to hear the speech made by the honourable member for Boothby (Dr. Price). It was a very valuable contribution to the debate. The honourable member showed conclusively that we are far behind many other countries in respect of social legislation, and that this measure does not go nearly far enough. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Marwick) said that any attempt under existing conditions to honour election promises could not be justified. All I can say is that this measure falls very far short of the promises that I made at the last general election in respect of invalid and old age pensions. Eegardless of circumstances, I should not at any time ask a human being to live on £1 5s. a week. We can find unlimited sums of money for war expenditure; butj surely, we shall not win the war if we be content to let many of our people starve. The honourable member for Swan objected to any increase of invalid and old-age pensions. manner in which it is. to be made available to aborigines and half-castes. the honourable member object to the payment of a bounty on wheat.

Only last week an old-age pensioner, approached ine and told me that he had the opportunity to do some air raid precautions work. It was to put up a protective covering over plate-glass. He asked me whether he would lose hi? pension if he received payment for this work. I was obliged to tell him that if iiis earnings throughout the year averaged more than 12s. 6d. a week, he would be disqualified from receiving a pension. Surely, there should be no objection to permitting an old-age pensioner do work of that kind. Such an arrangement would not involve the country in any cost; but, on the other hand, many able-bodied men perhaps could be relieved for more urgent work. The honourable member for Hunter also instanced the case of the wife of an invalid pensioner who 13 obliged to remain at home in ord'er to attend to her husband. Some provision should be made in respect of a woman placed in that position. I sincerely hope that tlie Minister will accept amendments dealing with cases of the kind I have mentioned. I am hopeful that later, many medical benefits which the Government of New Zealand has granted to pensioners in that dominion wilt be introduced in. the Commonwealth; and that our social' legislation will be greatly improved by the Labour Government. I congratulate the Government and the Minister for Social Services( Mr receive weekly a small grant of rations Holloway) upon introducing this legislation to improve the Invalid and Old age Pensions Act. Some years ago in this chamber, I advocated an increase of invalid and old-age pensions,, and the then Treasurer ( Mr Casey) assured me that the necessary legislation would be introduced. It has been left to a Labour Government, in war-time, to give effect to my wishes. In my opinion the position of the aborigines in Australia would not be so had as it is if all governments had done as much for them as has the Government of Queensland. Comparatively few aborigines a-rc walking about in that State. Most of them live on mission stations-. The honourable member foi Swan( Mr Marwick) declared that the Government, instead of paying to aborigines a pension of £1 5s. a week, should use the money to provide permanent shelter for them. Prom my extensive knowledge of the habits of aborigines, I contend that the quickest way to kill them is to place them in a home. Even on the mission stations, some of them at times become unmanageable and insist upon "" going walkabout"". However, many of them on mission stations, such as Lockhart, Mapoon, Arakun and Weipa missions, work among the stock and their efforts return to the establishment a considerable sum of money from the sale of cattle. The aborigines are treated well, and lead a better life than they would if left to their own devices. I see no objection to granting assistance in those cases, and I doubt whether the suggestion of the honourable member for Swan would be of advantage to tlie aborigines,, because I am under no illusion as to who would ultimately get the money. They would not belong to the Labour party 1 Kanakas, who were "" black-birded "" to Australia many years' ago by undesirable elements who claimed that they were developing the country,, will be entitled, under this legislation, to receive the pension. These old men, few of whom are under 70 years, of age, would not number more than 100, and they a<re living in small groups in New South Wales and Queensland. From the Government, they valued at a. few shillings.. I am happy to say that in several places ins Queensland, assistance has been extended to them by farmers who have made available small plots of land on which they build miamias and grow vegetables. A pension of £1 5s. a week will be an enormous boon to them, and I congratulate the Minister upon his humane action in extending to this small group the benefits of the: act. Like many honourable members, I should like invalid and old-age pensions to be further increased but I consider that in view of the circumstances, the Government has done a wonderful job. The honourable member for Boothby (Dr.",65,Frederick Stewart No T The Briefly From The Remarks Of President
210,"Mr Martens (Herbert) [10,40]","Price) stated tliat in 1938, certain benefits were granted and more were promised. Tbe conditions that existed in that year were vastly different from those prevailing to-day, when the Government has to provide for enormous war expenditure. But it has not forgotten the claims of the pensioners. The Lyons Government had an opportunity in 1933 to introduce these benefits, and I keenly appreciate the fact that the then Minister for Social Services( Sir Frederick Stewart) would have heen much more liberal had certain influences not been brought to bear upon him to restrain him from acting upon his personal inclinations. On that occasion I invited him to record his vote against the coterie which then governed the country. In conclusion, I appreciate the introduction of this legislation, which will be a boon to invalid and old-age pensioners. At present, there are, in South Australia, thousands of between the ages of 65 and 70, who could render invaluable service in munitions annexes and factories, and I invite the Minister for' Social Services( Mr given to men who enlisted in the previous Holloway) to consider the advisability of using this reserve of man-power. They should be paid the basic wage, less the amount of the pension that they receive. It is utterly impossible to find the manpower that is required in South Australia for its munitions industries, but thousands of pensioners who are willing and able to work would relieve the position. However, they fear that if they engage in this work, they will forfeit their pension and experience considerable difficulty in having it restored at,, a later date. These men possess considerable ability and can. do the work as capably as a man aged 25 years. Many young persons are compelled because of disability, to apply for the invalid pension, but they could be trained in some light work. This instruction would provide them with an interesting life and would enable them to become independent of Government assistance. I a.=k the Treasurer to give earnest consideration to those two matters. adjourned. -GLASS MANUFACTURERS COMPANY PROWOOD SUPPLIES. That the House do now adjourn. direct the attention of the Government to an important matter, which demonstrates the urgent necessity for bringing the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act into line with conditions due to the present war. Honourable members have heard a good deal about a "" lost legion"" of Australian soldiers who were reported to have landed in Java. It will appear from the facts ""that I shall place before the House that there is in this country s lost legion of men who have served in the present conflict and have been discharged because of disabilities that have rendered pensioners them of no further use in the fighting services. No provision has been made for their welfare, despite the assurance given to them-a n assurance similar to that war-that on their return they would find Australia to be a land fit for heroes to live in, instead of which they found it a land of broken promises, unemployment, and doles. The case I wish to refer to relates to a constituent of mine, who was an original ANZAC in the Great War, in which he served for four years. He was at the landing on Gallipoli, and served for a considerable period during this war as a member of the Australian Military Forces. He was injured in an accident while riding on a military truck with 22 other men, and as a result he was disabled, probably permanently, and was discharged from the forces. On his discharge he found that the department had not a civilian suit to fit him, and he had to wear .his military uniform for some time. He applied for a pension, and was told that none was available because he did not come within the provisions of the Repatriation Act. He could not obtain work, and he had to accept food relief.

I wish to cite the facts in his own words, as expressed in this letter to meDear Sir, Just a few lines to let you know of the treatment I have received from the Defence Department; on the 28th March, 1941, I was in a military truck with about 22 others, when it turned over between Casula and Liverpool. I sustained broken bones in my right instep and also head injuries. I was taken to the 113th Australian General Hospital at Concord. I was discharged from there at the request of my unit, who wanted me back on the 18th August, 1941, and I resumed f u l l duty on the 21st August, 1941, wearing a felt slipper as I could not wear a shoe or boot, and I was walking with a stick issued to me on the 7th December( It h in k ) . I was sent to the ShowMadigan, my Commanding Officer, and pushed grounds to be medically boarded. I appeared before Uie board, and I was declared medically unfit because of my injuries. I was to be discharged on the 22nd December, 1941, but I objected to the medical officer on the grounds that I was not in a position to earn my own living in civil life. The doctor agreed, and deferred my discharge. I was called up for examination on the 17th January, 1942. The medical officer told me that my foot would never get any better and advised me to be discharged, and assured me that if I reported to the Repatriation Department they would look after my welfare. SoI agreed to be discharged. Captain Jackson, another medical officer signed my discharge sick report and he also (when I asked him) said that I was to report to the Repatriation and all would be well with me. SoI accepted my discharge which took effect on the 22nd January, 1942. When I returned my equipment, the discharge wing at the Showground did not have a civilian suit to go within six inches of my waistline. They measured me and told me it would take about three months to make. I had no other clothes of my own, so that after a big fight with them. I got a signed paper allowing me to wear my uniform until such time as they can secure a civilian suit for me. So that now I am a civilian walking around in uniform. As I could not put in my uniform they booked me with £2 12s. 3d. until I do return it. A t that time. I had £2 5s. Gd. due to me on my pay-book, which they withheld until they get the uniform. I reported to the Repatriation first told that I had no claim upon them as I wa.s a .F.T.D. man on home service, but my accident occurred in the Army and I thought it was up to them to do something for me. AnyhowI filled up a form of application pension, but I could get no sustenance. that after seeing Mr A. L. Lamb, M.L.A. (he advised me to write to you), I drew my first food relief to-day. I have now no money or clothes. only a uniform to wear. I have seen the legal adviser at the District Finance Office, and Mr Morgan. he has gone into my case and he is very definite that I must receive something as I have a definite claim. He got in touch with Captain Forsythe, Q Section, Victoria Barracks, and explained everything to him. He (Captain Forsythe) is writin g to my unit and to Army Head-quarters, Melbourne, and I believe their decision is final. I would appreciate anything you can do for me, as I don't know what w ill become of us. I have taken over a war-service home and got furniture on time payment. I have a wife and two children, aged six and four years. I served four years in the last war. I was at the landing at Gallipoli, and I have been in the R.A.F. at the School of Military Engineering at Liverpool for sixteen months. I would appreciate if you could give me an interview, when I could explain everything more fully and make my case more concise. I contend that myself, my wife, and kids have received a very raw deal. I was enlisted at the request of Lieutenant-Colonel C. T. out just at their pleasure without any consideration of me and mine. Thanking you in anticipation, Your faithfully , (Signed) PEROT HOLMES .

On 28th March, 1941, he was in a military truck w i th about 22 others when it was overturned near Liverpool and he sustained broken bones in right instep and also head injuries, and was admitted to 113th A.G.H. On 21st August, 1941, he resumed f u l l duty with his unit but was unable to wear shoe or boot and got along with the help of a stick. Earlyi n December he was medically boarded and declared medically unfit. His discharge was deferred by the medical officer until 22nd January, 1942, when he was recommended to report to the Repatriation Department. When he returned his military equipment the department was unable to provide him w it h a civilian suit and he was given a signed and I was authority allowing him to wear uniform until such time as a civilian suit could be issued to him, but debited him with £2 12s. 3d. pending return of the uniform. An amount of £2 os. Gd. to his credit in his paybook was for withheld. On applying to the Repatriation So Department, Mr Holmes was informed that he had no claim on the department as he was an F.T.D. man on Home Service. He filled in a pension application but could get no susI cannot get a job because I have tenance. He is now on food relief. He has neither money nor clothes and can get no work as he is in uniform. He has made inquiries at the District Finance Office and been advised that inquiries are being made into the matter. Mr Holmes is a returned soldier of the last war and had been at the School of Military Engineering at Liverpool for sixteen months prior to his accident. He has a wife and two children, aged, respectively, six and four years. You will realize that, as he is in receipt of food relief from the State government, the family are in dire straits. The letters "" A . I . F . "" in t h a t letter should have heen ""A.M.F."". I proceeded in the letter to relate the other facts, and lo point out the unfortunate condition of in which the act should be this discharged soldier. I received a The sections dealing with onus of proof tentative reply on the 3rd February, in are not being complied with and there which the Minister saidThe history of the case as set out in your letter has been noted by me and I am having inquiries made in regard thereto. I will advisp way in which it is now being adminisyou further as soon as I am in a position tered. Another matter which indicates to do so. On the 17 th MarchI received a further is the following reply which I received reply in whioh the Minister saidI regret that I am not yet in a position to respect of a case which I brought to his advise you in regard to this matter, as the notice:necessary investigations are not yet complete, immediately finality is reached, I w ill communicate with you further. Finally, on the 28th April, the Minister sent a letter to me in which he indicated that the matter had been fully investigated, but inquiries showed that the soldier was a member not of the Australian Imperial Force, hut of the Australian Militia Forces, and that the discharge was not effected until the 22n.i January, 1942. The application for a war pension was rejected on the grounds that his condition-fractur e of the third metatarsal of the right foot and a wound on the right eyebrow-wa s not directly attributable to his employment as a member of the forces. On the day of his discharge, the letter said, he could not be fitted with a civilian suit, but this had since been supplied and he had been asked to collect it. The Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) regretted that a sustenance allowance could not be granted. That is a clear case for the amendment of the Repatriation Act in order to bring it up to date and into line with the conditions prevailing in this war. The need for the appointment of a select committee has been brought to the notice of the Minister for Repatriation several times by me and other honourable members, but he does not see the necessity for it and claims that the returned soldiers' organizations are satisfied with the Repatriation Act as it stands. Certain"" brass hats "" in control of those organizations may be satisfied, but the rank and file of the returned soldiers are not; complaints about the administration of the act are rife. Men discharged after active service in this war are restive. They will not take the treatment that was meted out to the men who returned from the last war. There are many other ways amended. should be an inquiry, not only into the provisions of the act itself, but also the that the Repatriation Act is out of date from the Minister for Repatriation in With further reference to your inquiry concerning the case of Mr W. W. Passmore, of 7 Hartington-street, Granville, New South Wales, I desire to advise that I have inquired into the matter. My inquiries reveal that Mr Passmore was a member of the Permanent A i r Force, in which he enlisted on 21st February, 1930, for six years, and was re-engaged on the 21st February, 1936, for a further six years. Because he was a member of the Permanent A i r Force, and did not have service overseas, he does not qualify as a ""member of the forces"" within the meaning of the relevant definition in the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. and it was for this reason that the pension claim submitted to the repatriation author) ties was necessarily rejected. It is not within my province to comment on the reasons for which Mr Passmore was diecharged from the Royal Australian A i r Force or the question of compensation for his condition of health, and any inquiry in that connection would be one for attention by the Air Board, Melbourne. We are going round in circles. The case does not come within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Repatriation because it does not come within the four corners of the Repatriation Act or within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) because the man concerned has been discharged from the Air Force. I am glad that the Minister for Repatriation has now come into the chamber. I hope that he will take up the matter of amending the Repatriation Act in order to bring it up to date. present when the honourable member for member contend that there should be no Reid( Mr Morgan) commenced his punishment for breaches of discipline? speech.

226,Mr Calwell,"I appreciate that I directed the attention of the MinisBeasley) last night to the lack of firewood in Melbourne. I understand that the situation in Canberra is no better than it is in Melbourne. I have a letter from a man who served throughout the last war, and who would not protest Avithout cause. Thi3 man says that in Pelham-strect, Carlton, there is a wood-yard which has been owned and operated by the one family since 1914, that the owner has been called up for service, and that the people in the locality will now be without wood for the winter. The letter addsThis man has been able to get wood when the other yards have hod to close down. In the past, the majority of the people around here have had to rely on wood for warmth and cooking. They have been too poor to buy gas Htoves. WhilstI am not at this stage making a particular plea for exemption for the man concerned, I cite the letter as evidence of the fact that there is a grave shortage of fuel in Melbourne. 1 trust that whatever inquiries are being made by the Minister for Supply and Development they will be expedited so that we may obtain an adequate fuel supply .for Melbourne as early as possible. I hope, also, that representations that have been made to the honourable gentleman by wood merchants in Canberra will receive prompt consideration, and that the merchants will receive sufficient petrol supplies to enable them to bring in the wood before the winter rains start, so that the people of Oanberre will not suffer from the rigours of the climate any more than is necessary. by honourable members will be referred to the appropriate Ministers.
