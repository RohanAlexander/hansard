It is proposed that the Board of Trade shall be the authority to advise the Government in relation to the assistance to primary production. Under clause 5, the Government is, of course, asking the Blouse to place it in a .position to make an advance or to render assistance to a primary industry when, in fact, no aet of Parliament has been passed appropriating the money which may have to be expended. frequently been necessary to take similar stance the unfavorable position of the fruit-growers last year and the measure of assistance that was rendered to them by the Government. That expenditure had subsequently to be ratified by Parliament. Any action the 'Government takes under this clause will later be subject to review cision of the High Court the Government by Parliament. It is essential that the Government should be empowered to assist primary production. Honourable members probably know that certain applications have been received in which it is claimed that, in the general interests of the community, a measure of assistance should be given to industries to aid in their stimulation and expansion. Clause5 is designed to allow such claims to be dealt with. The expenditure under the clause is limited to £500,000, and that sum was set aside from the surplus of last year. The clause also provides that a return showing the reports and recommendations made and the assistance granted, shall be laid before Parliament on the four quarterly days of the year, and it will lien, of course, be open to Parliament to review any action that may have been taken by the Government. sistance indicated? ted to the export and marketing of primary produce. sistance "" may mean a grant or a gift. exists, such as the Dairy Produce or Dried Fruits Control Board, any advance made under clause 4 would not exceed 80 per cent, of the value of the produce. Unfortuthe export of wine? and marketing -of any produce. that have been passed? to production outside those acts would be governed by the provisions of this measure. The bill contemplates two things. First, it gives power to guarantee a bank in respect of advances made up to 80 per cent, of the value of produce, to a board constituted to control the export of any particular primary produce. In the past it has Secondly, under clause 5, the Government is empowered, after report and recomaction. For example, I inmendation by the Board of Trade, to render assistance in the marketing and export of primary produce, and such assistance is limited to £500,000. The Government could not endorse or approve of any scheme under which that expenditure would be exceeded. Under a recent dehas no power to give a guarantee until money is appropriated for it . In the case of, say, dried fruits, the advances to be guaranteed may amount to £1,000,000. It is almost inconceivable that there should be a loss by reason of such a guarantee, but unless there was power to appropriate money beyond £500,000 no advance for any sum beyond that could be guaranteed. The position is safeguarded to -the extent that the Government cannot advance beyond £500,000 in relation to assistance to primary production as recommended by the Board of Trade. There would be no expenditure beyond £500,000 unless the guarantee exceeded that figure. Supposing the Government, gave a guarantee of £1,000,000 upon dried fruits for an advance of 80 per cent, of the market value, and the fruits ceased to have any market value at all, the Governbut I suggest that it is inconceivable that such a position could arise.

If this bill is agreed to, and the responsibility for advising the Government in regard to these guarantees is placed upon the Board of Trade, action will be taken to constitute branches in each state. I remind the House that the members of the board give their services gratuitously. The motive for the formation of the board was that the best commercial minds in the community should be enlisted to assist the Government in regard to problems of trade and industry generally. I do not think there could be any better authority than the Board of Trade to report upon any proposals for guarantees that may be submitted to the Government. I hope that the bill will be accepted by the House.

30,Mr Anstey (Bourke) [12.19],"It is that while the Commonwealth has a banking institution of its own, it is undertaking to find money to guarantee different boards who obtain advances from private banks. That is one of the weaknesses of the bill. The guarantees are to be subject to a recommendation by a board that has no legal status. The Board of Trade has never been legally constituted. Some of its members are gentlemen who make a living as "" guinea-pigs "" on various Government or semi-Government bodies. Hardly a board is appointed on which the names of the same gentlemen do not appear. for their services on the Board of Trade. have heard of a gentleman at Washington who was a member of a Government board, and who explained, "" We give our services patriotically. We get no fees, but we are allowed travelling expenses, and if one is wise and careful he can make more out of travelling expenses than he would out of definite fees."" The bill guaranteeing the boards to an unlimited extent in respect to their engagements with private banks. We have no idea of what the liabilities of the Commonwealth will be under this measure; but the responsibility for them rests with the Government. Having gone so far, no doubt we can travel the rest of the journey in the hope that at the end we shall find that the primary producers have derived some advantages. But these measures demonstrate that, whilst the representatives of the primary producers are opposed to Government interference in industry, economic determinism controls the situation, and they are prepared to sacrifice their principles when they can dip their hands into the public funds in order to improve their own industries. able members have had very brief opportunity to consider the bill; but I take this opportunity of saying that I cannot agree with the principle it embodies,or the course of action which it will authorize. The bill proposes to constitute a board to advise the Government in regard to guarantees, and the Prime Minister has said that that board will be the Board of Trade. If that is the intention, it should be definitely stated. The bill appears to give the Ministry power to bring any produce under its operations, and to create a board to deal with it and advise the Government thereon. If that is not intended, the bill has been very loosely drafted. We have already carried this form of assistance to private business further than is justified; but, having agreed to the bills relating to the control of the export of dairy produce and dried fruits, this measure is justified and necessary to provide the machinery for giving effect to the previous decisions of Parliament. I am not prepared to consent, however, to this assistance being extended over a wider field, as the bill appears to allow. The Prime Minister referred to payments made out of the Treasurer's Advanoe during recess, for which the Government was brought to account in subsequent sessions. For that reason, he said, the Ministry is not prepared to take similar risks in future. I agree that it should not do so; but if this bill is passed in its present form, Parliament commits the Government to will give to the Government a general exoneration in respect of all guarantees that it may give. vernment's actions will be subject to parliamentary criticism when the papers are laid upon the table. M i . MANN -The Government may be subject to criticism, but the bill gives it very wide powers. The Minister may, upon the receipt of a recommendation of any body constituted to advise him, grant assistance in regard to the export and marketing of primary produce. The. Ministry might give a subsidy to shipping, and even if it makes a serious mistake, it cannot be taken to account by Parliament ; or if it is, it may reply, "" The action was taken under the authority given by Parliament."" It is dangerous to create boards to advise a Minister so that he may act independently of Parliament during recess. What is meant by a board duly constituted? Surely that is very loose phraseology.

The Tariff Act gave a that such a dangerous principle as that to which it gives effect has ever previously been embodied in a bill presented to this chamber. No reference to the measure was made in the budget speech. If advances are made from the Treasury to the boards contemplated under the bill, P armament will have no security for the money. Some time ago, a bill was introduced for the purpose of making an advance to a cooperative concern which did not even own the land on which the advance was made, and the Government had no hold whatever upon the company. The House should take a firm stand, in the matter, and insist on security being provided. When Government business is to be transacted no reasonable opposition can be given to the accounts passing through the Commonwealth Bank. I have no doubt that I shall live long enough to see all the Government's finanany other primary produce, could go to cial business conducted through the bank of the nation.

That money has been largely provided by the people who are in need of the benefits that this bill will confer. If the primary producers had not been called upon to contribute solargely to the Customs revenue, they, would not be asking Parliament now to assist them in finding markets for their products. Therefore, I say that this bill is,, as a matter of fact, consequential upon past legislation. The bill, under the circumstances, is a fair one, and I support it .

I rather regret the necessity for legislation of this kind, but although anotiier "" economic revolution "" may be charged against me, I hope I am broad enough in my views to accept legislation of this sort when it is necessary. An honourable member has described it as "" consequential legislation,"" but I say that it is "" essential legislation."" Condiditions for the marketing of our primary products are not at present normal, and it is therefore essential that the Government should give what assistance it can to enable markets to be exploited to the best advantage. there .is no doubt that the bill will give great latitude to the Government.

I am glad that the clause says "" u p to 80 per cent.,"" for in some circumstances 80 per cent, is sound, but in other circumstances is too much. Pour years ago the price of wheat was soaring to an abnormal height, and the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales agreed to make an advance of 7s. 6d. a bushel. That was The Prime Minister far below 80 per cent, of the value of the wheat in the world's markets at that time, but, before the end of the season, the price had slumped u n t i l 7s. 6d. a bushel was more than the value of the wheat.

Every effort had already been made by the farmers, in anticipation of a good yield and high prices, to increase their acreage. I do not think that the guarantee made a difference of 100,000 acres, and it probably did not make a. difference of even 10,000 acres.

In my opinion, this is a most extraordinary departure from the settled policy of the country. agree with the honourable member for Perth that such wide powers should not be given to any Minister or government, but I disagree with his unqualified statement that it is socialism. It may be a poor brand of socialism. If I am to have socialism, I want a good brand, and a good brand would set out the conditions under which the people's money would be spent. This proposal is subject to no conditions. I do not want to deny the Government any opportunity from now until the next session of Parliament begins to render assistance in the marketing of our products, but I suggest that the amount it should have available for such a purpose should be limited.

171,Mr Brennan (Batman) [ 3 . 4 4 ],"Idifferent name altogether, that of Government interference w i th production. This, honourable members opposite would say, is a well thought-out patriotic scheme of this patriotic Government to support our primary industries. What is being done is being done, not in the name of socialism, but on broad national grounds. Drunk with its success in the past, the party opposite has introduced this bill to obtain another large junk of pubbc funds to assist in a general way primary production and industry. Clause3 readsThe Minister may, by notice in the Gazette, declare that the produce, -specified in tlie notice, the export and marketing of which is controlled 'by a board, is produceto which this act applies. . . . The Minister may declare by definition any kind of produce to be covered by this clause.

Of course, there is no limi t clause was the Board of Trade, and to the liability. The Government is in that for some technical reason that board could not be named in an act of and what'has taken place during the last Parliament. I do not know why.

If either House of the Parliament be not sitting on each or any of the dates mentioned in the last preceding sub-section, the return shall be laid before the House within fourteen days of its next sitting. The total expenditure under this section shall not exceed £500,000. If the total expenditure"" under this clause is limited to £500,000, I ask the Prime Minister what is meant by the following clause, which provides for the establishment of a primary production trust account, which is to be a trust account w it h in the meaning of section 62A of the Audit Act 1901-20. Clause1 readsThere is hereby appropriated for the purposes of this act out of Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of £500,000, and such further sums as are necessary from time to time for the purposes of this act. If under clause 5 the Government is limited to an advance of £500,000 to assist in primary production, what is the reason for the appropriation under clause Then we come to clause 5, 7 of a sum of £500,000, and such further sums as are necessary from time to time for the purposes of this act? "" The purposes of this act "" clearly are to guarantee advances up to 80 per cent, on primary produce for export overseas. What is our liability under the guarantee? There is clearly no l i m it to the appropriation under clause 7, and no limi t to the amount of the guarantee under clause 5. I should like the dulging in an orgy of expenditure. When the people realize what is taking place, measures as this. general scheme for the nationalization of exchange, and adopt a policy to which the Labour party can give its wholehold of the prablic purse, to return to constitutional government, and to set its face against governmental interference with private enterprise ? .SurelyI t is time that pended. I have taken steps to ascertain this scandal was exposed, and understood by the public mind. Where are our constitutional defenders in the press of this country? A little while ago we saw recorded burning indignation on the part of the press because the present Premier of the Victorian Labour Government proposed to reduce railway freights, and to assist in the marketing of primary produce. The press indignantly protested against this incursion into socialism by the Victorian Labour Government. But that Government does not know its business in comparison with this Government. It has not started along the road of success traversed by the Country party and their friends the Nationalists. I do not blame honourable members on this side who represent primary producers for being committed to a general policy of expansion of production, but it is about time, in the interests of the Commonwealth, that there should be some protest from those who represent purely tax-paying constituencies, like my own. I want to know what benefits my constituents will reap from the guarantee under this bill. Very little, I should suppose. If the Government will propose some gtiarantee to serve the consumers of Batman, I shall see what I can do to. support it. not used that argument in relation to not ask for one.

On every measure introduced I have sought to expose the policy of the Government. The Prime Minister has necessary. A guarantee is a contingent made a laboured attempt to explain somepromise to expend, and it is covered by thing which he does not understand. the wording of the clause. Usually he is lucid, but to-day he is ambiguous, because he realizes that this meaopinion; I say it is clearly not covered, sure gives a blank cheque. advances have been wrung from the clone by the inclusion' of the words sugpeople for particular commodities, but gested ? this measure is the grand finale, and provides the means of obtaining one or two clusion, although I do not think they will millions of pounds.

The Victorian Rivers and Water Supply Commission has estimated that the sweat box return to growers will be a little more than £ 2 8 per ton. The Prime Minister stated that tjhe quantity that w ill be available for export will be 32,000 tons, and I calculate that 80 per cent, of the return -from that f r u it will be approximately £616,000 which, with the £200,000 for the first advance, will make a total of £816,000 for the dried fraiit industry.

I point out that certain amendments have been made in the motion previously adopted, and they clarify the position. The first occurs in paragraph 2. It previously appeared as if the tax were to be levied on the whole of the sum for which leases were sold,, but this amendment makes it clear that the tax applies only to the profit that has been made. paragraph a, the whole of the power is left to the Commissioner with respect to the tangible assets. Would it not be fair to provide some right of appeal? that point later. . The second amendment occurs in paragraph 4, and provides that ""prospector"" includes a person who, though not personally performing the work of prospecting, has a liability under a contract or arrangement to contribute to the cost of prospecting, and who is entitled to the whole or a part of any profits resulting from the sale of a ""lease of a mining property discovered during I that prospecting. The next amendment is. found in paragraph 6, and it limits the application of the clause to assessments made in the lost three years. The proposal set out in the motion deals with three principles. raised is whether or not there should be a tax on the profit realized on the sale of a lease, where the sale is not made in the course of the business of buying and selling property. Paragraphs 2 to 5 of the motion set out the methods to be followed in levying taxation on leases, and the remaining paragraphs deal with the question whether the tax should be collected for past years. I suggest to the committee that the motion should be considered in those three divisions. I ask the committee to consider, first, whether there should be a tax at all; if so, in what way it should be levied; and, finally, whether the assessments for past years should be validated and the tax collected. As to the first point, the question arises whether the profit on the sale of a lease is profit on the realization of capital, or represents commuted rent. argument has been advanced that no tax has been levied on profit made casually on the sale of freeholds, and, therefore, no tax should be imposed on the sale of leases; but there is a wide difference between the two classes of sales, as the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) has pointed out. It is true that leasehold and freehold tenure relate to capital assets, but the values of those assets rest on entirely different bases. In the case of a freehold its value is usually steadily increasing with the expansion of settlement in the country, but a leasehold estate gradually diminishes in value until, at the termination of the period of the lease, there is no value left. All the value of a freehold property is always realizable, irrespective of the unearned increment is secured by tlie owner when he sells"". The value of a leasehold estate cannot exceed the capital value of the difference between the economic rent at the relevant date of valuation and the rent reserved in the lease agreement. If the lessee is at all times paying the f u l l economic rent for a property, it has no profitable sale price, because he would not be able to sell it for more than the capitalized value of the rent. This shows that any profit realized by the sale of the lease is really the capitalized difference between the true economic rent and the rent reserved by the lease. It is agreed by all parties The first question that the rent received by a person is a proper subject for income tax. There cannot, therefore, be any reasonable ground for objecting to the present proposal to impose a special tax on what is really rent in another form. It should also be borne in mind that under the Income Tax Assessment Act a sinking fund deduction is allowed to the purchaser of a lease equivalent to the amount required to amortize the price he paid for the lease during the unexpired period of it. The purchaser, therefore, not only does not pay a tax on the annual sinking fund mentioned, but he secures a reduction in the rate of tax levied on the remainder of his income. ' If the purchaser were deprived of this deduction, there would be no justification for taxing the vendor on the profit on the sale. The tax was proposed in the first instance only because the purchaser The was allowed to deduct the sinking fund required to amortize the purchase price. For these reasons the Government thinks that there should be a tax on the profit made by the sale of the transfer of a",40,Lessee Tax Bill

Annual rent paid on business premises is in ordinary circumstances allowed as a deduction to the person whopays it,but in the hands of the person who receives it , it is subjectto income taxation. paragraph i i of paragraph a, clause 2,. seems to be somewhat unjust. It is about as clear as mud to me, if it does not mean that a man who is taxed on one-third of the amount of profit will have to pay the rate applicable to the whole amount. will be divided by the number of unexpired years that the lease has to run, and the amount so ascertained will determine the rate of tax. It appears to me that the paragraph seeks to apply to a part of the profit the rate applicable to the whole. Where there are time-payments, the tax will be assessed as if the whole amount was paid in one year, i hope the Treasurer will accept an amendment to meet that objection. I disagree with the Treasurer's contention that, because a freehold pays land tax, it is entitled to be exempted from income tax, while a leasehold, because it does not pay land tax, is in a different category. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten), when we were discussing the same question the other day, referred to the amortizing of the lease. The amortizing that takes place each year allows a deduction to be made from the income of the property of the amount of the cost of the lease for that year. If the cost of the lease for ten years was £1,000, £100 a year would be deductible from the lessee's income. A f t e r five years £ 5 0 0 would be deducted, and that might be the point at which the man would decide to sell his lease. No amortizing has been done for the five years that the lease has still to run, but that is the part of it that is sold. The Treasurer says that in selling the remaining five years of the lease, the lessee sells the. value of it , and he asked the committee to assume that the lease had not increased in value. No man buys a thing in the expectation that it will not increase in value. He hopes, when he buys a lease, that the application of his energy and wisdom to it w ill increase its value as he received from the transfer of the lease an asset. A man may take a pastoral lease on which there are only"""" kangaroos and dingoes. It is not at that stage revenue-producing, and it cannot be sold. It belongs to the Crown, and is leased for perhaps 5s. per annum for 1,000 acres. The man who leases it has to have a considerable amount of capital. He has to construct windmills and dams, erect fences and a homestead, and buy sheep. Thus he turns something that was not a revenue producer into a revenue producer. He may have failing health after five years, and some one may want to buy the lease because it is revenue-producing. The Treasurer w ill allow the lessee to deduct only the windmills and the sheep, &c., but everything else made out of the transfer will be taxed. But the man has sold his revenue-producing machine, just as he would have done had it been a freehold, the value of which he had enhanced by working upon it . If a i l to see that there is any difference in this regard between a freehold and a leasehold. We have 700,000,000 acres of land still-unalienated in Australia, and we want people to settle ou it , to make dams and erect mills, and to place sheep upon it . The proposal before the committee is not calculated to induce people to do that. If a leasehold property is developed and made revenue-producing, the Government has a chance of collecting taxation on the lessee's income. I beseech the Government not to tax profits on the transfer of leases, particularly Crown leases. If that is done, the proposal will be in the right direction. -The honourable member for Forrest( Mr. Prowse) has read a wrong meaning into the word "" whole."" He has come to the conclusion that the motion means that, even if the payments for a transferred lease are spread over a number of years, the man who transfers it will be charged at the rate of tax applicable to the whole amount. I assume that the explanation of the phrase "" if the whole of that amount were income "" is to be found in the previous paragraph of the clause. Assuming that an individual sells for £1,000 a lease which still has five years to r u n , and receives the money in two equal instalments, and that he has an income from other sources of £1,000 a year, I take it that under the provisions of clause 2 of the motion the £1,000 which would be divided by five, and that the' resulting £200 would be added to his",42,Lessee Tax Bill

But the Treasurer has pointed out that all income tax is retrospective, relating as it does to the income earned in the year previous to that in which the tax is collected. The honourable member for Boothby acted i'ightly in moving an amendment at this stage, because although it is true that we assess the income and collect the tax for the year previous, yet it is collected on the basis that the income was then lawfully liable to taxation. That is the point at which I join issue with the Government. collecting the tax, but of levying it . of the tax that has been declared by the High Court to be vicious and wrong, and whether the tax goes back one year or one week beyond the time of that decision or not, the principle is precisely the same. The tax is rethe honourable trospective and bad, and if the argument of the honourable member for Boothby is sound, it is applicable to clause 1.

It is suggested that vthfi taxation upon the profit from a transfer of leasehold is merely a tax upon capitalized rent, and as such should be taxed as income. My answer is that it is quite open to the transferor to either sublet the property for an increased rent, or transfer the whole of it for an aggregate sum. In the one instance the transaction is a sale of capital and in the other it involves an increase of income, and automatically the principles of income taxation immediately -apply. a sale of capital, similar to a transfer of freehold, the seller should not be subject to income taxation. no taxationupon the transfer of a freehold unless a man makes an income by repeated turnover in freehold estate. is his business, and his profits may be regarded as income and subject to taxation im the same way as is the income of a man whose business is betting on the fcurf.

It is not just that the proceeds of one deal should be taxed, and the proceeds of another be immune, merely because .tiie one occurred before, and the other after, a certain date, and it is particularly unfair to tax moneys paid under transactions which ante-dated the period covered by the motion. Why should this proposal be retrospective to the 1st July, 1923 ? Why is the Government not content to legislate for the future ? The following facts, relating to an actual transfer of which I have knowledge, indicate the inequity of this proposal. sold a lease at the end of June, 1924, which date was subsequent to the H i gh Court's judgment in the Dalrymple case. He and the purchaser therefore contracted, as they were entitled to do, upon the basis of the existing Jaw, as declared by the High Court, namely, that no taxat i o n was payable in respect of the proceeds of the sale. That assumption naturally had an influence upon the price. Now, four months later, the 'Government proposes to upset that transaction, by making the receipts subject to taxation. That is quite unjust and indefensible. realize that the success of Mr Dalrymple in the court arose out of a mere slip in the wording of a section of the act, and, having regard to the intention of Parliament, I do not contend that there was any particular merit in his claim, or those iof other lessees similarly situated. defect in the law was a mere slip. The honourable member for Wakefield, and others, were deliberately responsible for it. gratulate them upon their acumen. Eveni f it be assumed that there are liabilities to the department in respect of the transfer or assignment of leases, it is very diffi-cult to fix an arbitrary date to divide -Ahose transactions which shall be taxable from those which shall be immune.

The present provision applies only to persons who have asked that their objections be transmitted. I invite the committee to consider whether other A man taxpayers would be in any worse position than those who have asked that.their objections be transmitted. In the first place, there are those taxpayers who have been assessed and have lodged objections, but whose objections have not been dealt w it h by the department. I understand that some of those taxpayers thought that their objections were being held over, because Dalrymple's case was regarded as a test one. I am not able to say whether that is so OT not, but it is not unlikely. Are the people, whose claims have not I been dealt with through no fault-of their own, not-to be in the same, position as those who have made objections, but whose objections have been dealt w it h more promptly by the department? Then, again, there is a class of men who have made returns, but have not been assessed, and, therefore, have had no opportunity of making objections. Finally, I do not think that the there are those who have had transactions in the current year.

The safe rule is to leave everybody to his legal remedyj whatever it may be. suggest that the Commonwealth Parliament should stand to the law, and expp.et citizens to take advantage of their legal rights or give them up. The proper way is to administer it without fear or favour, leaving everybody to his legal rights. Section 37 of the act enables a taxpayer to re-open a matter w it h in three years. I suggest that retrospective benevolence in administration is a mistake, and cannot continue, because in a few years we shall reach a position in which it w ill be impossible to make all decisions retrospective to the beginning of our income' tax legislation. Similarly, I suggest that there should be no retrospective harshness or injustice in legislation. It would be better to make the new law apply to the transfers and assignments of leases after this bill has come into operation. Nobody could complain of that as a matter of principle. would be that anybody who had lodged objections under the law which applied when the transaction occurred would be able to ask that those objections be treated as appeals, and his case would be dealt with according to the law. Persons who had paid the tax w it h in the previous three years could get their cases reopened under section 37, and other persons would be unable to get their money back, because they had paid the tax without desiring to challenge the assessment. It is impossible to do complete justice by retrospective legislation.' The dates chosen offer a poor compromise. leave everybody to his legal rights would be f a i r and prudent. Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [ 5 . 4 0 ] find myself, as a layman, in agreement with one, if not both, of the legal members who have preceded me. proposes to impose income tax on something which is really capital. of a number of cases in which leases have been purchased and businesses have been built up. A f t e r a few years these leases have been sold' at a profit, and although income tax had been paid annually on the income earned by the lessees, the profit on ""Wherei t is impossible to the sale of the leases has also been taxed. If the retrospective clauses of the bill are put into operation, very grave injustice w ill be done. I know of leases that have been sold since the 1st July, 1923, at a considerable profit. If the lessees I had known that they would be subject to the payment of income tax on the profit of the sale, they would have asked for, and would^have obtained, a higher price than they received. I cannot agree that the profits on the sale of a lease should be subject to income taxation. In this matter I claim to take a broader view than that of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), who applies his objection only to the taxation of the profits from the sale of Crown leases. If the objection is sound for one kind of lease, it is sound for all kinds. It is because I consider that the profits on the sale of leases, whether Crown leases or leases of business, premises, are not a proper subject for income taxation that I oppose the motion. I oppose, particularly, that part of it which is retrospective. The committee ought to insist upon the deletion of, at least, the retrospective Then the position clauses. I hold different views from those expressed by the last three speakers. Parliament definitely decided how the burden of taxation should be distributed, and there is not the slightest doubt that it was the intention of Parliament that this tax should be collected. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) admitted that, but a technical defect in the act permitted the Dalrymple decision to be given. We shall not be doing our duty if we allow persons who were intended To to pay to escape payment. I hold very strong views on this matter, because there is much evidence to-day of attempts to evade taxation. In so f a r as those I attempts succeed, extra burdens' are placed on the shoulders of others. Parliament may have been wrong in imposing this Theb ill tax, and I believe it was wrong to a certain extent. A man who makes a livin g I know by buying and selling leases, whether busi-",47,Lessee Tax Bill
225,Mr Manni Ng (Macquarie) [5.47],"ness leases or Crown leases, should be taxed in the same way as the man who buys and sells sheep, or anything else. a lease and holds it for a number of years should not be subject to taxation, for he is not making his livin g by buying and selling leases. Let us consider the case of a Crown lessee in the western division of New South Wales. We wish to give every encouragement possible to men to settle in that uninviting country and to bring it into production. A man may-buy an unimproved lease at a very low price. It takes courage to invest money in such a property, but by spending' money on the conservation of water, the ring-barking of trees, and the erection of dog and rabbitproof fencing, a man may, after a number of years, make the lease much more valuable than the actual cost of the i m provements put on the land. I have in mind a man who held a lease for twenty years, and when he sold it he had to pay a large sum of money in taxation. Tliat was unfair to that man, and it would be equallj' unfair if it had been a business lease instead of a Crown lease. If a man has a lease of an hotel, holds it for a number of years, builds up a business connection, and after he has made it more valuable sells it , it cannot be said that he is trafficking in leases. He is entitled to all the profit he makes. shall move an amendment to bring the Commonwealth law into line w i th the existing law in New South Wales and Queensland. In those states the sale of a lease that has not been held for five years is subject to taxation, but if it has been held for five years or longer, the profits ou the sale are not subject to taxation. broad acres only?' leases, including business leases. I shall move that the following proviso be added at the end of clause 1 : Provided that after the passing of this act no tax shall be payable if the vendor of such lease has held the same for a period of not less than five years prior to such sale. I am opposed to retrospective legislation, as usually understood, but I do not regard this as retrospective legislation. Technically, it may be retrospective. as retrospective by the honourable member if he had to pay taxation for eight years past. legal training of the honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham), and I may be giving to words a common-sense meaning that is different from their legal meaning. If taxation was paid in good f a it h , and if it was the obvious intention of Parliament orable member begs tbe question. How can he interpret the intentions of Parliament except by the language used by Parliament ? honourable member for Kooyong as an authority, and no one, after listening to his speech, can be in any doubt that, in his opinion, it was the intention of Parliament that the tax should'be collected, but a technical ersor in the drafting of the bill enabled some genius to discover a loop-hole for escape. I do not blame any man for taking advantage of his legal rights. Many men paid the tax in good f a it h , and it is our duty, as representatives of the people of the Commonwealth, to see that as many people as possible are made to pay. I am glad that early in the discusI sion of this motion, the honourable Hughes) has given the committee an opportunity to decide the question whether the retrospective clauses shall remain. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr. Latham) and others have pointed out that the later clauses of the motion are more retrospective than that under discussion, but. it is well to have the matter settled now.' It is dangerous, unjust, and unfair to impose upon people It applies to all a tax for years that are past. If one person, because he was able to appeal to the courts of this country, escaped taxation, every other person, whether he has paid the tax or not, should also be allowed to escape.

The wealthy brewery corporations throughout the Commonwealth buy up hotels by methods which in some cases are not above suspicion. to agree to the terms of the breweries under threat of eviction and stoppage of. supplies. enormous profits because of the extra protection afforded them since the war. If this motion is not agreed to, the Commonwealth Government will have to ref u n d to land dealers and breweries taxes amounting to almost £500,000, and two-thirds of the sijm will be paid to those who traffic in hotel leases. This system of taxation will not affect the small leaseholders, and it is of no use for honourable members representing country constituencies to. argue to the contrary. It is the old argument of-unearned increment. If many of these properties were situated in the Sahara desert they would not be worth 2d. It is the general community and its activities that increase the value of property; and any accretion of capital brought about under these circumstances should rightly be taxed. There is no reason why taxes collected on unearned increments should be refunded simply because there is a loop-hole in the law. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Latham.) has raised many fine legal points, but he must remember that this matter should be judged, not from a legal stand-point, but from; that of justice. I hope that the committee will agree to the motion, and allow the taxes already collected to remain in the Treasury. Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 8 jt.m. shall not delay the decision of the committee, but I must say that I cannot support the sweeping amendment of the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Duncan-Hughes). labour the arguments against it . I am prepared to admit that it is anomalous, if not unjust, to tax those who sell leasespeaking earlier in the day and, therefore, holds on the profits they make from their sale, when we do not tax profits made from we should not tax profits from the sale of the sale of freeholds. But two wrongs do not make a right, and I am going to vote with the Government on the motion before the committee. There may be proposals submitted later which I shall find myself able to support. As has. been done in other countries, we need in the Commonwealth to overhaul our methods of taxation occasionally, that its incidence may be made more equitable. There is this objection to the imposition The lessees are forced of taxes-that they are generally passed on, and have in the end to be paid by the mass of the people; but that, I am The brewers are acquiring afraid, cannot be prevented.

An instance occurs to my mind of a man who held a western district lease for many years. He had a big struggle, and he reared a family on it . In course of time he made good, and sold out at a failprofit. He was taxed £2,000 on his profit on the sale of his lease, although, improving it as he did, he rendered good service to this country. If men are not given special inducement to take up 'unpromising leasing propositions they will not do so. If a man buys a lease of any sort, and after holding it for a few months or a year, sells it at a profit, I regard him as in the same position as a man who buys a few sheep or horses, and shortly afterwards makes a profit on their re-sale. I consider that the profits made in such cases should be taxed. I trust the committee will support my amendment, which, if accepted, will bring the Commonwealth law into line with existing legislation in Queensland and New South Wales. surer) [8.12] -The Government cannot accept the amendment for the reason that it recognizes that tax should be levied on profits made from the sale and transfer of leases. because of the deductions of the sinking fund for the unexpired portion of the whole period of a lease. The fact that a man has held a lease for five years does not alter that in any way. The amendment would be a very good one if it applied only to original Crown leases for which nothing was paid, because in that case the provision mentioned by the Treasurer providing for deductions in income tax, and for depreciation in value of a lease, would not apply, because it would have no original value. The Treasurer is right in saying that the reason for the imposition of this taxation in the past was the fact that the deduction to which I have referred was allowed. It is quite right that the deduction should be allowed, because this particular asset is a form of capital, and its value depreBUI ciates every year u n t i l at the end of the We should give men period of the lease the whole yalue is worked out. For that reason there should be an annual deduction allowed. * It will My amendment, if be admitted that that is a fair deduction to make, but it is a corollary that the person who receives that amount should be taxed. If the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) would make his amendment applicable only to leases for which nothing is paid, I feel sure he would reoeive a good measure of support, and possibly in that case the Treasurer would be willing to accept his amendment. support the amendment. In connection with a pastoral lease it is nonsense to talk of a sinking f u n d or gradual relief as the period of the lease expires. Is not the purpose of giving long leases in the outback country to give -security of tenure to the man who w ill create at enormous expense a national asset? Everything humanly possible should be done in the interests of the nation to encourage suoh leaseholders. People cannot be induced to go into that country if they are not given long leases. ment introduce the Northern Territory Lands Ordinance? tend the long leases. I thank the honourable member for that helpfu l interjection. A t one time in South Australia, after many years of settlement, the whole of the back country was deserted and The reason the tax is levied is reverted to the Crown, and it was only when the State Government' offered f u r ther encouragement to the lessees by lending them £3,000,000 for the erection of vermin-proof fencing and the eradication of w i ld dogs, that they were induced to resume their holdings. A f t e r the state has offered a l l possible inducements in order to get the country occupied, I cannot understand the Commonwealth Government proposing this discouraging and repressive taxation. The values of the leases are created by the energies of men and women who have spentyears f a r away from the centres of civilization, in conditions of hardship.

A man pays £10,000 for the transfer of the unexpired portion of a lease, and represents to the department that as the lease has only ten years to r u n he should be allowed a deduction of £1,000 per annum from his income. The department concedes that, and now some honourable members desire to give immunity from taxation in respect of the profit on a transfer or assignment. In other words, the leaseholder is seeking to get exemption both ways. I should prefer that the taxation of these transactions should be abandoned, rather than that the amendment should be carried.

If a lease that had ten years to run was sold at a profit of £9,000, and the money was to be paid in three annual instalments of £3,000, each amount would be assessed at the rate for £900, which would be one-tenth of the full amount of profit.

The Treasurer, in his second-reading speech, used this sentence in respect to themThere are some members of the Service who wilfully omitted to make an election, and for them no provision is made. I trust that he wil l agree to make some provision so that these officers may rect if y their omission. The more officers we can encourage to subscribe to the fund the better it will be. It is quite natural that officers who were not receiving a large salary should hesitate to subscribe any more than they could help to a new scheme like this, but they have now had an opportunity to realize how beneficial it is, and would welcome an opportunity to contribute for all the benefits that it makes possible. Some information supplied to me by a Service organization put the position of these officers as follows: The proposed amendment to section 13 only gives officers who have failed to make an election tbe option of taking up to four units as at thirty years. We desire that it should provide that any officer who has elected to take less than four units should be again given the opportunity to elect, if he so desires, to take up to four units. has over the Superannuation Board, but There are many officers who elected to take less than four units, for the reason that the retiring age for a full pension was 60 years. Section 85 of the Public ""Service Act provides that-(1 ) Every officer having attained the age of 60 years shall be entitled to retire from the Commonwealth Public Service if he desires so to do; but any such officer may (unless retired as hereinafter provided) continue in the Service until he attains the age of 65 'years; (2) if any officer continues in the Service after he has attained the ago of 60 years he may at any time before he attains the age of 65 years be retired from the Service by the Board. Owing to the fact that"" the tenure of office after attaining the age of 60 years is not secured by the provisions of Section 85 of the Public Service Act, many officers were not prepared to take the risk of contributing for four units when the retiring age under the Superannuation Act was 65 years, for tlie reason that an officer compulsorily retired at 00 years -would only receive the actuarial equivalent of the pension contributed for. I welcome the provision that is made for lighthouse-keepers fund, and feel sure that every honourable member will gladly do all he can to afford lighthouse-keepers, lar class, who render splendid service to the country and to our navigators, possible benefit. cally prisoners, for they live in their lightbouses with the member's of their families, and see very little of the outside world. I a.m glad, too, that provision is being Mr Fenton. made to liberalize the conditions respecting invalidity. I understand that an amendment is to be made to the bill as submitted to us, to provide that officers may retire at 60, with a larger pension . than is now possible, by making extra contributions. It may suit some officers to contribute additional amounts to entitle them to the bigger pension at 60, so that they may retire then rather than continue the ordinary payments and remain in the Serviceu n t i l they are 65. On the other hand, some other officers may prefer to remain in the Service as long as. 1 hey can. Certain anomalies are brought under the notice, of honourable members from time to time. An officer at the Jervis Bay College, whose services may be dispensed with on three months' notice, is eligible to subscribe to the f u n d ; whereas other officers, who have at least a three years' engagement, are not eligible. One would have thought that if an officer whose services are liable to be dispensed with on three months' notice could subscribe, officers who have a three years' membership could also do so. I do not know what power the Treasurer I should like him to do what he can to remedy a grievance which some annuitants have. The persons I have in mind, who are entitled to payments of £ 1 or £ 2 ' per week in certain cases, have found that, instead of receiving the f u l l amount due to them fortnightly, a few pence less is paid to them. For instance, an officer who is entitled to £ 2 per fortnight receives only £ 1 19s. lOd. We know of Gregorian calendars and Julian calendars, but the Superannuation Board has adopted one which is peculiarly its own. According tp it , annuitants lose their payments for one day in normal years, and two days in leap years. I suggest that steps be taken to pay them the f u l l pension on an ordinary basis. A number of amendments have just been circulated which seem to me to be very important, to subscribe to the although I have only been able to glance at them hurriedly. It is unfortunate that a. technical bill like this must be and officers of a simiunder consideration in the closing hours of the session. I suppose that at midevery night we shall be wrestling in committee These men are practiwith highly technical clauses. However, we must be thankful for small mercies. Many of the proposed amendments to the principal act will be much appreciated by the officers of the Service, but doubtless next session we shall have another amending measure before us on account of having to rush this bill through so quickly. I again commend to the Treasurer my suggestion that he should give to officers who are not subscribing for the f u l l number of units to which they are entitled an opportunity to do so. If he cannot see his way clear to make provision for it in this measure, I trust that he will give us an assurance that a bill will be introduced next session to provide for it . I understand that the individual contributions to the superannuation scheme in New South Wales are less than those to the Commonwealth scheme. standing that, the. Commonwealth scheme is doing remarkably well.' I support the bill ou the second reading, and I trust that in committee it will be amended so as to further liberalize the provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act. Sir NEVIL LE HOWSE (Calare) [9.16], -Soon after the passing of the Superannuation Act of 1922 it was recognized that it contained many anomalies and a few injustices. The Government has since promised that an amending bill would be brought down to rectify those errors, and I trust that the measure before the House will be beneficial in this direction. It will tions would have been between the be remembered by honourable members that the original' act made provision for all military officers, with the exception of quartermasters, warrant officers, non-commissioned thereby inflicting a hardship upon a deserving section, of the Public Service.

I have with me a letter referring to a very 'clear anomaly, which I am glad to notice will be rectified by the bill. It is from the widow of a man who had 39 years' service in the Marine and Lighthouse Department. This lady was ineligible for a pension under the act because her husband had not been ten years in the Commonwealth Service. He was denied the right to subscribe either to the superannuation scheme of Queensland, from which state he was transferred, or to the' Commonwealth scheme, and, therefore, his widow was debarred from a pension under both schemes. Another anomaly exists under the act in relation to military members of the age of 65 years. No provision is made to give a military employee, who is a contributor under the act, the right to elect to remain under his present conditions. The amending bill does not meet the difficulty, and I do nor know whether the amendments that have been circulated provide for such An officer whose retiring age is 65 is forced to cease contributing under the old scheme, and to come under the new scheme with its higher contributions for pensions at 60 instead of 65, and thus he has to pay before 60 years what otherwise would be spread over a period of five years longer. An officer aged 59, whose Notwithage for retirement is 65, would be asked to make payment at the annual rate of, approximately, £1,850 in fortnightly in stalments. Very few men, and, indeed, no officers of the Service, are able to meet such a demand. I hope the Treasurer will be able to inform me that the amendments he has introduced will remove that injustice. There is also an injustice under the second proviso of section 12 of the act. . A public servant whose retiring age is 65 may elect, if he so desires, to retire at 60, and be ' permitted to contribute in a lump sum the actuarial equivalent of what his contribuage of 60 and 65, an equal amount being contributed by the Government. There is a further anomaly in the bill. One provision proposes to disentitle from officers, and privates, receiving any pension whatever persons to whom compensation has been paid under the Defence Eetirement Act 1922. This provision is no doubt intended to prevent the application to those persons of the retrospective class giving four units of pension, without contribution, to those who retired since December, 1920. However, I think the bill goes further than is intended, and prevents those Duntroon graduates who were compensated and later brought back into the forces, from participating in the scheme at all. I believe that the Treasurer in tends to remedy that anomaly. The members of the late Parliament w ill remember that in 1922, when the b ill was in committee, clause 30 was discussed at great length. I refer honourable members to Hansard, volume CI , second session of the eighth Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition fought w i th great pertinacity for the reduction of the period before which a pension could be granted, from ten years to five years, and after a long debate tbe period was reduced to seven years. It was clear that it could not affect the actuarial basis, because the Attorney-General graciously gave away .three tenths of the period suggested with: out in any way affecting the contributions to be made. The logical outcome is that the remaining seven-tenths should now be given away. away. to be a very simple procedure. I must congratulate the Treasurer upon introducing the bill to amend the Superannuation Act, and I hope it will fulfil the wish, not only of the Treasurer, but of every honourable member, that an estimable body of government officials shall receive the benefits of the act which was passed with the object of assisting those who retire after long and honourable serviee, and also those who through physical or mental incapacity are compelled to retire before reaching the age limit. On behalf of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews), who has been summoned to another state on urgent public business, I wish to bring before the House the case of certain Commonwealth employees who have been unjustly treated. Certain members of the Victorian Marine Board were transferred to the Commonwealth Service just prior to the Superannuation Act being proclaimed, and they, therefore, came under its provisions. Before that transfer took place it had been decided that the whole of the Victorian Marine Board staff should ultimately be transferred to the Commonwealth. The other members were transferred nine months later, and were unjustly deprived of the advantages enjoyed by their former colleagues. transferred are subscribing to the superannuation scheme, £10 18s. lOd. per annum for four units, but those who were later transferred are subscribing £51 2s. 8d. for the same number of units. That cannot be regarded as fair and equitable, and I ask the Treasurer to rectify this anomaly in the amending bill. It has been suggested that this injustice might be remedied by back-dating the appointment of those men who were later transferred; but I leave it to the Treasurer to suggest some way out of the difficulty. He will remember that I asked, by interjection, whether these men would be covered by the bill, and he distinctly answered in the affirmative. Mn MAKIN I was then referring to them. The Prime Minister last evengiven ing was under a misapprehension concerning a certain amendment to the Public Service Bill. He believed, in error, that the amendment covered a certain matter which had: been referred to him. I hope the Treasurer will see that the men to whom I have referred may be given the same benefits as have been given to their colleagues who were transferred to the Commonwealth Service at an earlier date than they were. I realize that the Treasurer has given sympathetic consideration to a number of suggested amendments in the bill. A matter was brought under my notice only , ,. this afternoon, and I regret' to have to bring it under the attention of the Treasurer at such short notice. It affects officers who have 'already reached the age of 60 years.' It is pointed out that a contributor of the age of 59 years when he attains the age of 60 years, is relieved of the necessity to make any more contributions, and is entitled to receive the full pension when he retires at any time. A contributor whose age is now 60 years must contribute until he is 65 years of age before he can receive a full pension. Should he retire before he is 65 years, his pension would be only the actuarial equivalent of a full pension. Thus a contributor who is now 60 years of age, if he retires, would have to make a lump sum payment of £36 Is. in order to receive a pension of £68 7s. 8d. If no lump sum payment be made, the pension would be only £26 2s. A contributor aged 63 years would have to pay a lump Those who were first sum of £17 18s., to secure a pension of £86 19s. If he paid no lump sum the pension would be £48 18s. per annum. These would be the results in such cases, although both contributors may have contributed for a pension of £104 per annum. These facts disclose a position which seems to me to require rectification. They indicate the penalization of men who are at present 60 years of age, as compared with those who have not yet",55,Earle Page

It has.been suggested that to overcome the difficulty the following addendum should be made to clause 7 of the b ill Notwithstanding anything contained in any section of the principal act, a contributor who is 60 years of age, or more than 60 years of age, before the passing of this act, may, within six months after the commencement of this section, elect to increase all previous contribuof amendments which the Treasurer protions he has made to the fund, to such rates specified in the third or fourth schedule to this to go through them carefully or to asceract as are applicable : For four units at the rates prescribed for the age of 30, and in respect of other units, shall be at the rate in those schedules which is appropriate to his age at the date he elects under this section. Any contributor who makes an election in accordance with this section, shall be entitled upon retirement, at any time, to receive full pension, according to the number of units for which he has contributed. Provided tliat after the contributor has increased his previous contributions in the manner as specified in this section, he shall not difficulty crops up in connection with be required to make any more contributions. That is the method suggested to overcome the difficulty under which these particular officers labour. I have had a conversation with a permanent head of a department on the matter, and I think he had a consultation also with one of the Treasury officials. Unfortunately, the Treasury officialsdo not take a favorable view of the method suggested for overcoming the difficulty. claim that it would lead to a number of complications, would create an indefinite position, and involve an addition to the annual expenditure of something over £70,000. They may not have had sufficient time to thoroughly consider the proposal, and for the present I leave it with the Treasurer and ask him in the limited time still at his disposal, to give the matter consideration and see whether the suggestion made can be accepted. If the suggestion is not acceptable in the form in which I have submitted it, the honourable gentleman may himself be able to submit an amendment which will meet the difficulty. Honourable members are at a very great disadvantage in discussing this bill, because under Standing Order 171 it is not competent for them to move any amendment upon it. The standing order provides thatNo amendment for the imposition or increase of a tax rate or charge shall be proposed by any non-official member in any committee on any bill. [217] The Treasurer has submitted a number of amendments because, I presume, he comes within the category of official members. Other members have responsibilities to their electors and to public service associations outside who make suggestions for the amendment of the measure. We have only just received a long list poses to move, and have not had time tain whether they conflict with amendments we have in mind ourselves. I presume that our only opportunity to move amendments was when the main resolution was before the House some days ago.* A t that stage we knew nothing of the provisions of the bill, and could not indicate what amendments of it we considered necessary. A similar other matters. When, for instance, a Minister laid on the table the report of Yarwood and Company on the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, no motion that it be printed was moved, and, consequently, honourable members were given no opportunity of discussing that report, as many of them desired to do. These difficulties due to the Standing Orders should be considered and remedied by the Standing Orders Conimittee. Seeing that They the Treasurer intends to move certain amendments on the bill, I hope he will take notice of amendments suggested in the course of the debate. This bill is of very great importance to the Commonwealth Public Service. I intend to support it. I hope to be able to suggest certain amendments which the Treasurer may agree to incorporate in it . I quite realize that a superannuation scheme must be actuarially sound, and the Superannuation Board must see that it does not make an exorbitant drain upon the people. Consequently, any amendments suggested should be reasonable. The superannuation scheme established under the principal act of 1922 was based upon the report of actuarial experts of whom Mr Wickens, the Commonwealth Statistician, was one. I am glad to notice that the bill now before us rightly brings within the scope of the superannuation scheme warrant and non-commissioned officers and men of the Military Forces, and officers who were excluded from the benefits of the principal act.",58,Earle Page

I am very glad that the Government has seen fit to amend section 4 of the principal act by clause 4 of this bill . with a matter on which I had occasion to interview the Treasurer when he was in Rockhampton with the then Minister for Trade and Customs. I had the pleasure of taking to him two people who were outside the scope of the superannuation scheme because the word "" service "" in section 4 of the act is interpreted to mean "" service under or employment by the Commonwealth "" and under section 35 reference is made toAn employee who(n) has been in the Servioe for at least to this act as are applicable. ten years, who may get certain benefits. qualification cut out a number of men engaged in the lighthouse service of Australia. U p to 1915 these men were employed by the State Governments. They were then taken over by the Commonwealth. Because at the date of the passing of the principal act they had not been ten years in the Commonwealth Service they and their dependants were denied the benefits of the superannuation scheme. The Treasurer will probably remember the case I brought before him of Mr G. A. Stevens, of Rockhampton, who joined the State Marine Department at the pilot station, Keppel Bay, in February, 1901. He served continuously in different lighthouses u n t i l his retirement in 1922, seven years after the taking over of the lighthouses by the Commonwealth. Although he had given 21 years' service in the state and the Commonwealth, under the interpretation of "" service "" in the act he was denied the benefits of superannuation. Fortunately clause 4 of this bill will meet his case. Another case was that of Mr G. W . Gray, whose widow I introduced to I think the provision the Treasurer. , He was in the lighthouse servioe for 38 years and seven, months,and was for a long time superintendent at It should include not Dent Island. He died in 1922, and his widow could not get any benefits under the superannuation scheme. I submitted these cases to the Treasurer, and also the case of a postal assistant who was taken over from the state service and had state rights. He died in 1922, and his widow was entitled to a small pension under a state act, and was consequently under section 51 of the principal act prevented from seeking any benefits from the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. I understand that under clause 11 of the bill that widow will be able to receive a pension for herself and her children. This is a good provision. One of the It deals amendments I shall move if I have the opportunity is to delete from clause 7, after the word "" contributor,"" the words "" who is less than 60 years of age, and "" . The proposed new section 16A would then readA contributor to whom Part IVA . of this act does not apply may, within six months after . the commencement of this section, and an employee who becomes a contributor after the commencement of this section may, within six months from the date of the commencement of his employment, elect to contribute at such rates specified in the third or fourth schedule I also desire to insert the following proviso That after proposed new sub-section 2: Provided that an employee who has attained the age of 60 years before the date of commencement of this section shall contribute, in respect of other units, at the rate prescribed for the age of 60. give notice in the Housei n detail of amendments to be moved in committee. be prevented by the Standing Orders from moving in committee any amendment which would increase the appropriation. has that effect will be ruled out of order apart from the Standing Orders, because parliamentary practice in that regard is invariable. allowed at this stage to indicate amendments which I consider desirable. The object of those amendments I have outlined is to place an employee between the ages of 60 and 65 years on as favorable a footing as an officer who is not quite 60.

This bill provides for the f u l l payment of a pension to an officer who makes a higher contribution in order that he may retire at 60. Thus a great discrimination is made between officers of the ages of 59 and 61 respectively. Dr. greatest consideration to officers who are over 60 years of age. and desire to retire at 60, will be required, to make no further payments towards their pensions, but the man who is 61 is required to continue his contributions until he is 65. Probably many employees will die before they attain t h a i age. Whilst some men are young at 70, others are old at 60 years. give the higher must be the rate of contribution. amendment I am suggesting would involve an increase in the rate of contribution, and the Treasurer pointed out in his second-reading concessions he is proposing will not do so. The object of my proposal is to treat all men between the ages of 60 and 65 as they would be treated if they had not reached 60 years. If the amendment were incorporated in the bill, such employees, upon payment of a higher rate, would be able to retire on the f u l l pension instead of on the smaller actuarial equivalent, as at present. I believe that the cost to the Government would be actually less in respect of men retiring between 60 and 65 than in respect of those retiring at 60, whilst the Superannuation Board would be protected by the payment of the higher rates. Under this bill a contributor aged 59 years, when he attains the age of 60 years, will be relieved of the obligation to make further contributions, and will be entitled to receive a f u l l pension when he retires at any time; whilst a contributor who is now 60 years of age will have to contribute u n t i l he is 65 years before he can enjoy a f u l l pension. Should he retire before 65 years, his pension will be merely the actuarial equivalent of a f u l l pension. Thus a contributor who is 60 years of age now, if he retired,, would have to make a lump sum payment of £36 Is. in order to receive a pension of The£ 6 8 7s. 8d. If no such payment were made the pension would be only £ 2 6 2s. A contributor aged 63 years would have tr> make a lump sum payment of £ 1 7 18s. in order to-get a pension of £ 8 6 19s. If no lump sum payment were made, the pension would be £ 4 4 18s. per annum. Yet both those officers will have contributed for a f u l l pension of £ 1 0 4 per annum at 65 years. Honoraible members EARL E PAGE -The act gives the will-admit that those contributors who are now between the ages of 60 and 65 yeas* will be at a great disadvantage. The 192S actwas made retrospective to December, 1920, and contributions from persons under 65 years of age started from the 5 th January, 1923. Those officers, however, who were over 65 years of age at that date received a pension of four units without making any contribution; and as the retiring age for all new contributors is to be 60 instead of 65, I urge upon the Treasurer the advisability of placing all contributors between 60 and 65 on the same footing as those employees who were over 65 when the principal act commenced. That would mean that those who are over 60 now would receive a f u l l pension without making a further contrispeech that certain bution, in the same way as a man who is only 59 years of age will be entitled to a f u l l pension twelve months hence without being required to continue payments after 60. There would be no loss to the Government, because the majority of the men who are now between 60 and 65 years of age will not live much longer, probably ten years at the most. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman) will probably propose an amendment of section 34 of the principal act by inserting a new clause after clause 9, to delete the word "" female "" and substitute the word ""his "" for the word "" her "" whenever occurring. The object of that amendment is to place a single male contributor or a contributor without dependants under the act, e.g., a widower with children over sixteen, on the same footing as a female contributor in regard to the refund of contributions. That would be fair and reasonable. It would mean no extra cost to the Government, and the increased cost to the Superannuation Board would not be high enough to affect the rate of contributions.

I should like, also, to receive from the Minister for Defence an assurance, that all members of Forces due to come under the deferred pay scheme shall, in the event of death, invaliding, or retirement, receive an amount of deferred pay not less than one year's salary, inclusive of deferred pay. MrD . CAMERON know that. Can the Minister assure me that the rates of deferred pay to be prescribed for the Naval Auxiliary Services will be the same, rank for rank and rating for rating, as those in force for the remainder of the Permanent Naval Forces? but they will not be the same, because the' ages for retirement are different. realize that this is a bill that can be more appropriately dealt with in committee than on the second,reading, but I wish to place on record my recognition of the f u t i l it y of indicating amendments at this stage of the session,'when the House is jaded by long sittings, and in consequence moreor less irninterested. Treasurer has tabled the bil l in the dying hours of the session, and has not given honourable members a fair opportunity to examine its provisions. It is a highly technical bill, the actuarial basig of which warrants the most careful study. time this Parliament adopted the system of the British House of Commons of appointing committees to consider measures of this character. be a Standing Select Committee to consider the effect of this complicated amending b ill, the expense involved to the taxpayer, and the merits of the proposals of the Service organizations. I , therefore, approach the subject with some trepidation I recognize that the Government has done something to remove anomalies that have weighed heavily upon widows and some of the contributors. I have no desire to discuss that aspect of the matter at length, but I protest against the way in which the Treasurer has delayed the bill. not know whether that delay has been unavoidable, accidental, or deliberate. I have repeatedly asked when the bil l would be presented, but I have received no. other response than that it would be presented "" in due course."" In view of all the circumstances, I shall deliver the remainder of my speech in the form of the Naval Auxiliary questions. W h y is there a differential age for military officers ? W h y are lieut generals to be retired at 65, major-generals at 62, and majors, captains, and lieutenants at 55? Do those figures indicate the relative periods of capacity of officers of the different ranks? It seems I am glad to peculiar that a lieut -general can be efficient up to 65 years of age, while a major, captain, or lieutenant, who is subordinate in *ank, is incapable of continuing his duties after 55 years -of age. to a higher rank than captain at 55 years of age, he ought to go out. but there is another way to look at the matter. It is strange that a man can be a lieutenant-general, at 65, but cannot carry out the duties of a major or captain after he has passed the age of 55. Why cannot the Government recognize temporary service as part of the continuous service defined in clause 4? Why not extend the right of re-election to all members of the Service, on the lines already exThe plained and amplified by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) and others? W h y not make the retiring age for all members of the Service CO years? Why have two schedules, one for officers retiring at 65 years of age, It is and one for others retiring at 60 years of age? The Treasurer expressed doubt in his second-reading speech whether members of the Service as a whole would There ought to accept the increased contributions provided for in the bill to enable them to retire at 60 years of age. Judging by the views expressed by the Public Service organizations, I am inclined to think that they would accept the increased contributions. The fixing of the retiring age at 65 years has been largely responsible for the failure of a considerable section of the Service to elect to take an increased number of units. That failure suggests that the Service was dissatisfied with the old provision, and sup-, ports my suggestion that there should be* I do",62,Earle Page

Treasurer, in his second-reading speech, explained that the provision in the bill would apply to about 40 widows and 11 children, and was limited to the widows of employees who died during the two years' period commencing on the 31st December, 1920. TEat period ended on the 31st December, 1922, but contributions commence u n t i l the 5th January, 1923. I presume that the provision will apply to employees who died on or before the 5th January, 1923. I suggest to the Treasurer that special consideration should be given to officers over the age of 60 years who have been retired Many of them have long records of f a it h f u l and efficient service, and even if it is not possible to give them the f u l l pension, could he not provide a special fund to make up the f u l l pension rates for them 1 persons will rapidly diminish, and they will entirely disappear in the course of a few years. Men who have had from 30 to 40 years' service are entitled to treatment equal to that given to the younger men, who will ultimately reap the f u l l benefit of the act. . When the bill is in committee I shall move an amendment to prevent the discrimination that is now made in regard to women who die in the Service. They have the right to will their superannuation contributions to any beneficiary nominated by them. I submit, on behalf of the Service organizations, that the word "" female "" should be l e f t out, so that the concession shall apply equally to unmarried men and widowers. I regard all those persons as having equal claims. It w ill save a lot of discussion if the Treasurer, a t the conclusion of this debate, will reply to the questions I have asked, and explain the amendments proposed. ' I desire at the outset to congratulate the Treasurer on introducing a bill that has many excellent features. I am glad that one of its principal objects is to provide pensions for members of the military and air forces. The feature that appeals to me very much is the provision made for the widows and children of those officers who died before they had time to elect to come into the scheme. W ill this The Service provision be retrospective to the time when the principal act was proclaimed? D r . EARLE PAGE It w ill be. The MrA . GREEN W ill the persons benefiting receive the money in a lump sum ? D r . EARLB PAGE -Yes. MrA . GREEN -That will remove a great deal of discontent. The benefits will go to the widows and children of old officers in the Service, who must have been in the Service for at least ten years to be to the fund did not eligible to elect to come into the scheme. It is a just clause, whatever actuarial adjustments will be necessary to give effect to it , and will receive the approbation, not only of honourable members on bo'.h sides of the House, but of all members of the Public Service. A m I correct in assuming that the Public Service Board can retire a man at 60 years of age without intimating why he is retired ? If the man was contributing for four units of pension, which is equivalent to £ 2 a week at the age of 65, he would go out at 60 years The number of these on a pension of £ 3 0 per annum, and would have to pay a lump sum of £ 3 5 in order to receive a pension of £ 7 0 a year. I submit that if the Public Service Board retires a man at 60 it should give reasons for so doing. The man concerned should have the right to go before a government medical officer, and if a certificate is given that he is not physically or mentally able to do the work required of h i m, he should be granted a pension for the f u l l amount for which he is subscribing. ' I regret that the blot on the original act is not being erased by this amending b ill . It is most unfair that -no provision ismade for the dependants of deceased single men or deceased widowers to benefit by their contributions. It is well known that many single men have widowed mothers dependent upon them. No t in frequently the men are single because they have to keep their mothers. It is a monstrous anomaly that on their death their dependants obtain no benefits from their contributions. Provision should be made for their contributions to be repaid to whomever they may have nominated. It has been said that to make such a provision would involve increasing the contributions of a l l . subscribers. There would be no general objection to that, although it appears that the board has",63,Earle Page
300,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie) [10.25].,"informed the Government otherwise. Common justice demands that the dependants of this class of subscribers should obtain some benefit from the payments of their bread-winners, and I do not think that any fair-minded person would object to an increase in contributions to enable this provision to be made. It is extraordinary that although these dependants are not given any benefit in the case of the death of an unmarried male subscriber, a single man dismissed from the Service, or even jailed, has returned to him the f u l l amount of his contributions. does not take steps to rectify the position I can assure it that the Labour government, which will be in power in 1926, will do so. The Treasurer must recognize the injustice of the present scheme in this respect, I am confident that it is a mistaken belief that serious objection would be made to an all-round increase of a few pence per week in contributions in order to deal justly by unmarried or widowed contributors with dependants.' I trust that early next year the National Insurance Royal Commission will be able to submit to the Government a scheme which will improve the lot of all workers throughout the Commonwealth. Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [10.40] I received a telegram this evening from the secretary of a Service organization which has a large membership. It reads as follows :Am advised Superannuation Amending Bill provides pensions mature at sixty only; those persons under sixty would like to see an amendment making provision .to enable full pension to be paid earlier than sixty-five for those under or over sixty at commencement principal act should they desire to retire at any time after reaching sixty.

The delay in the introduction of this measure has been unavoidable on account of the tremendous number of actuarial investigations that had to be made. The work was being done, by particular individuals, and could not be transferred to other officers. Thef u ll effects of some of the amendments that If this Government honourable members have suggested cannot possibly be appreciated without the making of careful actuarial calculations. It would be most unwise, for instance, to agree, without such a calculation, to alter the basis on which single male contributors subscribe. It is quite possible that the adoption of the proposal would be most detrimental to the fund unless a general increase in contributions had been made to meet the expense of doing so. missed for misconduct or jailed for some crime he is entitled to a refund of his contributions to the scheme, but if an officer dies his contributions remain in the fund. wealth system of superannuation is practically a family benefit scheme, and for that reason there is a distinction between the benefits contributed to by male and female employees.

Question resolved in the affirmative. B ill read a second time. In committee.; Clauses1 to 3 agreed to. Clause4 (Interpretation). I am very disappointed with the attitude adopted by the Treasurer respecting the position of the men who were transferreo from the Victorian Marine Department to the Commonwealth Service. These men were transferred subsequent to the date of the proclamation of the Superannuation Act, but prior to that date it was known that they were to be taken over. It is grossly unfair that they should be deprived of advantages accruing to men from the same Service who were transferred previous to the proclamation. H ad they remained in the State Service they would have enjoyed great benefits under the proposed Victorian superannuation scheme. on a perfectly equitable basis. who were previously in the Service received very generous treatment. entitled to discriminate between certain officers. The Public Service should be administered with equity and justice. If one section receives specially generous treatment it will cause a great deal of dissatisfaction in the Service. There is a difference of £ 4 0 between the annual contributions of these men, and the Government should do the fair thing and back-date their appointments. I have endeavoured to put the case clearly to the Government, and have shown it a way out of the difficulty, but Ministers apparently are not prepared to do justice to these men. ber going to move an amendment ? were possible, but I am prevented by the Standing Orders from submitting any amendment. I recognize that a line must be drawn somewhere in the application of an act of this kind, but Ministers know that the men to whom I have referred are to be transferred to the Commonwealth benefits of the superannuation scheme which are given to other men whose services are on absolutely the same terms. J trust that I shall be given some assurance that justice will be done to these men before this bill is disposed of, or that another bill w ill be brought down, if not this session, early in next session, to meet their difficulty. surer) [11.3] I point out to the honourable member that the first consideration in connection with the superannuation scheme is its actuarial stability. If we are to continually add to the number of persons who are given the right to take advantage of the rate of contribution f o i the age of 30 years, it is not possible for the scheme to remain actuarially sound. Special consideration was given in the case of officers who at the commencement of the act had already been in the Commonwealth Service for some time. It is because the first consideration is the stability of the fund that the honourable member's suggestion cannot be accepted. understand that sub-section 5 of section 13 is the section relied upon for the distinction between officers to which exception is taken by the honourable member for Officers Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin). It provides thatAn employee who at the commencement of The Government is not this act is not less than 30 years of age shall make certain contributions.

I explained on the second reading that the object of the amendment is to place an employee who is between 60 and 65 years of age on the same footing as an officer who is not quite 60. Under the principal act, an employee who retires between the ages of 60 and 65 years will obtain the actuarial equivalent of a f u l l pension, but that actuarial equivalent will mean a very meagre sum for the majority of the employees, and a big lump sum will have to be paid to secure even that. The amendment aims at treating all men between the ages of 60 and 65 as if they hadnot attained the age of 60, so that upon payment of the higher rate they will be entitled to retire upon a f u l l pension, and not the actuarial equivalent as at present. I believe that the cost to the Government would be less in the case of men retiring between 60 and 65 years than in the case of those retiring at 60, and the Superannuation Board would be protected from loss by the payment of the higher rates. I hope that the Treasurer will accept that amendment, for which the Public Service Associations have asked. surer) [11.25] -The proposal contained in the clause is much more generous than the existing provision. It is an application-of the defence superannuation scheme to the Public Service as a whole, so that, whereas previously the employees could only contribute to a scheme based on a maximum retiring age of 65 years, they will in futur e have the alternative of electing to contribute for a pension on retirement at 60 years. Despite this improvement, Public Service associations have asked that consideration be given to the possibility of reducing the maximum age from 65 to 60 years. That proposal is resisted by many men in the Service, who say that their present contributions are sufficiently heavy. have been submitted on behalf of the employees by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde), and the honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson). The adoption of the amendment proposed by the former honourable member would mean a great addition to the contributions necessary in order to enable all officers to retire at the age of 60. It is estimated that there are in the Service about 500 employees between the ages of 60 and 65 years. Assuming that they are contributing on an average for five units, or £ 1 3 0 per annuma low average considering that it includes a large proportion of the officers who are contributing heavily to the superannuation fund the annual amount of pension which the Government would be called upon to pay if the officers were now all retired, would be £72,500. Whether the employees retire or remain in the Serviceu n t il they attain the age of 65, it would still be necessary for the Government to recoup the superannuation f u n d to the extent of about £7,500 annually, to cover the contributions which would have ceased. Again, if officers now 60 years of age and over were exempted from the payment of further contributions, those officers who are under 60 years of age, and do not come under the new scheme, would, when they attained the age of 60 years, claim to be also allowed to cease contributing. That would upset the whole of the scheme, and be unfair tothose who elected to contribute at higher rates for the purpose of securing a f u l l pension at 60. Under the circumstances I cannot accept the amendment. There seems to be a big disparity between the position of members of the Service who are just under the age of 60 years and those who have just attained that age. A contributor who is now 59 years of age w ill , when he attains the age of 60 years, be entitled to receive a f u l l pension, but a contributor who is now 60 will have to contribute u n t i l he reaches the age of 65 years, or else he w ill have to pay a large lump sum in order to obtain a f u l l pension. be avoided. there should be some graduation of the payments to overcome it .

Section 50 of the principal act is amended by the deletion of the words ' not less than two-thirds of,' and the insertion of the words ' equal to.' "" The section will then readIf suitable employment is offered to him, at a salary equal to his salary at the time of his retirement, or at such salary as is agreed upon between him and the Public Service Commissioner, the board may cancel the pension and thereupon it shall cease to be payable. That would safeguard the contributor. An officer retired on the ground of invalidity should not be asked tp perform duties for less remuneration than his former salary. My amendment proposes that the salary shall be equal to that paid at the time of retirement, instead of being only two-thirds of it . The contributor would still be allowed to work at a reduced rate of pay if he agreed to do so. surer) [11.52] I hope that the honourable member will not press his amendment, because the section as it stands is fair and reasonable. If a man was provided with employment at not less than two-thirds of his salary, he would receive more than the equivalent of'his pension. That is an eminently fair provision. Members of tbp Service desire the superannuation scheme to work efficiently, and that end will be promoted by providing that public ""servants shall not be placed on pension unnecessarily. effect of the amendment will be that a. man's pension cannot be taken away from him if he is retired through ill health unless he can return to his previous position. He must be offered his previous position if he is fit to fill it , or, if he is not fit for that, his pension must not be reduced. To a man who is judged to be not restored to health, the Government now says, "" We cancel your pension and compel you to do other work at two-thirds of your former salary."" That provision is not vide for the application of the act to cerquite so fair as it appears to be. tain employees at Cockatoo Island DockIf Government will be involved in very when the dockyard was taken o.ver by little increased expenditure, because the the Shipping Board. The Shipping Act. majority of menwould prefer to return to under which the board took control of work at a reduced salary, if they felt the establishment, makes no provision able to do so, rather than continue on a pension. If the Public Service Board will not offer him the amount of his former wages, a man still has the option of agreeing to accept a smaller amount. I contend that my amendment is reasonable. If suitable employment is offered to a man at a salary equal to that which he received at the time of hi3 retirement, or at such salary as is agreed upon between him and the Public Service Board, he can still be employed. The Government would not lose much by accepting the amendment, because there would probably be very few cases in which a retired officer would recover his former vitality, and if such an officer was not able to do as much work as formerly, there would be nothing to prevent him from coming to an arrangement with the Public Service Board to accept a reduced salary. In some cases there might actually be a reduction of the expenditure involved, for the Government might be saved the cost of employing a man at increased wages to do the work of .the retired officers who could be re-employed at a salary equal to that .which he was receiving at retirement.

The conditions of life to which these people have been accustomed are not in keeping with the standard we enjoy and desire to maintain in Australia. I should welcome an amendment of the immigration law which would restrict the number permitted to secure entrance into the Commonwealth. It may be expected that the restrictions placed upon the admission of southern Europeans to America will direct their attention to Australia. If they could be usefully employed on their arrival, there would not be so much reason to complain of their admission, but in view of the fact that people of our own k it h and k in are unable to obtain employment in Australia, and that there is ""an army of unemployed of our own race in Britain, our immigration law should give preference to -the admission of people accustomed to something like our standard of living, whose presence would be acceptable to Australia.

I have drawn the attention of the Government to the fact that immigrants from the continent of Europe enjoy great advantages as compared to immigrants from Great Britain, and that Czecho-Slovakians have been admitted to this country who cannot speak a word of English. No provision was made for receiving them, and they are living on the charity of our citizens. It is said that they were introduced to be farm hands, but the TradesH a l l authorities have had [12.58 to take them in hand, and in Newcastle they had to go to the mayor of the city to obtain assistance for them.

Some Chinese Btowaways have on occasion arrived in Australian ports. Persistent efforts are apparently still being made to introduce Asiaticsi n this illicit way. There are organizations at work in Australia, as well as overseas, to accomplish this end. It has been found that, the penalty, ranging up to £ 1 0 0 , is not a sufficient deterrent to these people, and it is proposed to increase the monetary penalty to £200 upon any one convicted of bringing a prohibited immigrant secretly to the Commonwealth. This will be provided for by new clauses which it is intended to propose. After the honourable gentleman's explanation I do not think there can be any objection taken to the amendment.

It is intended to propose the insertion of another new clause under penalty for being concerned in bringing immigrants secretly to the Commonwealth will be increased from £ 1 0 0 to £200. The proposed new clause 5A will give the Minister discretion in dealing w it h a person about to be deported. ""Under the existing law such a person, on finding two sureties of £ 5 0 each, may be released until deportation.

To those provisions I have no objection; and I agreed to allow the bill to pass without opposition, but the new clause now before the committee has nothing to do with either European or Asiatic immigration. the proposed new clause is to give the Minister discretion in dealing with a prohibited immigrant between the date of the order of deportation and the sailing of the ship. men only ? ordered to be deported. relate to the deportation of any persons who are disqualified by section 8A of the act. It is meant to give the Minister power to deport any political refugee.

With regard to the apparent delay in submitting the Supplementary Estimates for 1921-22, I may mention that it has always been customary for the Auditor-General's report, together with the Treasurer's financial statement of accounts for the year, to be submitted to Parliament before they are presented. The statement of accounts for the year 1921-22 and the Auditor-General's report on them, were presented late in October, 1922, and, as honourable members immediately went to an election, no opportunity occurred to ask Parliament to deal with those Supplementary Estimates.then. After the election there was a very short session, lasting only about a fortnight, and as the session held last year was. very hurried,, only matters of urgency could be dealt with, and no opportunity was afforded of dealing with the amount of the vote for the Treasurer's Advance for 1921-22 was £1,500,000, and the expenditure was £1,412,072, made up as follows:-Ordinary departmental expenditure and war services, £1,027,917; additions, new works and buildings, £384,155. The Auditor-General's report for the year 1922-23 was not available until the 10th December, 1923. Parliament rose during . the latter part of August, and it was not possible then to bring down the Supplementary Estimates. This year the advance to the Treasurer was £1,500,000, and the expenditure made from this vote was £1,377,736, made up as follows: Departmental expenditure and war services Refunds of revenue Additions, new works, and buildings 28.128 Losses on 1920-21 and 1921-22 Fruit Pools'Advances to 1922-23 Fruit Pool (to be recovered) ..

I am therefore now in a position to bring down the Supplementary Estimates for 1923-4.

It will thus f be seen that many opportunities have .. .. 344,618 been afforded to honourable members to .. .. 141,990 make themselves familiar with the expenditure which is now submitted for their approval in the Supplementary .. .. .. 312,000 Estimates. .. .. 551,000 Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [1.48 a.m.]. --This is the last opportunity we shall £1,377,736 have to direct the Government's attention of questions about tbe timber industry. Tbe reply I received was, "" Tbe information is being obtained."" I can readily understand that it had probably been impossible to obtain the information in the meantime. I asked whether it was a fact that timber production in the Commonwealth of Australia had decreased in the period from 1921 to1924 by 13,000,000 superficial feet; and that during the same period the exportation of Australian timber had decreased by 23,000,000 superficial feet, and the importation of foreign timber had increased by 123,000,000 superficial feet. It is a very sorry commentary, on the protectionist policy of Australia that this industry, which has given remunerative employment to so many people, is being wiped out of existence by portations. that can be remedied except by further tariff protection. It is too late to expect any measure of tariff relief for this or any. other industry during this session of Parliament. I bring the figures again under the notice of the Minister in the hope of impressing upon him the necessity for making the fullest possible inquiries immediately as to the condition of the industry, with a view to ascertaining whether anything can be done between now and the next session of Parliament to give relief. During the next session of Parliament it will be possible to increase the tariff protection. A number of mills are being closed down, and the workers in them are being thrown out of employment. It is very serious for those portions of Australia that rely very largely upon the timber trade for their prosperity. That great industry is suffering because our policy of protection does not sufficiently protect. Another industry that is suffering probably to a greater extent is the textile industry. My reason for bringing that before the committee at this hour of the sitting is, perhaps, a selfish one. I have received, during the last few days, from the director of a woollen mills at Hobart, telegrams that disclose the serious position existing there. readsSaturday's Hobart press states members proThat newspaper is not a supporter of the pose adjourn this week and anticipate long party to which I belong, but I admit that holiday. To-day's press gives warning that T large number Australia's woollen mills will be closed unless tariff relief is given. If Parliament thus callously throws hundreds out of employment, with consequent destruction to this fine industry, it will be a standing blot on the sincerity of Parliament. Suggest you move adjournment of House to-day and make final appeal. It is signed ""John Nettlefold, director, Aiken's ""Woollen Mills."" ' I telegraphed immediately asking how many employees there were in the textile industry in Hobart. His reply wasWe have 93 employees, and assume that the other mill has about the same. That is a small number actually, but when considered in relation to the size of the city, it is large. Proportionate numbers are suffering similarly in the other capital cities. That telegram proceededthe increased volume of imAustralian law justly protects them (the employees) by compelling us to pay double the I do not know how English wages, but if Parliament fails to also protect the employer against these low wages, I am firmly convinced that all ours, and the hundreds of others, will be thrown out of employment, because I believe it is physically impossible for the mills to pay. The last telegram received by me was as follows:If Kersall and Kemp's interview appearing in to-day's Mercury also appears in Melbourne press, I would explain they are also very large importers from their English factory. Mr Nettlefold then goes on to state that he is very pleased that the Minister for Trade and Customs will visit Hobart in a month's time, but he expresses the fear that it will then be too late, as the damage will have been done: That telegram' is rather significant, for it explains that someone connected with a woollen .mill, or a mill connected with the textile industry in Australia, has been writing to the newspapers opposing increases in the tariff. Some Australian woollen mills have been making reasonable profits for some time past, but others have not been doing so. The Minister for Trade and Customs recognizes that, great as the difficulties may be in giving relief, and impossible as it may be to give immediate relief, the onus is upon him to look into the matter and ascertain as soon as possible what can and ought to be done. I feel justified in placing on The first telegram record a few figures published by the Melbourne Age on Wednesday morning. ii .has always been a stalwart protectionist. However much I may differ from it on its general policy, I admit that it has always advocated Australian industries for Australian consumers. It stated yesterdayAccording to official calculations Great Britain exports to Australia over 97 per cent, of tlie requirements of this country in woollen aud worsted tissues. Mr O'KEEFE I realized that the figure 97 per cent, was a misprint. The article proceededThe competition has been stimulated by the compulsion placed on British manufacturers, confronted with a flood of cheap French woollen goods, to realize on surplus stocks as rapidly as possible. How the export of woollen and worsted tissue from the United Kingdom to Australia have been maintained are shown in the following figures :Year. 1920 1921 1922 1923 Seven months ended July, 1924 The Australian production of woollen and worsted tissues, on the other hand, was as f o l lows :1913.

There is evidence of over-importing in recent years, and that, notwithstanding the huge consumption, the imports of woollen and worsted tissues have been greater than the increased local production rendered necessarypossibly in excess of the country's ability to absorb."" Naturally this would react on the local woollen manufacturing industry. It would appear, further, from tbe statements of some companies, that overseas competition in itself has not been the sole cause of the depression. Other factors, including under-capitalization, shortage of efficient labour, and possibly in isolated instances a lack of efficient management, are said also to enter into the .calculation. Point is given by the present condition of the Australian manufacturing industry to the recommendation of Professor Barker, one of the world's authorities on textiles, that a textile school should be established in Australia. His report on the subject was presented several months ago, and some authorities consider that the establishment of a well-equipped textile school, under adequate protection, would rapidly give the Australian industry a commanding position in the local market. The demand for more adequate duties than those provided at present has evoked the approval and support of a number of members of the. House of Represent tatives. It appears from that statement that there is a big likelihood of many of our woollen mills closing down. If that should occur incalculable harm will be done to the industry in Australia. It is regrettable that although this Parliament has been in session since last March, nothing has been done by way of tariff revision to remedy this state of affairs. I know that the Minister for Trade and Customs is a good protectionist, and is anxious to do everything that he can to conserve the interests of Australian industries, and I trust he will take all possible steps to gather information on the situation so Square Yds. that assistance may be given to the in15,171,400 dustry as soon as possible. 9,239,500 22,234,000 The only other matter that I wish to 18,564,700 refer to is the treatment which ex-officers of the Federal Taxation Department have 10,057,200 received at the hands of the Classification Board in Hobart. To-day I received the following letter from the secretary of the ex-Federal Officers Association, in Hobart: 6th October, 1924. 1922-23. EX-FEDERAL TAXATION OFFICERS-LOSSE SI N ... 5,565,853 ... 7,828,943 Dear Sir, I regret having to approach you on .this mat7,953,873 ...12,872,437 ter in such an urgent manner as is now the case, but the actual results of the State Classification Board have only just become known. Upon reading the attached statement, I think you will agree that the ex-Federal officers have been very badly treated, and I am instructed by my committee to ask you if it is possible at this late stage for you to move the adjournment of the House in order to have the matter ventilated. If this is not possible or advisable, we would be grateful if you could take any other action which might bring about a more equitable result. From information received here, the officers in other states are also discontented, though to what extent they are worse off we are unable to say. It is considered that the Commonwealth Government should make up to the officers concerned the actual loss sustained. The statement that was attached to the letter gave details of the way in which federal officers had been treated by the State Classification Board in comparison with state officers who were doing the same class of work. The following figures",77,Atkinson Agreed Department Of Works And Railways £33 630

A number of other comparisons are given, but they are of the same nature. The actual amount lost per aunum by these ex-federal officers, as a result of their having been transferred to the State Service, ranges from £59 downwards. In many cases the difference is £27 per annum, which is a considerable amount to an officer who is receiving only £307 per annum. I trust that the Treasurer will take whatever steps he can to see that ex-officers of the Federal Service are more fairly treated. Ex-officers of the Federal Service should at least receive the same pay as state officers who do similar work. doubt honourable members noticed a paragraph which appeared in the Melbourne Age's, day or two ago, to the effect that some hundreds of employees engaged in the textile industry at Geelong, the Bradford of Australia, were likely to be dismissed. I could hardly understand the statement when I read it, so I visited Geelong yesterday to ascertain the position. I went to four woollen mills, and got first-hand information. I discovered that 300 employees at one mill are to be dismissed to-morrow, and that there is a likelihood of employees in other mills also being dismissed It is true that some mills are busy, but others are in a very serious position. At one mill, which is engaged almost exclusively in the manufacture of blankets and flannels, I was taken into a storeroom and shown a pile of 15,000 rolls of flannel; the value of which was roughly £90,000, which there was very little hope of selling for a considerable time. I was .also shown certain price-lists from a firm in England by the name of Becker, which I believe has some connection with a firm in Germany. According to those price-lists that firm was prepared to supply the Australian trade with yarn spun from shredded cloth, which is really old clothes torn up, carbonized and re-dyed, at a price as low as 9fd. a lb. A great deal of that class of stuff, which is very shoddy, is to-day being manufactured in Great Britain from yarn spun in Germany, and is sent here to compete with the Australian product made exclusively from Australian wool. It is remarkable that it is impossible to buy even the cheapest wool suitable for the manufacture of clothing at under 17d. or 18d. a lb. Honourable members will see at once how impossible it is for the Australian manufacturer to compete successfully with the overseas manufacturer. The position is very serious to the people engaged in the textile industry. The Minister for Trade and Customs has promised to give this matter his close attention. It has been stated that the industry will receive protection against dumping some time after April next. That is practically six months ahead, and if dumping still takes place there is ng possibility of many of the mills con-No tinuing operations. Probably every member of this House has on the public platform of this country emphasized the necessity for the establishment of more mills in Australia to manufacture our own raw material, but if the mills already established cannot be kept going because of unfair competition, it is improbable that the number of mills will be increased. Some persons say that there are other causes for the present depressed position. They believe that our workmen are not so efficient as those engaged in the textile industry in other countries. I differfrom that view. The men and women engaged in our textile industry are equal, in skill and ability to those in any other part of the world. In fact, many of our skilled workmen have been brought from the mills of Britain to help to establish the industry here, and to instruct Australians in the manufacture of the textiles. Every one knows that the Australian workman is intelligent and capable, and soon becomes proficient in any class of trade. I sincerely trust that the Minister will immediately investigate this matter, and take steps to prevent the closing of textile mills that have in the past rendered excellent service to Australia.

The matter was taken up on behalf of Mr Stirrat because of a speech made by the then Prime Minister, the Hon. W . M . Hughes, at Maryborough (Q.) during the last Federal election campaign, on 9th November, 1922, wherein lie was reported to have stated that t h t Co-operative National Government was prepared to assist in following letter, improving the quality of stock for the beef and dairying industries, and also sheep, by defraying the cost of transport and quarantine of any Cusstock brought into Australia with this end in view. In reply to my letter to Mr Hughesi n quiring if he was correctly reported, he confirmed the press report, and advised me to get into touch with the Customs Department to give effect to his promise, which I d i d ; but we regret to say, as you are, of course, aware, that your department repudiated Mr Hughes' promise. If you refer to the correspondence you will note no reference to any claim based on what other countries are doing in the direction indicated, but as you have re-opened the matter it occurs to me that your Government is prepared to reconsider its decision, and there is no doubt that under the circumstances the assistance sought for should have been forthcoming. In consequence of the written assurance of the Prime Minister, Mr Stirrat determined to give Australia the benefit of the Government's concession by purchasing higher-priced cattle-the National portion of tbe present Government went to the country under the leadership of Mr. Hughes, whose written promise induced Mr. Stirrat to spend money he had no intention of doing under other circumstances, and I certainly fail to appreciate that the Government is not morally bound to honour the promise of their leader when it was made by him as an inducement to those interested in stock to return the National party to power. I feel quite certain Mr Stirrat would not appreciate your suggestion that he approach No concessions in private shipping companies who have no cognizance of his existence, apart from the absence of any obligation on their part, or reason why he should do so, to approach them for assistance-wh y should these companies be expected to do what your Government, although under a moral obligation to do so, refused to do?",82,Salary

The request in this matter has been made in respect of cattle that are not produced in Australia. Mr Beak, the secretary of the Australian Polled Hereford Association, has had great success in exhibiting his stock at the Rockhampton and Brisbane shows. The Rockhampton Evening Ne ws of 11th August mentions the success of Mr Beak, at the Brisbane show I quote the following statement: Brisbane, 1 Till August, 1924 -The judging of the cattle section in connection with the Brisbane Exhibition commenced this morning, when Meary, Beak and Sons gained several successes in the polled Hereford section. Mr Beak, writing to me in connection with the matter, says:I think the fact of showing so successfully against the cream of our State should help you in persuading the Federal Government to assist us by paying the transit expenses on imported polled Herefords. I am getting an enlarged photo of our polled Hereford beef that won first prize at the Rockhampton Show, to send as a gift to the Federal Parliament. It will be sent to you, and I would like you to present it to the House on arrival. I thought I could not do better than place the photograph on the table of the House, as I have done, whilst this matter is under discussion. ' If Ministers w ill at it it may induce them to reconsider their decision to repudiate the promise of the leader of their party. Mr Beak writing to me in regard to that class of cattle, saidI had a letter recently from Mr Crani3ie, chairman of the Australian Meat Council, iu which he says that the beef we exhibited at Brisbane Show was excellent, and for export he had never seen better. It was taken from a polled Hereford, 3 years old, grass fed only. I am sending Mr Cranisie a photograph like the one that is going to you. It is the meat that was successful at Rockhampton, and what makes it of more value'to mc is the fact that Lakes Creek was placed second. That letter should be sufficient to induce the Government to reconsider this matter. In regard to Mr Beak's representations, the fact must be borne in mind that he is, in his own wordsacting solely for the Australian polled Hereford Breeders Association, and we only desire the concession to apply to approved polled Hereford stud cattle, and our chief reason for asking for this concession is because we cannot Mr Forde. get fresh blood in Australia, and fresh blood is vital to the development of this fine breed of early maturing cattle. My association will guarantee that all polled Herefords purchased in America are for members of the association only, and will not be sold for at least two years, or, if you desire.it, that they will not be sold at all, and are only purchased for breeding purposes. That association is not confined to Queensland. Its members are scattered throughout Australia. The annual meeting of the association was held in Rockhampton on 25th June last, when there were present: Mr G. H . Horne, of Rockfield (president^; Frederick Dearden, Tenterfield, New South Wales; A . H . Stirrat, Euroa; James Perry, Nebo; M . Beak, junior. Willarigi; J . W . McKenzie, Perrl Creek; W . H . Edwards, Collosseum; A. Walls, Rockhampton; and W . Beak, secretary. The president of the association at the present time is Mr Frederick Dearden, of Tenterfield. They have a right to expect that this Government should honour a moral, obligation. At Maryborough, on 9th November, 1922, Mr Hughes made a definite promise that if the Nationalists were returned to power the Government would pay the transport and quarantine charges on stud stock. Because of that promise many breeders who are endeavouring to improve their herds voted for the Nationalist party. Some of them wrote to Mr Hughes to ask if they interpreted his promise correctly, and he look replied that they did, and congratulated them upon their appreciation of it . 1 appeal to the Prime Minister, even at this late hour, to carry out that definite pledge given by his predecessor. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN The honourable member's time has expired regretfully obliged to take this opportunity to lay before the committee some facts in regard to the proposal to alter the basis of tariff preference to British goods. The Government has announced its intention to change the percentage of value to be added by British labour before goods can have the benefit of the preferential duty from 25 per cent, to 50 per cent., and even 75 per cent. When that statement was made to the HouseI protested against the subject being introduced in that way, because no opportunity was given to the House to express an opinion upon it . The Minister merely announced that the change would be made by departmental",83,Salary

I asked the Prime Ministeri f he would afford honourable members an opportunity to discuss the proposal. No real opportunity has been given because, although we may deal w i th it in Committee of Supply, it is hardly possible to get an expression of the composite opinion of the committee. I am, therefore, forced to take this opportunity of disclosing the facts relating to British preference. I have elicited those facts only by a series of questions, and considerable trouble, but. I acknowledge the courtesy of the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) in making available to me certain documents, and allowing me to see some departmental reports to which I shall refer later. I have not been able to peruse all the papers connected with this matter; so, although there ' may be on the files information which may contradict or modify some of the statements -I shall make, those statements w ill be, so f a r as my knowledge goes, absolutely correct. British preference was first introduced by the Tariff Act of 1907, and the section which i m posed it readsThe rates of duty set out in ScheduleA in what proportion of value should be added the column headed "" Tariff on Goods the Proby British labour, and so f a r as I can duce or Manufacture of the United Kingdom"" see there is no statutory power to make shall apply only to goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, which are any such regulation now.

A regulation was passed prescribing the for m of declaration which should accompany the goods.

I have had a great deal to do with the f r a m i ng of regulations under statute, and ensuring that departmental action waslegally correct; but I have never heard of an important direction, such as that controlling Australia's trade with the United Kingdom, being introduced in this indirect and devious manner by means of a declaration in a for m attached to a regulation.

Even now the change cannot be made without Parliament being asked to subscribe to it . I have asked that the whole matter be deferred u n t i l next session, when an opportunity w ill be afforded to properly consider the proposal. If the regulation came into force on the 1st A p r i l next this House would be precluded from taking any action in regard to it . Having dealt w it h the legal position I now wish to discuss the actual merits of the proposal. Some of the documents which led up to the introduction of the 75 per cent, basis are significant. I have not seen the complete file, but with the courtesy of the MinisterI have seen a report by the Comptroller-General of Customsf M a j o r Oakley), recommending ""the adoption of the 75 per cent, standard, and a letter drafted by the Customs Department, and sent by the Prime Minister to the Prime Minister of New Zealand. This letter appears to have been written in reply to a letter from the Prime Minister of New Zealand, following upon previous proposals of this nature, in which evidently the Prime Minister of New Zealand raised objections to the imposition of' the 75 per cent, standard. The document sent to New Zealand contains a series of protected by tariff and anti-dumping duties arguments as to why that standard should against foreign goods, and such are not feared be adopted, and eventually, apparently, it led to the Prime Minister of New Zealand agreeing to it . But these documents are remarkable. The report of Major Oakley, dated 14th June, 1924, contains this passageI t was left (by the 1908 act) to departmental interpretation to determine the extent to which such goods must be British manufacture. I maintain that there is no reference in the act to such a power being lef t to the department. The report also statedI agree that the definiThis 25 per cent, has greatly prejudiced manufacture and production in the United Kingdom. He went on to say that he had discussed Apparently it means any goods the matter in England"" with a director of a large British firm,"" and we subsequently find that he consulted with the And no goods not Australian Association of British Manufacturers. The report continuesSecondly, it is detrimental to us because Q u it e so; . 1 do not we cannot compete with Great Britain. It If it was never contemplated (when the 25 per cent, standard was adopted) that circumstances might arise which would cause this provision to result in the reduction of labour and production in the United Kingdom. On the one hand Major Oakley said that the provision should be altered because it harmed the manufacturers of GreatB r it a in ; and, on the other hand, he said that it was harmful to Australia, because we could not compete with British manufacturers. It is the most illogical argument that I have heard for a long time. He further saidThere can be no question that the raising of the proportion of British labour would mean additional work in Great Britain. Yet he said that we should improve our basis of competition with GreatB r it a in . Apparently the Prime Minister of New Zealand raised a very important point. It has been alleged in this country that the proportion of British manufacture should be raised, because it would exclude goods that are largely foreign, and that are made up in England and exported to Australia. I submit that it would have just the reverse effect. If we cut off the 25 per cent, of British labour, we shall divert the whole of the trade into foreign channels. The Prime Minister of New Zealand apparently raised the same point. This is the answer of M a j or OakleyIn most of the dominions, especially in Australia, the local manufacturers are adequately",84,Salary

F u l l copies of certain representations were laid on the table, and as they have already been published in f u l l in the press. I do not propose to read them again, but the effect of the reports of the Australian Association of British Manufacturers was to protest against the 75 per cent, standard being imposed, because, in its opinion, most of the manufacturers favoured 50 per cent, as a maximum. the replies to a questionnaire amongst British manufacturers, the secretary of the association went on to sayThe matter when under .consideration by a London conimittee of this association on the occasion of your recent visit to Great Britain was referred to a member of our London advisory committee, who was unable to attend the meeting of this special committee. This member ( I have not permission to mention his name) has dealt exhaustively with the subject, and in communicating his regret at being unable to be present, stated:-""Replying to your letter of the 16th January, I went very deeply into the question of the extension of the percentage of United Kingdom labour and material necessary to qualify goods for British preference .it the Board of Trade, and I have also examined it in relation to particular trades; and I am satisfied that an alteration of the .percentage would raise very considerable difficulties. I cannot conceive that those who have 'replied to your questionnaire, and asked for 50 per cent., have done so after close examination of tlie facts."" When this change was first mooted, it was stated in the press that other dominions were equally interested w i th us, and that before the Government proceeded to make any alterations they would communicate with the other dominions. I asked the Minister how the other dominions were associated w it h us, .and he said that no agreement had been entered into. I do not wish to i m ply that the Minister deliberately misled me, but there must have been some sort of understanding, for the report of the . . was Tariff Board on this matter states-The raising of the proportion from 25 to 75 per cent, would benefit British industries as well as those of Australia, and, if followed by all of tlie dominions who subscribed to the present conditions, it would enable Great Britain to come into her own The whole argument is a That suggested that the other dominions had subscribed to it . The Minister said I asked in one of my quesi n replyIn view of the fact that all the dominions have ibeen acting hitherto on a uniform basis in this matter negotiations were initiated, as a beginning, with New Zealand, for the purpose of making a general alteration. The communications began and ended with New Zealand. We have not troubled to find out what effect the regulation would have on our relations with the other dominions or the Imperial Government. The Tariff Board's report, which should be a most carefully prepared document, is very disappointing in its nature and scope. One would have thought that the Further, when forwarding first thing to be done in inquiring into the effect of a regulation' of this kind would be to get statistics of the trade affected. I inquired of the Minister whether any particulars were available as to t! e amount of goods imported into this country in respect of which 25 per cent., 50 per cent., or 70 per cent, of value had been added, and the reply was that the information was not available. Considering that these goods are imported with a declaration of their origin, it would surely be an easy matter to gather statistics over a period of a few months, so as to get an idea of the effect of the proposed change. The Tariff Board is supposed to make inquiries, and report. There is no account in its report of an inquiry. It does not mention any facts upon which its opinion is based. It merely expresses its opinion upon M a j i r Oakley's memorandum. That is not the way a Tariff Board should work. If it is an investigating board it should gather definite facts upon which a reliable opinion could be based. I protest against the way in which the business has been done. I protest against the proposal to alter the basis of trade, because of the effect that I believe it will have. member think that the effect will be favorable to Australia? so. We have been listening during this debate to a series of complaints of the effect of high protection upon Australian industries. people unemployed in Great Britain. many here. The honourable member need only read the report of Mr Wignali on that subject. As a matter of fact, there are nothing like 2,000,000 persons unemployed in Great Britain. The regulation will increase the amount of protection, the disastrous results of which are coming home to us every day, and have been the driving force behind the legislation passed by this House to oveiv come, by government, assistance, the difficulties and hardships placed upon the primary producers by the undue fostering of secondary industries. Whetheri t is right or wrong to increase the amount of protection on certain classes of goods may be a matter of opinion, but there should be no difference of opinion among honourable members as to how additional protection should be imposed. It should be imposed by the Parliament, and by the Parliament only, in a proper and legal way. It should not be done, as it were, by a side wind. It is notorious that certain industries have been pressing the Minister for additional tariff' duties. The Minister well knew that it would be very difficult and unpopular for him to introduce a definite proposal to the Parliament for a higher tariff, but by altering this regulation the same effect w ill be obtained. mothers who have to buy their children's clothing learn that the effect of this regulation will be either to raise the price of cloth or to prevent any reduction in the price of it below the high levels of war time, they will begin to object to the regulation being enforced merely by a scratch of the Minister's pen. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member's time has expired. A t the outset of my remarks it may be as well for me to indicate that I intend .to move the following amendment:That the total £1,027,917, be reduced by £6,500. The-amount of £6,500, by which I propose to reduce the total of £1,027,917, the honourable represents the total salaries of themem-, bers of the board. I move this amendment as a protest against the inexcusable I certainly do not think delay of the Government in presenting the Public Service Board's report to Parliament after the Public ServiceB ill had been disposed of; and also to express disapproval of the attacks on the Public Service Arbitrator and the officers of the Public Service generally. And proportionately as In reply to a question by me to-day, the report of the Public Service Board was tabled. Before to-day I had made inquiries of the board, and of the Prime Minister's Department, and could get no information regarding it , but, on referring to the report as tabled, I find that it is dated the 22nd September, 1924, when it was addressed to the right honourable the Prime Minister. I am advised that the report was handed to representatives of the press over a week ago, but whether by the Prime Minister's Department or the Public Service BoardI have been unable to ascertain. The press was instructed not to publish it u n t i l it was released, and the result was that it was published in the Melbourne newspapers last evening and this morning before honourable members had had an opportunity to peruse it . It may be contended that the usual practice has been followed, but most honourable members w ill agree with me that the practice is wrong. Every member of this Parliament should have an oppor-. tunity to consider papers of such paramount importance before the press has access to them, particularly if important matters of policy and legislation to which they relate are being discussed. I thereWhen the fathers and fore charge the Government w i th having deliberately delayed the submission of the report to Parliament. If the Government has not delayed it , the Public Service Board must have done so, and for that the Government must accept responsibility. It is peculiar that the report should reach honourable members the day following the long debate on the Public ServiceB ill , and late enough to prevent effective criticism of it . I have hastily looked through it since the tabled copy was handed to me earlier to-day, and I find many objectionable features in it.

407,Mr Coleman (Reid) [3.22 A.m.],"report upon the recent reclassification. Honourable members asked for information and reasons for the drastic departures made by the board from established principles in regard to the classification of the Public Service. While the Public ServiceB ill was being discussed, the report would have been useful to honourable members, although the tabling of it might, even at that stage, have had unpleasant results for the members of the board. It is one of the most extraordinary official documents I have ever perused. It is the first report of the new board created by the Government. It is remarkable for its amazing language, for its exaggeration, bias, and bathos. That is a f a i r detravelling time has become a vested interest scription of certain sections of it . Public Service Board with a quasi judicial status should have hesitated to in dulge in the savage criticism of the Service employees contained in the report. taining efficiency and contentment in the Service, and yet by its report it deliberately antagonizes members of that Service. I submit that the terms in which it is couched are calculated to raise intense indignation, and the attacks which it makes upon the Public. ServiceA r b i trator, who has a judicial status, are contrary to the established practice of all British communities. Attacks upon the Arbitrator are not in the public interest. The Government should most certainly tell the board to exercise a little more tact and discretion in phrasing its reports, and to keep within the limits of decent criticism of a concomitant authority such as* the Public Service Arbitrator. The report emphasizes the fact that the criticism of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey) and other honourable members on this side is quite justified, and that the charges that have been made against the board of lacking experience and of being militarized in its constitution are more than justified. Unf a i r criticism of those who comprise the Public Service should not be tolerated. I , therefore, ask honourable members to treat the matter with the seriousness that it deserves. I propose to quote from the report of the board to show that its criti cism is unfair. I shall not deal with the various matters in their order of importance, but in the order in which they appear in the report. On page 20 the following tactless criticism is made of officers who had' the temerity to claim their rights :' The position in many departments of the Service borders on the ludicrous as regards the avidity with which officers seize every opportunity of claiming the payment of higher duties allowance. I submit that such language is quite uncalled for where established rights are concerned. Further on, the board attacks the claim made by Service members to payment for travelling timea principle that has been established for years. On page 22 of its report the board saysThe difficulty is that the payment for A under arbitration awards, and the Public Service is particularly tenacious of vested interests. Much of the present expenditure on travelling time is unwarranted, and involves a free gift to the officers concerned. If any pf the expense is unnecessary, it It is charged with mainis the duty of the board to l i m it it . If it does not do so, it is failing in its duty. The statement that the Service is tenacious of its vested interests is ridiculous, and is a misuse of the English language. On page 23 we have an attack upon the very necessary desire of members of Parliament for information respecting various matters affecting the Service. In explaining the reason for the overtime worked, the board saysParliamentary returns are responsible for much overtime worked in Commonwealth departments, and it is questionable whether in many cases these returns, compiled at the cost of considerable labour and continuous night work, are really of very much value. It is probably not realized how much work is necessitated in the preparation of these returns. I claim that, that statement is impudent in the extreme. It is not for the board to determine whether the requests of members of Parliament for information are necessary or unnecessary. Such matters are outside the province of their report, and of fair criticism. A more serious matter is the attack on the principle of a livin g wage. On page 35 we findIt appears somewhat anomalous that a living wage, as thus defined, should be payable to employees upon reaching manhood's estate, although only a mere fraction of them marry at such an early age. I submit that in connection with that matter, the Arbitrator is charged with the responsibility of determining these things upon the established principles laid down by the Federal Further on, the criticism becomes-to put Houses. it mildly-exaggerated . On page 38 it is stated that the recent classifications -were quotations are from the report of the received with enthusiasm by the younger Public Service Board, as by reason of the men in several mail branches. is a misstatement ' of the position, language, they perhaps might not think as honourable members know, not only so. These statements emanate from a from communications they have received body of three alleged responsible men, personally, but from the evidence of occupying what are to be virtually judidiscontent which has appeared in the cial positions. Statements of that nature press reports of various Service employees' are not calculated to make the relations meetings. The board claims that the disof the board with the Service harcontent that exists has been deliberately monious, as was the intention of Parliamanufactured. It charges various Service ment. The board was not established .to unions w i th unfairly attacking the board, create discontent, but to administer the and on page 39 passes the following criticism:It is somewhat surprising to have to record that these charges were followed up by statements made in all seriousness in Parliament all departments commenced a telegraphic that the Board had committed a serious barrage which developed into an intensive breach of an arbitration award in reducing bombardment. Utterly regardless of the strain salaries, which, being arbitration salaries, placed, upon their fellow-unionists, the telewere sacrosanct, and should not have been graphists, these messages of remonstrance and varied by any process of classification. I submit -that it is by no means surprising that members of Parliament have pro tested against the board's deliberate desentence in the report reads:"" Every parture from the arbitration awards. Thj public servant was free to protest and language used is untimely and injudicious. used the telegraph at his own expense."" In reviewing the attacks made by the What an unnecessary and childish critiunions upon the classifications, the board cism to place in a report! Lower down, alludes to their action in the following the board suggests that the association terms:-The executive of the union circularized its honourable members. members throughout the Commonwealth, and prepared statements of grievances for the deals with political influence. I suggest, signature of those members, who in turn bomin passing, that if breaches of the regulabarded members of Parliament with these tions were committed, the board has been effusions. The report goes on to sayThe employees had nothing to lose and that officers, in protesting against injuseverything to gain, while the parliamentary retice, committed no breach of the regulapresentatives were subjected to a flow of manutions. I am assured that the Clerical factured pi-otests from men who had benefited Association acted only after receiving so materially by the classification, but who, if the opinions of their leaders were to be aclegal advice.

The ganizations used moral suasion to compel most serious portion of the report is that their members to join in protest. That which deals with the basic wage, fixed is ridiculous. An attack is made upon the by the Arbitrator. On page 49 we read, Clerical Association in the following lani n paragraph 2 : guage:Not content with circularizing members of Parliament, the Clerical Association adopted sideration of the evidence and arguments, inon attitude which was certainly not dignified, creased the basic wage to £204 in respect of and bordering closely on the hysterical, in adult male officers.

A little further on the board says: Acting upon these instructions, officers of complaint passed through the Melbourne telegraph office in hundreds and thousands. What a ridiculous exaggeration! Another committed a breach of regulation 36a matter which has already been before That regulation lacking in its duty in not taking action with respect to them. But it well knows statements that are not based upon truth , The Board, through its representative, placed its views fully before the Public Service Arbitrator, who, however, after conThe board then proceeds to attack the determination of the Arbitrator. That is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. Parliament established these two authorities to. work in harmony, and not to criticize each other in this manner. In another part of the report the board reviews the decisions of the Arbitrator, aud virtually states that they were not based upon proper principles. The concluding section of this part of the report is couched in the following language: Before concluding its remarks on this subject, the Board desires to emphasize its view tliat although during 1023-4 the Service has benefited by increased remuneration under arbitration ""determinations to the extent of £255,000 per annum, the recent -basic wage judgment will commit the country to a still further increased expenditure of over £200,006 per annum on salaries of public servants already well remunerated. It is not for the board to attack a principle of which this Parliament has approved. In yet another place we"" find these words: The decision of the Arbitrator is founded on a slavish adherence to Statistician's figures distributed to honourable members before which were temporary and fortuitous in their incidence, and afforded no reasonable justification for interference with the basic wage adopted for purposes of classification. The Board regards with the utmost concern the unnecessary increase in the cost of the Public Service. A board that can make such a report is out of sympathy with the expressed view of this Parliament. The report goes on lo traverse the Arbitration Public Service Act, on page 84, 'and on page 86 it attacks the Public Service Arbitrator by inference. the powers this Parliament conferred upon that officer. that he appears to have accepted the fact that Parliament has not demurred, as evidence of the correctness of his determinations. In contradistinction to this it says that the wisdom of his awards has frequently been open to serious doubt, and has been challenged by the Public Service Commissioner. ""Where is the necessity and authority for indirect criticism of this judicial officer of tbe Crown? The board has the power to appeal against his awards, or to ask for had every opportunity to sta.te its case before the Arbitrator, and there is, therefore, no necessity for it to indulge in criticism which has not been invited by Parliament, and does not come within ' [218] the scope of its duties. Its business is to administer the Service, with due regard to efficiency, and to co-ordinate the work of the Service. Those duties have been neglected, to enable the board to present a report of this character. The. section of the report dealing with the arbitrator ends up with this suggestionAn amendment of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act has become necessary, to reduce to a reasonable and practical measure the application of the principles of arbitration to the Public Service. Who has asked for this opinion ? I have done the best I could in explaining the character of the report of the Public Service Board. I have had but a very short time toanalyse it in difficult circumstances during the present sitting. I shall insist on pressing my amendment to a vote, because I think that Parliament, should express its opinion iipou such injudicious and intemperate language as is contained in this report. I have raised three issues. I suggest that in future these reports should be tabled and they are made available to the press. Parliament should have a f u l lopportunity of considering them, and, if necessary, of rejecting them. Other official papers ane presented here, and motions are made that they be printed. If honourable members consider a document impudent or unjustified they should have an opportunity to reject it . They should have the opportunity to reject the report of the Public Service Board, or refer it back to the board. The report It attacks should have been before us when the Public ServiceB ill was under consideration. It admits, however, When the Public Service Arbitrator delivers an award, the award and the judgment are tabled simultaneously in this House, and we have the right to disallow an award. I cannot attribute the withholding of the report of the' Public Service Board, whilst the Public ServiceB ill was under consideration, to> any other motive than fear on the part of the board of criticism of its intemperate statements. It is not in the public in terest that a body of this kind should a variation of them. It has have the power to issue a report of this character without Parliament having an opportunity to review it . I think I have satisfied the committee that the language of the report is intemperate and in judicious. Even the Prime Minister must agree that it is undesirable that the Public Service Arbitrator or any other judicial officer of the Crown should be attacked in this manner. not to so would be to violate the conventions which govern all the Parliaments of the Empire. I do not see why a board appointed to administer the Public Service should be allowed to do so, and, in view of the hour and the circumstances, I leave the matter at that. I did not intend to speak until I heard the honourable member for Denison( Mr of timber as a result of the award to O'Keefe) ask some questions concerning timber. Many timber mills in Tasmania are closing down, and the honourable member wants to know why. As many of the mills are in my electorate I may claim to know a little about the timber business. The honourable member for Denison has said that there has been a great decrease in shipments of timber from Tasmania and a great increase in the. imports of Oregon. Those statements are correct. I ga/ther tjhat the honourable member desires that a higher duty should be imposed on imported timber. Those interested in the timber mills are trying to secure an additional duty of 50s. per 1,000 super, feet on Oregon. If we put an additional duty of 50s. per 1,000 super, feet on Oregon local mills will raise the price of their timber to the same extent and the only effect will be to increase the cost of building material. The crux of the difficulty is the cost of labour. Any man who has a knowledge of the timber business will know that if a builder has the choice of using hardwood or Oregon pine, and there is only a difference of 3s. or 4s. per 100 feet in their cost, he will use Oregon all the time, simply because of the saving in labour. know what has closed down the timber mills, and I propose to enlighten the honourable member for Denison on the point. They have been closed down because of the high cost of producing timber. About seven years ago Mr Justice Higgins, in the Arbitration Court, made an award of £6 per week per man for the whole of Australia. That might be a fair thing in Queensland, Western Australia, or in New South Wales, where the rainfall is tropical and occurs only at certain seasons. But in Soiithern Tasmania it rains for 180 days out of the' 365. No industry could be carried on in We are such circumstances on the condition that permitted in this Parliament, the men employed in it must be paid attack such officers. To do per week whether they work or not. All the men have to say in the morning is, "" It is too wet; we shall not go out today,"" and they can come up on the Friday night and draw their cheques for £6 each. It is not too wet for some of them to go out fishing, and they have to be paid for fishing. The timber mills have had to close down forno other 'reason than the high cost of the production which I have referred. Mr O'KEEFE -Ho w long ago was the award made? Mr O'KEEFE -It is only lately that a number of the mills have been closed down. biggest mills in Tasmania were closed down because of that award, and as a result 2,000 men were thrown out of work. It took three years to have the award altered; when the mills started again. Under what conditions did they have to start? The Arbitration Court says that the men must be paid from the time they leave their homes until they get to their work. They must be paid for 58 hours a week, and they work for only 40 hours. The consequence is that timber costs 16s., 18s., and 20s. per 100 feet, and in spite of these prices the biggest mill in Southern Tasmania lost £34,000 on one year's operations. That mill has shut down, and thrown 160 men out of work because it could not produce timber at the price. I . repeat that if an additional duty of 50s. per 1,000 super, feet is imposed on. Oregon the mills will make use of that to I increase the price of their timber to cover the wages they have to pay under the award, and the only result will be to penalize people in every part of Australia, because rents must go up if houses cost more to build. The young people in' this locality, in common with others of their own age, attend the weekly dances, and on one occasion a young lady lost her way in endeavouring to return home through the scrub. .

The awards of the Arbitration Court are largely responsible for the closing down of the timber mills, and the price at which the product has to be sold. Statistics show that Tasmanian hardwood is produced at the rate of 150 super, feet per man per day, whilst in America the production of pine, which is, of course, easier wood to handle, averages 830 feet per day. Huon Timber Company, which owns the biggest mills in Tasmania, could not keep it,s mills going while the award was in operation, because the men could not be kept working under cover in wet weather, but later, when on piece-work, the men worked in all weather, and the production of logs was so great 'that in less-than a fortnight the mill was over-supplied. It is quite impossible for these mills to continue in operation whilst wages have to be paid in accordance with Arbitration Court awards. Such courts are the curse of Australia, and are largely instrumental in destroying industry. The Navigation Act is also responsible .for driving shipping away from the Tasmanian coast. Tasmania conducted a lucrative timber trade with New Zealand before it was in operation. before the committee, I am sure that the honourable member .for Denison( Mr price. O'Keefe) and other honourable members -will know why the mills .have ceased to operate. desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr worked up with householders for it in certain Pratten) a matter which has a direct bearing upon the sugar agreement. Eor the information of the Minister, I quote the following letter from Oharlick Brothers, Adelaide, which is a reputable business firm. It reads:I have had considerable negotiations and correspondence with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company with regard, to raw sugar, and I am quite satisfied that they are deliberately blocking us in the matter of supplies. In the first place, they refused to quote us for raw sugar, and they personally explained to me that they could not sell raw, as it deprived them of the profit in refining. I passed this on to the Minister for Customs, and he replied that there was. nothing to prevent them selling raw sugar, and tlie Colonial Sugar Refining Company then quoted us raw at £30 l is . 4d., plus a guarantee of £2 per ton to have it sent back to Sydney if it was not up to sample which thoy had supplied us; but to pick out any of their stock at Glanville they wanted £3 per ton extra. This, of course, we could not agree to, except in a couple of tons to keep us going while our shipment was coming. I pointed out to them that to charge us this price when it only cost them £27 per ton f.o.b. Cairns was too high. Asi t now stands, we have bought 20 tons from them on sample, which they won't guarantee, at £30 l is . 4d., bags Sd. each, and interim supplies at £33 l is . 4d. I personally saw an even regular sample being turned out at the South Johnstone mill, The and they are at the present time turning out over 1,000 tons per week, all of which is being shipped to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and it should be a perfectly simple matter to quote us 20 tons f.o.b. Cairns or Mourilyan Harbour. We cannot give them an extra price for same taken out of their Glanville store, as it necessitates sending a man to the works to sample same. The sugar position in South Australia is very unsatisfactory from, a purchaser's standpoint like ourselves. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company are the only suppliers, and they have an aggressive stand-and-deliver attitude, which is very irritating.

Another man, who is receiving a war pension and an invalid pension, also visited me the same evening. This man was passed for active service when the medical test was much more severe than it was later, when men were accepted without any questions being asked concerning their age.

It is not right that a responsible body should make such serious reflections on the Public Service, and suggest that there are incompetency and unworthy practices. If the members of the board have to resort to such statements in order to justify themselves, this Parliament must make them recognize that it demands from them logical conclusions expressed in temperate language that is in keeping with the dignity and responsibility of their positions. Yesterday, the Prime Minister and I had a difference of opinion in regard to the effects of the reclassification of the Service. I contended that even after transfer or promotion some public servants would probably suffer a reduction of the salaries that they were enjoyingunder the award of the Arbitrator. that it was ridiculous to suppose that the board compel them to accept lower salaries. I am able to quote now the names of some employees who have had that experience. Four sorters in the Postmaster-General's Department-Miss D . Warrington, who has had twelve years' service; Miss E. Hawser, who has had eleven years' service; MissE . McAlister, who has had seven years' service; and Miss0 . Jenkins, who has had nine years' service-were receiving a salary of £169 per annum, which on promotion was reduced to £ 1 5 9 . Miss G. Fidoe, telephonist, who has had seven years' service, was receiving £ 1 8 3 per annum, and upon her promotion her salary was reduced to £ 1 5 9 . I deplore the injustices that have been done to the Commonwealth Service, and I am disappointed that the honourable member for Boothby-in whose electorate are many officers of the Commonwealth-di d not say a word yesterday in support of their claims. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), and the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr), who I understand have been advising the Government in regard to the Public ServiceB ill , acquiorable members have not had the report esced in the serious invasion of the rights of the Service. A t one time-befor e he entered this Parliament-the honourable member for Perth led a strike of the Western Australian civil servants; but his attitude upon the Public Service Bill The exwas incomprehensible to me. I cannot understand how the honourable member could subordinate to party loyalty the interests of a great Service that probably was largely responsible for his election to this House. The honourable member for Lang( Sir Elliot Johnson') had not the courage to vote in one division, because he recognized that the attitude of the Government was opposed to the interests of the Public Service, and did not meet with the approval of the people. Every amendment that I submitted yesterday was desired by the Public Service, but not one of them was accepted by the Government or supported by those honourable members opposite who in the past have claimed to be the champions of the Service. consideration be given to the public servants ?' The Prime Minister said ask this Parliament for justice; but honourable members on the ministerial would promote officers and side have deprived them of their dues under the awards of the arbitrator. They have worked hard through their association to improve their pay and status in the Service, but by a miscarriage of justice and a repudiation of the Government's obligations, they have been robbed of their rights, and although many Commonwealth employees reside in the electorate of the honourable member for Boothby, he did not make any protest in their behalf. I make the same criticism of the honourable members for Perth. Parkes and Lang, who have professed great interest in the welfare of the Service. No t even in the hour of crisis, when the employees of the Commonwealth were trying to uphold the standard secured through the services of the Public Service Arbitrator, could they obtain the assistance of those who ought to have recognized their duty to persons for whom they had expressed so much concern in the past. a.m.] -It is very regrettable' that honof the Public Service Boardi n their hands u n t i l quite recently.

I understand that the report has been available for some time, and, although other people have had it, honourable members have not seen it until to-day. said by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman). The board has been in existence for some time, and has carried out part of the work allotted to it . Honourable members on this side have stated that the reclassification of the Service has not given satisfaction to members of the Service, but the report suggests that it has given great satisfaction to certain sections of the Service. members will agree with me that it is very important that the Public Service should be justly treated, and that the board appointed to control it should have wide powers. The restrictions imposed upon members of the Service should be just, and their monetary reward should be adequate. I have had only about ten minutes in which to look at the report^ but even in scanning it during that time. I have discovered certain paragraphs that should be brought under the notice of the committee. It says that officers of .the mail branch of the Postal Department are enthusiastic about the protection that the new system of classification offers to them in .the future. The report does not .say whether it means the near future or the distant future. This is the first time honourable, members have hea-iid of any 'satisfaction in the Service with the reclassification. Iin another part of the (report the board complains most bitterly about the action of certain organizations, and in particular those organizations that, in the words of the report, have ""inundated"" members of Parliament with telegrams and other messages expressing the greatest possible dissatisfaction with the reclassification. Personally, I have received no telegrams. This is what the report saysNot content with circularizing members of further, ,and say that .a board of Caesars Parliament, the Clerical Association adopted .set .up ovier .the Commonwealth Public an attitude which w,as certainly not dignified,' Service, perhaps by mistake, which .oband bordering closely on the hysterical, in issuing instructions to officers of departments jects to members of the association exerto dispatch telegrams to the .members of both cising their rights, is not fit to oocupy Houses.

Every public servant was free to protest by telegraph-a t his own expense. The board looks upon it as a great I endorse what has been calamity that every member of the Service is free to protest to a member of Parliament by means of a telegram. It is a public "" calamity"" that the freedom of which we boast should be extended to the Public Service! It may be a calamity in the minds of members of the board, but to other people it is not. The majority of the people of Australia have decided that the freedom enjoyed by them shall be enA l l honourable joyed also by members of the Public Service. There was a time when it was not so. I was once a member of the Public Service, and in those days if two or three public servants met together to discuss something relating to their material welfare in the Service, or to the work they were doing, means were employed to discover their identity, and they were placed on a ""black list."" Those days have changed for the good, not only of the officers, but also of the Service. Let me read a little more ,of the reportThe association had issued its ultimatum, and .tlie .members must obey. The .form of telegram as dictated by the association was followed in most cases, but officers stationed throughout .the Commonwealth varied the formality as they 'considered fit. Mr O'KEEFE -Does the board object -to a member of the association telegraphing to a member ""of Parliament ? dently does object to that. It has been placed in the position of a Caesar towards the Public Service, and has exercised its authority with greater tyranny than ever any Caesar displayed. I am indeed pleased to know that .the Government has not allowed it to exercise its authority to the full, but has come to the rescue of .the public servants by aiot allowing any interference with the Public Service .Arbitrator.. The Government ought to .go that position in a free country. Let me bombardment. The ^general -purport of these messages was as follows :these "" Whole Public -Service strongly opposes board's reclassification.""",95,Earle Page Ho W Old Was He Ber S Experience Justifies Him I N Thinking

Public Service strongly resent injustice Board's action reducing salaries consequent upon reclassification."" ""Board lowering standard of wages. Whole Commonwealth Service protests. Ask you oppose."" That gives a very different impression from the statement about tense satisfaction and wonderful enthusiasm shown by the postal sorters. I notice that exception was taken by members, of the board to the toneof the telegrams sent to honourable members, indicating the disinclination of members of the Service to accept anything, less than the Arbitrator's awards. It is presumption, of course, in the eyes of the board, that telegrams should be sent to members of Parliament asking for protection, but to whom else can the public servants appeal, when the board evidently will not give them a fair deal ?' I read somewhere in the board's report' that members of the Service had become. "" hysterical "" towards the classification, and "" in d i g n a n t "" over it. We are all human, and I wonder what the attitude of the members of the board would be if they wereplaced in the' same position as some of the women 1 whose salaries' have been reduced from £200to' £16& a year after giving the best years of their life to the service of their country. Would not the members of this sympathetic, board be hysterical if they were asked to live-on £150 a year? Would they be so dignified then as they now profess to be ?

MrF . M c DONALD board,, and it has. the impertinenceto attack the employees' organizations'. report shows that it attacks the awards made by the Arbitrator,, and questions the index figures used by him in arriving at his determinations. When a young man in the Service wrote' to the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) asking for the interpretation of a. certain legal document, and when the board was asked to supply the information.., it replied that the officer had committed a breach of the regulation which provided the in that no member of the Service should use influence to obtain promotion,, transfer, or undue advantage. The board brought the matter under the notice of the head of the department, with the result that this humble officer was branded as: having contravened an important regulation. The board displayed its ignorance m being unable to interpret its own. regulation. It also complained that the organizations of the employee'SS had contravened that regulation. But that is a misstatement. I challenge any Minister to say that the officer in any way contravened it . It may seem a small matter because it affects only a humble servant, but it is more necessary to protect the humble than the highly-placed officer, because when attacked in this way there is noauthority other than Parliament to which the assailed can appeal. This arrogant board even challenges the parliamentary practice under which, every honourable .member is entitled to ask questions which lead to information being supplied showing .how the country is being governed. The board remarks in its report that parliamentary returns are responsible for much overtime being worked in Commonwealth departments, and it was questionable whether in many cases the returns, compiled at the cost of considerable labour and night work, were really of very much value. I venture to suggest that it is questionable whether the practice of placing the Public Service under the control of an ignorant and incompetent boards is of much I understand value. In another . part of its report the board utters a dirge about 1 theincreasing cost of the Service. The board, deplores the increasing cost of the Public Service. Evidently it objects to the public servants receiving the wages "" brasshat "" fixed by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator basest his awards on the cost of livin g in It is a military Australia.

424,Mr Cunningham,"Alargely due to the poor management of the hoard, which has not adopted proper business methods and has failed to establish co-ordination between the departments. The board evidently looks forward to the day when it will have sovereign rights over the Public Service. In placing the Public Service Board in control of the Public Service, and giving it such power, a great mistake was made if that board is to be allowed to attack the principle of arbitration, as it has been attacked in this report. I feel sure that the Government is not in agreement with the action of the board in connection with its classification, and I hope that it will express its dissatisfaction with the board's attack on the principles adopted by the Arbitrator ih his award, and also with the treatment meted out to the public servant to whom I have referred. The board's report contains the following paragraph:Before concluding its remarks on this subject, the board desires to emphasize its view that although during 1923-4 the Service has benefited by increased remuneration under arbitration determinations, to the extent of £255,000 per annum, the recent basic wage judgment will commit the country to a still further increased expenditure of over £200,000 per annum on salaries of public servants already well remunerated. The cost of living has increased since the Arbitrator's awards were made, yet the board speaks of the public servants as being "" already well remunerated."" If the cost of living 'has increased, the salaries of public servants should have increased also. The members of the Service ask for no more than that. Another statement in the board's report reads"" The decision of the Arbitrator is founded on a slavish adherence to the Statistician's figures, which were temporary."" What are the qualifications of the members of the board that they should ignore the Statistician's figures? Where have they gained their experience and their wisdom ? Of course, the figures were temporary. The index number has gone up, and, naturally, the public servants expected that their salaries would show a corresponding increase. The board states: The Statistician's and fortuitous in their incidence, and afforded no reasonable justification for interference with the basic wage adopted for purposes of classification. concern the unnecessary increase in the cost of the Public Service. There is much in this report which does not coincide with that spirit of justice which should be present in the relations of the board with the members of the Public Service. It would appear that the board desires to get back to the conditions which existed when men were ruled with the iron rod of the despot. I hope that the Government will intimate to the members of the Public Service that it does not agree with the opinions of the board as expressed in this report. .Unless that is done, the discontent which at present permeates the whole Service will grow, with the result that there Avill be a lessening of efficiency. a.m.] -In a report from a body such a3 the Public Service Board we look for something different from that which is contained in the. report before us. The language of the board is more suggestive of the junkers of Germany than of men who have been appointed to administer the Public Service of this country. I anticipate that there will be a vigorous and unanimous reply by the members of the Public Service to the strictures of the board. The board has seen fit to attack the Public Service Arbitrator, who was appointed under an act of this Parliament. As a man of some spirit, I do not think that gentleman will remain quiet under the lash of this trio of despots. I do not expect that the public servants generally will take the criticism of the board lying down. The board was appointed to throw oil on the troubled waters of the Service, and smooth out its differences. It was to reclassify it, and start it on a fresh career of usefulness to Australia. Instead of doing that, it has in its report thrown down a challenge to the public servants. I am expecting that in every capital city meetings will be called, at which public servants will give their reply to the board. The members of the board are paid high salaries. The chairman receives £2,500 a year, and each of the other members £2,000 a year. The most comfortable conditions are assured to them when travelling, and figures were temporary they are, in fact, the curled darlings of the Service.

To would be interesting to know what the Government proposes to do in view of an event which transpired within the last hour or two. An important bill has been rejected in another place, and it might be as well to refer to what the constitution provides las the mealns to overcome such a difficulty. Section 57 readsIf the House of Representatives passes any proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, and if after an interval of three months effect of enabling certain persons to escape the House of Representatives, in the same or the next session, again passes the .proposed law with or without any amendments which have been made, suggested, or agreed to by the Senate, and the Senate rejects or fails tr pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree, the Governor General may dissolve the Senate and the House of Representatives simultaneously. But such dissolution shall not take place within six months before the date of the expiry of the House of Representatives by effluxion of time. I am one of those who have subscribed to the plank in the platform of the party abolition of another place. useless excrescence on the Constitution. whether the Government w i ll meekly submit to the action of that chamber, which should be very careful about the way in which it handles financial measures. I take it that the Prime Minister will make some announcement on this subject. backbone at all, it w ill not hesitate, as soon as the period of three months its about to expire, to call Parliament together, and submit the measure again to another place, and see whether it will again unceremoniously reject legislation intended to secure the collection of taxation from a number of very wealthy people in the Commonwealth. There are two other matters to which I would refer at some length if Ministers concerned in them were present. I cannot blame them for not being present in this chamber at 5 o'clock in the morning. I hope the Treasurer will convey to the Postmaster-General my earnest plea on behalf of men who have been thrown out of employment because of the very limited demand for insulators by his department. I trust also that the Minister for Trade and Customs will listen to the pleading refer to another matter, it of members on this side that he should do something to improve the present position of the textile industry in the Commonwealth. a.m.] I so seldom agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr. Fenton), that when I do agree with him, I should not like the opportunity to pass without recording the fact. In common with the honourable member, I enter my emphatic protest against the action taken in another place, which will have the taxation which they ought to pay. I trust the Prime Minister will take the earliest opportunity of bringing the measure forward again, and seeing that the persons who should pay this taxation are compelled to do so.

The reports received from the different states disclose that the quality and quantity of the wool clip is exceptional. The wheat harvest prospects are also very attractive.

Does not the Leader of the Country party tell the farmers that unless they organize, and are able to bring combined pressure to bear upon the Parliament, they will get nothing? I tell my constituents to form themselves into, organizations, so that they may speak with one voice. Yet the antediluvian members of the Public Service Board, whose principal characteristics are ignorance, arrogance, and egotism, say that it is not right that, representatives of the Public Service should approach Parliament. These gentlemen constitute themselves the censors of Parliament. found with members of this House,' we have at least stood the test of public criticism, and have been elected by the votes of the people. Parliament is coming to a pretty pass if we are to be told by' troglodites of the type of White, Skewes and McGlinn that the questions we ask, in order to elicit information, are valueless. This is one paragraph in the board's reportParliamentary returns are responsible for much of the overtime worked in Commonwealth departments, and it is questionable whether, in many cases, these returns, compiled at the cost of considerable labour and continuous night work, are really of very much value. It is probably not realized how Tii'ich work is necessitated in the preparation of these returns. That statement comes from a general whose principle in war is, "" Achieve your objective, no matter what the cost."" These men presume to dictate what questions we shall ask in Parliament. They have not the faintest knowledge of what parliamentary government and parliamentary responsibility represent. of a progress association in my electorate, or of any other public body, have a right to ask me to ascertain, say, the salaries of the members of the Public Service Board. That would be a proper question for widespeak of awake taxpayers to ask. Yet these gentlemen would say that, on the score of cost, the .information should not be supplied. S u r e l y the GoI happen to know the salaries paid to those gentlemen. We protested against the amounts to be paid when Some of the members of the board were appointed. For the salaries we pay we are getting a very poor return if this report is a. specimen of their work. It would not be well for me to tell my electors that I could not get the information they desire, because the Public Service Board said it was doubtful, on the score of cost, whether it was necessary to supply it . This report is one of the most scandalous and ridiculous documents. I have seen for many years. WereI the Prime Minister of this country these men would be out of their jobs to-morrow morning, and I have no doubt whatever, that the people of Australia would endorse my action. If one of the members of the board was to contest an election against the least experienced member of this Parliament, I guarantee that he would lose his deposit if this report was shown to the electors. It may be necessary for officers to do Whatever faults may be night work to prepare information for Parliament, because strangers cannot be called in to do such work. That, however, can be easily overcome by paying the men for the work they do. The members of the board do not like members of Parliament to ask questions, for they ara afraid that we may learn too much. We may find out, .for instance, that £3,000,000 of taxation is owing, and that certain people have not furnished taxation returns for several years. Another part of the report statesThe difficulty is that the 'payment for travelling time has become a vested interest under arbitration awards, and the Public Service is particularly tenacious of vested interests. Much of the present expenditure on travelling time is unwarranted, and involves a free gift to the officers concerned. I guarantee that Sir Brudenell White is allowed expenses when he travels in the service of this country. A question ca that subject might well be placed on the notice-paper for the information of honourable members.

I think that the Arbitrator took note of that comment, for his decisions have been more consistent .since that time than they were previously. My remarks on that occasion were curtailed by Mr Speaker, who said, that the Arbitrator was in a judicial position. Mr is enormously higher than that obtainea Speaker said that I was going too far, and he did not permit me to continue. Are members of the Public Service Board to enjoy a privilege which cannot be exercised by a member of this House1 Are they to be. permitted to say what I cannot say' in this chamber? It is preposterous to suggest it, and yet these men arrogate that right to themselves. Their report, according to to-day's press, state? that since 1913 the pay of the Commonwealth employees has increased by 69 per cent., while the cost of living has only increased by 50 per cent. This means that since 1913 the average increase in the wages of public servants, apart from the increase granted in consequence of the higher cost of living, has been 7s. 3d. a week, and this the board attributes to the dreadful system of arbitration. If the cost of the Service has .inwhen duties to be done in Melbourne creased considerably in the last four years it is nob the members of the Service, or the organizations of the employees, who are responsible for that; the blame rests entirely with the Government. could read the report without realizing that the members of the board are obsessed by their feeling about arbitration. They are more bitter and vindictive about it than are private employers -the great ma1 jority of whom accept the system, and much' prefer it to strikes. ignores the fact that the large increase in the cost of the Service has arisen from the increase in the number of employees. The report states that the expenditure on overtime and other extraneous payments during 1922-23 amounted to £136,000. I point out that, spread over 25,000 men, that amount works out at about 2s. a week for each employee. is a paragraph in tbe Sun this morning about the amount by th© different classes of employees. It get in overtime and what the postal sorters receive. If the board had been anxious to give a fair dea-L to all it would have pointed: out what was paid for overMr Anstey. time in each division. The impression that the board evidently desires to convey is that the overtime pay is drawn b) those in the lower paid sections of the Service, andthey obscure the fact that, although the higher class officers are relatively few in number, the amount they draw in overtime and travelling expenses in the lower divisions. Objection is taken to travelling allowances; but I wish it to be remembered that some of the higher officers are careful to see that they do a lot of travelling, in order to augment their incomes. Therefore they often travel from state to state without any good reason. The purpose of the board i9 evidently to cloak the amount absorbed in travelling allowances by the men in the higher divisions-. The board virtually tells us that the taxpayer is being defrauded because an officer on a salary of £350 a year receives £1 17s. by way of recompense for the hardships involved in travelling from Melbourne to Sydney, and returning in his private time. There was a time-befor e federation was established-whe n officers in Sydney attended to the work to be done there, and -were not carried out by men from Sydney. This is entirely a matter of administration; but under the present Government travelling expenses are unnecesNobody sarily piled up through officers travelling between the various capitals, crossing one another's tracks, in order to look at one another's work. Parliament votes the members of the board from £2,000 to £2,500 a year each, and they increase their remuneration as much as possible The board by making special trips between the capitals so that they may draw extra travelling expenses-no t at the rate of 12s. a day, but at £2 2s. a day. On the subject of the basic wage the board says that a serious difference had arisen between it and the Arbitrator, and that the board fixed the minimum wage. What right had the board to There fix a minimum wage? It is in the position of an employer on behalf of the drawn nation.. Its business is to employ labour, and to: see that it is utilized to the best tells us what 'the telephonists advantage, to act justly, and protect the national interests. It has no rights beyond those of the ordinary employer of labour. The merchant, the pastoralist, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, or any individual employer, or body of employers, does not claim the right to f i x wages. use of the Arbitration Courti f each employer had the right to decide the wages of hi3 employees'( The Board fixed the minimum wage at £190 per annum, but it was increased by the Arbitrator to £ 2 0 4 per annum. Even that amount was below the Arbitration Court's decision. Although Judge Powers fixed the basic ""wage, men in the Government employ have never received it . They have always been £ 6 a year below the rate outside. The board's report contains the following:Before concluding its remarks on this subject, the boaTd desires to emphasize its view -that, although during 1923-4 the Service has benefited by. increased remuneration under arbitration determinations to the extent of £255,000 per annum, tlie recent basic wage judgment will commit the country to a still further increased expenditure of over £200,000 per annum on salaries of public servants already well remunerated. There is no mention of the amount received by the highly-paid officers. If we turn up the Estimates, we shall see that many men in the higher grades have received increases of £500 per annum. Some have received as much as £1,000 above their salaries two or three years ago. When the board talks of an increase of £300,000 or £400,000 in the cost of the Publio Service, it ignores the fact that a relatively small number of officers receive the greater proportion of that amount. The board says, "" The decision of the Arbitrator is founded on a slavish adherence to the Statistician's figures."" If he is not to be guided by the Statistician's figures, what is to be his guide? Those figures are supposed to be correct. They are the basis on which judgments and decisions are made. . No other ground can be taken if decisions are to be consistent from year to year. What right have these men, who are really employers, to present a report of that nature? not the function of the board to make awards. That is the function of arbitrators and judges. L e t us, for a moment, put to one side judges and unions, and see what is in the papers this morning. Here is an example. It is headed, "" New York Job."" The paragraph continuesApplications, closing 16th October, are inEvery industry and occupation should vited, in the Commonwealth Gazette to-day, for carry with it a remuneration sufficient for the position of clerk to the official secretary at the Commonwealth's New York office. I should like to know who is the official secretary, and who will occupy the posiW h a t would be the tion of clerk. The paragraph states, f u r ther, that the officer selected w ill receive an allowance to bring his remuneration up to £650 a year as from the date of his taking up duty in New York. If he is married, he w ill get an additional £100, as well as £ 5 0 for each child under sixteen years of age. The very thing of which it complains when applied to the public servants, the board has applied in a more extensive form in this case. In the Age appears the following paragraph:The Board states that the official secretary to the HighCommissioner's office, after reviewing the evidence submitted by officers, hadconcluded that married officers with children on a salary of £500 plus bonus were unable to live on their income, and have had to borrow money or draw on their private resources. In London an officer with £500 a year, plus bonus, is .unable to live on his income, but apparently a salary of £250 for a workman in Australia who has a wife and f a m i l y is outrageous and preposterous-a public robbery. Yet the members of the board are supposed to hold the respect of honourable members i u this Parliament and members of the Public Service of the country. They have been appointed, not because of their knowledge of their duties, but in order to constitute a superior class, which w ill be recognized by its snobbery and class distinction. The men under them are a class inferior, and should be dealt with as such ! It is stated that these men in London have had to borrow money, or draw on their private resources. Our dear friend, Mr. Casey, may be placed in that same unfortunate position. The same sad fate may befall h i m . The dear one who has gone to America may also be similarly situated. Years ago thousands of women in this city worked in milliners' shops and It is other establishments in competition w i th the daughters of well-to-do men, who were anxious that they should learn some occupation. The result was that those working-class women, who could not borrow and who had no private resources to draw upon, were forced to accept 2s. 6d. a week, and augment their incomes from other sources, which need not be mentioned. men and women to live decently. As these men cannot live on £500 a year, plus bonuses, the commissioners w ill improve their conditions. Married men are to receive a further £156 per annum, w it h £26 for each child; while unmarried men w ill receive an additional £78 per annum. Why is this distinction .made between married and unmarried men? Evidently those who fixed the terms do not understand Australian conditions. A man's remuneration should not be determined by his social position, but by the value of the position he occupies and the service he renders to his country. This report w ill do more to condemn these gentlemen and -injure the Government than anything I could say at this moment. shows bias, and is based upon class hatred and a callous misunderstanding of the position. The men who have prepared it have no knowledge of the industrial conditions, the outlook, or the social aspirations of the masses of Australia. look upon these matters with old-world eyes and old-world prejudices. In this report I can see the influence of Mr Skewes. It must be remembered that Mr Skewes went to the court to defend the Public Service Board and its reclassification. I venture to say that every time he appeared in the court to argue the case on behalf of the commissioners against proper remuneration for others, he drew fees from the public Treasury, and that wherever he travelled he did for himself that which he condemns in others. clay, while the clerk who assisted h i m received 12s. a day. his side of the case to the judge. The men did the same. They spoke through the secretaries of their organizations. They were, so to speak, the defendants in the case. In every case where the judge has given a decision he has, because of the preliminary criticism, followed the practice of the court in setting out in every case the reasons on which he founded his 'judgment. Isi t not reasonable to believe that he gave his verdict for or against the men, or for or against the Public Service Board on the evidence brought before him ? If he gave a decision against Mr Skewes and the board, were they not in honour bound to accept that decision, just as the members of the Publio Service organizations were bound to accept decisions given against them ? What would be said of the men if , the judge having given his decision, they personally assailed the judgment or the judge in their journals, or through the agency of members of this chamber? They would very properly be the subjects of denunciation. But Mr Skewes has been defeated in the court, and under cover of this report he has made an attack upon the judge. He has used the report as an instrument with which to satisfy his vendetta against the judge and to relieve his disappointment because he has not been successful. That is what underlies this report, and the The report whole thing from beginning to end is odious and discreditable. The members of the board complain of the overtime and travelling expenses for which the Public Service is responsible. I venture to say that these gentleThey men are themselves' claiming large amounts for overtime and heavy travelling expenses. I have said enough to show that no man can peruse the report without admitting that it is a biased report. It will do the Government no good in the country, and on that score honourable members on this side need not complain of it . The Government did nob see fit to present the report unti l it was too late to properly analyze and discuss it .

Like the Acting Leader of the Opposition I have not had an opportunity to read the report, and it has not yet been considered by the Government. I put it to the committee that it is very unfortunate that honourable members' opposite should, during the last few days, have been fighting a battle on behalf of the public servants of the country. They have put the situation entirely from the point of view of the public servant. In not one speech made on the Public Service Bill was there any reference to the interests of the taxpayers of the country, with the exception of one particular class. It is a great pity that this Parliament should approach, iu such a way, questions of so much importance to the whole of the people. bers of this Parliament who do not recognize the service which the public servantsare rendering to the Commonwealth. No honourable members who come in contact with individual members of the Public Service will have failed to appreciate the fact that, in the Public Service of Australia, we have men of infinite capacity and amazing loyalty. I say, with the greatest pleasure, that since I have been a member of the Government I have had an opportunity of associating with members of the Public Service. Prior to my becoming a member I had opportunities of ""being associated .with men Iiolding positions in outside organithe report of the board cannot be zations and in great public companies. These men in the ordinary conversation of the day are referred to as "" business men."" They are always held up to us as the embodiment of ""wisdom, and we are invited to believe that if Parliament and the Public Service were composed of such men there would be no problems left to be solved in this country. I have seen both classes working, and i l bear my testimony unhesitatingly that the responsible civil servant in this country is a man of infinitely greater capacity than men holding positions outside in the busiconnexion with the appointment of a ness world, and the problems the Public Service have to face and work out are incomparably more difficult than those which have to be faced outside. The officers with whom I have been associated are men of capacity and ability, and do their work with greater efficiency than many men in private business. But, although we appreciate the loyal service rendered by our public servants, a question such as this should not be considered from only one viewpoint. Some honourable members have approached perilously near such a consideration of it during the last few days. The report, which shows the manner in which the board is carrying out its work, will have to be studied by every honourable member. gentleman expected to protect members of this Parliament from the insults of the board ? Parliamentare quite capable of protecting themselves from the insults of any one. This is the first occasion on which the There are no honourable memboard has had an opportunity to express its views and to give the country an indication of -the work it is carrying out. Premature discussion', such as we have had today, is not likely to be of advantage to public servants, or to result in efficient control of a great organization, carrying on an important work in the interests of the Commonwealth. Mr CnNOTNGHAM (Gwydir) [7.2 a.m.] I am somewhat astonished at the statement of the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), that what he terms ""premature discussion"" is not likely to be of advantage to the public servants. If discussed at this juncture, when Parliament is about to close its doors for four or five months, when can it be discussed? It is our duty, as representa-tives of .the people, to make our position clear and to let the public servants know that we strongly resent the insults hurled .at them by the board. The right honourable gentleman states that the ability of many public servants is superior to that of many men in private employment. It is rather an astounding statement when we recall what has occurred in clerk for the London office of the Department of External Affairs.

The Prime Minister very carefully evaded the criticism levelled at his Government, and he misrepresented what most honourable members on this side had said.

I have every confidence in the Service, and I regret that they have not received the recognition they deserve. It is well for honourable members to know the source of the bias shown in the board's report. Mr Commissioner Skewes has always had a strong antipathy against the Service. When he made a reflection on the Public Service Arbitrator, why did not the Prime Minister take an opportunity in the House to protect that officer against the unwarranted criticism levelled against him ? H the Prime Minister is not prepared to defend the Arbitrator he should take steps I call to mind what to dismiss him from bis office, because Mr. AtleeH u n t is unable to defend himself against such an attack. I protest strongly against the insults that have been flung at the Public Service. Members of the board should realize how great is the responsibility that has been entrusted to them, and Parliament'demands that their I have no doubt that conduct shall be such as to promote confidence and goodwill throughout the Service. A t . least we should have fair play from that tribunal. What is there to justify the board in grossly libelling the Servicei n the eyes of the people?

I desire to refer to the payment of £5,000 to a number of men in Sydney. In this connection I shall read a letter which I have receivedFrom the year 1917 tlie Shipping Labour Bureau, Young-street, Sydney {which is comprised of fourteen (14) shipping firms and one stevedoring firm), have been employing permanent men at a weekly rate. At the time that they were thrown out of work on the waterfront they were receiving the weekly wage of £4 lis., although the Federal award rate was 2s. lOd. per hour, or £6 4s. 8d. per week, and this bureau employed on an average of 300 permanent hands a week, so you see that whilst these shipping companies were running this bureau and employing these men, they were not only beating the Federal Arbitration Court award: they were also beating the Waterside Workers Federation and unionism They were reaping tor themselves about £30,000 a year. 1 am just pointing out to you this-wh y should the ratepayers compensate these men through a Nationalist Government whilst the shipping combine, through the Shipping Labour Bureau, have in the past been receiving this amount yearly from these men, who have been willing enough to give the bosses £1 13s. 8d. a week out of their wages, and men are still doing this through this bureau at the present time. The history of this case is well known. In 1917 the railway men in New South Wales went on strike. A number of men in the Waterside Workers Federation decided that they would not carry coal for the railways while the trouble was on. The railway men went back to work, and the waterside workers were left. As a result, they were placed outside the award of the Arbitration Court and robbed of their preferences. I know the name that was given to the men who came forward to relieve the situationA t that time there was a strong feeling because of the war sentiment which existed. patriots, and the other as enemies of the country. The men of the Waterside Workers Federation paid the penalty for their support of the railway men and the cause that they believed to be right. Bowden, E. K.

For seven years the employCameron, M. ing class in New South Wales, and pracFoster, R. W. tically throughout Australia, has derived Francis, F. thousands of pounds of benefit from their Gardner, S.

C. the assistance of the ship-owners and the country, advantage was taken of the fact that they were not within the scope of the arbitration laws, and were not protected by any union. Consequently, their wages were cut down to the extent of £ 1 13s. 8d. a week. By that means the ship-owners have been saved thousands of pounds which otherwise they would have paid out in wages. Now a judge of the court has stated that the men have been penalized sufficiently, and he has restored to them the preferences they previously enjoyed. If any one is entitled to reward the men who took their places, the employers who gained the advantage should do it . From approximately 300 men they have taken £ 1 13s. 8d. a week. That means about £ 4 5 0 a week, approximately £25,000 a year for seven years, or a total of nearly £200,000, that they have gained. The country is now called upon to compensate the men who replaced the waterside workers. Their reward from the Federal Government is to be £5,000, and, . in addition, £7,000 from the Government of New South Wales. I am not saying t h a t . the men were "" loyalists"" or "" scabs,"" nor am I raising the question whether they should be paid, but I protest against the payment being made by this Government. No question of patriotism, loyalty, "" scabs,"" or a living wage, is in my mind. I merely contend that whoever had the advantage of their-relatively cheap labour should pay any compensation which they may receive. It is unjust that the employers should be able to shift their responsibility upon any government, whether state or federal. These men have no moral claim on any government.

What evidence has Sir Samuel Hordern given of ability to ru n a financial institution ? It is common report in New South Wales that he has been a constant subscriber to the Nationalist funds, and upon one occasion subscribed as much as £20,000.

If the two members of the Board who hold the rank of. general displayed as much capacity in. the field of battle as they have in controlling the Public Service, we need not be surprised that the great war was unduly prolonged. Taxpayers have a right to submit grievances to their representatives in this Parliament. Every citizen is entitled to approach this Parliament by petition, and to interview its members when desired.

They are the servants of. the people, and should not have the audacityto say that public servants should' not interview members of this Parliament. honourable member supports dictate to every one. MrE . RILEY member for Eranklin has to obey the dictates of Sir Henry Jones. The board has not only attacked our parliamentary institution, but has the effrontery to say that members-of the. organization must not dispatch circulars or telegrams to honourable members. The members of this Parliament receive communications and circulars from the Licensed Victuallers Association, the Wool-growers Association, Shipping organizations, the Taxpayers Association, ""the Fruit-growers Association, Association.

Arbitration is the safety valve of discontent, and where employees aud employers are workin g under that system harmony prevails. arbitration courts would be dispensed with . MrE . RILEY I quite believe that. (South Sydney) Some years ago, when New .South Wales was in a state of industrial turmoil, a system of arbitration was introduced which resulted in the industries in that state being placed on a satisfactory basis for quite a number of years:. An indust r i a l court, consisting of a judge, a representative of the. unions, and a representative of the employers, was established which investigated disputes and conducted inquiries into the profits being made by the; employers. 1 was a member of the court for a few years, and I recall an occasion when the father of Sir Samuel Hordern said that his firm could not afford to pay its employees additional wages. Similar statements were made by the representatives of Mark Foy and, David Jones Limited, and when the case closed his Honour said that, in view of the sworn evidence adduced by the representatives of the employers; it was evident that they were not in the position to pay higherwages. I insisted upon thebooks of these firms being examined in order to ascertain the profits being made; and after an investigation which lasted three weeks it was ascertained that these men, who haddeliberately sworn that they could not afford, And the honourable to pay higher wagesj were making substantial profits.

The contents of the report submitted by the board are of such a character that it is the duty of every honourable member to give it the greatest publicity to enable the public servants of the Commonwealth to receive that treatment to which they are entitled. I should like to know if it is not possible for the Government to continue the work of ship construction at Cockatoo Island, particularly as 600 or 700 men have recently been thrown out of work. Hundreds of skilled engineers and mechanics, whose services have been dispensed with, will be scattered all over the Commonwealth, and it will be most difficult to bring them together again should their services be required. Even if it is not the intention of the Government to construct at least one cruiser in the Commonwealth it should continue building vessels of the type of the Ferndale and Fordsdale. Mr Larkin reports that the vessels of the Commonwealth Line are now paying, and if two additional steamers were constructed the Government would be relieved of the necessity of paying the Orient Steamship Company a subsidy of, approximately, £250,000 a year to carry mails'. This amount would be sufficient to pay interest on the capital involved in the construction of two new ships. Mails would also be carried more expeditiously, as the vessels of the Orient Company have for many years been running at a speed much below that of the "" Bay"" steamers. Even some of the mail boats on the coast do not maintain the' speed of the Fordsdale and Ferndale. This matter demands the immediate and earnest consideration of the Government. I have nothing whatever to say constages without amendment or debate:cerning the personal qualities of the members of the Commonwealth Bank Buildings) Bill"" 1921-22. Board, but such a body should consist of bankers. the Melbourne branch of the Commonwealth Bank, is a very able man, and, he and the manager of the Sydney branch should be on the board of directors, so that they could give to it the benefit of their knowledge and experience. If the bank is to develop as it should, the directors must be men who give their who * read a first and second time. time to banking business. Those who have been appointed by the Government Mr E. Riley. to the board will meet not more than once a fortnight, and for that each of them will draw £600 per annum in fees. That payment is not big enough to attract men with the necessary qualifications and experience. I hope that after the next general election the Labour party will have an opportunity of rectifying the mistake that this Government has made. The bank is not increasing its branches or trying to compete with the associated banks in ordinary banking business, but is concentrating its attention on the big business of financing the wheat harvest and wool clip. Therefore, it is not discharging all the functions for which it was created. Reverting to the report of the Public Service Board, some of it3 paragraphs contain the greatest insults ever offered to the people's representatives in this Parliament. The board is attempting to deny to a big body of public servants the right to look to Parliament for protection. If the jnembers of the board think that they will be allowed to dictate to Parliament they are making a mistake.

I represent a large country constituency that is, on the whole, sparsely populated. those who live in the outback districts is that they are required, in addition to paying the ordinary taxation of the Commonwealth, to subsidize mail services, which are even then in many cases inadequate. I had hoped that with the accession of the Leader oif the Country party (Dr. Earle Page) to the office of Treasurer, and with another Country party member as Postmaster-General, the policy in regard to these mail services would be altered. The Treasurer should have used some of his accumulated surplus to provide mail services for the pioneers in the back country instead of for the remission of taxation to benefit the wealthy section of the community. A few days ago I saw a letter in which the department notified the residents of a district that if they dein the country. When the general Estisired an extension of the mail service from two days to three days a week, they would have to pay a subsidy of £15. In order to keep i u touch with the outside world, the people in the back country need improved mail services. I do not blame the responsible officers of the Postal Department. A policy is laid down for them, and they must follow it , and if they have not the money, the Government is to blame. to .induce the Department to extend the mail service for 2 miles to serve an isolated settler's home. Country mailmen make a business of delivering mails, and they do it at surprisingly low rates. It often happens that a mail w ill run along a route, will call at^ some of the settlers' homes, but will not go 1£ miles off the road to call at other homesteads. A settler, when he wants his mail, has to collect it from the place where the mailman deposits it . If he is expecting an important letter, he has to leave his work, saddle a horse, and ride perhaps 2 miles there and back to ascertain whether it has arrived. If it has not arrived his [219] journey has been fruitless, and his time wasted. I suggest that the mailmen should deliver letters at the settlers' homes. I would even go so far, in order to institute this reform, as to say that it is not necessary that they I am sorry that he did not should collect letters, except when they have others to deliver. The present arrangements entail on the settlers travelling that amounts in some cases to hundreds of miles a year. I claim that our back-country mail services are ridiculously cheap, and instance the mail service beThe outstanding complaint of tween Yetman and Bonshaw, a distance of 64 miles, which entails the opening and closing of 56 gates and costs £ 2 2 0 . member does not suggest that the mailman should open still more gates to deliver his mails at the settlers' honies ? the reads because no fence flanks the roads. The cost of the mail is about £ 5 a week, and the mailman has to travel a distance of 128 'miles twice a week. No one can complain that that charge is excessive. I suggest that the Treasurer and the Postmaster-General, as the self-appointed guardians of the interests of the men in the country, should, instead of remitting taxation to wealthy people, give more efficient mail services to the people mates were being considered, the Postmaster-General was not present, and honourable members had no opportunity of placing these matters before him. When a homestead is near the end of a mail route, the interval between the times when the mailman calls on the outward and return journeys is very short, and in order to reply at once to an urgent letter the settler must, when he goes to In many cases it is impossible meet the mail, take with him pen, ink, paper, and, if it is wet, a tent fly, so that he may write the reply for the mailman to collect on the return journey. All these difficulties could be overcome by arrangement with the mailmen and paying them reasonably for the services we desire them to render.

The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Cunningham) will admit that a fair share of the money available for postal services has been spent in his electorate. In fact, there has been a very even distribution of the expenditure throughout Australia. The Government expended over £4,000,000 on these services last year, and a similar sum is . provided for the current year. It is impossible to have a mail service to every home in the country. The people of the Commonwealth are better' catered for in the matter of telephones and mails than those of any other country I have visited in my travels. Our telephone system is the cheapest in the world. No fewer than 50,000 telephones a month are being installed, and in order to cope with the increasing demand for them it may be necessary to continue the expenditure at the present rate. We may certainly look for a decided improvement in both telephonic and postal services throughout the Commonwealth. a.m.] I direct the attention of the Government, of position of Mr Mark Young, who until recently was chief inspector of the Commonwealth Bank. I do not avail myself of this opportunity for the purpose of entering into a general discussion of tlie management of the bank. That matter has been well debated, and we on this side of the chamber do not pretend that we are satisfied either with the bank or with its present management. That is hot now the issue here, but we think that it w ill be a very live issue elsewhere. The matter on which I have to speak has a personal element in it , but it is, nevertheless, of considerable importance. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) yesterday asked the Prime Minister the following questions, on notice: 1. Whether lie has been advised of serious complaints made by MrM . B . Young of the exercise of arbitrary powers, and of unjust treatment, by the Acting 'Governor of the Comjostled out of his position during the monwealth Bank towards Mr Young, and also of specific charges against the administration Denison Miller and the appointment of a of the bank? 2. Will he agree to the appointment of an in dependent commission to investigate Mr. As honourable Young's complaints and charges, and report thereon to the Government? 3. Will he lay the correspondence relating to such complaints and charges on the table of the Library? The Prime Minister replied in the f o l lowing terms: 1. Yes2 and 3. The management of the Commonwealth Bank has been solely, in tbe hands of the Governor of the bank, and, in future, will be under a Board of Directors. Nothing has occurred to justify any want of confidence in the management, and it is therefore considered that, in all matters of internal administration, aud in the investigation of any charges, the Board should be free to take such action as it deems fit, and without political interference. I accept the principle generally that there should be no political interference with the management of the bank, subject, of course, to certain reservations; but, without infringin g on that general principle, I think that we should be doing our duty to ourselves and to the country if we had a clear understanding of the circumstances under which this country and the bank are losing the services of a very valuable officer. Until recently, Mr Young was chief inspector of the bank, and prior to [11.35 that he was manager of the Melbourne branch. I do not think it is too much to say and particularly that that there was a general expectation and the Prime Minister, to the strong hope on the part of a large number of the customers of the bank throughout Australia-for Mr Young has an Australian reputation as a banker -that he would be given a very responsible position in connection with the administration of the reconstituted bank. I did not consider it right to refer to this matter while the delicate subject of the appointment of the board was under consideration, but now the board has been appointed, and we are able to discuss it . That the opportunity has not arisen u n t i l the last day of the session is very unfortunate. Mr Young asked for an inquiry, and also for the favour of an interview, with the Prime Ministeri n the presence of the present Acting Governor of the bank. The unpleasant feature of the case is-and there is something sinister in the fact-that a difference arose between the present Acting Governor and the late chief inspector, and Mr Young has been transition stage between the death of Sir",123,Supplementary Appropriation Works And Buildings Bill 1923 24
538,Mr Brennan (Batman),"new governor. Young was a trusted and honoured servant of the bank for a number of years,, in association w it h thelate Governor, and that closely following on the death of Sir Denison Miller he was deprived of his position justifies an inquiry. Mr Young was appointed to represent the bank at the Honolulu conference of bankers, and on his return he received the glowing eulogiuim of the late Governor of the bank, who, generally speaking, enjoyed the confidence of all political parties. This is much more than a personal matter; it gravely affects the public confidence in the bank itself. principle of non-interference in the management of the bank, I do not say that this Parliament has no right to in quire into the circumstances under which a valued officer was unexpectedly, and I think unjustly, retired. cluded from going into the history of the case in detail, and, therefore, 1 ask for an inquiry. This would not necessarily touch the prerogative of the present management of the bank, but it would relate to the rights of the late officer,Mr Young, with a sense of t h a t responsibility which attaches to his late position, and his very high reputation as a banker, endorsed as it is by almost every branch of the bank in the Commonwealth, makes very serious charges in regard to the administration of the bank. I hope that because the bank is managed by a directorate, this House w ill not be told that an in quiry cannot be granted.' That we are entitled there is not the slightest doubt. Prime Minister does not do himself jus>tice when he attempts to evade the question by saying that nothing has occurred to j u s t if y any want of confidence in the management of the bank, and that it is considered that in all matters of internal administration, and in the' investigation of any charges,, the board should be free to take such action as it deems f it , without political interference. of which the Governor is a member, is not a fit body to make this inquiry. The charge made by the late chief inspector, whose reeord does not contain the slightest blemish, is a matter for investigation and consideration by members, nf this Parliament. We should know the facts:, in justice to ourselves and the officer most concerned. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [11.47 a.m.] -The matter to which the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has referred is one with which it is extremely difficult to deal in this committee without prejudicing the position of the gentleman whose case has beeni placed before us. As stated by the honourable gentleman, I was asked a question yesterday by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), and gave the reply that has been quoted. Mr Young's services were dispensed with after Mr Kell became the acting AlthoughI have accepted the governor of the bank. Subsequently Mr Young addressed a communication to me, in which he set out certain facts. That communication was considered by me, but I was faced with the position that neither I nor the I am preTreasurer, nor, indeed, the Government, had any control over the internal administration of the bank's affairs, and that the only justification for interference by the Government would be that there was, prima facie, a state of affairs requiring investigation. The Commonwealth Bank has been placed by Parliament beyond the control of the Government. An in vestigation of the management of the bank would be justified if the circumstances showed that the Governor had acted in an improper way, but in regard to a question of internal administration, where there were no facts to indicate that the Governor had behaved in an .improper way, it would certainly be a very serious step for the Government to instito the fullest information tute an inquiry. When the facts in this The case came under my notice, I made certain inquiries respecting Mr Young, and obtained certain information. I do not desire to discuss that information now, ' because it would not be fair, and might prejudicesubsequent action. Indeed, I feel a considerable measure of embarrassment in dealing with this matter at a l l ; but as the honourable member for Batman has indicated that Mr Young The board, was held in the highest esteem, and was a distinguished member of the banking community, I am very reluctantly compelled to say that the inquiries which I made indicated that there were circumstances which, possibly, justified the action taken by the Governor. I certainly did not feel that the Government was entitled to take such",124,Supplementary Appropriation Works And Buildings Bill 1923 24

That suggestion arose, I believe, from the fact that I had declined to see tions, but I said that I could not, in any circumstances, see him to listen to his case, as that would be to receive an ex parte statement in regard to the administration of the bank. I said that the only possible circumstances in which I could see Mr Young would be in the presence of the Governor of the Bank, who would be able to put his side of the case also. I was perfectly willing to do that, a fact which some honourable gentlemen in this chamber know. in the presence of the Governor of the Bank for the reason that the legal opinion was obtained that I had no authority in the matter, and no right to demand that a conference should be held. MrE . RILEY I s the bank above Parliament ? A conference -might have been held, but, in fact, the head of the Government had no power to require a conference. I do not know whether the honourable member for Batman has considered this point, but it appeared to me, after reading the legal opinion, that I actually had no right to summon a conference of the parties. MrE . RILEY that opinion obtained ? that question should be asked. opinion was obtained, and if the honourable gentleman insists on knowing, I shall tell him at whose request, but 1 do not think that the question is relevant to the matter, and it certainly would be unwise to ask it . On reflection, I thought that there was a good deal to be said for the view that I neither had, nor should The Minister relied on have, power to bring about a conference. It would be difficult to dissociate the I admit that to some idea of political influence from the action of the head of the Government in requiring the Governor of the bank, in whose hands Parliament has placed the internal administration of the institution, to attend a conferThe ence. Such action might suggest that political pressure was being brought to bear upon the Governor of the Bank. a conference between Mr Therefore, I did not, as I indicated in the answer to the question of the honourable member for Fawkner, consider that the Government should institute an inquiry of the character that has been suggested. On the evidence which I have received from both sides, it did not appear to me that there was a prima facie case to cause want of confidence in the administration of the Bank, and to warrant interference with it . Consequently, the Government is not prepared to appoint any tribunal to consider this case. It appears to me that a solution of the difficulty is now possible without any such action being taken. To-day, the Commonwealth Bank Act has been proI understood that. claimed, and the affairs of the bank are now under the control of the board which I did not see Mr Young was recently appointed. If Mr Young desires to have his case reviewed, he should place it before the controlling authorities of the bank. It is open to him to appeal to the board to consider the circumstances in which he was dismissed. I am not Parliament. the Government sees it . I do not desire to enter into a detailed discussion of the merits of the case. The honourable member for Batman refrained from doing so to any extent. I have tried to put the position to the committee without stating the whole of the facts which were before me when I considered the request that Mr Young sent to the Government. . A t whose request was wish to say a few words on this question, and in the spirit which has characterized do not think the speech of the honourable member for The Batman and the reply of the Prime Minister.

I am open to correction on. the point -The Prime Minister was prepared togrant that conference. He asked MrK e l l to meet Mac. Young ata private informal conference with himself. The holding of the conference would not in any way have involved the legal position, but what happened? MrK e l l refused' to meet Mr Youngi n the presence of the PrimeM in ister. There was a legal opinion from Mr Kell's solicitor to the effect that bewith those around him, and that he in cause the bank was not under political control there could not be an informal private conference between the ActingGovernor of the bank and the ex-Chief Inspector of the institution, a man who had done service in every state of the Commonwealth. To-day there is lef t an aspersion on the character of a man who is spoken of in banking circles in the highest possible terms. AlthoughI appreciate the reluctance of the Prime Minister to say anything at this stage, I be that he should say what he has to say than to leave the matter as it stands. If an inquiry were proceeding, it would not be proper to say anything on the subject. In fairness to this man an inquiry must now be given. He is prepared to produce evidence of serious matters affecting the conduct and control of the Commonwealth Bank. There are two things he wants investigating, one affecting the management of the bank, and the other affecting his own position. There never was a more reasonable claim put before Parliament. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [12.10],I gather, from what the honor^ able member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has said, that, in tryin g to avoid anything which might prejudice the issue, I left quite a wrong impression, which I desire to correct at the earliest possible moment. The reason I have felt considerable embarrassment in connection with this case is that I believe there will be a further investigation of it , and I do not wish to interfere with the course of that investigation. left in my mind the belief that there was not a case to warrant interference with the internal administration of the bank. I desire to make it very clear to honourable I which character and integrity.

It seemed to be suggested that he is a difficult man, that he could not work evitably caused friction, among the people with whom he was working. gentleman will pardon me. for saying, that Mr Young asked that he should be given the name of one man in the bank with whom he could not work and he has never been given a name. speak because I thought from the remarks of the honourable member for Yarra that in endeavouring not to .prejudice Mr. Young's case by saying too much, by saying too. little I have probably done the very thing I was desirous -of avoiding;. I therefore wish to make it clear that I have received no information which in any way reflects on Mr Young's integrity and character. The information that I did receive merely suggested to my mind that he is not a person whose continuance in the position he held would tend to promote the efficient and good working of the bank. I find it somewhat difficult, for several reasons,' to discuss the matter now before the Chair. One is that Mr Young, whose case is under discussion, is a personal friend of mine, and a man for whom I have, and always have had, the profoundest respect and admiration. As the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has said, he is held in the highest esteem in banking circles as a most efficient officer. The Prime Minister, when speaking, seemed to convey the impression that Mr Young had been dismissed.

But he was forced, by the treatment he received from the successor of the late Sir Denison Miller, to make most definite and specific charges against the management of the bank as to partiality and inefficiency. probable presumption of the truth of the charges which Mr Young has made, have been brought under my notice. Young has absolute and implicit f a i th in the merits of his case. been mentioned, he has asked the Prime Minister to meet him in the presence of the man of whose behaviour towards hi m ' he has complained. The Prime Minister courteously consented to such a meeting, and notified the Acting Governor of the bank of his decision, but the Acting Governor, having obtained legal opinion, stood on his strict legal rights, and refused to meet his accuser. It was practicable for him, seeing that it was not an official inquiry;-it was a request by the Prime Minister-to meet Mr Young. It was not as if a subordinate officer had made a complaint concerning the actions of an officer occupying a high position in the bank. the greatest possible propriety, could in vite MrK e l l to meet Mr Young, and disspecific charges are made in regard to its cuss this matter quietly and privately. One would have thought that Mr Kell would be pleased to attend, but the conclusion I have reached from his refusal is that he is aware of the case which Mr Young has to make against him, and knows that he cannot meet it . When asked to meet Mr Young he had to give some excuse for his action which necessitated Mr Young's retirement. It is well known that Mr Young did not voluntarily retire. and was willing to give the remaining years of his fife to the service of the'bank. Mr Young is a. man of eixceptional ability, as every one who knows him will admit. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) has referred to the trumpery charge made against Mr Young, .who has a specific one to make against Mr Kel l concerning partiality and inefficiency in the administration of the bank. We are informed that Mr Young was asked to submit his resignation because he did not get on w i th his colleagues. Mr there was not a suggestion Young challenged MrK e l l to name one could not officer who found it difficult to work on with his brother officers with him. I am advised that to this day nosuch name has been submitted. It is a matter of general knowledge that Mr. Young has the confidence of the general staff of the Commonwealth Bank. I was prevented fro m attending the House yesterday to hear the answers to the quesFacts, which raise a tions I submitted on Mr Young's behalf, but I am sorry to learn that the Prime Minister cannot grant an independent Mr inquiry. Having regard to the personnel of the board of directors, and the personal As has already relationships possibly existing between the Acting Governor and the members of the board, Mr Young would not feel he was receiving an independent and /impartial__ review of his case if it were submitted to that body. I do not know to what extent the case has been submitted to the Prime Minister, but the facts placed beforeme by Mr Young demand an inquiry in the interests, not only of Mr Young, but of the Commonwealth Bank, the efficient management of which is vitally involved. I trust the Prime Minister w ill reconsider the matter, and see whether an inquiry can be conducted, without making it appear that political influence has been introdiiced. I should be the last to bring poliI think the Prime Minister, with tical influence to bear upon the management of t/his great institution. B ut when efficient management, it is essential that independent investigation should be made, sa .y> by a commission, or some similar. independent tribunal, which should report to the Prime Minister. It would then be the duty of the right honourable gentleman to take what action he considered necessary. It might be found that it was not a matter in which he should act. On the other hand the report might be of such a character as to He had no intention of retiring, justify the Prime Ministeri n intervening. I trust that in the interests, not only of Mr Young, but also of the bank, the Prime Minister will grant the' inquiry. [12.22] I am not acquainted with Mr. Young.

In which is causing so much discontent. That the busy season between 4,000 and 5,000 people will be affected by that award, but at the present time only about 2,000 are employed. I shall hand to the Prime Minister the communication I have received, and ask him to endeavour to bring about more amicable relations between employers and employees in the industry, in order that serious troubles may not arise at a most important juncture in its history. The representatives of the union in the court are unable to understand the reason why the Deputy President made such a serious departure from the court's past practice. I hope the Prime Minister will look into the matter sympathetically. I commend the Government for its action in distributing to public institutions the Captain Cook souvenir, and thus endeavouring to cultivate a good Australian sentiment while at the same time honoring the memory of the gallant sailor who first explored the eastern coast of Australia. The suggestion has been made by Mr Tonkin of the Provincial Press that the Government might consider the advisability of extending this policy and signalize the opening of the Federal Capital by the issue of a souvenir which, while paying some attention to Captain Cook, will deal also with the birth . of the Australian nation and the foundation and development of the Federal Capital. If possible, that publication should be made available to every family in Australia. There may be difficulties in the way of adopting the suggestion, but I ask the Prime Minister to consider it seriously. The Prime Minister was rather unjust to honourable members on this side of the House when he said that we had addreosed ourselves to the Public Service Bill only from the point of view of the employees. The interests of the taxpayers, which we are supposed to have neglected, and those of the public servants coincide to this extent that there cannot be an efficient Public Servicei f the members of When the a likelihood of its being efficient. If the remarks of honourable members on this of the public servants, it was largely because the report of the board dealt at considerable length with the classification is indicated by the heading in this morning's Sun Pictorial, "" S c a t h in g ! H o t report on the Public Service; Mr AtleeH u n t attacked."" In justice to the public servants I should like to correct a misleading statement published in that journal. I do not know whether the extracts it'purports to quote from the board's report are verbatim; if they are, the complaint must be against those who drafted the report, but if they are not, I hope that the Sun will correct the injustice done to the Public Service. The portion of the report to which I refer is: Messages of venionstrance and complaint passed through the Melbourne Telegraph Office in hundreds and thousands. While taking f u l l advantage of arbitration, these associations had no compunction in bringing political pressure -to bear. An unfair inference may be drawn from that paragraph, namely, that the salaries were arrived at by means of arbitration, and afterwards the public servants complained. Honourable members are aware that that was not so. The Public Service Board fixed the salaries regardless of the arbitrator's index numbers, and the previous salaries. The inference seems unjust and even malicious, and I hope that if the extract has been taken verbatim from the board's report, the PrimeM in ister w ill take steps to ensure that the publio servants shall not be misrepresented in that way. night ago I introduced to the Treasurer and the Minister in charge of Repatriation, a deputation of blind soldiers, who asked that an increased pension might be granted to enable those men to employ attendants.

That body has reported that while Australia is the only country in the Empire which pays a special pension to blinded soldiers, attendants' allowances are paid in addition to special pensions in certain cases of "" very severely disabled men needing attendants."" The special pension of £ 4 per week, in addition to amounts paid to wives and children, which Australia grants to blinded soldiers, is well in excess vernment's resources were required for the of amounts paid in other dominions ; but the Repatriation Commission reports that, in view of all the circumstances connected with war pensions and allowances in Australia, and the attendants' allowances to certain very severely disabled men in other parts of the Empire, it would be reasonable to grant to actually blinded ex-soldiers in Australia a similar allowance. Accordingly, the commission recommended the payment of £ 1 per week in each case. In addition to the f u l l y blinded men, there are some who are granted the special blinded soldiers' pension, because they have "" no useful sight."" These cases can be carefully considered by the Repatriation Commission in order to ascertain whether the degree of vision is so small as to justify the granting of an attendant's allowance. The commission further reported that the allowance can be made available by regulation, so that there will be no necessity to pass an amending act. Cabinet has approved of the recommendation of the commission, and that body is now preparing the necessary regulations to enable effect to be given to it . In its report, the Public Service Board assumed an authority in connection with government departments never previously claimed by any tribunal or board. The board seems to resent the interest of members of Parliament in the public servants. I have had occasion to forward to the board communications sent to me from public servants, and I have received replies. appointment of the chairman of the board, Sir Brudenell White, because he is a military officer. It is a mistake to appoint a soldier to the control of civilians, and it is never done in Great Britain. I shall continue to forward correspondence to the board regardless of the likes and dislikes of its members, and if they do anything to offend me they will discover that I am not to be rebuffed. Some years before the war I unsuccessf u l ly endeavoured to have Lord Howe Island connected w i th the mainland by wireless or some other means of quick communication. In those days wireless was still in its infancy, and it was not then possible, with the resources at the command of the Government, to establish communication with the island. When the war broke out, and the Goprosecution of that enterprise, I had to suspend my agitation. The island is about 450 miles from Sydney Heads, and is in the track of the New Zealand, American, and Pacific Island steamers. The department placed certain proposal's before the board of control of the island, which consists of a member of the New South Wales Parliament and two civil servants; The board decided that it could not meet the expense of a meteorological station. I suggest that expenditure for such a purpose should be regarded as a national obligation. There has been more than one wreck, on the island, which is in close proximitv to some very dangerous rocks. It is of no use having a meteorological station there if the daily weather records cannot be forwarded to the mainland. The difficulty now is the cost. I doubt whether there are 100 inhabitants on the island. During the last two years they have been very unfortunate. A French steamer from New Caledonia went to pieces on the island, and rats from it overran the island, and ate the palm seeds, which are the principal means of livelihood of the inhabitants. This island is the only place where the seeds remain fertile after they have been detached from the plant. The seed is marketed in Europe. It is fourteen years since I first tried to obtain means of communication between the island and the mainland. The war first blocked the proposal, and since then the board of control, and the rats from the wreck, have prevented anything from I was opposed to the being done.",131,Supplementary Appropriation Works And Buildings Bill 1923 24

W it h a listening-in wireless set they could reoeive news every day from Sydney, The cost of that would be very small, but I shall have to inquire how much expenditure would be involved in providing them with a transmitting set as well. All honourable members appreciate the efforts that are being made by the Government to come to terms with the South Australian Government for the building of the north-south railway. necessarily be some time before that railway can be constructed, even so f a r as Alice Springs, I urge the Minister to make sufficient funds available to provide lowlevel vehicular crossings for the streams. A few hundred pounds would meet the cost, and would materially assist in the development of the country. The crossings would be of great assistance, particularly to those engaged in mining. mica mine there employs six men at present. In spite of the absence of crossings, they have provided a motor service. There is an acute shortage of mica, the Australian market for which could absorb the whole of the output of the mine. Twenty men could be employed there if the crossings that I suggest were available. It has been brought under my notice that a considerable number of oysters, grown under black labour conditions, are 'being imported into Australia from the East. The state governments established a number of returned soldiers in this occupation, and they have had to incur con.'siderable expense owing to the scientific methods of culture now employed in the industry. The imported oysters are being landed at about one-fourth of the cost of the local oysters. Seeing that oyster culture is largely a returned soldier's occupation, the circumstances call for careful consideration by the Minister. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [12.54] I -have received a written request from the honourable member for Maribyrnong ;( Mr Fenton) that I shall inquire into. Concerning the importation of oysters, I shall bring the statements of the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr. Pratten), and ask him to ascertain all the facts.

I understand that the Commonwealth made a proposal that the Asi t w ill states did not accept. Is there still a possibility of the bounty being paid, so as to bring the price of the grapes to these growers up to £ 5 per ton for grapes grown on irrigated land, or £ 4 per ton for grapes grown on non-irrigated land. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [12.57] -The facts are as stated by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb). A The Commonwealth Government made a proposal to the states, under which payments were to be made to bring the receipts of the growers up to £ 5 a ton, the expenditure to be borne equally by the Commonwealth and the states. The states did not agree to that. This Parliament has passed legislation to provide for a bounty on sweet wines, and the position at the moment is that the proposal has expired owing to the refusal of the states to picept the terms proposed by the Commonwealth.
