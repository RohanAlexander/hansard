Sir the troubles in adjusting the loading of boats arise from the fact able gentleman will agree that the miners, in regard to output, have made a wonderful recovery since the war? point is that, as the output of the mines increases, so do the requirements of Australia increase, but still we have a margin. the mines, in my judgment, is not in creasing as fast as is the demand up and down Australia. There is a margin for overseas trade, and one of the reasons for the shipping control the other day was to enable Commander Fearnley, who controls matters at Newcastle, to so arrange the loading of ships, so as to obviate the difficulties to which the honourable member calls attention.

What are the requirements-of this particular work which render it beyond the powers of the Clerical officers to perform who have accountancy qualifications? 3. Is the arrangement a temporary expedient to meet a present alleged shortage of qualified Clerical officers? 4. If so, will the Government take steps to see that future appointments will be confined to Clerical officers? 5. What was the reason for sueh a position in the State of Western Australia, to which an "" outsider"" was appointed, being recently reclassified to the "" Clerical"" Division, and the ""outsider"" appointed thereto? 6. As the result of this action, has a Third Class position become lost to existing Clerical officers, who, by reason of long and faithful serpayment of a bonus to officers in Perth, viee, were deserving of' more consideration, and does the officer so appointed become eligible for transfer throughout the Service at large, although he has passed no such qualifying examination as is required of Clerical officers?' 7. In view of the fact that the appointments were made under section 31 of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, which requires a certificate from the Public Service Commissioner that there is no person in the Service capable of filling the position, will the Government constitute a Board of Inquiry before which officers affected can appear to prove their right to appointment in preference to ""outsiders""? to the honorahle member's questions are as follow:1. Yes, in cases where no officers of the Clerical Division were regarded as capable of filling them with satisfaction to thc Department. 2. Practical experience in commercial or other business undertakings. 3 and 4. It is hoped that, witli the training and experience now arranged for Clerical officers in the position of Junior Investigating Officer, it will not be necessary to go outside the Service to fill further vacancies. 5. It is intended to reclassify all such positions in the Clcrieal Division. 6. No officer with the requisite qualifications. was overlooked in filling this position. The appointee will be eligible for transfer or promotion to other positions in the Clerical Division, in common with other Clerical officers. 7. The Government do not propose to take action in the direction suggested by the honourable member. Prime Minister, upon notice1.

63,Mr Wise,"On the 13th inst., theup all intending subscribers who are at present only waiting for telephones. On the 13 th inst., the honourable inember for Darling( Mr Blakeley) asked the following questions:1. Whetheri t is a fact that the Dubbo, New South Wales, Post-office has been in charge of an acting postmaster for the past eix months; also, whether Eedfern Post-office,. New South Wales, has also had an acting postmaster in charge for some time? 2. If so, for what reason? 3. Whetheri t is a fact that officers of lower grades, upon taking up positions of acting postmasters, are not entitled to extra payment for same for thc first month of such service? 4. If so, will he take steps to see that in such that point, has then to establish his case cases the officers are paid the increased rate from the date of taking up duties? -I promised the information would be ob-' tained. The following is the reply:1. Yes. 2. Pending the filling of positions in connection with changes necessitatedby the reclassification of a number of post-offices in New South Wales by the Acting PubUc Serviee Commissioner, in compliance with the provisions of the award of thc Arbitration Court relating to postmasters. 3. Yes. This is laid down by the Postmasters' award. 4. See answer to question No. 3. The following paper was presented: Public Service Act-Appointmen t of E. T. Asche, Attorney-General's Department. In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from 6th July 9726). The motion before the Committee is designed to give effect to a promise made Sby the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) when we were dealing with the Tariff. During the discussion, of the Tariff schedule, many arguments were advanced to * the effect that the duties that were being imposed would not adequately protect pur industries in -view of the exchange position and the dumping that was going on. TheM in ister was impressed with the seriousness -of the situation so created, and said he would bring down measures to deal w i th it . We now have before Us a motion dealing with both subjects, which will be ^embodied in the B ill itself. The motion is divided into two parts, the one, from paragraph A to paragraph D dealing w i th dumping, and the other from paragraph E to paragraph H , dealing with the exchange position. Asf a r back as 1906, this Parliament passed the Australian Industries Preservation Act , which was intended to deal with dumping; but it has been inoperative owing to the fact that under it the Comptroller-General of v Customs, in the first place, has to be satisfied that goods in respect of which complaint is made are being dumped with intent to in j u r e an Australian industry, and, having satisfied himself on before the H i g h .Court. impossible. . that such a procedure is quite impossible, and that no one could have expected it to be successful. Since then practically no legislation dealing with that class of dumping has been passed, but since the war it has become more and more apparent that dumping is not only taking place, but likely to go on until it is stopped by legislative enactment. This motion is designed w i th that object. It would appear, that we are following largely the Canadian legislation in respect of dumping. Canada has led the way in this direction. That Dominion passed legislation in 1904, which was amended three years later. In the United States, legislation exists which was somewhat similar to that' which we propose; but it was recently found advisable to amend the United States law, so that it is now practically in conformity with the Canadian Statute. The same remark applies to South Africa, while Great Britain also has to a very large extent legislated on the basis of the Canadian Act. Lastly, Australia is falling into line. For a long time Australia held a leading position with respect to advanced legislation; but, here, we are following the precedent of another Dominion. W it h respect to the resolutions themselves, provision is made that not more than 15 per cent, can be levied over and above the value fixed for duty under the Customs Act. That is similar to the Canadian law. Whether the specified proportion will be sufficient remains to be seen; but, throughout these resolutions, honourable members wil l notice",26,Public Works Branch Melbourne

I think the Minister means well by this legislation, and that he is honestly trying to prevent dumping by either under-selling or taking advantage of the exchange position, but the proposal to refer everything to a Board before a decision is arrived at may be found to work very unsatisfactorily. I hope the Minister will take note of this objection and consider if anything can be done to meet"" it. If he can show that the procedure will work fairly and expeditiously, without doing an injury to anybody, I shall have nothing more to say. tries which have an appreciated exchange ? this proposal will make much difference to them. America, for instance, has an appreciated exchange, and might be under a slight disadvantage if it had to compete with Belgium, France, or Germany, which have a depreciated exchange. But, after all, it is very difficult to meet all cases, and it is quite possible that the appreciation of American exchange will not last for a very lengthy period. This legislation must operate slightly against a country that has an appreciated exchange, and if the honororable member for Dampier( Mr ters which are the subject pf the motion, Gregory) desires anything more done in regard to such countries, he should bring the matter up for consideration in Committee. good to the United States and Japan and pretty hard on Italy and France. thist, this legislation will not put Italy and France in relatively the same position as they occupied when the exchange position was normal. It may beargued by some honourable members that no provision should be made fer trade with Germany. Whatever we think in regard to trade with Germany, it is very evident that such trade is being done. If it is not being done directly, it is being done indirectly, and the sooner we realize that, ,war conditions having passed, the nations must again deal with each other, the better it will be for If the rate of Australia. If we trade with Germany indirectly through other countries we shall pay more for German goods. than we ought to pay,"" and the intermediate country will be getting the advantage. This measure proposes to balance .trade conditions -.generally. No matter howmuch the mark may be depreciated, the balance can be restored by applying tliis legislation. The only objection I have to the Bill is that it leaves so much in doubt. The Board has to make inquiries, and it must recommend to the Minister, and the Minister in turn has to proclaim the application of this law. I again suggest that it would be an improvement to specify all those goods which are produced in Australia in sufficient quantity, and allow all questions affecting other goods to be referred to the Board. I hope the Minister will give consideration to that suggestion before the Committeestage of this Bill is reached. have no objection to the passing of a short Bill for the protection of the manufacturers of this country against dumping, and, no doubt, members generally are ready to give fair and legitimate consideration to the interests of Australian, manufacturers; but, in my vijew, the Minister might be satisfied with a measure embodying the powers asked for in paragraphs A and D of the motion, allowing legislation for the regulation of exchange, and for dealing with other matto stand over until October, when we could give it full consideration. The Minister showed that he had hacLextreme difficulty in coming, not to a. definite, conclusion, because he found thatimpossible, but to anything like a reasonable conclusion. After cabling to various countries for all the information available, he still found himself in the dark. At the present moment, there are only about a dozen members in the chamber. We have come to the fag end of a session in which there has been an arduous Tariff discussion, and we are not now prepared to deal with an intricate measure of this sort, which may seriously affect the trade and prosperity of the country. for the Bill you suggest to embody paragraph E as well as paragraph D.",29,Customs Tariff Industrie S Preservation Bill

The Brussels Conference, September 24I now wish to deal October S, was the outcome of a demand for international as distinct from independent The action. The experience of the post-war period made it abundantly clear that the nations, whether recently belligerent or neutral, cannot afford to work out their financial salvation, so to speak, in water-tight compartments, and regardless of the effects of their plans upon foreign countries. The problems confronting them, it is true, are more or less similar; but their successful solution will depend in large measure on co-ordinate and co-operative effort. It was the object of the Conference to obtain as complete a picture as possible of the situation of the world, and by comparison of the situation in the various countries to make it possible to form a judgment of tlie importance and difficulty of the problems with which they are respectively faced. The result of deliberaWe tions extending. over a fortnight was generally regarded as disappointing.

Generally speaking, the. financial outlook leaves a great deal to be desired. Tho Britisli (government has iiot yet put into practice the principles of economy it is never tired of preaching to others. Extravagance and waste still rule in various public departments, and there continues to be too ready a disposition to embark on grandiose schemes at home and hazardous and expensive adventures abroad.

Mr ©REGORY.i-The whole ,of it , with the exception of paragraphs A , D , and C. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Ryan) f u l l y appreciates the far-reaching importance of the measure to which this motion relates. We are all tired and weary after the long and trying debate on the Tariff, and find very great difficulty in dealing w it h a measure of this kind, for which, in so far as it relates to the exchange position, there is no urgent need. The Minister promised the people of Australia that he would endeavour to protect the consumer. If that part of the motion which relates to exchange were postponed u n t i l October next, the honourable would then be able to give further consideration to that phase of the question. The CanadianA c t does not give the Minister so great a power as is proposed in this case. It provides thatIf at any time it appears to tlie satisfaction an anti-dumping duty equal to tlie difference of tlie Governor in Council, on report from the Minister of Customs, that the payment of the special duty by this section provided for is production. being evaded by the shipment of goods on consignment, without sale prior to such shipment, the . Governor in Council may, in any case or class of cases, authorize such action as is deemed necessary to collect on sucb goods or any of them tbe same special duty as if the goods had been sold to an importer 'in Canada prior to their shipment to Canada That refers to an ordinary dumping duty, which cannot exceed 15 per cent. The Canadian Act does not give the Minister power to add all the other charges for which provision is made in this motion. We should be very careful as to what powers we give the Ministeri n this direction. retrospective duties, such, for instance, as the duty on t in plates. A supply of tin plates is very important in connection with the export of f r u it and jams from' Australia, but the Minister might apply a dumping duty to t in plates coming into this country because he believed that some one was about to enter upon their manufacture here, and might seriously prejudice the f r u it and jam export trade. Parliament would have no voice in the matter. It might take years to produce tin plates here in sufficient quantities to supply local requirements. ber think this power could be used to hold up prices to enable big wholesale houses tb get r i d of their stocks at prices satisfactory to themselves? far, but it mighb be dtine. Let us suppose that rerj'resentations were made to the Minister that a firm was about to enter upon the production of t in plates in Australia. In that case the Minister might apply a dumping duty to all t in plates coming into this country before the local industry had been established on a commercial basis. That would mean a very big impost, and possibly ruin to our export trade in tinned f r u it s and jam. Under the American law it is provided thatWhenever the Secretary of the Treasury member finds that any industry in the United States of America is being, or will likely be, injured, or is prevented from being established because of the importation of any article, and that such article is selling or is likely to be sold in the United States of America, or elsewhere, at less than is fair value, importers thereof shall pay, in addition to other duties, if any, between the purchase price or export sale price and the foreign market value or eost of I am content with that power, but when the Minister seeks power to take into account f.o.b., c.i.f., charges, plus a profit of 20 per cent., he is making it very plain that it will be possible for him, when a new industry sets up here, to destroy competition so that the consumer will have to pay all these extra charges; and the consumer w ill suffer accordingly. The Japanese Anti-DumpingA c t providesWhen any important Japanese industries are threatened by the importation of unreasonably cheap articles, or the sale of imported articles at unreasonably -'low prices, tlie Government, We have provided for certain after submitting the question to the special Committee, may impose upon sueh articles during a fixed period of time duties not exceeding their proper prices in addition to the duties provided in the Tariff. If tbe articles specified have already been imported, and are in the possession of an "" unreasonably cheap seller,"" the additional duties may be collected from the seller or his agent. I do not think we could do the latter, but that is the procedure in that country. In no instance has any of these countries gone to such extremes as are provided in paragraphs B and C.",35,Customs Tariff Industrie S Preservation Bill

That is to say, I would make paragraph A provide for all contingencies; and that could be easily done. Had the Government taken a little care in connection w i th their finances, had they taken a little thought for the prosperity of the community, they might have made millions by way of income taxation, and so have avoided the need for putting on these special rates of duty. There are certain large firms trading in Australia, which are really sub-sidiary to big foreign interests, the Australian profits from which go overseas. If a tax were put upon the output of those concerns the outside interests would not continue to gain to the extent of millions of Australian money, while our revenue would be correspondingly in creased, with less need for these imposts. The SouthA f r i c a n legislation provides:In the case of goods imported into the Union of a cJass or kind made or produced in the Union if the export or actual selling price to an importer in the Union be less than the true current value (as denned in this Act) of the same goods when sold for home consumption in the usual and ordinary course in the country from which they were exported to the Union at the time of their exportation thereto, there may, in addition to tbe duties otherwise prescribed, be charged, levied, collected and paid on those goods on importation into the Union, a special Customs duty (or dumping duty) equal to the difference between the said selling price of the goods for export and the true current value thereof for home consumption as defined in this Act: provided that the special Customs duty (or dumping duty) shall not in any case exceed 15 per cent, ad val. Here, however, we have a 45 per cent, duty; then the 15 per cent, is charged, and a further 20 per cent, is taken on top of all that-no t to mention other charges which are heaped upon the goods. Do the Government forget that there are other industries in Australia beside manufacturing interes'ts? W h a t real hope is there for the man on the land ? He is charged enormously for the implements which he must use in the course of his operations. The difference between the cost of his reaper and binder and the cost of the same to the Canadian farmer is really enormous. Take, specifically, the cost of fencing wires. Not long ago I received a telegram from Western AusI f paragraph C is left tralia, pointing out that the duty which had to be paid upon 14-gauge wire actually amounted to £ 1 8 per ton. Before the war we were able to buy that gauge I would amend ""for £ 7 10s. to £ 9 5s. per ton. What encouragement is shown to a man to go out and open up new country? W h a t facilities are wo offering immigrants? I suppose there is not an honourable member present who desires to see new citizens entering Australia from overseas and going into city life . We have no room for newcomers in the cities and manufacturing centres. But if we impose these dreadful casts upon a man who is willing and anxious to go out and battle on the land, what hope is there for the f u t u r e of Australian primary industry? A man must protect his holding against the hordes of pests. Nowadays, however, our returned soldiers and others-first clear a comparatively small acreage of new country and plant it . The usual procedure is to take off a harvest or two before going to the cost of fencing and protecting a block. What hope is thei'e, however, for the beginner who, in order to save his crop from the encroachment of rabbits, kangaroos, and the like,, buys fencing materials and netting, and has to pay such enormous prices? The Minister is to be given certain further powers. He desires to be known as the M&Kinley of Australia.

First, there may be a purchase of cheap goods from some foreign country, the importation of which goods into Australia may cause in j u r y to local industry.

A of the first motion; but I shall be no party to a superadded penalty of 20 per cent.

The -Minister( Mr Groom) has explained the pr&visions with regard to consigning on sale, or for sale, goods of such exceedingly low value that their sale Would be likely to be detrimental to Australian industries. Under the present Customs law the Department demands that the duty shall be paid, not necessarily on the amount for which the importer purchased the goods, but on the value of such goods at the port of shipment, and on the date of shipment. Some of the provisions of these motions are merely reimposing conditions which already exist under the Customs Act. If an invoice does not represent genuine values, the Customs Department will rectify it , but the Government are asking the Committee to impose an entirely new condition, namely, that the value shall not be less than the cost of production of a similar article in Australia. cost of production in Australia?Board and the Minister between, them.

Whfen we come to the consideration of the second paragraph, I shall move to omit it . rise with a good deal of sorrow and a certain feeling of humiliation to address the Committee on this question. I think that neither the Minister who introduced the Bill nor the members of the CJommittee at present realize what it is proposed to do. effect of what is proposed. become apparent during the somewhat conversational debate that we have had, that the powers which we are asked to give to the Minister are to be intrusted to him without restriction. The Tariff Board which this House has authorized is to be entirely an investigating and advisory body. It is true that before the Minister can take action, he must refer certain matters to the Board, and await its report; bub nothing in the Bill passed last week, or in the motion under discussion now, compels him to take notice of the recommendations of the Board, beyond saying bhat he agrees or disagrees with them. If he wishes to enforce any of the penalties for which we are now asked to provide, he need only make a reference to the Board, and. await its report., and he can then put into force any decision that is allowable under bhe wide provisions of this resolution. Buti t is this Committee which will really be responsible for the acts that may be done under the proposed law by future Ministers for Trade and Customs, and I ask members to seriously reflect upon that fact. I will now deal with the provisions for allowing the Minister for Customs to impose special duties or penalties against our late .'allies, namely, France, Belgium., and Italy. AndI beseech the Minister now in charge of the Bill to withdraw the clauses which the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) has asked shall be withdrawn, and to consider the advisability of postponing the provisions of paragraph A. of the schedule, because if that were carried grave and unjust disabilities might be im' posed on countries which, as allies, fought side by side with us in the war. It is to that aspect of the matter that I propose to address myself now. The honourable members for Dampier and Wakefield have pointed to serious flaws in the provisions relating to dumping, about which I shall not say anything at pres(|at beyond declaring that I am in favour of any effective method of controlling what is known as dumping; by which I understand to be meant the sending of goods to this country to undersell Australian, manufactures, and to destroy Australian, industries.

This process would apply immediately to all our-exportable goods such as wheat and wool. These goods are bought here by exporters to other countries, and they pay for the goods eventually in the money of their own country. If they find, as from to-morrow, that for every £1 they have to provide in London, they can get double the number of our Commonwealth £1 notes in Australia, they are immediately able to give double as much for our wool and wheat. That is a case in which the prices of goods are almost immediately doubled. Of course, this would not apply to every commodity, nor would it apply immediately to wages; but from the operation commences the process of adjustment sets in, and gradually all prices, wages, and costs are adimports from Germany are concerned, justed to the increased supplies of money. This means a depreciated currency; in other words, the £1 note becomes worth 10s. That is exactly the process that has gone on for the last seven years in France, Belgium, and Italy. It is a pure delusion to believe, and it is wicked to try to make others believe, that this process has not gone on in those countries. The theory on which paragraph A is based therefore, seems to me to be absolutely and fundamentally unsound. It appears to be based on the view that as we can buy for £100 of English money a larger number of francs and lire, in Prance and Italy, we can, therefore, buy to the same extent large quantities of goods from Prance, Belgium, that is not so; it is a pure delusion, a wicked doctrine to circulate here or elsewhere. The real position is that a process of adjustment goes on, and gradually tends to render nugatory all those theoretical advantages of a fall in exchanges. I am not prepared to say there is not some temporary advantage given to exporters in a country, the exchanges of which are falling, and the currencies of which have become depreciated, as compared with those of other countries; in many cases it has proved a valuable industry. But it is not a permaMr Jmcett. nent advantage to the same extentWhile the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) was speaking, an honourable member interjected, "" How can we protect ourselves against the depreciated currencies of other countries?"" The reply to that question is very simple. In the fir3t place, from the moment this depreciation in the currency of other countries sets in, there is set up in those countries a process by which these advantages are rendered nugatory.

In the first place, he sought to show that paragraph A was fundamentally wrong, and was based on a misconception. He suggested that a man could take £100 sterling to France, and there buy up depreciated currency at the depreciated rate, but with the francs thus purchased he could not obtain in addition a quantity of goods corresponding to the depreciation. There is no doubt that, in that connection the increased cost of the production of the goods would make a substantial difference, which must be taken and healthy stimulus to into consideration.

Power is provided, under the laws of that country, for the exploitation of any foreign country in order to permit America to dump its manufactures abroad. Another instance of this same specific objective may be seen in the scientific manner in which Germany went to work. By an extraordinary system of subsidies, financial concessions, railway rebates, and such means, provision was made for the export of Germany's surplus goods.

I call the careful attention of honourable members to resolution (2) :The various duties specified in the foregoing paragraphs be separately charged, notwithstanding that more duties than one may apply to any particular goods, but that the duty payable on any particular goods under paragraphs (A) to (1)') inclusive of this resolution shall not, eitlier severally or collectively, exceed 15 per centum of the value for duty of the goods . . . tions. honourable members will bear in mind that this resolution refers only to dumping, and that, though it appears to be complicated, yet it purports to deal with several different methods of importing goods and completely differing contingencies, they w ill perceive that the methods set out aro really a simple way of placing the necessary legislation on our statute-book. I am satisfied that the Government have exercised reasonable care and precaution in ascertaining and benefiting by the experience of other countries. Another point made by the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) had to do with the Tariff Board. I think the Board will provide assurances to Parliament which, the honourable member himself would be the first to welcome. _ I refer to the procedure of its undertaking investigations. The general form of our Australian Tariff, and particularly of the schedule passed by this House, contains provisions which enable the Minister to reclassify a great number of goods, so excluding, for example, certain machines and other articles from duty. practice has been for some time to take advantage of those provisions in order to render assistance to local industries. This was really a great power in the hands of the Minister. Now, however, the Tariff Board is to have the responsibility of investigation. ""We even seek to go f u r ther, so that if it is alleged that dumping is being practised here, the matter will not be one for decision upon the mere ipse dixit of the Minister; the ques-. tion must be referred to the Board. Care must be exercised in its investigations. Then, it must report to and advise the Minister. Thus is afforded extra security to this Parliament and to the commercial community. It really amounts to an additional guarantee of justice. If the Minister is satisfied that dumping is being carried on, it becomes his duty to bring the anti-dumping provisions into operation. But, unless he is so satisfied, they will not come into operation. Hence, in this extra care proposed, far more assurance is given that the Government are upon sounder ground than in the exercise of the mere discretion pf the Minister. Even as regards this matter of investigation by the Board, we are largely following a practice placed in the hands of Committees in other countries; and it amounts to a guarantee, at least, that the right thing is being done. Whilei t may appear to be harsh in some regards, yet, on the whole, the procedure is fair. As for the suggestion t'o exclude paragraphs B and C, to do so would be equivalent to a deliberate invitation to importers to carry on their dumping operations by the method of consignment. Of course, paragraph A would be of no value unless paragraphs B and C were to stand. The gross liability is 15 per cent. Much exception has been taken to the consignment duty, but after all ifc is fair and reasonable. If a local manufacturer should ask 5s. pergross for certain articles, and the purchaser declared that he could buy them for 3s. from another vendor, the manufacturer would immediately realize that something was wrong, and bring the fact under the notice of the Minister. It is reasonable that the difference between the wholesale price and the selling price in Australia should be imposed as a dumping duty, and the means of ascertaining it is fair. has laid stress on the fact thafc fche maxiThe mum duty w ill amount to only 15 per cent. Does he realize that the penalty against France, Belgium., and Italy under the schedule rises as high as 75 per cent. ? tempt a,t this stage to deal w i th the schedule; I am dealing only w it h principles.

The saine plea was raised prior to a recent Court decision which overruled the practice of the Customs Department, and compelled the Department to refund certain amounts which had been collected in duty by a certain method of valuing goods imported from countries whose exchange was depreciated. Flinders( Mr Bruce) took up the cudgels on behalf of those countries as the honourable member for Grampians is doing today. I would like to deal as leniently as possible with our late Allies, but I recognise no nation to which. I would give precedence over the Australian people. And if the operation of the exchange upon goods imported from those countries will defeat our efforts to encourage local manufactures, I must oppose the claims of France, Belgium, and Italy. for any such apprehension has ever been advanced. is in a peculiar position. _ The United States of America, with its vast wealth and resources, found itself, after the war, iu an enviable position financially, but in an unenviable position in regard to the manufacture of goods for export. help America. sirous of acting fairly by the people of the United States of America, I am even more desirous of establishing true Protection in Australia.

Therefore, wa should not fail to protect the local product against the competition of goods manufactured in Prance, Belgium, and Italy. Although my sentiments are strongly in favour of those countries, I desire this proposed legislation to have the very effect which the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) fears. If the proposals which the Government have submitted will do that, the Tariff will be more effective than I thought, because it was the competition of those The honourable member for countries whose currency is depreciated that I feared most, just as I am afraid of America's powers of dumping. We have to guard against goods which America's financial resources and dumping capabilities enable her to land in Australia cheaply, and the goods from countries whose depreciated currency en# ables them to export cheaply. Both forms of competition are equally detrimental to Australian industry. The honourable member for Grampians has made me more enamoured of the Bil l than I was at first, because I was afraid that, not even with these provisions, would we be able to prevent dumping. The Minister( Mr Groom) and others who have addressed themselves to the motion to-day have not dealt with the question as I think it should .be dealt with; but this is legislation that is largely experimental, and whatever our desires may be, only experience will show wliether these provisions will be effective. I hope that all that is expected of the Bill will be realized, and that it will help us to achieve complete protection and encouragement of local production. If this legislation should prove to be insufficient to achieve that purpose, I hope the Government will introduce other proposals which will be more effective. When my earlier speech was interrupted I was dealing with the theoretical advantage said to he possessed by countries whose currency is depreciated so much that they have to sell their money at a lower rate in exchange for the moneys of other countries. Honourable members have attempted to show that the depreciated exchange gives certain countries an enormous advantage which can be guarded against only by this provision relating to exchange. But I have shown that the natural result of the depreciation of a country's currency is a rise in the costs and the prices of commodities",46,Foster Whe N The Refer To Goods The Sale Of Which Under

221,Mr Jowett (Grampians) [6.17],"within that country. France, instead of being able to buy £100 worth of British goods for 2,500 francs, as she could before the war, now has to pay 4,700 francs for the same quantities of British goods marked at the old pre-war prices. Then, as regards other enhanced costs, wages in France are now , four times higher than they were at the beginning of the war. Thus, the disadvantages arising from the exchange position may approximately almost balance the advantages. The cost of all the raw material imported into France, Belgium, and Italy for manufacturing purposes has increased in equal proportion to the depreciation of the currency, and so any theoretical advantage in regard to manufacture for export is largely nullified by increased costs of all kinds. The alleged advantage that French manufacturers have over other manufacturers is largely illusory, and, therefore, I again ask the Committee to pause before doing what, in my opinion, would be a dreadful wrong to our late Allies. Another matter of the gravest importance is that these countries against whom it is proposed to impose these special duties are among the largest purchasers of Australia's raw materials. France, at the present moment, is one of the largest buyers of Australian wool. The other day I had occasion to go to Queensland in connection with a very important scheme 'for settling returned soldiers on land which is now undeveloped, and I returned in a train which Was carrying a number of wool buyers, who had been attending the wool sales at Brisbane. From them. I learned that of about 37,000 bales'sold there, nearly half had been bought for French manufacturers. Franoe has not imposed a special duty on Australian wool, because, the paper currency of this country has depreciated, as I have shown, to such an extent that the £ 1 note is worth ""only 15s. Id. in gold. She has not treated us with the harshness with which it is now proposed to treat her. But, owing to the depreciation of her own currency, and an unfavorable exchange, she has to pay much more in French money for the wool that she buys from us than she used to pay, and the loss that is thus caused to her through her depreciated currency may equal any advantage that she might For instance, get in exporting her manufactures to this country. France, Belgium, and Italy all manufacture largely raw materials which they import, and for which, owing to adverse exchange, they have to pay prices much in excess of pre-war prices; and the more closely one examines the facts, the more clearly it is seen that the advantages which their exporters are said to enjoy are to some extent illusory and nugatory. The speech of the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) showed that the members of the Committee are not aware of the extent to which it is proposed to penalize the industries of France, Belgium, and Italy. members of the Committee present. There is not one member of the Opposition in his place,, and there are only seven members in the chamber. of the immortal Wordsworth, ""We are seven.""

If it finds in any case that the Protection so given is being abused, it may recommend that the duty be reduced or removed. The Board will also have the power to recommend that industries struggling against severe competition shall in the public interest receive a little more protection. We are now asked to give our industries the additional protection of these dumping duties. Paragraph B provides that if the Tariff Board reports that goods. produced or manufactured outside Australia are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a 'reasonable price, with the result that the competition to which a local industry is subjected is too keen, the Minister may direct that special precautions shall be taken at the port of shipment to see that the goods are not invoiced below the actual cost of production plus certain charges and then plus 20 per cent.

The Government is not going to allow Australian industries to stand before the breath of fair and honest competition. Not content with giving our industries a generous protection, it is providing for what is practically prohibition. And yet honourable members opposite talk of bringing down the cost of living and creating price fixing Boards. Paragraph B, if agreed to, will make it impossible for Australia to be a reasonably cheap country in which to live.

This amendment, if carried, will also involve the omission of paragraph C. Paragraph A deals with goods of a class or kind produced or manufactured in Australia and sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than the fair market value. Paragraph B deals with any goods that may he imported into Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price, so that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry. It covers almost any class of goods that the Minister may choose to gazette on the ground that they are being imported under conditions which are detrimental to some local industry. It will be easy for him to make excuses if excuses are necessary. Minister is satisfied with a very reasonable proposal under paragraph A. The dumping duty imposed under that paragraph is to be merely the difference between the fair market value of the goods and ,the export price, or, in other words, the price at which the goods were sold by the exporter to the importer in Australia, including f.o.b. charges in the country of export. We aTe quite content with that. But the Minister says that, under this paragraph, a reasonable price represents ' the equivalent of the cost of production, plus 20 per cent. bringing goods in genuinely they would look for quite 20 per cent, profit. sonable for them to expect to make more than from 5 per cent, to 7^ per cent. Does the honourable member say that goods should not be imported into Australia without the expectation of a profit of less than 20 per cent, upon the values? Any such profit would be unfair and abnormal, certainly in respect of large contracts. When an indent merchant is dealing with large supplies of steel, or galvanized iron, or tin-plates, it would be a. preposterous charge to add 20 per cent. As for "" a reasonable selling price,"" the Minister himself can fix that. To ascertain it, there is added to the production value the cost of getting the goods to the coast in the country of export, and the cost of landing them here. Then there [412] is heaped up every conceivable charge that can be imposed; and upon everything else, the Minister adds a profit of 20 per cent. After which, and before the .goods reach the consumer, there is the ordinary duty of, perhaps, 45 per cent., plus 15 per cent. Where does the consumer come in? This is one of the most wicked and preposterous proposals ever placed before Parliament. a profit which, under the Money Lenders Act, might be considered unconscionable. understand the motives influencing honourable members, because paragraphs B and C have not the same bearing as paragraph A. The first of the series had to do with goods of a class or kind produced or manufactured in Australia; and it is The in respect of those that the chief danger from dumping lies. We need to protect the industries which are being built up here? I was satisfied with the proposition contained in paragraph A ; but honourable members are now asking for the same conditions in respect of paragraphs B and C, which deal not with goods produced in this country, but with goods the importation of which might be detrimental to Australian industry. According to the argument of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews), no cheap goods of any kind, from anywhere, should be permitted to come into Australia. As for the letter of the Minister for Customs, addressed to the points raised by the Belgian Consul, it contained absolute rubbish, which reflected credit neither upon the Minister nor his Department. job, and our place, to see that Australia gets Australia's trade. We are not legislating for Belgium, but against it, when it is a matter of competition with Australian industry. not destroy our own country in the effort. Is there to be no limit to the prices which our people must pay for goods, while the Minister and honourable members pile on duties? Here is a circumstance which has come before me only to-day. The particulars are set out in the following letter:Re exchange dumping -If this Bill goes through, it is going to seriously affect the man",51,Foster Whe N The Refer To Goods The Sale Of Which Under

I can understand honourable members opposite, who are desirous of keeping up the eost of living, so that wages shall not come down, but I cannot appreciate the motives of the Government. The whole of their efforts in connection with the Tariff have been in the direction of increasing the cost of living and. piling up the cost of production. The object of the amendment is to apply to paragraphs B and C the same conditions as apply to paragraph A.

The object and intention of the Bill is to prevent unfair competition or unfair dealing to the detriment of Australian industry. I can. not accept the amendment for the reason that the general intention of paragraph B is to prevent imported sroods being sold to people in Australia at prices lower than the cost of production in the country of origin.

That class of goods, instead of being bought and sold in 'Australia, Tnay be sent here by manufacturers abroad, and at prices lower than the cost -of production in the country of. origin. only One object, namely) to wipe out the local industry. only that effect! ' No Australian industry could produce and sell goods in competition, with manufacturers abroad who were selling their products in Australia at, less than the cost of production. Such competition must result in the wiping out of the industry, and the consequent creation of unemployment. The next question is, how does paragraph B meet that situation? I think it meets it very aptly. It provides that when the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry by the Tariff Board, that goods produced of manufactured outside Australia have been or .are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price, and that detriment results, the dumping below cost duty may be imposed. What is the meaning of the dumping below cost duty ? The amount of the dumping below cost duty will be in each case a sum which represents the difference between the reasonable price of the goods at the time of shipment and the export price of the goods. Then reasonable price is defined as such price as represents the cost of proelsewhere and are sold at the mere cost of duction abroad, plus 20 per cent., plus f.o.b. charges. moral. seem to think we are imposing a 20 per cent, duty, whereas we are only assessing the reasonable price.

331,Mr Bell (Darwin) [9.10],"In spitegreater share of the local market, not so that they may charge higher prices, for their goods, but so that, because of the increasing; of their output, they may lower their prices. We have contended all through the Tariff discussions that the local manufacturers should be able to sell at a lower price when their output increases, because the greater the output the lower the profit that is needed. There are industries in the TJnited States of America whose turnover is so great that +hey can carry on with a profit of 5 or 6 per cent, on the cost of production; and if, to ascertain the reasonable price at which their goods should be sold on this market, we add 20 per cent, to the cost of production, we assess those goods unreasonably. If we impose an additional duty of 15 per cent -on the goods of a foreign manufacturer, on the ground that he is selling them at a price detrimental to an Australian industry, when he sells them for a profit less than 20 per cent, on the cost of production, we do away with the possibility of competition. To brand as unfair competition the selling of goods made abroad at a profit of, say, 10 per cent, on the cost of production is absurd. Unless the Minister is prepared to modify his method of arriving at a reasonable price for goods imported from abroad, I shall support the amendment.

The question is a very involved one, and even after hearing the informative and instructive speeches of the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), I am still somewhat without light. I may apply, how-, ever, an argument or instance which,though it has nothing to do with the Bill, will illustrate my point. In the early days of this Parliament, when we were in the throes of the controversy, white versus black labour, we passed a Bill which provided for the application of a language test. That test, I may say, was not for the purpose of letting people into Australia, but for the purpose of keeping people out. Now, what is the object of this Bill? Australia to the detriment of Australian industries. for but to prevent dumping? The language test to which I have referred was designed to prevent certain persons from, coming to Australia; in the resolution now before the Committee the same principle applies, but refers to goods instead of to people. No person will bring goods here under the provisions of an effective Bill of this kind, because there will be no profit in doing so; and I ask the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Foster) how he can pretend to be logical when he contends for low duties in order to prevent dumping ? anything of the kind! vent dumping we must make this Bill so stringent and effective that no dumping will take place; and to advocate low duties with that object seems absurd; the higher the duties the more likely are they to prevent dumping. posals only apply to specified articles. tralian industries to their detriment.

When the cost of production in one country has been ascertained, who is going to say what is a reasonable cost in another? If it is the intention of the Board to endeavour to do what is suggested, they will be in an impossible position.

I have said on many occasions that if it can be shown that any company, corporation, or individual is endeavouring to sell goods in Australia with the deliberate object of ruining an Australian industry I would not only support high duties, but would entirely exclude their products. The honourable member for South Sydney has said that the Steel Trust has made up its mind to dump steel rails in Australia. the American Steel Trust is one concerning which much cannot be said in its favour, but supposing those who are controlling it decided to do as I have said, what power will we have over it? able member object to the Bill?

AlthoughI do not expect that the observations I am about to offer will have the desired effect of curing the narroweyed squint which the Government appear to be giving to this very important question, I feel it my duty to deal briefly with it . The honourable member for have some anxiety as to the difficulty of ascertaining the cosfc of production in any country other than our own. Surely such anxious doubts' on his part are little less than an affront to the 'omniscient Minister( Mr Greene) who. controls the destinies of the Customs House, and who,just for the moment, has breathed omniscience into his subordinate now at the table. Surelyi t would be utterly wrong to suggest that one who has at his Angers' ends all the details of the intricate ramifications of production in Australia is limited by the narrow confines of Australia's shores in knowledge of the details of production of any article. We must assume in favour of the Minister that, having sent a cable We are gram to Australia House, and having had the good luck, perhaps, to send it direct to the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), now in England, he would receive an answer, also by cable, showing at once what is the cost of production of any article in any country. We have .just passed what some people describe as a fairly high Tariff. In some particulars, others say fchafc ifc is not sufficiently high, but <-< the whole it is claimed by a large This majority of honourable members that it is an effective Tariff. We have dealt very industriously with fche schedule from end to end, but, just when we thought we had finished with it, we find that we have to begin afresh. In this proposal we have Tariff piled on Tariff. It is a new Tariff superimposed on the old or, It will if I may paraphrase the words of Tennyson, "" Tax piled on tax were all too little."" By means of what is known as an anti-dumping motion we have designed a Tariff, not for the protection 'of Australian industries, because that already has been dealt with-no t to preThe penalties provided in vent undue competition by cheap labour of other countries against our workers of Australia, because that, too, has been provided for, but to do something more. And in that process some think, and I share their view, that in many instances we have inordinately increased the burdens of the people, and especially of the poor. Whether that is so or not I suggest that paragraph B of the motion as it stands, in effect, is merely designed to make sure that whether the Tariff does or does not increase the cosfc of living no low-priced commodity shall be sold in Australia.

Let me read the paragraphIf the Minister is satisfied, after inquiry and report by the Tariff Board and I may here interpolate that .ithe Minister is the final arbiter, and may regard or disregard the findings, of the Tariff Board that goods produced or manufactured outside Australia, have been or are being sold to an importer in Australia at an export price which is less than a reasonable price, and that detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry I pause because we have here the first of the many vague phrases in this paragraph-' ' Detriment may thereby result to an Australian industry."" general discussion on the Tariff we, at least, had the advantage of having in our minds definite industries and sets of definite conditions-wages , prices, and so on-and it has been said that some of us have been unduly influenced by lobbyists and interested persons outside. I do not plead guilty to that, because I think it is the duty of the Committee to derive all the information it can froin those who are operating these various industries. In this particular paragraph we are handing the Minister a blank cheque to deal w i th industries generally. We are invitin g h i m to operate the paragraph in cases where the price may operate to the detriment of an Australian industry at some future time in regard to some unnamed Australian industry which may not then be actually in existence, and possibly may not even be in contemplation. . . . a dumping below cost duty on those goods imported into Australia, which are specified by the Minister by notice published in the Gazette as heing goods as to which he is so satisfied, the amount of the dumping below cost duty being in each case the sum which represents the difference between a reasonable price of the goods at the time of shipment and the export price of the goods. In this paragraph "" a jeasonable price"" means such a price as represents the cost of production of the goods, plus 20 per cent., plus f.o.b. charges. This part of the clause imposes on the Minister the necessity of exchanging a number of cables with some representative in England or abroad, or calling upon the consular representative in Australia to determine, perhaps in a few hours or a few days, the intricate ques[413] tion of the cost' of production of articles made abroad. The clause insists upon a profit of 20 per cent Now, we have been railing for some years against profiteering, but in this clause, so far as it relates to goods sold but not manufactured here, there is provision for a profit of an amount which, as I said by interjection, might well be regarded as unconscionable under the Money LendersA c t . It has been shown, and rightly shown, that a profit considerably below 20 per cent, might secure to the exporter a just and fair return, while the public will get a commodity at a reasonable price, with the knowledge that it is adequately protected; and so we may, therefore, for m some idea of what, apparently, is the In the object of the Government, namely, boosting up prices. The paragraph goes on to stateIn the absence of satisfactory evidence in relation thereto, the cost of production to be such amount as the Minister thinks fit to fix, after report by the Tariff Board as fche cost of production. A f t e r the Tariff Board has reported, and after several cable messages have been exchanged with the H i g h Commissioner in London, the Minister might be as blankly ignorant as a Chinese coolie as to the cost of production of an article. Nevertheless^ he w ill be entitled fco say, ' ' For the purpose of my resolution, I d e clare this amount to be the cost of production."" I have not lent any measure of appreciable support fco the Deputy Leader of the Country party in his Tariff campaign, but in connection with this proposal, at all events, he can rely upon my vote, because it is perfectly clear to me that we are running riot, or proposing to do so, under the delusion that we are protecting Australian industries, when, in truth and.in fact, we are doing nothing more than boosting up Australian prices. [9.57] -Assuming that the arguments of the Minister are right, he is still in an untenable position. How, in the name of conscience, can the Customs Department ascertain the cost of production in a factory in Japan or America? It is utterly impossible. The Department has no power to do that. I should like to know why the Minister did not accept the position as set out in the Customs Act and take "" fair market v a l u e "" as a basis. The Minister cannot mention one",59,Foster Whe N The Refer To Goods The Sale Of Which Under
375,Mr Eichard Foster (Wakefield),"single instance anywhere of a Tariff placing a further impediment to the importation of an article, as is here proposed. He should accept the recognised principle, as contained in the Customs Act, namely, the market rate at the port, of shipment and on the date of shipment. That' is as far as the Department should go. I am going to fight the motion paragraph by paragraph, and if we cannot get the principleto which I object struck out, I intend to oppose the' Bill, which will cause a greater storm throughout the country than the Tariff, which itself will open the eyes of the people when they realize what it really means.

General) [10.37] I agree with the complaint of the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) that there are a large number of people throughout Australia waiting for telephonic service. It is useless now to discuss whether it was a wise «r unwise policy to starve the Department, as the honourable member phrases it, during the years of the war. We have to deal now with the present situation. I told the House in* November last that almost immediately after I took office the Treasurer gave me authority at once to call for tenders for a large amount of works. He gave UB about £900,000 last year for those works, and in order that the matter might be expedited, he gave us permission to anticipate this year's vote to the .extent of another £900,000, so that we could get the orders put during last year, and they would be coming to hand during the present year. In November of last year we had £1,130,000 worth of orders out. At that time we had orders for 636 miles of cable, 19,354 miles of wire, and 46,628 telephone instruments for all Australia, besides a large quantity of accessories and other material, butnone of this could be t ot for same time. I think the rst delivery of telephone instruments under the contract was in May last. They .have been coming to hand reasonably well ever since, and the supply is well up to contract time. There are in Sydney and itssuburbs about 1,000 subscribers who are only waiting for instruments, and these will be supplied within the next two or three weeks. There are others who are waiting for cable wire and other material, as well as instruments, and their cases will be dealt with as soon as possible. The Department is anxious to bave these subscribers, because the telephonic service is a good business proposition; but we cannot make bricks without straw. Iexplained last year that, owing to the great demand for telephonic material in other parts of the world-, andin places near to where it is manufactured, noneof the tenderers would bind themselves to sup-ply us within any particular time.' All we could do wasto -try to expedite orders as much as possiM<». Material"" has been coming to [ « * ] -» hand, and during the next few months is likely to come more rapidly. The commercial men of Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne have appealed urgently for the erection of an additional trunk telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne, and for a trunk telephone line between Sydney. and' Brisbane, there being none now. Both proposals were referred to the Public Works Committee for report, and had not the business of the House been held up to-night we would have endeavoured to obtain the necessary parliamentary sanation for them before the House rose, but we were told by the honourable .member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) a New South Wales member-that he would oppose all these proposals until he had obtained a satisfactory explanation about Canberra.
