0,"House Of Representatives. Wednesday. 22 March, 193s. Took The Chair At 2.30 P.m., And Read Prayers. General) [2.30]","by leave-Severa l of the companies engaged in the oil business, and particularly in the distribution and sale of petrol in Australia, have informed the Government that, they are not prepared to give the undertakings which the Government required in regard to making available certain information to the Honourable John Gunn, who is at present conducting an investigation into this matter. The Government has therefore decided to appoint a royal commission for the purpose of inquiring into the petrol industry. The commission will consist of Mr Sydney Ernest Lamb, KC., barrister at. law, of Sydney; the Honourable John Gunn, Director of Development; and Mr trusts exercise in this country, is fhw Albert Edward Barton, consulting chartered accountant, of Sydney. A secretary will be appointed from the Development Branch, and counsel will be briefed to assist the commission. Minister state whether, if the terms of reference have not yet been drawn up, it is proposed to invite the commission to inquire into certain phases of oil production in Australia nt Newnes and elsewhere ? Is Mr Barton, the public accountant who has been appointed to the commission, associated in any way with the company likely to take over operations at the Newnes shale oil-field ? ence to the commission are under consideration at the present time, and it would be undesirable to make an announcement regarding them before they have been adopted. 1 hope that it may be possible to make a statement on the subject to-morrow or the next day. Before he was asked to accept appointment, inquiry was made regarding Mr Barton's commercial associations, and it is understood that he is not connected with any oil interests whatever. consider broadening the scope of the inquiry to embrace the development of our own oil resources, including the extraction of oil from shale and coal ? Will the commission inquire regarding the extent to which the various oil companies have "" sabotaged "" development in this direction in the past ? given to that matter; hut the principal concern of the Government is the price of petrol. We wish to ascertain whether the public of Australia is boing charged a reasonable or an unreasonable price. I doubt whether this commission would be qualified to inquire into the possible further development of the oil industry in Australia, its personnel not having been selected with the idea that it should make tin inquiry into technical and scientific methods associated with the production of oil. The terms of reference will certainly include inquiry into the whole of the trade in oil. the undoubted power which the foreign oil Government prepared seriously to consider the development of our own resources in the way of oil production",12,Setup

7,Mr Beasley,"Having regard tofrom coal as mentioned by tlie honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), so that we may throw off this foreign yoke, and make ourselves independent? ber's question raises a large issue. As he is aware, efforts are being made to develop our shale oil resources at Newnes and other places. Tlie Government has examined proposals for the production of oil from coal by the. hydrogenation process. During the last interview I had in regard to this matter, I was informed hy those well qualified to speak that the plant necessary to carry on this work by the latest process would cost £12,000,000 t'o erect in Australia. The Government is certainly not in a position at the present time even to contemplate expenditure of that magnitude, and we shall have to await, further developments. T.f the developments should be such as to make it likely that the treatment of coal for the production of oil will be commercially successful, I hope that, it may be found possible for private enterprise to enter the field rather than that the industry should become a government undertaking. MrJ AMES -In view of the 1'nct that a committee set up by the Government of New South ""Wales to inquire into the possibilities of the extraction of oil from coal has' reported in favour of the low temperature carbonization process that has been operated by the Lyon Brothers at Wallsend, and recommended that those gentlemen should be assisted to the extent of £5,000, is it not advisable thiii the Government should extend the scope of the royal commission with a view to its embracing such an important matter as the making of Australia self-contained in regard to oil supplies? that, as a' present advised, it appears to' -me that, to he of any use, an inquiry into the question raised by the honourable member would have to be conducted by moil possessing special technical knowledge. could be summoned to give evidence. non-technical men, whatever witnesses might be examined, would probably not be of any considerable value. It is hoped that the.commission which is to-be appointed will inquire into the trading and dealing in oil and petrol, and procure useful information. The subject to which the honourable gentleman has referred is quite distinct from that; namely, the possible development of the industry. Judgment upon that would have to be arrived at after a consideration of facts and opinions, and that would require special scientific knowledge and skill. of the House lay on the table the substance of the cablegrams that have passed between the British and Commonwealth Governments, and between the Resident Minister in London( Mr Bruce) and the Commonwealth Government, in regard to the proposed restriction of the exportation of butter to the United Kingdom? Will he also indicate the nature of the negotiation between the Commonwealth Government and the Dairy Produce Export Control Board, so that, honourable members may have an accurate idea of what is occurring? the cables which have passed between the Commonwealth Government and London contain highly confidential information and expressions of views regarding the probable attitude of some of tlie parties concerned. It would be quite improper to raukc such information public, but I shall inquire to what extent, if at all, the material sought by the Deputy Leader of the .Opposition can be made available to the House. been informed that the British Government did not make representations to the I have already stated Resident Minister in London( Mr Bruce) regarding the. butter quota.

Prime Minister inquire whether a conference of bodies representing citizens of the Federal Capital Territory made an offer to the Federal Capital Commission that it would provide £3,000 a year towards, the maintenance of the local hospital, the money to be raised by means of a levy, and that the Crown Solicitor's Office gave a ruling at the time that no legal provision existed for the imposition and collection of such alevy?

I am aware that Dr. Watson has, on other occasions, stated that opinions of a particular kind had been given, whereas, in fact, the opinions were of a directly contrary kind. I made inquiriesinto this matter this morning, and found that neither iu the Crown Solicitor's Office nor in the office of the Attorney-General is there an opinion of the nature mentioned.

Item 240,.sub-item ( A) (Tiles). rose last night to seek an assurance from the Minister that the consideration of this item would be postponed until the report of the Tariff Board on the matter was in the hands of honourable members. I know that the Minister invariably follows the recommendations of that body. I was of the opinion that the case submitted hy those who are interested in this industry was so strong that the recommendation of the board would be a favorable one. The Minister to-day tabled the report of the board on flooring and wall tiles. There has not been much time to scan that report, but I have read the recommendation of the board. Doubtless, having in mind the fiscal views of the present Government, and the opposition of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) to any increases of duties that can be avoided in these times, the board has recommended against an increase of British preferential, and 5s. a square yard general, imposed in 1926 by the Pratten tariff, prior to which the rates were 25 per cent, and 35 per cent, respectively. is most unfair to the .hoard, which is totally disinterested. to the Tariff Board, as finally amended by the applicants in the case that has just been considered, was for an increase in the general rate to 12s. 6d. a square yard, or 65 per cent, ad valorem, the British rate to remain at 3s. a square yard, or 25 per cent, ad valorem. This request had the support, not only of the Australian, but also of the British manufacturers, whose views were expressed by Mr C. E. Mayo, representative of the by Mr ""WHITE (vide Glazed Wall and Floor Tile Manufacturers Association, Tunstall, Staffordshire, England; also chairman of the tile section of the Association of British Manufacturers, Sydney, and representative in Australia of Maw and Company Limited, tile manufacturers, Jackfield, Ironbridge, Shropshire, England. Unfortunately, the request was turned down by the board. This is one of the industries which benefited under the prohibition proclamation that I , as Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, made in April, 1930. It was necessary to stem the tide of imports and shut out lines that we could do without. The Government was confident that industry would not stop, and construction would not be prevented, if we had to depend upon Australian tile manufacturers for supplies. The prohibition of the importation of tiles lasted for approximately two years from April, 1930, and, during that period, the local industry made great progress. There are",15,Papers

37,Mr Forde,"The request submittedtwo Australian manufacturers actively engaged in making tiles-the Australian Tesselated Tile Company Limited, Mitcham, Victoria, and E. Fowler Limited, Marrickville, Sydney. Anybody who has taken an interest in the industry will appreciate the great improvement that has been made in the quality of the locally-produced article during the past three or four years. To-day only the most fastidious would object to using Australian tiles. The following table gives the importations of tiles for the year 1928-29, the last year before the prohibition was enforced:United Kingdom. Square Vards. Value. Square£ Coloured glazed tiles White glazed tiles . . 169,593 The aggregate was 337,289 square yards, valued at £180,842. This industry has great possibilities in Australia, because there is a growing tendency to use tiles when building, with improved hygienic results. Taking the year 1928-29 as au average year, it is estimated that the volume of the importations of coloured tiles sources of the total importations of coloured tiles from British manufacturers are similarly placed to our own in respect of competition from foreign sources, and in Great Britain it has been found necessary to impose a duty on imported tiles to protect the local industry. During the year 1929-30 the Australian Tesselated Tile Company Limited employed 269 operatives. To-day they employ only 104. Our two Australian factories now employ an aggregate of approximately 200 persons, as against 400 two and a half years ago. the decline in the building trade. were told in 1929-30, when things were at their worse, in Australia, that the trouble was due to a Labour government having control in the Federal Parliament. Only a few weeks ago the Prime Minister (Mi\ Lyons) said that there were general indications of a growing confidence in the stability and future of the country, and he instanced the building trade as a remarkable example of the return of that prosperity which, allegedly, is just around the corner. Yet the Minister now declares that the. trouble is due to the decline in the building trade. It is evident that it, is due to the lifting of the prohibition on the importation of tiles. Price levels in European countries have fallen to such an extent that importers are able to land tiles in Australia at a price against which our own manufacturers cannot successfully compete. Further, the local manufacturer has to conForeign. tend against the prejudice which still persists against many locally-made proYards. Value. ducts. Importers disseminate all sorts of attractive propaganda in favour of the £ 100,659 79,484 67,039 33,189 articles which they.handle, claiming that 68,160 scientists and engineers have proved that the imported commodity is better than the local tile. One is sometimes asked to name any manufacturing industry that is employing fewer hands to-day than when the Scullin Government was in office. The tile industry is such a one. It is true that the work now going on in these factories is infinitesimal in comparison with what would be possible in to Australia from foreign boom construction days. Here is an equalled about two-thirds opportunity to restrict our tile purchases to Australian and British products, ^and the United Kingdom. keep the trade within the Empire. That, I thought, is what the Minister and.his Government stand for. The plant and equipment are already in existence, and these well-known companies have given an assurance that they are ready to extend their works if necessary. We have suitable clay in Australia for the manufacture of tiles, and 90 per cent, of the raw materials used in the process are obtained locally, the remaining 10 per cent, representing finishing materials imported from the United Kingdom. One of the arguments used by certain honourable members opposite, when criticizing Australian industries, is -that they are uneconomic, because they have to import from 50 per cent, to 60 per cent, of the raw materials required. This is not such an industry The necessary equipment has been installed at Fowlers Limited to produce 2,000 yards of glazed tiles .and 1,000. yards of flooring tiles a",16,Tariff 1932 Special The Existing Duty Of 3s A Square Yard

This firm also has a tunnel oven, which is not being used at present, because of the decline in the .demand for . its product. The Government cannot turn down the industry on the ground that the quality of the article is not up to standard. Here is what the Tariff Board has to say on the subjectThe quality of the local product is considered good, but the range in design is limited, of tiles from foreign countries was proaud the cost of production is greatly iu excess of the f.o.b. price of continental tiles of comI t should be sufficient, to have, in addition parable type and quality. . . . In the board's opinion the imposition of the 'increased general rate suggested hy the applicant company would have the effect of transferring much of the continental business to the United Kingdom; thus the local manufacturer would not reapany appreciable benefit. That, is iii accordance with the Government's view, and the principle underlying the Ottawa agreement, that we should buy from the Mother Country instead of from European countries. The Australian manufacturers were not unreasonable. Recognizing the Government's view that British manufacturers should be given a share of the Australian market, they requested that the increased duty should apply only to foreign importations. breaking the Ottawa agreement? written before it had received the text of articles 9 to 14 of the Ottawa agreement. than the Ottawa agreement requires. the Government should be so concerned about the importation of foreign tiles. Its solicitude for the foreign manufacturer will assist the workers in foreign countries to the detriment of Australian workers as well as of British and Australian manufacturers. recommendation, which will no doubt be adopted by the Government, will deprive this Australian industry of the necessary increased output to make its business economically sound. In order that a business may be established on an economically sound basis in this country, it must be given a protection sufficiently high to enable it to obtain the preponderating share of the Australian market. which all the time is struggling against the competition of low-wage products from other countries cannot succeed. Apparently, the fight between Australian industries and foreign industries is to continue to the detriment of the former. The Minister says that if we exclude foreign manufactures, the range of tiles available will be limited. I remind him that for over two years the importation hibited without any great inconvenience. to the Australian product, the product of British factories. Mr ""WHITE -During the period of the prohibition, tiles to the value of £18,000 were admitted into Australia. the importation' of tiles not manufactured in Australia. In the case of articles which can be manufactured in Australia, it is only right that preference should be given to the Australian product. If the imposition of higher duties restricts the volume of foreign imports, surely the Australian manufacturers are entitled to the benefit. They have shown courage, euterprise and initiative in the establishment of this industry, and have given employment to hundreds of workmen. In asking for protection, they are asking only for what the primary producers of Britain are seeking in connection with meat and butter and other primary products which are imported from the dominions. Are Australian employers who have had the courage to open up new fields of employment for Australians to be forced to apply for further reductions of wages and longer hours of employment, thus bringing their employees down to the level of the coolies, in order that they may compete with the products of cheaplabour countries?

Trade and Customs) [3.17] -Only this afternoon, I tabled the report of the Tariff Board on flooring and wall tiles. The board's inquiry was held as recently as January of this year. This industry, which is well established and working efficiently, does not need the eulogy of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde). Evidently the honourable member has not read the report, or he would know that the request of the Australian Tesselated Tile Company Proprietary Limited referred solely to coloured, glazed tiles of foreign origin. In his evidence before the Tariff Board, MrE . E . Walker, the governing director of the company, statedFor the purpose of this case, I ask the board the embargo had been in operation for to disregard the importations of white glazed only a short period, the imports were tiles, as our request will not affect such imports, which are all of British origin.

In the following years, the an increase of duty is not justified for the importations were smaller, hut the ratio following reasons:1. It would add materially to the cost of tiles of special design not manufactured in the ing in the cities was practically at a United Kingdom or Australia. Australian factories do not cover the the importation of tiles to the value of whole range2. It would result in but a small addition to the output of the Australian manufacturers. turers are producing slightly less than They are looking for other lines to manufacture at any eost. The Tariff Board took into consideration all the factors, The honourable member is and then reported against increased duties3. The increased cost of tiles and the limitation of the range would tend to restrict the use of tiles and thus decrease employment. Any one acquainted with the building trade knows that there is a tendency to face city buildings with tiles. That practice has encouraged the tile-making industry. To raise the cost of tiles would discourage their use for building purposes4. The range in quality and design of tiles demanded by the' building trade being very wide it can be satisfactorily supplied only when the various sources of supply are available for selection. The requested duties would practically exclude from the Australian market all continental tiles, thus unduly limiting selection. Those who want special tiles should be able to obtain them provided that they are willin g to pay for them. If the i m portation of tiles is prohibited, the result w ill merely be that tiles w ill not be used for building purposes. D u r in g the Scullin Government's regime, the i m portation of tiles was prohibited, except with the consent of the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs. The fact that considerable importations were permitted shows that Australian manufacturers were not in a position to meet requirements. D u r in g the year 1929-30, when they come? was preserved.

It is apparent, therefore, thai much of the eloquence of the honourable member for Capricornia has been wasted. A perusal of the Tariff Board's report, shows clearly that the present duty adequately safeguards the interests of Aus-, tralian manufacturers.

It is estimated that 40,000 tons of sulphur are required annually in Western Australia; but we should need SS,000 tons of pyrites. Evidence was given before the Tariff Board that contracts would be entered into for the supply of pyrites, if we could guarantee continuity of' supply for ten years. It was estimated that if pyrites were used instead of sulphur, there would be a reduction of Is. (3d. a ton in the price of superphoshe was Prime Minister a couple of years phate. would be more expensive than the handling of the sulphur, and would give employment to a much larger number of men. At present, and for a long time past, the Australian manufacturers of superphosphate have been entirely in the hands of the American exporters. When we made our proposal to the Tariff Board, and the matter was brought under the notice of the Government, a reduction of a dollar a ton was made in the price of sulphur. I point out also, that if we could enter into contracts for the supply of this SS-,000 tons of pyrites for Western Australia, it would mean that there would be S8,000 tons of shipping available on the return trip, which would be a valuable consideration to our wheat and wool producers. It would also have a considerable effect upon our adverse trade balance. The importation of this pyrites would give employment to a considerably larger number of men on the wharfs and railways, and in the manufacture of sulphuric acid from the pyrites, and would make the price of the superphosphates a little lower to the producer. The importation of the pyrites would not affect any mining company in Australia, because a bounty is payable on the production of sulphuric acid from zinc concentrates. mine were in operation, and were producing pyrites for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, the bounty would be payable to it. As honourable members will realize, it is impossible to ship sulphuric acid from, say, New South Wales to Sir. Greuory. other parts of the .Commonwealth, and pyrites could not be shipped even from New South Wales to Victoria, for the cost annually even by the would be too great. I trust, therefore, Although that the Government will realize the reasonableness of my suggestion that Western Australia, at least, should be permitted to import pyrites for the manufacture of superphosphates in that State. Every one realizes the value of superphosphates in a country like Australia. Prom the point of view of production, it is desirable that we should make the highest grade of fertilizer available to our producers at the lowest possible price. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) knows something about this proposal, for it was submitted to him when The treatment of the pyrites ago. The pyrites would come from Spain, where it has .been produced from the Rio Tinto mine for, I suppose, about a thousand years; but the mine is a British property. If pyrites could be admitted free, it would be of advantage to the producers, and to a considerable number of people who would obtain employment in this country manufacturing sulphuric acid from it, and no injury would he done to any section of the people. Mi'. WHITE (Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.35] -There is a good deal to he said in favour of the proposal of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). I remind him that the duty was originally imposed in the interests of the Lake George mine, in the Federal Capital Territory, which was then producing pyrites; the situation has since altered, for that mine has now almost ceased to produce pyrites. Regard must be paid, however, to the possible effect of the importation of pyrites on the Australian industries now engaged in the manufacture of sulphuric acid. I point out to the honourable member that pyrites can be admitted under item 275 (n), in group 5, as prescribed by departmental by-laws.

Has the Government been in communication with the representatives of these companies? Has it submitted the question to the Tariff Board for inquiry and reporta board which it has placed above Parliament, and without which it is not prepared to act?

Interstate shipping would benefit, ancl we should keep within Australia money that. would otherwise be sent abroad. We want from the Prime Minister something more tangible than his mere statement that the matter is still under consideration. Some honourable members seem to take the view that when an industry is to be started, the first step necessary is to The present Prime Minister ask the Government for assistance. 1 know something about the paper pulp industry, and let me inform honourable members opposite that there is no suggestion that the companies concerned are asking for favours from this Government.

I do know that the statement of the Prime Minister, as quoted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eorde), to the effect that there would be no opportunity for the industry to be established unless a change of government took place, was perfectly true. But since the last election, another group has become interested in this project.

72,Mr Riley (Cook) [3.51],"I supportregime of the Scullin Government that failure to start the industry was due to lack of confidence. Obviously, that was not the real reason, because this Government has been in ofiice for some time now, and nothing tangible has been done. Apparently, the delay is now due to a lack of co-operation between the two financial groups interested in the enterprise. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) has just told us that these groups are not looking for financial assistance from this Parliament. That is not so, because for some nine years or more successive Commonwealth Governments have promised a bounty for the manufacture of paper pulp, but it has been recognized that it is not economically possible for two financial groups to engage in the enterprise. They must come together with a view to reducing initial costs and overhead charges. When this is done, the necessary financial assistance will be forthcoming. For the honourable member for Denison to suggest that the financial interests associated with both enterprises are not expecting government assistance is too absurd for words. It is well known that wealthy newspaper interests in this country are associated with the proposal, and they would be the last people in the world to risk hundreds of thousands of pounds of capital in a. venture of this description without first having a definite assurance from the Commonwealth that financial aid would be given to them. This scheme has been dragging on since the present Government took office a little over fifteen months ago, and, as far as I can gather from the information given to honourable members, there is now less likelihood of the rival groups coming together than in any previous stage of the negotiations. I should like to know from the Minister precisely what financial assistance this Government proposes to provide for this industry. Unless we encourage the establishment of important secondary enterprises such as the manufacture of paper pulp, the fish industry, the extraction of oil from shale, and others, I cansee no hope of a reduction of unemployment in this country. Trade and Customs) [3.55] -It u There is not the .slightest doubt that, if ; amazing how readily the Deputy Leader this industry is developed along right of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) can work up an argument about an abstract subject such as the item before the committee. Some years ago Tasmanian interests approached the Bruce-Page Administration, and, later, the Scullin Government, for financial assistance to establish the paper pulp industry in that State. But soon there were two rival groups in the field, and up to the present time they have not come to an agreement for the pooling of their resources, and consequently have not submitted to the Government a proposal that is acceptable. The development branch is now making the necessary investigations. Work cannot be started until the parties reconcile their interests, and can show that they have command of the necessary capital. but the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) told a different story during the last election campaign. Minister expressed the hope that manynew industries would be established in this country. Undoubtedly, it would be a good thing for Australia if paper pulp could be manufactured from eucalypts, which was the original proposal. This industry has reached a highly productive stage in other countries, and, because of the technical difficulties involved, the interests concerned in the Tasmanian project are going slowly in the matter. Although it is not the Government's province to put these people into business, it will give careful consideration to a tangible scheme when it is submitted for consideration. I understand that the Minister in control of development has this matter in hand. It has occurred to me that, possibly, the wealthy newspaper interests in this country are indulging in a sham fight against one another, so that the establishment of the industry may be delayed. The Government should not tolerate undue delay. This proposal has been under consideration for at least ten years.

Althoughi t may not be an important industry, it is desirable tliat we should give encouragement to all enterprises that provide employment for our people. I understand that this item was submitted to the Tariff Board some considerable time ago; but, as the Minister has since referred other matters to the board, at the behest of representatives from the Country party, I am afraid that its report concerning this particular industry may be unduly delayed. As this industry has asked for tariff protection, it is not right that the board's inquiry should be further delayed. Althoughi t may be a small industry, it uses Australian materials, with the exception of graphite, and its successful development will keep out many trashy pencils that are imported from Japan and elsewhere.

Item 359, sub-items ( c l ) ( D 1 , 2 ) , and ( E 1 , 2, 3) (Vehicle parts). Sub-item ( E ) relates to metal panels for motor bodies and provides for duties of £15 per set for single-seated bodies; £25 per set for double-seated bodies, and £32 10s. per set for bodies with fixed or movable canopy tops and bodies. Panels for cars are provided either by moulding with dies, beating by hand, or the substitution of leather for steel to avoid the high duty and capital cost of dies. I understand that the cost of a set of dies varies from £6,000 upwards. If there is a demand for, say, 6,000 sets of panels of one kind, the die cost per car is only £1, but if the demand should be limited to 300 sets of panels, the die cost per car is £20. Even when the motor car business was booming, only a few popular makes were^sold in sufficient numbers to justify the provision of dies at such tremendous cost. Cars of whicli the sale is restricted-and that applies to many makes of British cars-canno t afford the prohibitive cost of dies, and have to choose between hand-beaten panels and leather. Some honourable members may imagine that leather bodies are provided in accordance with the desire of the purchasers. In many cases leather bodies are used because of the impossibility of providing steel panels at a reasonable price. Many of tbe makers of the less popular cars But w ill the investigahave fitted the bodies with hand-beaten panels, but I understand that the manual product is inferior to that made with dies. When the honourable member for I can only give my Capricornia ( Mr Forde) was Minister for Trade and Customs, the associated' agents for British cars suggested a sliding scale of duties on sets of panels' imported from the United Kingdom, so that the duty would be low when comparatively few panels were required, and ><. would increase inproportion to the importations, until, eventually, through",24,Division 13 Pape R And Stationery

That was a reasonable proposal which I hope the present Minister for Trade and Customs will investigate. To-day it is doubtful if any make of car is selling in numbers sufficient to warrant rest the doubts raised by the honorablethe body-makers incurring the expense of dies. being used. tal cost of £6,000 is spread over a relatively small number of cars the cost per car is unreasonable. I believe that if the importation of panels were permitted at a low rate of duty, thus cheapening the cos-t of cars, more cars would be sold, and a greater volume of work would be provided for body builders. At present, the British cars are undoubtedly penalized because the makes which are selling in large numbers -are principally of American origin. The disparity between the sales of British and American cars would be reduced if the suggested relief from the present tremendous duty were granted. -The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) has made out a prima facie case, judgment upon which must depend upon the accuracy of the figures he has given to the committee. I can hardly believe that a set of dies for, say, out, from their point of view, a strong a 7 horse-power Austin car, would cost £6,000. In 1929 or 1930, Holdens, of Adelaide, turned out 43,000 motor bodies. patterns of dies. was a considerable slump in the motor trade, and the output fell, so I was told, bodies, because they are unable to afford! to little more than 1,000 a year, but trade to buy or make the dies which large-scale: has now improved considerably, and this firm, now linked up with General Motors Limited, is again employing large numbers bodies for all the chassis imported by that number of such builders, but the number large company. The panels required cover a wide range of patterns. I am inclined to think that no substantial increase in the demand for cars would follow a reduction in the duties on panels, bodies used are made locally. There are in which represent only a small proportion of ""the cost of a car. I have been under the impression that leather-covered motor bodies were the most advanced development in the trade, but the honourable member for Gippsland has told the committee that resort to leather has been dictated by our poverty. Unless the Minister has information which will set at member's speech, this item should be postponed until such information is available. The motor car is now an integral part of our lives, and it is vitally important that its cost be reduced as low as possible; but equally important is the eucouragement of the manufacture of motor bodies and parts in Australia. The honourable member for Gippsland will probably be surprised at learning the extent to which the production of motor bodies and parts has developed. manufacturer who cannot afford a set of dies? The answer is suggested iu the interjection. He dies. suggest that the Government walk very warily before allowing itself to becaptured by the suggestion that has beenmade by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson). When I was Prime Minister, I received an influential deputation which discussed this very subject with me. I do not deny that they made case; but there is a stronger case against it. Their case, on the whole, was very similar to that presented to us this afternoon by the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson). Some small body-builders desire to import, panels with which to make motor-carproduction alone justifies. sma.ll builders are there? of bodies they make is small.

Holden's, in South Australia, is a striking example of the way in which the industry has developed. This firm has spent a large sum of money in equipping its factory. It may, of course, be said that, if the importation of panels is prohibited, a monopoly will be given to the Australian body-builders; .but we must remember that, so expensive is the machinery which the Australian body-building firms have installed, that its use-is justified only on a mass production basis. If we permit imported panels to come into this country, they will eat into the volume of trade offering, and the big firms will not be able to carry on successfully. I admit that the honourable member's proposal looks fair enough, and that by his scheme for a sliding rate of duty the big manufacturers are apparently protected. He suggests that if panels are required in small quantities only, they should be allowed in at a lower rate of duty, which rate would rise as the number imported increased, so that firms using a large number of panels would be encouraged to install their own dies. I remind honourable members, however, tliat if the number of designs is large enough, the number of panels of any given description imported at one time may be so small as completely to defeat the protective purpose of the tariff. The honourable member for Gippsland raised one important point, namely, that the present system penalizes the British car manufacturer incompetition the multitude of the varieties of British -cars in comparison with the small number of standardized makes usually imported from the United States of America renders it more difficult to build bodies for them in this country. was one of the points I emphasized in England when discussing the subject with British car manufacturers. I pointed out that we gave them a preference of, I think, 27\ per cent, on cars, and that notwithstanding this, they were unable to take advantage of it to the extent of Mr Scullin. .displacing the American cars. I am conI f the honourable member's vinced, as a layman, that the reason why British manufacturers do not succeed, is that they will not standardize their products for the Australian market. They are too individualistic, too proud of their own product, with the result that it is impossible to get a group of them to cooperate in the production of a few standard cars which would he acceptable in this country. If they are not prepared to do that, we cannot be expected, to upset our local industry in order to help them. I was told, when in England, that if the British Government would alter its system of motor taxation, British car manufacturers would be able to build at a cheaper price cars for the Australian market. That is their business. We can point out to them what ought to 'be done; it is for them to adopt the suggestion. In the circumstances, I do not think that we are justified in departing from the present system. There is something to Be 'said for the case put forward by the honourable member for Gippsland, but, on the whole, the weight of evidence is against it. surprised to hear any honourable member in this House assert that motor-body panels cannot be made in Australia. the tone of the debate on this subject. We have not many secondary industries in South Australia, but among them are two large motor body-huilding works which press their own panels. The only factory in my electorate is that of T. J.

96,Mr Price,"I was also surprised at[4.25] -The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was correct when he said that the British manufacturers persisted in producing freak motor cars for which it was impossible to build bodies in Australia at a reasonable cost. So few of them are sold here that it is not worthwhile installing the machinery necessary for making the bodies. England appears to be specializing in the manufacture of such cars, and at the annual exhibitions, is able to sell many of them to continental and even American buyers; hut the demand in Australia is so limited that it would not pay to install dies for the manufacture of panels used in making the bodies. hand beaters in Australia. but the use of hand beaten panels would probably increase the cost of the bodies. Those British manufacturers who produce standard cars such as the Austin, Vauxhall, and a few others, are able to compete in the Australian market, because the bodies can be manufactured here. As for the other manufacturers, nothing can be done to help them, except to reduce the tariff on imported panels, and that would injure the Australian industry. I do not know why Australia need bother about the British freak motor cars, when there are already on the 'market British cars of standard makes which can compete with the best America sends us. I should be loth to do anything to hurt the .body-building industry in this country. orable member's suggestion for helping it would be particularly injurious to Holden's ancl the other large body-building firms. Mi\ HUTCHINSON (Indi) [4.28] I am reluctant to hurt the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) by expressing sentiments of which he does not approve, but I am compelled to give my unqualified support to the proposal of the honourable member for Gippsland. I have, for years, taken an amateur's interest in the motor industry, and I am convinced that the case presented by the honourable member for Gippsland is sound. I have in mind a certain make of car for which body panels could be manufactured in this country only with the use of dies costing about £7,000. The estimate of £6,000 for a set of dies is, I consider, conservative. Although there are some hundreds of thousands of cars sold annually in Australia, this number includes a great variety of makes, and it would be impossible to manufacture 'body panels for them here on a mass-production basis. Because of the number of different models of all makes of cars involving different sets of dies, the cost of motor bodies has risen enormously.' I was informed in Melbourne, by a man uponwhose word I can implicitly rely, that in some cases the cost of a motor body in Australia is equal to that of the fully equipped car in the country of origin. If that statement is correct, or even approximately so, the price to the Australian purchaser is out of all reason. The people of this country definitely demand individuality in motor car appearance. I have no wish to possess the same make of car as that which is possessed by other persons, or to have on that car a body similar to that on other makes; bodies must conform to make of car; and that feeling is general in the community. Where there is a demand for individuality, the manufacturer will meet it. Apparently, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) suspects that Great Britain has not moved in the direction of completely standardizing and modernizing its cars. I deny that that is so. Particularly within recent years, very considerable strides have heen made by British manufacturers in the direction of meeting the Australian demand, and, in my opinion, it will not be very long before the English car will supplant the American. The question of the labour employed has been raised. Apparently, the Leader of the Opposition would create in Australia a monopoly in motorbody building, with, possibly, a' limited number of body types being sold for different makes of cars. It would be absolutely impossible to divide the industry into groups, or to expect reasonable competition so long as the huge overhead cost of dies continued. I wish to see costs reduced, if possible. The effect of that would be to expand the industry, and enable' a",27,Division 14 Vehicles

I pone the item, and give further consideraam surprised that some honourable tion to the matter from all its aspects. hope that the committee will allow this item to stand. It has been stated that Holden's employ in South Australia in the vicinity of 600 men. I believe that, even during the depression, as many as 1,000 were employed by that firm. Any person who has visited its works knows that the capital invested in them must exceed £1,000,000. They cover many acres of ground, and are the best equipped, as well as the largest, works of their kind in the southern hemisphere. Holden's have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in the purchase of the plant and machinery necessary for motor-body building, including the making of panels, and, in addition, during the depression, they concentrated on other work with the object of absorbing as much labour as possible. At one time they employed upwards of 3,000 or 4,000 men, and turned out a large number of bodies each week. I do not believe in protection being made too high, but I sincerely hope that the committee will give what is necessary to a company such as this, which we really cannot do without. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr body. Hunter) stated that mass production resulted in the dismissal of a certain number of men. That is not borne out in the case of Holden's, who employ thousands of men despite the fact that they produce in the mass. I hope that the item will .not be altered. I believe that British car manufacturers have not catered adequately for Australian needs. I am a loyal British subject, but I own and drive an American car, and am not ashamed to make the acknowledgment. I know that if I wanted to purchase a British car of the same class as the Buick for which I paid £400, I should have to pay over £1,000. I think that, at last, British car manufacturers are making special efforts to cater for our requirements. When they have done that to our satisfaction, we can think of lowering the duty in their favour. [4.46] -This is not altogether a matter Yet, when their wishes are met in the of British industry versus that of the motor body industry, honourable members [16] United States of America, but of members should attempt to belittle the value of this industry to the Oommonwealth. It is not fair to gauge that value on a depression basis. The motor body industry has been carried on successfully in this country, and it is not at all uncommon for representatives of American car manufacturers who visit Australia to declare that Australian-built bodies are equal to those constructed in the United States of America. Thousands of bodies built by Holden's, and other concerns, have been fitted on American chassis, including such well known makes as Chrysler, Studebaker and Buick. Hundreds of metal workers and beaters have been specially trained for the purpose, and it would be improper if we did anything to hamper the growth of the industry. Every part of a panel for the body of a motor car can be made well in Australia. There is not very much difference between the cost of the local and that of the imported article. It certainly would not be possible to land a motor car equipped with an imported body as cheaply as the same chassis could be purchased if fitted with an Australian to the cost in the country of origin. not swim to Australia; they have to be freighted across. One indication that our motor body industry is successfully established is that the money invested in it is, largely, American. For years most of the popular cars have been fitted with bodies built in the Commonwealth, to the great satisfaction of their owners. During this debate; and on other occasions, members of the Country party have claimed that the cost of production iu Australia is high because there is a multiplicity of workshops trying to carry on. They contend that the only way in which to place our industries on a sound economic -basis is to evolve a rational scheme of grouping these small concerns in one big, comprehensive, efficient plant.",29,Division 14 Vehicles

If it became evident that Holden's or any other company was exploiting the community, this Parliament has power to protect the people. It is unwise to prejuestablishment dice the minds of others in these matters the body-building industry in this counTho Government is selecting a jury to inquire into the transactions of the oil companies, yet we are prejudicing the minds of all by saying that those companies are a monopoly robbing the community. It is not wrong to be a monopoly; it is wrong to use monopolistic powers improperly. I hope that this item will not be altered, because the Australian motor body-building industry has proved satisfactory and efficient, and it deserves a proper measure of protection. to say a few words on this item, because a considerable amount of motor bodymaking is done in the Eord Motor Company's works, and these are in the Corio electorate. Some honourable members are slightly in error regarding the cost of dies. In the United States of America and Great Britain, where many thousands of bodies of one design are manufactured, steel dies are used by the manufacturers; but in Australia, where there is a market for a relatively few bodies of the same design, the necessity for economy has prompted research into cheaper forms of dies, such as cast-iron dies, and even hardwood and reinforced concrete dies, the first downward thrust of the die block forming a steel plate which acts as a shoe to protect the relatively soft body of the die from being deformed by subsequent use. in the production of inferior panels? few panels of the same design are manufactured. It is essential that we should keep faith with the big organizations which have invested money in Australia, not only in dies, but in enormous and expensive presses, for the making of panels for motor car bodies. We must also consider the interests of small bodybuilders, the scope of whose operations does not warrant repetition machinery. adoption of the suggestion of the honorI t is I cannot support the proposal of the Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson), because, in my opinion, it would work against the interests of mass production in body-building, and would not appreciably assist the small man. As to the cost of Australian car bodies, I think that this community has paid, and is paying, a very heavy price for the and maintenance of try. I say that in spite of the fact that the second biggest body-making factory in Australia is in my electorate. I believe it to be true in general to say that wo pay several times as much for a body as we should pay for an imported body if these did not carry a heavy duty. The car which I use costs £430 in Australia, whereas its price in the United States of America and Canada-is only 700 dollars. I admit that these figures are not directly comparable, and I give them merely to indicate in general terms the spectacular difference. The biggest single item of difference between 'the price here and in America is, I am given to understand, due to the cost of the body. Because' of the limited market, it does not pay Holden's Limited, the Ford Company, or any other company to market more than the minimum range of bodies. Because of that, we are denied the advantage enjoyed in other countries of a wide choice of body types. The"" Sunshine"" body that has been developed, particularly in Great Britain, is wind proof, rattle proof, and weather proof, and makes it possible to give a closed car the characteristics of an open car by the flick of a finger. We are denied the enjoyment of bodies such as that, because it would be too costly to install the necessary dies and machinery for the number of bodies that would be sold here. We are also denied, in perpetuity, the chance of exporting car bodies, because we could not possibly compete with the American or Canadian makers. _ It may be possible one of these days, not by any arbitrary action of this Parliament, but by negotiation with the representatives of the industry to prevent the whole country having to pay a toll that is not justified by the number of men. employed in the industry.",30,Division 14 Vehicles

In my opinion, that would lead to a number of new types of cars being placed on the market, and to increased numbers of applications for the importation at low rates of duty of small batches of panels, and would, in the aggregate, throw out of employment large numbers of Australian workmen now employed in the well established body-building factories in this country. orable member make that out? say, twelve different types of English cars were brought here, and application made for 40 sets of panels for each type at a low rate of duty, they would displace a number of cars fitted with Australian bodies.

Had the British manufacturers accepted the advice of the then Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), and decided to concentrate on a limited number of makes of British cars for the Australian market, and to establish their own plant and dies in Australia, they would have overcome the difficulty. The Australian motor body-builders were only too willing to meet the British car manufacturers by turning out as far as practicable exclusive body types for them. The British car manufacturers wanted something entirely different from the bodies on American Gars.

127,Mr Jennings (South Sydney),"cult to compare manufacturing costs in Australia with those in other countries, because our exclusive arbitration laws tend to raise the cost of production in Australia. In considering the tariff that fact should not be overlooked. I hope that, in the interests of this large secondary industry, the item will be allowed to stand unaltered. Some honourable members have taken an extraordinary view of my suggestion. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Jennings) appears to think that the motor body-building industry would be jeopardized if this item were referred to tbe Tariff Board for investigation. I am proud that so many of the motor car bodies in use in Australia are made in this country. I drive a British car which has an AustraUan body. I believe that if the Tariff Board investigated this subject it would decide that it would be to the advantage of the Australian motor body-building industry to admit a limited number of imported panels at reasonable rates of duty for those makes of cars which are not sold in large numbers; it would stimulate rather than hinder motor car body-building in Australia, because it would reduce the cost of cars. In a book which he has written, Henry Eord, whose name has been mentioned during this debate, says that every time he succeeded in reducing the price of his car by 10, 20, or 30 dollars, lie reached a new stratum of buyers. He succeeded in getting as purchasers people who were unable to afford a car before the price was reduced. Every reduction in price enabled him to catch more buyers, make more cars, and employ more workmen. If we can reduce the cost of the motor bodies built in Australia-and I stress that we would still build them here-w e would sell more of them, and thereby give employment to more of our people. I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr ing industry is established there on a Corser) that we need not concern ourselves about freak cars, .but I submit that a make of car which requires, say, 400 sets of panels from a set of dies has its price increased by from £15 to £20 owing to the cost of the dies. Where the order for panels is a large one, running into thousands, the cost of the dies is not in body-building is justified. very much per set of panels; but where the order is for only 200 or 300 sets of panels, the cost per set is greater. In that way the cost of the car is raised, with the result that fewer of them are sold, and consequently not so many workers are employed in making the Bodies. There is really not a great deal of labour employed in pressing these panels. The bodies would still be built here, and, I submit, in greater numbers, if my suggestion were accepted. Let ""us consider the position of an English car which sells in hundreds rather than in thousands. There exist in Great Britain dies suitable for the moulding of the panels of that car. We have to choose between obtaining panels from those dies, and incurring the expense of making dies here. It is both unreasonable and uneconomic to make dies in Australia for only a few hundred cars. In order to test the feeling of the committee on this item, I move That sub-item (E) be postponed. I do so in order that the item may be referred to the Tariff Board for investigation. interest the committee to know that in 1927 the interstate sales of Holden's General Motors Limited were valued at £2,191,274. In that year the company paid £764,239 in wages, and £53,320 in salaries. Unfortunately, the figures dropped considerably for the year ended June last, when the sales amounted to £312,015, and wages and salaries together to £152,534. Eor the last five years the company's aggregate sales have amounted to £7,360,137, and salaries and wages to £2,868,405. It will be admitted that the establishments of Holden's Limited and T. J.

Members of the Country party talk about duties that should be reduced; but I find that these duties were introduced by a ministry of which the Acting Leader of the Country party ( Mr Paterson), the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) , the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson), and the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) were members. Those duties have been in operation since 1921 without protest from those members. I admit that we have had protests from the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), but the other honourable members to whom I have referred were content to let the duties stand, so long as they remained in office. Because the late member for Wimmera, Mr P. G. Stewart, would not be a party to such a policy, he walked out of the Ministry with which the Country party was associated. myself capable of similar action. orable member did in cabinet, I do not know; but the public generally believes that he stood behind these duties from 1921 to 1933, without a protest. Now members of the Country party are seeking to make political capital out of this matter, and to injure this Ministry hy advocating a policy of free trade.

So far as my knowledge goes, no manufacturer has ever made such an application. The post-war industry of motor bodybuilding is an efficient one. It was promised adequate protection in 1921, and in 1925 it got it. The duties now prothe posed were recommended by the Tariff Board, which reportedOne of the disquieting facts in connection with the motor car industry is found in the heavy importations of bodies last year, i.e., 1923-24. There is no apparent need to import bodies into Australia. In that year £1,163,138 worth of bodies came from abroad, and three-fourths of them were from the United States of America. In view of our adverse trade with that country, it was thought advisable that the work of building the bodies should be done in Australia, rather than that thetrade should be allowed to become still more adverse. The board further statedThe success which has attended mass pro* duction in Australia of touring bodies leaves no doubt that the closed type can also be produced with equal success, if the demand grows. The truth of that statement has been proved. The local firms were previously making touring cars, and now they have made a success of the manufacture of closed bodies as well.

I understand that there would have to be separate dies for the panelling of each model, because the die suitable for the panelling of the largest model would obviously be unsuitable for that of the smallest. If a set of dies for one model cost, say, £7,000, a capital outlay of £28,000 would be required to enable a manufacturer to be in a position to supply panels for the four different models. Such a heavy expenditure upon dies alone would be unthinkable, and the purchaser in Australia would not be able to obtain the same kind of body and the same panelling as that provided on cars of the same make in the country of origin.

In my opinion, the cost of the dies has been over-stressed and considerably exaggerated. No doubt a manufacturer would consider the number of panels that he was likely to require before deciding to procure dies. If only a few cars of a particular model had to be made, the panels would he beaten by hand; the services of panel-beaters can be .obtained for that particular class of work. Buti f it happened that certain But there are few small bodydies were required, and their cost was prohibitive, consideration would be given to their admission under by-law, in order to help an Australian industry. The motor body-building industry also uses a large quantity of Australian steel and a certain amount of imported steel, and also a large quantity of Australian leather-cloth. As I . have already remarked, if any request by a manufacturer by-law were refused, mention of the fact could be made in this chamber. Amendment negatived Sub-items agreed to. Item 360 agreed to.

I do not think that any country in the world except Australia puts a duty on fertilizers, or the ingredients required in the manufacture of them. Usually, the authorities who deal with customs duties realize the enormous value of manures as a factor iu the wealth production of a country. I desire that Australia shall follow the example of these other countries. In 1901, when our first tariff schedule was manures were on the free list, but sulphate of ammonia, which was not then used for the manufacture of fertilizers, was made dutiable to the extent of 15 per cent. British and 25 per cent, foreign, and it was placed in the chemical division of the schedule. During the war, when the Germans found it impossible to get nitrates, owing to the blockade, their scientists discovered a method of obtaining nitrate from the atmosphere, which, after the war, was' exploited to a very large extent for the manufacture of fertilizers, and fertilizers were used with such great success that, within a couple of years, the areas which had been devastated by the war were restored to their former fertility. The Germans pointed out in certain circulars they issued, that the use of fertilizers was essential, and that they should be made available at the lowest possible price to those who had to use them. They then placed all their cards upon the table, and asked both England and the United States of America to allow these nitrogenous fertilizers free entry until such time as those countries could develop plants for the purpose of making similar fertilizers. the honourable member that sulphate of ammonia is covered hy item 271 in group 2. amendment to this item to provide that nitrates and nitrogenous and other fertilizers be admitted free from both British and foreign countries. These fertilizers are being manufactured in Great Britain to-day, but a big change has occurred in the process of manufacture. Originally, enormous power was required to obtain nitrate from the atmosphere. I believe that recently the process has been altered to lower the power required. We should encourage the importation into Australia of nitrogenous fertilizers. The time will come when we shall realize the enormous value of these high grade fertilizers, and at our wonderful hydroelectric power plant in Tasmania it would be easy to have these nitrate fertilizers manufactured, or the nitrate necessary for the purpose could be obtained by the operation of those plants. I wish under» consideration, to strike out the words "" n.e.i."" and to insert the words "" nitrogenous and other fertilizers-fre e "". I do that under the assumption that the amendment will include sulphate of ammonia used as a fertilizer. I am notincluding in the amendment the words "" sulphate of ammonia "" because that product is neces.sary as a chemical, and, as such, I do not wish to interfere with it. .There is a distinction between sulphate of ammonia used as a chemical and sulphate of ammonia used as a fertilizer. Sulphate of ammonia is a by-product from the coke ovens at the works of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited at Newcastle, and from the gas works. It is merely a by-product, and its value as a fertilizer is created by an admixture of sulphuric acid, a mixture now classified by the Minister as a chemical, and subject to duty as such. Although the duty on nitrogenous fertilizers as a result of this ministerial ukase is 25 per cent., the method adopted by the Customs Department of adding 10 per cent, to the value, makes the impost really 29 per cent. That, together with freight and other charges, makes these manures very expensive. It should not be necessary to emphasize the wonderful benefits that will accrue from the use of these fertilizers, particularly iu the sugar-growing areas of Queensland. Some years ago the Tariff Board in its report on fertilizers pointed out that the charge for sulphate of ammonia in Queensland was £18 or £19 a"" ton, whereas the price in New Zealand was £12 12s., and in Western Australia £17 or £18 a ton. This fertilizer is an expensive item in orchards, where it is extensively used. It is an expense that is hardly justified, particularly at the present time.",36,Division 16 Miscellaneous

Then vested interests brought influence to bear upon the department and a by-law was issued to the effect that as these nitrogenous fertilizers came into competition with sulphate of ammonia, which was classified as a chemical, they would be subject to the same duty. I am satisfied that that by-law was illegal, and that the decision of the department could have been upset had the persons concerned with the importation of these nitrogenous fertilizers dared to fight it. I ask honourable members to realize what these nitrogenous^fertilizers mean to the sugar and apple-growers. Tliere is now in Australia a big movement on foot to settle people on small areas for intense cultivation. That movement would be greatly assisted if high grade fertilizers, not superphosphates, but sulphate of ammonia and nitrate fertilizers, were made nondutiable. I move That tlie item be amended by adding the following sub-item:"" And on and after 3rd March, 1933(D) Nitrogenous and other fertilizersBritish, free; general, free."" While I support, to a large extent, the remarks of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), I suggest that his amendment is entirely out of order, because ammonia sulphate is included in item 271, division 9 of group 2. The item with which we are now dealing relates entirely to superphosphates. by the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Hill) is not sustained. The words ' other fertilizers "" do not relate particularly to sulphate of ammonia, which, as the honourable member has pointed out, is included in another item. I support the amendment of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). I am afraid that the honourable member for Echuca is under some misapprehension. He has been referring to a chemical which is carrying a duty of 30s. Item 271 of group 2 specifically includes sulphate of ammonia as a chemical. The honourable member for Swan wishes to include sulphate of ammonia with manures which are non-dutiable. As the honourable member pointed out, this manure is used by small settlers. It is used by orchardists, market gardeners aiid others who have small holdings suitable for intense culture. These men, when their crops are being sown, use immense quantities of superphosphates. After the crops have germinated and become established,they should be top-dressed with sulphate of ammonia. Many settlers are precluded from using sulphate of ammonia because of the high prices charged for it, and, if the prices were reasonable, I am sure that immense quantities of sulphate of ammonia would be used. The honourable member for Swan has referred to the manufacture of nitrogenous manures in Australia. As a matter of fact, I know of one company which is willing to manufacture these manures when the quantity used is sufficient to warrant tbe establishment of the industry. At present, the company is carrying out organizing work in the country in an endeavour to persuade producers to use these manures, and thus hasten the day when their manufacture in Australia will be possible. It is an anomaly to class sulphate of ammonia as a chemical, subject. I rise to a point of order. to a high duty, when it can he largely used as a manure.

Sulphate of ammonia has been classified as a chemical, although Parliament really intended that it should be treated as a manure. We have now an opportunity to take a broad view of the tariff. We must recognize that fertilizers ""play an important part in primary production in Australia. Why should we refuse to place sulphate of ammonia on the free list when, by its unrestricted use, chemical manures required for their use we can increase the wealth of this country to the benefit of the people generally. The Minister should differentiate (between sulphate of ammonia as a chemical, and sulphate of ammonia as a fertilizer. I support the amendment of the honourable member for Swan. -We cannot, at this stage, afford to make 'blunders respecting the tariff, and the committee should have further information with respect to this item. The Minister has already stated that sulphate of ammonia and other substitutes for manures have been referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report, and before taking any action to amend this item, we should, at least, wait until we have the views of the hoard before us.

My company has recently been unable to obtain its requirements of ammonium sulphate in time for the spring season, and I enclose copy of letter to the Nitrogen Fertilizers Proprietary Limited, dated the 19th instant. The complete file is at yoAiT service. This company calls your attention to the fact that the nitrogen syndicate did not modify its statement that it could give pretty prompt delivery, while it is a reasonable inference that the fertilizer company allied with the nitrogen syndicate must have been made aware that there was going to be a shortage, and imported accordingly through the nitrogen syndicate. My company, being purely co-operative, has as its object the supply of fertilizers at the cost of production as nearly as possible. By"" trading without profit,"" it not only has reduced prices, but has distributed its surplus annually amongst its purchasing members. It pays no dividends on share capital. There being no control over the ingredients of superphosphate, the company has had a free hand in keeping its price to a reasonable figure. Mixed fertilizers w ill not be on such an assured basis if anything in the nature of a "" corner "" in ammonium sulphate (an essential ingredient) becomes possible. Any artificial inflation of price would particularly affect growers of f r u it , root crops, &c. It may be mentioned that we were not prepared to compete seriously in the mixed fertilizer market until November last. Up to then mixed fertilizer prices had actually risen during the time that superphosphate was coming down. Now, as a result of our competition, these prices are lower than they have ever been. It is respectfully requested that provision should be made in the new tariff to enable the Minister to suspend the increased duty on ammonium sulphate of foreign origin where there are grounds for assuming that the tariff operates in favour of any monopoly, Australian or British.

Yours faithfully , R. C. EVANS, Secretary."" The increase referred to amounts to £1 per ton. The previous prices were £9 12s. 6d. and £9 15s. 3d. per ton respectively. Before 29th June, 1932, the f.o.r. price was £10 4s. per ton. As a result of this action the cost of complete manures and superphosphate and ammonia mixtures wil l go up from 3s. to 10s. per ton according to the strength of the mixture. These fertilizers are prepared exclusively for tlie production of primary produce' other than wlieat. The Gas Company will, therefore, take considerable toll of the amount (15s. per ton) which the Commonwealth Government is making available as financial relief to the hard-pressed producers engaged in this class of production. The lack of justification for the increase is made apparent by the almost simultaneous announcement of a decrease in the price of gas. The Metropolitan Gas Company at tha present time is receiving the benefit of lowered wages, cheaper coal and a high tariff, and are the sole distributors of sulphate of ammonia in Victoria. It is submitted that the Minister should retain the power to suspend the duties to cope with cases such as this. The present position was anticipated in this company's letter of 31st October, 1932, to your predecessor (copy enclosed). In particular, your attention is respectfully directed to the last three paragraphs thereof. JAS. B. ROBERTSON, Secretary. The chief point made by this company in its letters was that power should be 1 retained by the Minister to suspend the .hands of a combine, which is linked up with the Australian combine. Australia in any case can only produce about one-half of its requirements, and the effect of the 30 per cent, general tariff, plus the present exchange, freight and other charges, is to the power to suspend the duty, as is suggested, there would be some control over the Australian combine; but under existing conditions it is at liberty to do practically what it likes. Under the present arrangement, exchange, duty, freight and otlier charges are added to the price of the half which is produced in Australia and the whole is sold at what is claimed to . be world's parity. keenly in this matter, because it so vitally concerns our primary producers, the great majority of whom are in such grave financial ammonia is used extensively for orchard purposes, for the cultivation of potatoes, and for top-dressing in many districts, and the Phosphate Co-operative Company hoped to be able to make mixed fertilizers available at a reasonable price. But as soon as it started operations it found itself in the hands of the combine, and was unable to obtain a f a i r proportion of the sulphate of ammonia that is manufactured in Australia except at the price demanded whicli, as I have explained, was the. British price plus freight, duty, exchange Minister should give this matter his immediate attention. impression that this item and that relating to ammonium sulphate were being taken together. Apparently, I was in error. However, I intend to vote for a reduction of duties on superphosphates in sub-item n, to show my bona fides and also as an indication that the Phosphate Co-operative associated, is not afraid of competition, whether British or foreign.

When to these prices was added the cost allowed by the Price Fixing Board for the operation of mixing, the ultimate fertilizer was extremely costly. The reduction of the price of mixed fertilizers is essential. Movements are already being made in this direction. During the compilation of this report advice was received that the price for sulphate of ammonia had been reduced by £1 3s. 9d. per ton in Queensland, and_£3 per ton in Western Australia. This is a move in the right direction.

If the Government realized the importance of sulphate of ammonia to the primary industries, it would not hesitate to accept the proposal of the honourable member for Swan( Mr. Gregory). Although this fertilizer is not used extensively in wheat production, it is essential in the raising of many other crops. Superphosphate is admitted duty free from countries within the Empire, and I have not suggested any alteration of that. But I do desire that"" nitrogenous fertilizers be placed on the same footing. Unfortunately, the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) has, by by-law, treated nitrogenous fertilizers entering Australia as if they competed with superphosphate, and has imposed duties of 15 per cent.

The gas companies are making such large profits that their shares, as a rule, are quoted at a premium. The BrokenH ill Company has received very favorable treatment under the tariff. The first consideration of this Parliament should be to allow the farmers to obtain fertilizers at the cheapest price possible. In another part, the report statesI t is remarkable that while only 16,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia were consumed in Australia during 1927-28, Great Britain and the Channel Islands consumed 167,000 tons. That has been explained in the minority report of the hoard, where it is stated that the price of sulphate of ammonia ranges from £14 7s. a ton in Sydney to £16 a ton in Perth, whereas, during the same period, New Zealand users were able to buy it from selected depots at £12 12s. a ton, while the price in England was £10 12s. It was further pointed out that Australian manufacturers were sending this product to New Zealand, and selling it there at a lower price than that at which they supplied the Australian users. I trust that when we come to consider the chemical division of the tariff, it will be made clear by the Minister that sulphate of ammonia, as a chemical, will be subject to a duty, but that, as a fertilizer, it will be duty free. honourable member for Swan( Mr soils as there is in those of other countries. Gregory) proposes,"" in his amendment, to put nitrogenous fertilizers on the free list. Special mention has been made of sulphate of ammonia, 'but on this subject, the last report of the Tariff Board shows that the board itself was divided regarding it. The duty on this commodity, shown in group 2, item 271, of the tariff, has been the same for the British product since 1926, but an increase of 5 per cent, is shown on foreign products in order to 'bring the duties into line with the Ottawa agreement. originally was 15 per cent. British and 25 per cent, general. I do not underestimate the value of top-dressing and of fertilizers, particularly nitrogenous fertilizers. I have seen experiments conducted, and have learned to realize the value of these manures. I . remind honourable members, however, that the present duty is not a heavy one. There are industries in Australia which would be adversely affected if these commodities were admitted duty free, and it would be wrong, I think, for this committee, in a slap-dash way, to wipe out duties that have been in existence for years. In the circumstances, I think it might he well if honourable members, who have always professed to attach so much importance of tariff hoard reports, were to wait until the board is able to report on this matter. when the commodity was used purely as a chemical, not as a fertilizer. in force for years, including the period while the Country party had an important say in the government of the country. come into use as a fertilizer only during recent years. since long before the honorahle member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) was a Minister. Evidently, he has not followed the progress of this fertilizer in other parts of the world. It is true that it has not been used in Australia in large quantities until recently, but for many years it has been in general use in England, New Zealand, and other countries. deficiency of ""nitrogen in Australian as a general proposition. There may be areas where nitrogenous manures are not required, but they are most valuable in other parts. Honourable members know that I have not been a slave to Tariff Board reports, nor should this committee follow them slavishly; but I have always said that there is value in having an investigation made, and in getting the facts. Parliament should then weigh the board's reports, and determine their The duty value. Evidently the Tariff Board recognized that there was much to be said on each side of this question, because members were equally divided on it. This commodity is a by-product of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company's works, and of the various gas works. While the gas companies may he looked upon as monopolies which have shown",42,Ammonia

I urge the committee to leave the duties as they are for the time being until we are in possession of all tJIG f £icts am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has shown a disposition to evade the issue. He must know, as did the Bruce-Page Government during its concluding days, that this commodity is coming into increasing use in Australia. Any delay now will be fraught with serious consequences because the time is close at hand when this fertilizer should be applied to be of value during the forthcoming season. Other countries recognize the importance of placing cheap fertilizers in the hands of the farmers, and admit them duty free. The Leader of the Opposition asks that no action be taken until the Tariff Board has reported on the matter, but we have before us a report dated the 5th Septemr ber, 1929, which is a comparatively recent one. The report contains this statementThe rather strange argument was put forward hy a representative of the sellers of sulphate of ammonia that the matter of price was not of very great moment in governing the amount of fertilizer consumed. The suggestion is that, given plenty of good propaganda, the price does not matter much. We arc unable to subscribe to that view. The illustration regarding the reduction of consumption of sulphate of ammonia in Great Britain, in spite of a fal l in price, is not convincing for the following reasons :1. A satisfactory comparison cannot be made between a country such as the United Kingdom, in which a very high consumption has been reached, and Australia, where the consumption is very much lower. In the former, the demand is sure to fluctuate, whilst in the latter their land by greater fertilization. Thati t must tend to increase. It is remarkis the case throughout Australia. Surely able that while only 10,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia were consumed iu Australia during 1927-28, Great Britain and the Channel Islands consumed 107i000 tons. ber quoting from what is called the minority report? orahle members that this commodity is a by-product which previously was wasted. Whatever the companies sell it for represents a profit which formerly they did without. But why should an excessive price be permitted for a commodity the output of which is not equal to half the requirements of Australia? Supplies of the local product cannot be obtained ,by Western Australia or other outlying parts of the Commonwealth. The position has been described as "" unfortunate "" by the Resident Minister in London( Mr Bruce), the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), when Minister for Trade and Customs, and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), who, as Prime Minister, told a deputation that the Constitution prevented his Government from allowing supplies to go free into Western Australia. quantity to be sent there. ber allowed one consignment to be sent, and then the strings were pulled on him by big city interests. basic commodity in the development of Australia. Advantage should be taken of anything that will increase and cheapen production in this country. It is not necessary to leave the Federal Capital Territory to learn what has happened since the depression began. Returned soldiers were placed on land that it was estimated would carry from 1,000 to 2,000 sheep. At the price which ruled for wool at the time, it was considered that that would give them a fair living. At present prices there is not a living in it, and there is no opportunity for these men to extend their holdings. All that they can do is to increase the carrying capacity of the development of these great industries along competitive lines is of more importance than the desires of those who produce sulphate of ammonia as a by-product. The time for the application of fertilizers for this year is now approaching, and if it is not carried out, the process will have to be postponed until next year. I , therefore, urge the committee to make it possible for supplies of this fertilizer to be obtained at a lower cost.",43,Ammonia

213,Mr Forde,"I am sure that theour production. 1,000 cases a week of black-grown bananas are enough to depress the market. Fijian bananas cost the Australian banana industry £1,800; and it must be remembered that these shipments are to come in weekly for the term of the Ottawa agreement, five years. There are approximately 8,000 banana-growers in New South Wales and Queensland, and each year they use nearly 1,000,000 cases which are made from Australian timbers'. Any injury done to the banana industry will adversely affect associated industries. In rail freight each year, the Queensland banana-growers pay £134,000, and those of New South Wales £70,000. The total area under banana cultivation in those States is 27,226 acres. planting for 1932-33 is 6,000 acres, which makes a total of 33,226, from which must be deducted 7,000 acres which are going out of cultivation, leaving 'a net acreage for the current year of 26,226. For years the Australian banana growers have striven to improve the quality of their product. In this respect they have incurred a great deal of expense in sending experts to practically every country where bananas are grown. As the result, they have achieved a substantial measure of success, and have produced a worth-while article.. The Australian consumption of bananas is between 900,000 and 1,000,000 cases per annum. This year the estimated production is 1,400,000 cases, so that there will be a surplus of approximately 400,000 cases, and the Government chooses such a time to countenance the importation of 40,000 centals or 4,000,000 lb. of bananas from F i j i . Naturally, that will reduce the price of the Australian product, and have a most damaging effect on the industry, as I shall demonstrate. When confronted by his irate electors in 1932, the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr approximately 1,000 cases per week. Francis) said that negotiations were in progress between the Commonwealth and British Governments for a variation of the Ottawa agreement regarding bananas. I should like to know the result of those negotiations. Probably the Minister will It represents but 2.7 of be able to offer us some explanation. Article 16 of the Ottawa agreement should give the Commonwealth the power to negotiate for a variation in regard to this item. It readsThe two last shipments of . . . In the event of circumstances arising which, in the judgment of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom or of His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia as the case may be, necessitate a variation in the terms of the agreement, the proposal to vary those terms shall form the subject of consultation between the two governments. The Assistant Minister for Defence told the irate banana-growers that the Government was taking action along those lines, and tihat they could look for the most sympathetic consideration being given to their representations. They want to know what progress has been made. Has any definite The estimated action been taken along the lines suggested by the Minister? It has been said that the banana industry of F i j i is conducted by whites as in Australia. I find, however, that the European white plantation owners in F i j i represent only 6.6 per cent, of the owners; Fijians, 75.9 per cent.; Indians, 9.8 per cent.,' and Chinese, 7.7 per cent. There are twelve times as many Fijian banana plantation owners in F i j i as whites, and there are more Indians and more Chinese than white growers. Those figures dispose of the argument that the Fijian banana industry is conducted chiefly by whites. I am sorry that the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) is not in the chamber. In 1921, when this subject was before Parliament, he urged that the duty on Fijian bananas should be increased not merely to what it is at present but to as much as 13s. 4d. per central. To-day, he stands behind a government which -accepts a duty of 2s. 6d. per central under the Ottawa agreement, and also under that agreement permits the entry of Fijian bananas to the extent of 40,000 centals per annum, or Speaking in this chamber in 1921, the honourable member for Lilley saidI have already demonstrated to the committee that the increased production in Queensland and New South Wales justifies the growers in asking for the whole of the Australian market.",47,Division 1 Ale Spirits And Strated That The Agreement Is A Washout

It has beenand if their fears are realized, then the problem will become a most serious one, with the admission of F i j i bananas on terms that will enable that product, grown under native labour conditions, to compete with the Australian product on terms disadvantageous to thu latter.

As a matter of fact, it is not confined to the members of the United Countiy or United Australia Party in the other States, as witness the peculiar attitude of two of Queensland's representatives in the Federal Parliament. We refer, particularly, to the very belated announcement made by the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Francis), and the Speaker( Mr Mackay), as to where they stand. Despite their specious and unconvincing arguments, it is now clear that whatever the consequences to two of the States' important tropical industries, it is their fixed intention to support the Federal Government's action, in having callously bartered them away at the behest of vested importing interests . . . Seeing that they have chosen the ignoble part of placing the interests of party before those of Queensland, and that they have failed her in her hour of need, their wanton betrayal carries its own condemnation. That newspaper, which represents the banana-growers, has a right to criticize, not only the Federal Government, but also the representatives of Queensland constituencies in the Federal Parliament who stand behind a government which does these things. This matter has already engaged the attention of the Queensland Parliament, the members of which, irrespective of party, were unanimous in their condemnation of the action of the Federal Government. member must confine his remarks to a discussion of the item before the Chair. there will not be one member of this chamber who will not admit that the Ottawa agreement has been a dismal failure. The reduction of the duty on bananas from F i j i strikes a blow at a great Australian primary industry in which thousands of returned soldiers are engaged. This action on the part of the Government, following their losses through bunchy top and other diseases, adds to the difficulties of these men. Hundreds have been forced off their holdings, having lost everything; others have out under article 16 of the agreement, and is there any hope of the growers Generai) [9.16] -The honourable member ( Mr Forde) who has just resumed his seat after a Queensland speech directed against his fellow members, and of a kind to which we are very accustomed, first referred to the provision in the tariff of a British preferential duty on bananas of 2s. 6d. per central, aud a general rate of 8s. 4d. per central, and asked where the provision was which confined the rate of 2s. 6d. per central to 40,000 centals of bananas from F i j i in accordance with the Ottawa agreement. If honourable members refer to the terms of the resolution under which the tariff was introduced, they will see that in the second paragraph, it is provided that the British preferential rate may be applied to goods specified in a proclamation, and it is well known that no bananas are', in fact, imported into Australia from Great Britain. It is true that if they were, they would be entitled to come in at 2s. 6d. per central, and the honourable member would be able to make another speech upon that grave risk to the Queensland industry. But a proclamation has been made which extends the 2s. 6d. rate to 40,000 centals of Fijian bananas, to he landed at Sydney and Melbourne in accordance with the Ottawa agreement. Therefore, lionorable. members should entertain no apprehension on the first point made by the honourable member. Members are aware that the concession which has been made in the reduction of the duty on this limited quantity of bananas from F i j i is a condition of the Ottawa agreement because of the special terms on which Australian",49,Division 1 Ale Spirits And Strated That The Agreement Is A Washout

222,Mr Latham (Kooyong,"Attorneygoods may enter all the British colonies. I look forward to a considerable extension of Australia's trade with the Crown colonies, particularly those to the north of Australia, on the continent of Asia, as well as those in the Pacific. The concession is also a condition of the Ottawa, agreement with respect to the concessions granted to Australian products entering Great Britain. The honourable member for Capricornia has spoken in generally unfavorable terms of the Ottawa agreement. No agreement, of course, could be made without regard to economic conditions, as they may exist from time to time. I ask honourable members, however, to consider what would be the position of many of our principal exporting industries at the present time if goods came into Britain from the rest of the Empire upon the favorable conditions granted under the Ottawa agreement, and Australian goods were admitted on the same basis as goods imported from countries outside of the Empire? The honourable, member has spoken of the fact that some of the Fijian bananas are grown by Chinese and Indians. It is quite hopeless for Australia to expect always to sell and never to buy. The people of this country would hardly 'be able to exist to-day if it were Queensland. not for the purchase of Australian wool, wheat, flour, and minerals in the East by Chinese and Japanese. Apart altogether from the question of what we can afford, it ill becomes us to speak in detralia for a remarkably high stanrogatory terms of people who are now important and, indeed, vital buyers of our goods. For confirmation of my statement that without our Eastern trade we could hardly exist, it is only necessary to consult any man who knows anything about the Eastern trade in wheat and flour alone. should remember, too, what our eastern were sold at astounding prices. It is .trade in minerals means to us. result of the Ottawa agreement has been small quantity of them is probably the. that some nineteen countries have sought best thing that ever happened to the trade agreements with Great Britain.

It is quite impossible for us to organize our tariff on the assumption that we are to sell to everybody, but to buy from nobody. One must have a certain sense of proportion in relation to these matters. When one realizes that the quantity of bananas to be admitted from F i j i in an average season is less than 3 per cent, of Australia's total production, one sees at once that the ordinary seasonal variations of production often exceed that proportion. In fact, I am informed by. my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, who has the precise figures, that, as it happens, the price of Australian bananas has several times increased since Fijian bananas have heen admitted into Australia.

I have seldom seen a more misguided and unfortunate effort at publicity than that made by the Committee of Fruit Direction in The methods which it adopted gave the greatest. publicity to Fijian bananas that could possibly have been desired by the Fijian growers, and also prepared the public of Ausdard of quality in the Fijian bananas. There are other ways of promoting the interests of the. growers of bananas in Queensland and in northern New South Wales, and I .am glad to say that other and wiser methods are now being followed, to that end; but the attempted boycott of Fijian bananas .aroused the resentment' of a large section of the Australian people.

Since the importation of bananas from F i j i has been permitted, I have had the pleasure, through the courtesy of the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Francis), of sampling a few Queensland bananas that he sent to me, and I am glad to be able to say that they are of as fine a quality as any -bananas that I have eaten in any part of the world. It is pleasing to note that the growers have been stimulated to greater energy and efficiency in their own industry. I believe that this admission of F i j i a n hananas, apart from its important hearing on the Ottawa agreement-becaus e if this duty disappears the Ottawa agreement goes-wil l be of the greatest value to the banana industry of Australia, and I am sure that, at no distant date, that opinion w ill be shared by the banana growers themselves. I have no hesitation in asking the committee to accept the Government's proposal. Pursuing the argument advanced by the land Producer, in a review of the banana Attorney-General( Mr Latham) that market in Melbourne on the 10th March, the importation of bananas from F i j i has says-resulted in an improvement in the quality and price of the Queensland bananas, the early part of the week and prices receded will the Minister. say that if we again about Is. per case.

The Minister argued that' from F i j i that week. this importation of bananas was necessary in accordance with the Ottawa agreement, and he attempted to establish his case by referring to the importance of Australia's trade with eastern' countries such as China and Japan. But This fruit arrived in good green condition the Ottawa agreement has nothing to do and sold at prices ranging from 21s. to 25s. with foreign countries, and, therefore, per case. Naturally the effect on the market our trade with the East is of no conwas not good, as it has undoubtedly displaced cern in dealing with the position of the The price paid for Fiji was ridiculously high, banana industry of Australia. The growers will lose, on a conservative needed the estimate, £50,000 a year, as the result of the importation of 40,000 centals a year from F i j i . That is a f a i r l y big loss, considering that 30 per cent, of our people are on the dole, and that the Governments of Queensland and New South Wales, in order to relieve unemployment, are sending married folk out to grow morebananas. When our soldiers returned from the war they were given preference in the allotment of banana lands; but we find that, under the Ottawa agreement, a preference has been given to F i j i a n natives and Indian coolies, which moans a loss to the Australian banana growers of £50,000 a year. The Attorney General's statement that the price of bananas to the Australian growers has increased since importations from F i j i have been permitted is not based on'facts. The price has not improved; it has fallen. The Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Francis) may pick out a certain class of banana, such as that given to his friend the Attorney-General, and assure h i m that the price has increased; but that is a very different thing from a general increase of prices for all classes of bananas.

233,Mr Riordan,"The Minister is i nin view of the quality of the Queensland and New South Wales bananas on tbe market, and it is doubtful whether retailers will make a great deal of profit on it. That report was made, not by tlie Committee of Fruit Direction in Queensland, but by the organ of the primary producers of Queensland, and I believe that it is unbiased. however, that my complaint of a few weeks ago that Queensland had received a raw deal from the Australian representatives at Ottawa and also from this Government, was amply justified. It appears that when there are Ministers in the Cabinet who are willing to make a stand in the interests of the State they represent, the State concerned gets a fair deal. I remind honourable members that the hop industry of Tasmania has been treated very differently from the banana industry of Queensland. A proclamation was issued by the Government on the 12th May, 1932, prohibiting the importation of hops into Australia on the ground that it -might lead to ""downy mildew ""attacking the Australian hops. orable member that I have already ruled that an embargo on imports issued by the Minister for Health cannot be discussed under the tariff. incident to show that when Ministers are prepared to make a stand in the Cabinet in the interests of the industries of their State, they can do effective work. There is no justification for differentiating between one State and another. When the banana industry was being discussed in this chamber some time ago, we were informed by the Government that the Fijian bananas which came into Australia would be marketed only in Sydney and MelbourneI do not know why those two cities were selected-ye t part of the second shipment was dumped in Queensland. Defence was in Queensland at the time. I do not desire to make a personal attack upon him, but the honourable gentleman said on that occasion, "" I will see that no more bananas come into Queensland "". bananas went to Queensland? does it affect my argument. The point assure honourable members that I am not is that the Fijian bananas went to Queensland' despite the assurance of the Cabinet to the contrary. What power has the Assistant Minister to control the marketing of these bananas after they have been landed? If I go to New South Wales from Queensland and buy a whole shipment of Fijian bananas, I have yet to learn that I can It goes to show, be prevented from marketing them in Queensland or anywhere else. I understand that there must be no restriction of trade between States. Yet the Assistant Minister said that he could prevent imported bananas from entering Queensland. ber desirous that they should go to Queensland ? the 'Assistant Minister should discuss this subject with the Queensland banana growers, and not endeavour to mislead them as to his power under the Constitution. A hearty welcome is awaiting him in Queensland from those who wish to discuss with him two slippery subjects, namely, butter and bananas. While the Acting Leader of the House( Mr Latham) was speaking this evening, an honourable member interjected that our banana-growers should be taught a lesson. I should like to see that gentleman on a banana farm. How would he feel if, on the promise of the Government that the banana industry would be protected, he had taken his wife and family into the banana country and had done ten years' pioneering work of the most arduous nature, only to find at the end of the time that the protection of 8s. 4d. which had been granted him had been reduced by 6s., and that he was being left to the mercy of Indian coolies and Fijian natives? The Acting Leader of the House said that the Government's policy would result in an increase of the The Assistant Minister for price paid for bananas. I should like him to discuss that subject with Mr Ranger, of the Queensland fruit-marketing organization, and Mr Anthony, the president of the New South Wales. Banana-growers Association.

239,Mr Riordan,"I am desirous thatparticipating in this discussion because I hope to catch a few votes. people who, in my electorate, live so far away from the banana-growing districts that they would hardly know a banana if they saw one. Dr. Vickers, of the Australian Inland Mission, told us this morning that many people in this great continent never see fresh fruit. I have no desire to curry political favour with any section of the people. I am discussing this subject because I believe that it is better for us to protect the banana industry than to pay doles to the unemployed. The banana industry could absorb a good many of the unemployed if it were adequately protected. Many Australian primary-producing industries have been adversely affected by the policy of this Government. I mention, in passing, the tobacco and cotton industries. If the Government would adequately protect these industries, we could profitably employ many additional people in them. The question has heen asked: What effect will the importation of 40,000 centals of bananas have on the Australian banana industry? reply is that it will mean a loss of £1,250 tain whether the British Government a week to it. I sincerely hope that the Assistant Minister for Defence will be able to exercise the same influence on the Cabinet in regard to the Queensland banana industry as some of his colleagues have exercised on it in regard hop industry. It is just as necessary to protect our banana industry from bunchytop as it is to protect our hop industry from downy mildew. What can be done by the Government for hops can also be done for bananas. [9.44] -My opposition to the importation of Fijian bananas, which come under this item, is on the ground that, the products of black people should not be allowed to come into competition with the products of white people who live on small and closelysettled areas in Australia. really the essence of the opposition to the Government's proposal, when the Ottawa agreement was under consideration, that 40,000 centals of Fijian bananas should be admitted to Australia annually. The Acting Leader of the House( Mr ducts. 1 refer to pineapples, rum and Latham) said this evening that There are it was necessary to pass this item in order to give effect to the Ottawa agreement. That is quite true. But why was that provision included in the Ottawa agreement in the first place? Many representations were made to the Government on behalf of the banana-growers of Australia against its inclusion. The Acting Leader of the House has also told us that, in order to engage in reciprocal trade with the East and the islands of. the Pacific, it is essential that there should be trade both ways. If it were absolutely necessary for the Government to concede this concession to F i j i , and if it is unreasonable for me to object to such action, why did the Cabinet, when the banana-growers of Queensland, the Committee of Fruit Direction in Queensland, and honourable members representing Queensland constituetjcies, approached the Minister and expressed their opposition to the granting of this concession, immediately communicate with the Resident Minister in LonMy don ( Mr Bruce), asking him to ascerwould agree to some other concession being made. Although the British Government would not agree to an alteration of the agreement, nevertheless, the action of this Government showed that there was some justification to the Tasmanian for the request of the banana growers. I admit that it is necessary that we should enter into trade agreements with countries that will trade with us, but when we trade with blacklabour countries, surely we can take from them commodities which are not produced in Australia. ties could we take? spices and other products which are grown in the islands. The objection raised by the Queensland growers to the concession given to F i j i was timely, and no doubt will be taken into consideration That was when the Government is receiving delegations from, black-labour countries which wish to enter into trade agreements with us. It is unfortunate that the concessions which were made under the Ottawa agreement affected only Queensland pro-",53,Division 1 Ale Spirits And Strated That The Agreement Is A Washout

Australia for a large increase of the consumption of bananas? deavour is being made to popularize the consumption of bananas in Australia. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth Government has agreed to spend portion of the duties collected on Fijian bananas in conducting a campaign to increase the consumption of bananas in Australia. I sincerely hope that that campaign will be successful. member for Kooyong( Mr Latham) said that because of the introduction of Fijian bananas the Australian industry had been stimulated and better bananas were now being placed on the market. It is ' admitted that the Australian bananas are better to-day than they were six months ago, but surely no honourable member would be foolish enough to imagine that six months ago the banana producer was burying his good fruit and marketing his inferior product. About SO per cent of the bananas sold in the Sydney market are grown in New South Wales. Six months ago many of the young plantations were producing their first crop, and, therefore, the bananas were of inferior quality, but todespatched to Melbourne, and only day excellent bananas from Coff's Harbour and the Tweed are being sold in Sydney. The right honourable gentleman also said that the introduction of Fijian bananas had brought about greater efficiency in the Australian industry, and market in one month nearly 30,000 cases that better ripening systems and transport facilities had been provided. Let me inform him that there has been no alteration in respect of the efficiency of the Queensland industry. Queensland growers sent experts all over the world in order to perfect the system under which they were operating. That system has for some time been 100 per cent, efficient. The New South Wales growers do not operate under the same system. The largest market for Queensland bananas is Melbourne. The Queensland banana organization has established a scientific ripening process in Sydney; but for some time, because of the opposition of the marketing authorities of Melbourne, it has been unable to establish a similar process in that city. It is only now, with the introduction of black-grown bananas, that the importers are prepared to allow this ripening process to be established in Melbourne. The concession to F i j i has been embodied in the Ottawa agreement, and will, no doubt, be agreed to by this Parliament, but the Queensland growers have justification for their opposition to the granting of it. It is not likely that Australian workmen would agree to allow 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, of the workmen of this country to be imported from F i j i The right honourable or some other black-labour country. I hope that the Government will profit by its experience, and that, when future negotiations are taking place for trade agreements with black-labour countries, it will encourage only the importation of commodities which are not produced in Australia. to support the item before the committee. One would imagine -from the remarks of some honourable members that the sales of Australian bananas had ceased altogether. I have information to the effect that, from the 1st to the 25th February, 23,561 cases of Queensland bananas were 4,051 cases to Sydney. It is idle to contend that the importation of 1,000 cases of Fijian bananas a week is likely to interfere with the Queensland growers, who have placed on the local of bananas. The sooner the growers cease their objections to the importation of 40,000 cases of Fijian bananas per annum into Australia the hetter it will be for The them. The treatment that Queensland has meted out to the southern States has been anything but of a friendly character. At a recent conference which met to discuss the need to expand our trade with the East, I interviewed one of the leading millers of New South Wales, who said that the granting of freight rebates to the millers of Queensland had stopped the carriage of flour from New South Wales to that State. Yet the Queensland producers are complaining to the southern States that they are being dealt with unfairly. The",54,Division 1 Ale Spirits And Strated That The Agreement Is A Washout

Recently, Sir George Julius, Chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, stated that, of the £5,000 to be provided by the Government for the banana industry-£2,00 0 for experiments in cultivation, and £3,000 for publicitya sum of £3,000 was to be made available immediately. Is it not extraordinary that an industry that has been in existence for 50 years should now require government aid in the marketing of its product? Instead of making this provision for the Queensland banana-growers, the Government should have disti'ibuted the money among unemployed returned soldiers who are in occupation of war service homes. It is absurd for Queensland members to suggest that the introduction of such a small quota of Pijiau bananas will destroy the equilibrium of the Australian banana industry. I speak feelingly on the matter, because I consider that the interests of Queensland have, for some years, been receiving too much consideration at the hands of the Commonwealth. Concessions have imposed a heavy burden on people living in the southern States. Nearly all the industries of Queensland are supported by embargoes which prevent competition from the outside world, and, as a consequence, people living in the southern States have to pay increased prices for sugar, and nearly every other commodity produced in Queensland.

The observation* of the honourable member on this subject do not represent the true position. He also said that most Queensland industries are helped by embargoes. Probably he has been reading the Daily Standard, of Brisbane, which, a few days ago, stated that a Labour government had imposed an embargo on imported bananas, which a Nationalist government, supported by the Country party, had removed. There never has been an embargo on bananas from abroad, and cousequently no government, Nationalist or other, could have removed it. A duty of 8s. 4d. per central was imposed on imported bananas, when the present Assistant Treasurer, Senator Greene, was Minister for Trade and Customs in the Hughes Government.

That honourable gentleman was attacked to-night by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) ; but few honourable members of this Parliament have done so much as he to help the banana industry.

256,Mr Francis,"When the importaotlier Queeiisland members, who to-night have professed to . champion cause of the growers, have done nothing. The importation of 40,000 centals of Fijian bananas in accordance with the Ottawa agreement was approved by this Parliament only recently; and as the personnel of the House has not been changed since that date, the former decision will certainly be re-affirmed. In the consideration of this tariff schedule those who supported the Ottawa agreement when the bill for its ratification was before the House have consistently voted for the duties imposed in accordance with it, and the discussion initiated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to-night can serve no useful purpose. Certain honourable members may be endeavouring to make a little political capital out of the the recommendations of an organization subject, but they will render no service to the banana industry, which should be our only consideration. Throughout the discussion on this matter those honourable gentlemen have endeavoured to create in the hearts of the growers ill feeling and hatred; they have not made one constructive suggestion or one helpful proposal. Instead of striving to assist the industry, they have by their speeches in the country and in this -chamber done much unnecessarily to depress the growers. On the other hand, the Government policy has been constructive and helpful. I was not prepared to disclose Cabinet secrets; but the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has been generous enough to do so by stating publicly that in CabinetI resisted strenuously the proposed admissiou of Fijian bananas at a reduced rate of duty. demn those who oppose the proposal in this* chamber? demned those who opposed the Ottawa agreement; but I do condemn them for reviving the banana issue to-night, when they know that there is no hope of the duty being altered, and that no advantage to the industry could result from their attitude. The Government has done everything possible to prevail on the British Government, to reconsider this arrangement, and I may claim, without egotism, that I have secured an undertaking that there will he no importation of Fijian bananas at the concession rate the in excess of 40,000 centals. To ease the market in Queensland, where the bulk of Australian bananas is produced, the 40,000 centals from F i j i are to be admitted in equal monthly instalments, equally, divided between the ports of Melbourne and Sydney. Moreover, the Government has made available a sum of £5,000 for the assistance of the local industry, because the market will to some extent be affected by the importations. The Government's sympathetic attitude is illustrated by the fact that, although to the 16th March only £700 had been collected in duty, £3,000 of the £5,000, which is the amount of duty estimated to be collected on. 40,000 centals, was made available at once for expenditure in accordance with brought into being on my suggestion. The provision of this £3,000 is an advance against the amount of £5,000 to be made available to assist the industry. I have already made clear the circumstances under which the £5,000 is to be made available to the Banana Industry Committee. This committee which is composed of the Hon. John Gunn, Director of Development; Sir George Julius, chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research; Dr. Rivett, and two representatives each from Queensland and New South Wales, one nominated by the growers and one by the Government in each State, has already been considering how the Commonwealth grant can be most advantageously expended in the interests of the industry. So successful have its efforts been that Mr Anthony, president of the New South Wales banana-growers, has intimated to the Director of Development that he is prepared to recommend to the growers in his State a levy of a certain amount per case to provide a fund for the continuation of the good work which the committee has initiated. To the scientific work, including transport, packing, maturation, and diseases of handling and transport, £1,450 of the £5,000 has been allocated. Transport has heen always one of the major problems of the industry, and has seriously affected the marketing of the fruit in good condition.

Posters will he prepared at an estimated cost of £400, and poster boards will be hired in all the important cities on the eastern coast, and possibly also in South Australia, in. order to call the attention of the public to the merits of the Australian bananas.

I feel sure that, as a result of the special efforts that have assistance in the campaign for the eradibeen made to improve the ripening of the fruit, which has always been a problem, Australian bananas will, in future, be infinitely better than in,the past. I am informed that, as the result of the installation in Brisbane and Sydney of ripening plants, designed by the officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the sales of fruit have materially increased in those centres. Mr ber for Lilley and myself in Queensland, Ranger, of the Committee of Fruit Direction in Queensland, has informed me that the sales have increased in Brisbane by 1,000 cases a week. was introduced long before the committee was appointed. problem in Victoria is different. There we have met with opposition from the Melbourne City Council, which has objected to the establishment of ripening chambers in the city markets. The committee is now making special representations to the Lord Mayor, and I have made authority for that assertion? personal representations to him. As a result, we hope that' he will be made to is my authority, and he is one of the very appreciate the needs of the industry, and few men who really know anything about that facilities will be provided for carrying on the work of the committee in his city so as to ensure that the consumer in Victoria will he able to obtain properly ripened fruit, and that our sales in that State will be improved. I believe that much of the misunderstanding in Melbourne is due to the propaganda which was carried on by certain interests prior to the importation of Fijian bananas. The honourable member for Kennedy mentioned bunchy top. I admit that this disease has proved difficult to handle. Fiji. importation of plants from F i j i several years ago was first responsible for tlie establishment of the disease in this country. The honourable member for Lilley and I , together with the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) made representations to the then Government, I think, in 1923, with a view to having measures taken to combat the disease. . We interviewed Sir Austin Chapman, who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, and invited his cation of bunchy top. As the result of our representations a sum of £5,000""was made available for carrying out investigations, on condition that the Queensland and New South Wales Governments each made available £2,500 for the same purpose. On the representations of the honourable member for Richmond in New South Wales, and of the honourable memthis proposal was agreed to. The sum of £10,000 was devoted to research work in which Professor Goddard and a young scientist named McGee collaborated. As the result of this research work, the disease was practically eradicated, although I am sorry to say, that there has recently been a recurrence of it in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. There is no justification, however, for saying that this is in any way due to 'the importation of bananas from F i j i .",58,Division 1 Ale Spirits And Strated That The Agreement Is A Washout

266,Mr Francis,"Professo r Goddardthe disease. owes much to his wonderful work and that of his assistant in connection with the bunchy top investigation. He has assured me, both in correspondence and verbally, that there is no chance of the disease being brought to this country in fruit. Sufficient has been said to make it clear that the Government has done a great deal to help the banana-growing industry, which, I admit, has had to bear some of the disadvantages incidental to the Ottawa agreement. As the honourable member for Capricornia has chosen to read certain paragraphs from the Courier newspaper, I shall conclude my remarks by also reading an extract from a sub-leade in that journal. In the issue dated the 11th November, 1932, the following appears:Undoubtedly Mr Jos. Francis (Assistant Minister for Defence), who returned to Brisbane on Wednesday to open the "" Queenslandmade Exhibition"", has done everything he could possibly do to assist the banana-growers; when the protection was lifted from the and it is satisfactory to know, that he has been able to obtain such a definite understanding as that in no circumstances will the Fijian supply of bananas be increased. . . . The understanding mentioned by Mr Francis should go far towards allaying that fear. Growers will bo grateful to him for what he has done. . . . This important industry should now be allowed to expand, as it may well do with the, assistance it is receiving from the Government, and honourable members should refrain from inflaming the minds of the growers or filling them with false ideas. I regret that the debate has taken its present trend, and I trust that in this committee we have now heard the last, of bananas. If the industry avails itself of the assistance offered, it should enjoy even greater prosperity than has hitherto heen its lot. The Assistant Minister( Mr Francis) tried to convey the impression that I had made a statement that Fijian bananas were responsible for the introduction of bunchy top into New South Wales. I said nothing of the kind. I said that the industry had been subjected to the danger of disease, owing to the introduction of fruit from F i j i , and I went on to say that the Government might have given the same consideration to the banana industry as was given to the hop industry. This important industry A miracle has happened during the last four or five months; according to the Government and its supporters there has been a marvellous improvement in the quality of Australian bananas. This improvement has staggered, not only members of this committee, but even the growers themselves. We have been told that the admission of 40,000 centals from F i j i is a mere nothing, hut I remind honourable members that a little crack in the wall of a dam, if left long enough, will eventually destroy the dam. The Assistant Minister claimed to have dismissed the matter with Professor Goddard, with a view to protecting the industry, before Fijian bananas were admitted to Australia. How is it, then, that no man in Australia was more surprised than Professor Goddard when the terms of the Ottawa agreement in regard to bananas were made known? I cannot do better than quote Professor Goddard himself, in a statement that he made Australian industry. The following appeared in the Brisbane Courier of the 4th October, 1932 :It is very difficult to make any definite statement on this matter until one hears the reasons advanced for the decision, which, I must admit, comes as a very great surprise,"" commented Professor E. J. Goddard, when told of the Federal Government's decision yesterday. If Professor Goddard's statement is correct, that of the Assistant Minister must be contrary to fact, and the interview to which he referred must have taken place only recently. The report goes on to stateI t is well known that for many years past, and until recently, there has been a certain section in the south clamouring for the admission of Fiji bananas. But the wonderful improvement in the quality of the fruit from New South Wales and Queensland in recent years, and the great advance made in connection with transport and ripening, appear, within recent years, to have considerably won favour for the Australian product. One had come to consider that the great extensions in banana planting, notably in the Tweed River area of New South Wales, and in south-eastern Queensland, would be rewarded by an increasing amount of popularity for a product locally grown, and more efficiently handled. Many growers have been fearing for some time past that there will be over-production, and if their fears are realized then the problem will become a mostserious one with the admission of Fiji bananas on terms that",59,Division 1 Ale Spirits And Strated That The Agreement Is A Washout
267,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [10.28],"will enable that product, grown under nativelabour conditions, to compete with the Australian product on terms disadvantageous to the latter. The action taken in connection with bananas, continued Professor Goddard, whatever may he the actual reasons-and I await the learning of such-wil l surely be accompanied by «uher changes insofar as imports are concerned. In short, this action is only comprehensible to me on the assumption that, within the next 24 hours we will learn of fundamental changes in the whole outlook of Australia in respect of imports. For one can hardly imagine that a local primary industry will be singled out for special disadvantageous treatment at this stage. The Assistant Minister also claimed to have received the plaudits of the banana growers for the action that he had taken on hehalf of the industry. that the 6,000 banana-growers from the Tweed River district and the southern portion of Queensland, who met in the Town Hall, Brisbane, did not sing the Government's held at Coolangatta, orable growers against the removal of the duty and severely criticized the Assistant Wires inviting co-operation were sent by that meeting to every Federal and Country party member in Queensland, including the Assistant the honourable member for Lilley Mackay), Maranoa( Mr Hunter), able member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) ; but, according to the information that we have, only the last-named member replied to the communication and offered his support. The question was asked, "" What has become of our member?"" to which the reply was, "" We shall find him on next polling day"". gentleman to-night that he was applauded for the manner in which he had supported the local industry, quote from a newspaper supposedly congratulatory had taken in the interests of the bananagrower. member for Barton asserted that the decision to .make a grant of £5,000 to the banana was reached long before the agreement chamber. Mr Riordan. not do himself justice, because the £5,000 made available for research, advertising, fertilizing, and other purposes, was to come out of the duty received on the importation of F i j i a n bananas, and so f a r only £2,000 of that amount has been handed over to the Banana Committee. that it comes out of the duty which is paid on imports of F i j i a n bananas. How, then, can the honourable gentleman claim to have prevailed on the Cabinet to make this'sum available prior to the admission of F i j i a n bananas? He has' recounted what he and the honourable I remind him member for Lilley have done for the grower. I hope that they do no more, because all that they have so far done has been to rob him of £50,000 a year. That loss has to praises. At a meeting be borne by 6,000 persons, who in the honwill not be helped very considerably by gentleman's electorate, the the granting of £3,000 a year for adverentered a vigorous protest tising purposes. Had Australian growers been left with the protection previously Minister. afforded them, their position would be much more favorable. Professor Goddard Nationalist has declared that the Australian banana industry is in every way efficient, and Minister, it may safely be taken for granted that ( Mr at least 90 per cent, of the growers desire the honourable member for to produce economically and efficiently, and the honorand to market their product to the advantage of themselves and the consumers.

Some, honourable members opposite have exhibited the worse possible' taste, although, after all, the subject-matter under consideration is of comparatively small importance. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) described the Ottawa agreement as one of the blackest patches in Australian or Empire history. Honourable members opposite who say "" Hear, hear "" are -expressing, not their opposition to the Ottawa agreement, hut their anti-British sentiments. interest them to know that in 1930 Australia exported to F i j i goods to the value of £449,845,. and in return bought from F i j i goods valued at £23,751. following year the figures were respectively £372,284 and £16,264. In the light of those figures, what is a concession of even £50,000? It is not to be expected that we shall continue to get the trade of F i j i if in return we buy nothing from that possession. The inroad on the banana trade of Australia which this concession represents is merely 2.7 per cent, of the Australian production. What is that compared with the numerous benefits which the primary producers of this country, particularly Queensland, will derive from the Ottawa agreement? Every one realizes that in the early stages of the operation of that agreement tli'ere must be re-adjustments here and there. It has yet to be shown to what extent Australia is carrying out the agreement in relation to allowing British industries to compete in the Australian market. still further concessions? ana thinking only of the carrying out of what we have agreed to do. original thought .of the honorable gentle nian ? is a thought which would not occur to the honourable member. Honourable members interjecting, jections are permitted by the Chair; but noisy and irrelevant interjections must cease. protest emphatically against the unfair attack on the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Francis). No representative of Queensland has fought more disinterestedly, or more successfully, for the banana industry than has the Assistant Minister. The efforts of Opposition members do not amount to a tithe of what he has done. I am convinced that the reasonable people of Queensland -no t those who applaud the sentiments of the honourable member for KennedyI t may Assistant Minister has done on their behalf. One of the conditions upon which Great Britain granted us other substantial benefits is this concession on bananas In the in which the island of F i j i , by reason of the richness of its soil and the profusion of its production, will be a participant. I remind the committee that the British market is practically the only market in the world of any great value to us, and that Great Britain has stood by us in the past, and is standing by us now. I hope that the committee will pass the item. port the amendment. Honourable members on this side of the chamber have been charged with not having done what they could to assist the banana-growers of :l Australia. Their criticism has, however, been, so effective that three Ministers, led by the Acting Leader of the House( Mr Latham), have risen to defend the Government's action in this connection. The Postmaster-General( Mr Parkhill) gave expression to another of his original thoughts when he said that we on this side were fighting this item only because of our anti-British sentiments. SurelyI it is a peculiarly twisted form of reasoning to contend that, because we are patriotic enough to believe in our own another country, and to put Australia first, w.e are unpatriotic and anti-British.

286,Mr Baker (Oxley) [10.57],"I supson, one of the world's greatest thinkers, that "" Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel"". The Labour party believes that the banana-growers of Australia should be protected from the product of cheap labour in other countries. In a typical speech to-night, the Acting Leader of the House selected his own false premises, and then built plausible arguments on them. really made out a strong case against the Ottawa agreement. contended that we should not advocate protection with respect to our own goods, or even with respect to goods produced in countries within the British Commonwealth of Nations. should remember that we had to trade with Japan and China, and should not build up any tariff wall against the products of those countries. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) had merely pointed out that only a small percentage of the banana-growers of F i j i Prime Minister or the Attorney-General were white men, the great majority being Chinese, Indians and Fijians, and had argued that we should not prefer their goods to the products of our own country. But the Attorney-General( Mr that it was not the custom of the Latham) spoke as though the honourable member was opposed to Australian trade with China and J apan. It is now easy to understand why the Prime Minister said at a deputation in the Cabinet room, in answer to a question put by a representative of the banana-growers' organization, that the White Australia policy was intended not to protect Australian industries against the products of coloured labour overseas, but. to protect white labour against the products of coloured labour within Australia. Judging from the tenor of the speeches of some Ministers, they pretend to expect the grateful to them. Apparently those Ministers would have the people believe that they had assisted the industry by allowing £50,000 worth of bananas from overseas to take the place of our own products on the Australian market; hut that argument will not be convincing to the Australian growers who are sufferingas the result of the Government's action. The Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Francis')' spoke mainly about the sum of £5,000 which had been obtained for the banana-growers. The Government seems to consider that to be the strongest argument that can be advanced in its favour, despite the fact that it endeavoured to avoid carrying out its promise in that regard, and avoided answering questions about this matter until it was brought prominently before the He House. I raised the matter when speaking on the adjournment of the House, In effect, he and the Prime Minister then made a statement; but his reply was so unsatisfactory and ambiguous that the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Martens) inquired whether or not the He said that we Government intended to give the growers the £5,000. Eventually the promise was forced from the Government. was made long before that statement. answer my repeated questions about the £5,000? I asked whether the matter had been decided, and the answer of the Prime Minister was Government to state matters of policy in reply to questions. Credit has also been given to the Assistant Minister for Defence for the great fight he is supposed to have putup on behalf of the banana-growers. From whatever angle we may view this matter, no credit can possibly redound to this Government. In the first place, we have no proof whatever that the Assistant Minister has done anything on behalf of the growers, though he said to-night that the Prime Minister had given away a Cabinet secret in saying that*-behad put up a great fight. member is digressing from the question before the committee. that the Assistant Minister did all these things, he was fighting against his own Cabinet, and, therefore, the Cabinet itself stands condemned for its anti-Australian action.

293,"Scholfield, T. H. "". Mr George Lawson (Brisbane)","for Oxley has now received a reply from the Prime Minister in similar terms to one which I received in February last, which was that the Government had decided that pensioners who surrendered their pensions prior to the 31st December, 1932, would not be called upon to pay back moneys received up to that date. Quite a number of pensioners were misled by certain press statements to the effect that the Government had given pensioners until the 31st December to surrender their pensions or otherwise, and at the same time it was pointed out that tbe pensioners would receive certain forms on or before the last pension payday in December. A number of pensioners did not receive those forms until the first pension pay-day in January, and immediately they received them they decided to surrender their pensions. Upon notifying the department to that effect, they as they had not surrendered their pensions on or before the 31st December, they would have to repay the money that they had .received in pensions as from the 12th October, otherwise the Government would take a lien over their homes to the extent of the money owing. That decision of the Government is unjust to the unfortunate pensioners concerned. I understand that the act is to be amended to enable the date of surrender to be extended to the 3'J.st December, and when the act is .being amended I hope that consideration will be given to these unfortunate pensioners who, through no fault of their own, but through ignorance of the law, are now being called upon to repay the amount of pension received from the 12th October, to avoid the Government taking a lien over their property. If the Government cannot extend the time of surrender, say, to April next, I suggest as an alternative that it asks these pensioners to repay"" the amount of pension as from the 31st December instead of from the 12 th October. to refer to a matter concerning which I must be taken into account when deterhave written to the Prime Minister( Mr mining the eligibility of a person to Lyons), and have not received a reply. receive a pension in excess of 15s. per I questioned him about it yesterday, and week.

I asked that in if any, of the amount paid by the children connection with the charge Upon the estate of a deceased pensioner, the same privilege be extended to the widow or beneficiary under the will of a pensioner who died between the 12th October and the 31st Dec-ember, as was extended to the pensioner himself of drawing the pension up to the 31st December. Four pensioners have recently died in my constituency, and claims have been made upon their estates ranging from 35s. to £7. In one case, the claim is for £3 10s., and the department has asked the widow to make this payment within 30 days. Form 47, which has been sent to the widow, states that this action has been taken in conformity with section 52E of the act. The widow is afraid that she will be taken before the court and an order made for the disposal of her property. One can quite understand the received word that, frame of mind of these people. Attention called to the state of the House. The bells having been rung and a quorum not being present, Mr Speaker adjourned the House at 11.30 p.m. The .following answers to questions were circulated:noticeUpon what basis docs the Pensions Department determine profit made arising out of board received from tlic children and counted as income when assessing the rate of pension received by the parents?
