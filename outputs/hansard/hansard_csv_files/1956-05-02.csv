As far as the date of commencement of inoculations is concerned, I sbould like to make it clear that, so far, the Commonwealth has made no announcement of any fixed date. I have read some preliminary announcements made by other authorities about the date on which campaigns may start, but it should be underbe brought to their notice and whioh may stood that those are not the result of Commonwealth decisions. The fact is that no vaccine will be liberated from the complaint has come directly to me. Commonwealth Serum Laboratories until all the safety tests have been completed. Those tests are now going on and are being duplicated by the Fairfield hospital.

I hope to be able to announce later the precise date on which all preparations will be completed and the vaccine will be ready to be issued for mass inoculations.

In order that these appalling circumstances can be remedied, will the Minister assure me of an early investigation of the matter? mated in reply to a question yesterday covering the same subject matter, I have had no complaints myself of the kind suggested by the honourable gentleman. If he has any specific directed to any aspect of hostel life I should be glad if he will bring it to my notice. I have said in this place more than once that hostel life can never be equivalent to life in one's own home. But the hostels have provided a most useful transition stage for many thousands of immigrants who otherwise would not have been able to come to this country and take advantage of the opportunities by which most of them have been able to profit. Generally speaking, I believe that the hostels are well conducted and of good standard. The hostels' management and administration are only too willing, at any time, to look at any instance which may appear to call for improvement. I repeat that, so far, in recent months no sucb External Affairs any further information to give on the subject of the appointment tbe Malayan Constitutional Commission ?

There will be individuals on the commission who are constitutional lawyers in higb degree, maybe to an extent to which Sir William McKell would not claim. But Sir William McKell, in addition to being a lawyer of distinction, has had rich experience of the day to clay and year to year working of a modern federal system at close quarters over a period of years. As to the terms of reference of the Malayan Constitutional Commission, I have them available.

If the visit constitutes a risk, is the issue of passledge of any specific investigation into ports justified ? course, no iron curtain around Australia should know that general investigations in relation to tourists or other visitors, of the kind are constantly being made except in cases where compelling reasons by the Minister for Social Services and of security would warrant the exclusion of persons who wished to visit this country. In borderline cases it is the practice of my department to consult relevant authorities such as the Department of External Affairs, the security service and any other department which might be involved. In certain cases the question comes to Cabinet for consideration. That was done in this particular case. The visits iu question have no official basis insofar as this Government is concerned. They have resulted from invitations extended by unions which have previously sent visitors to the countries concerned. After examining all the circumstances, we decided to issue vises for a limited period of approximately one month for. I think in each delegation, three unionists accompanied by one interpreter. As the honourable gentleman will have noticed, the people of Great Britain have in quite recent times been able to digest without apparent discomfort an official visit by three very senior members of tbe Soviet Government, and I am quite certain that the democracy of Australia will be able to digest without any great discomfort an unofficial visit by half a dozen trade unionists from Communist countries. After all, it is not only a matter of the visitors teaching us something about the way of life in their country.

These reports are not very new. When I was in South and South-East Asia a relatively short time ago I heard of them and took the opportunity to discuss them in the highest quarters in Pakistan. I can say that I would believe it to be completely impossible in any circumstances for tension between India and Pakistan to develop to tbe extent where there might be open friction and hostilities. I would believe that in no responsible quarter, in either of -these countries, that I have tapped-and I have discussed this matter with a number of people-is it really envisaged that there could be active warfare between the two countries. I would believe that it is nothing less than internationally mischievous for stories of this nature to be put about. In using the word ""mischievous "" in this context I am not by any means referring to the honourable gentleman who has asked the question, nor to the Australian newspapers which published the report. I believe that it would be quite inconceivable that such active strife between these two countries should come about. TALL Y CLERKS' AWARD. preface to a question that I direct to thc Minister for Labour and National ServiceI remind the Minister that in January of this year a conciliation commissioner awarded an increase of 9d. an hour to casual tally clerks. The shipowners sought leave to appeal against that' of all the safety tests of the vaccine now award, and on the 20th February a judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration granted the leave sought. As yet, however, tbe court has not set down a date for the hearing, of the appeal. In view of the delay that hasoccurred since the handing, down of the award in January, and the fact that tally clerks are now threatening to ceasework because of the tardiness of the court in concluding this matter or even in. fixing a date for the hearing of the appeal, will the Minister now say what action he intends to take, or can take, to have the matter hurried up? whether I can ascertain what the intention of the judge in this particular matter is, and convey that information to the honourable gentleman. Minister for Health is supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Wimmera. Can the Minister inform the House whether there is any justification for a statement made recently by the Minister of Health in Queensland, that Salk anti-poliomyelitis vaccine will shortly be available in that State! Has the Commonwealth approved a definitedate on and after which the vaccine will be available for use in the States, or was the statement made by the Queensland Minister of Health intended to produce an. electoral benefit for the present Queensland Government in the forthcoming State general election? Does the Queensland Government accept responsibility for the preparation of the vaccine, or is that completely an activity of the Commonwealth in the interests of the health of the Australian people ? facts are that the Commonwealth is the only authority responsible for the preparation and the making available of the Salk vaccine, and that the Government has not yet announced any date on which the vaccine will be available. Preparations are going forward quite satisfactorily, and when the vaccine is being produced in quantities sufficient to provide the States with adequate supplies to enable them to commence their inoculation campaigns-whic h depends on the completion going on-a n announcement will be made as to the date on which the vaccine will be available to the States.

31,Mr James,"B y a strange coinciThe honourable gentleman must ask his question. MrJ AMES -We can regard that as a preface to the question. Is the Minister for Labour and National Service aware that there is grave discontent on the coal-fields of New South Wales due to the fact that Mr Justice Gallagher has issued an award which gives the rigbt to work a second shift at Elrington colliery? The second shift caused grave discontent when I was a coal-miner. We struck for fifteen months to secure the abolition of the second shift, but now Mr Justice Gallagher has re-instituted it. We do not want to resurrect the circumstances that led to a grave fight which lasted for fifteen months, but, as employees in other mines are going on strike because of the effect of this award, I am quite certain that Mr JusticeI ask the Minister whether it is possible for the award to be suspended or for negotiations to be entered into with Mr and I cannot imagine that he would Justice Gallagher. I know that Mr have made an award in the terms Justice Gallagher was appointed by a Labour governnient, but the only time The honourable member is giving a lot of information. Will he ask his question? Opposition members interjecting, Honourable members will remain quiet, and the honourable member for Hunter will ask his question. which coal-miners have consented to work the second shift have been in relation to developmental work. honourable member now ask his question? posed to extract pillars on the second shift at the Elrington colliery. sympathetic consideration will be given to tliose persons who endanger their lives in the extraction of pillars on the second shift. able member pointed out in putting his question, Mr Justice Gallagher was appointed to his responsible position by a former Labour government, and he has enjoyed the confidence of this Government and the Labour Government of ew South Wales. He constitutes the Coal Industry Tribunal, which is appointed jointly by the Australian Government and the Labour Government of New South Wales. I believe that it is fair to say that he has enjoyed the confidence, not only of governments, but also of all sections of the coal industry. He is a man of great experience and knowledge of the industry. I do not profess to be competent to discuss the award that he has made, but my understanding of it is that it gives a very limited right to work a second shift in this particular colliery, and then only in portion of it. I may be mistaken about the facts, but that is my understanding of the award. Gallagher is very well aware of the long history of controversy on this matter, indicated by the honourable gentleman without being fully aware of tbe implications of his decision and without having convinced himself of the necessity for such an order to be made. I put it quite directly to the honourable member, whose interest in this industry throughout his long representation in the Parliament is well recognized, that, if there is to be any security and any continuing prospect of prosperity and regular employment iii this industry, the miners' federation must put its old prejudices behind it and look realistically and sensibly at the problems associated with individual mines as they arise. I feel that such a spirit was more evident at the conference that was held in Sydney last Thursday than it had ever been before. I regarded that as being a healthy sign, and I hope that all conit is procerned will face up to this issue in a sensible and co-operative way and not involve members of the miners' federaI ask, therefore, whether tion in another futile, stupid and wasteful stoppage. tion to the Prime Minister.

It refers to a promise made by the Prime Minister in, I think, more than one policy speech, that an all-party constitutional committee would be appointed. Can tbe right honourable gentleman give the House any assurance that that committee will be appointed before the House rises at the end of this sessional period? honourable member that assurance.

It has been under consideration for some time, and, as from yesterday, the lst May, in association with the Postmaster-General, I have established in Canberra a new facility for dealing with mail matter which may contain dutiable goods addressed to residents of the Australian Capital Territory. Under the former procedure, all mail matter addressed to residents of the Territory, which needed attention from the point of view of the assessment of duty, had to be dealt with at the parcels post office in Sydney, with the result that there was inevitable delay and inconvenience to residents of the Australian Capital Territory. I hope that the new facility will prove useful, especially to the growing business community in Can1 berra, because it will enable imported goods to be dealt with directly in Canberra, without being delayed at all in Sydney. inform the House whether this Government has made available, in conjunction with the Queensland Government, a sum of money for the alleviation of the distress and loss that occurred because of the recent cyclones in north Queensland? If such a sum has been made available, can the right honourable gentleman tell the House the amount of it? Has the Treasurer considered my request that special consideration should be given to losses suffered by ex-servicemen settlers in the Abergowrie area? the latter part of the question first, I repeat what I said previously in reply to a question asked by the honourable member, that the matter of compensation for losses suffered because of cyclones, floods or other acts of God is entirely the responsibility of the State Government concerned. Any representations made by a State Government to this Government on a Â£l-for-Â£l basis have received due consideration. national problem, but the States bave certain sovereign rights and responsibilities, and it is nearly time that the hono able member knew it. Witb regard tc the other part of the question, I do not know exactly what amount has been granted for the purposes indicated by the honourable member, but I do know that information was awaited as to an assessment of the loss and the extent to which the Queensland Government would contribute towards it, so that due consideration could be given to making a grant on a Â£l-for-Â£l basis.

To whom do people apply for these positions, and ean the Minister give details of the length of service, pay and any other qualifications necessary? the several results of the visit to the Middle East of Mr Dag Harnmarskjoeld, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, has been the proposal for the creation of about twenty additional posts to the United Nations Observer Corps on the borders of Israel and the surrounding Arab states. It is also true that Australia has been asked to provide four or five such officers. Three or four other countries have also been asked the same thing. The information that has 'been given to us is that omcers should be of about the rank of major. Speaking from memory, I believe the term of service will be until at least 31st October of this year. The remuneration is not in my mind, although we have it on paper. Officers, ' I understand, should not necessarily be members of the regular armed forces, but can be retired officers who could be re-engaged for the period of this new engagement. I understand that they need not necessarily be officers of the Army, but can be from any of the three fighting services. I may say that this is only in its international aspect, an affair concerning myself and the Department of External Affairs. It is really a matter for my friend and colleague, the Minister for Defence, and I think from him to the Minister for the Army. I have already had a very large number of applications, which, of course, I have passed straight on to the Minister for Defence, but I take this opportunity to say that it is no use addressing applications for these posts to me; they should -be addressed to the proper quarter, which is the Minister for Defence OT the Minister for the Army. Minister for Labour and National Service whether graziers have the right to withhold from sale wool produced on their properties if they consider the price offered to be unsatisfactory. If so, does the Minister agree that shearers and all other workers are justified in refusing to sell their labour-power if they are dissatisfied with the rate of pay or price offered, or if they regard the conditions of employment as unsatisfactory? honourable member has hardly presented a parallel in what he has put forward. As I understand the position, the distinction that applies between the grazier in his situation of being the holder of a commodity which he can elect to sell or not to sell as he chooses and the members of the union in the case in question, is that the members of the union were parties to arbitration proceedings under wbich presumably the parties were, by implication at least, willing to accept t.he independent decision given on the issues that tbey had willingly submitted for adjudication. However, as has been previously pointed out by me from this place, the aspect of the current dispute to which the most pointed criticism could be directed is the fact that the union principally concerned had employed tactics of incitement and intimidation which deprived or at least sought to dissuade the individual shearer from exercising his own free choice. My understanding of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of shearers would gladly work at the rates prescribed by the arbitration tribunal if the union of which they are members would only give them a clearance to go ahead and accept the rates that the tribunal has prescribed.

Surely, the bill should be so drafted as to make it.quite clear that the act applies to mammals, and that mammals include turtles, dugongs, and whales. I do not think that any act of Parliament should, include particular forms of life in a rather doubtful classification. I think that this is a very relevant criticism and I do not make it in a carping manner. It is a great mistake to adopt this course. This is not a matter of politics, and it is (feasible that previous governments may have been guilty of similar mistakes. man might benefit from a course in zoology. haps be very useful to the honourable member. He would understand from what particular species he came; in fact, we all would understand. There aro other features of this clause which are of very great importance now. Clause3 includes a reference to the fisheries development trust account. At this stage, I take the opportunity to re-emphasize that the Opposition has no objection to the establishment of such a trust account, but it does object to a very valuable asset of the people being sold and the net returns from the sale being put into this account. If the Government believes that further funds are necessary for the development of the fishing industry, those funds should come from Consolidated Revenue or from some other source. That is almost the sole reason why we are opposing this measure. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson) last night, during the second-reading debate on this measure, went to great pains to prove that after all the loss to tie community would not be as great as the Â£200,000 annual profit of the Australian Whaling Commission, which the Government is relinquishing. He said that the loss would be nothing like that amount, because the company taking over the undertaking, on the assumption that it continued to make an annual profit of Â£200,000, would, in contradistinction to the Government, pay income tax. My rough and ready calculation indicates that the income tax, company tax, and other taxes payable by a company on an income of Â£200,000 would possibly be in the vicinity of Â£60,000. income tax of each shareholder has to be included. the company taking over the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission will be subject to company tax. If I am wrong in that belief, I should like to be put right. shareholders will probably be subject to some taxation of personal income after they receive their dividends. The effect of all this is that the total tax levied on a private company's annual profit of Â£200,000 would not exceed about Â£60,000. The honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) shakes his head. He has, perhaps, a better knowledge of tbe taxation of big companies than I have. But even conceding a point to him, and even admitting that the company and its shareholders would pay Â£100,000 in taxes, the Commonwealth would be Â£100,000 in credit by retaining the station. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN . Order! The honourable member is getting wide of Clause 3. say that, Mr Temporary Chairman, but this is the clause that refers to the establishment of the fisheries development trust account, and as the Government is establishing the trust account from the proceeds of the sale of a government asset, I thought that perhaps it might be wise to make at least a passing reference to the taxation aspect of the transaction.

I consider that something in the nature of a statutory body should be appointed. 1 quite concede that at the present stage this proposal is still so much in its infancy that the actual method of operation cannot as yet be clearly delineated. I am very happy to note that a foundation of this excellent scheme has been laid, but I believe that it is necessary to formed in order to channel information appoint a statutory body to administer the proposal contained in the bill. I do not desire the appointment of another whaling commission, but I should like some authority other than a mere departmental head to whom one could make representations for assistance to a partisuggestions. cular branch of the fishing industry. I desire something more than that. An advisory body may be appointed, but I should prefer an authority with a little more power.

I should like an assurance from the Minister for Primary put this on his plate or on the plate of who has been handling this bill.

The Fisheries Division of the Department of Primary Industry is supervised by a Director of Fisheries who we think is one of the foremost authorities on fisheries problems in the Commonwealth. It has been agreed by the Government, insofar as advice to the Minister is concerned, that a small committee of the Cabinet will be to him and in order to make recommendations, should that be thought necessary. Nonetheless, the honourable member's great knowledge of these problems is known and I am sure that the department will give the most careful consideration to his I do not think that this would be the appropriate time at which to introduce an amendment; but I do assure the honourable member that the whole question will be examined.

78,Mr Mcmahon,"The honorableThe purpose of clause 4 of this bill is to set up a fisheries development trust account, and I want to congratulate the Government for making this provision because it is a most progressive and constructive step. This Fisheries Development Trust Account will provide for a number of things, but the main idea is to develop the industry of fishing and to use the funds for the publication of scientific reports and other information. I hope that some of this money will be used to encourage what is known as fish-farming, or, as it was called in an article which was written by the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) when he returned from Bombay, ""rural pisciculture"". There is nothing new in fish-farming which, after all, has been known for 2;000 years. The Chinese are past masters in the art and have been practising it for at least 2,000 years. In Europe, it has been practised for many centuries. Before the last war, Poland got about 50 per cent, of the fish eaten by its people from rural fish-farming. It has extended considerably recently, particularly in the United States of America and Canada. When the Minister for External Affairs returned from Bombay he wrote in the article to which I have referredIt is not far from the -.truth to say that Ausneeded to stock up these large dams and tralia is one of the few countries of the world in which fish farming is not yet carried on, at least to some extent. He finished by sayingOne .means that we adopted in Bengal to popularize fish .farming was to introduce it into the schools-to provide schools with a stocked fish-dam and to teach the children how to ma-nuTe it and to farm it. The fish culture habits spread rapidly from the schools to the homes, with ever-widening results. After all, if fish farming can be successfully carried out amongst the illiterate peasants of Bengal, may we not expect that the idea may be developed proportionately .more rapidly and successfully in Australia? Unfortunately, so far, I do not think that sufficient work has been done in Australia on rural fish farming. A certain -amount 'of work has been done in Victoria by A. D. Uutcher and G. T. Thompson, who have produced an excellent booklet. I hope that -the Commonwealth will consider the advisability of making that booklet av8ila""ble to many primary producers and other people who wonld. be in a position to use it. In this country, we spend annually Â£5,500,000 on imported fish, and surely we should do something to develop our own fish resources. We have enormous areas of water. The Hume weir, for example, contains a greater volume of water than Sydney Harbour. It is intended to increase the capacity of that weir to 2,500,000 acre feet. The Eildon Weiri n Victoria, the Burrinjuck Dam in New South Wales, and many other weirs could be fully stocked with fish. Lake George is not very far from here; and it is interesting to remember that Lake George, many years ago, was full of Murray cod. I believe that this came about because a person stocked a dam nearby which overflowed and carried the fish into Lake George. They multiplied to such an extent that at one stage a tremendous quantity of fish from Lake George was marketed in Sydney and it was considered that a steam trawler should be put on the lake in order ;to catch its 'fish. Unfortunately, the lake dried up. A few years ago, it re-filled, and looks like being f u l l for a considerable time. There is a case for encouraging the States to establish hatcheries which would produce the type of f r y that is to stock the rivers. Thef r y could be made available also to people who might wish to purchase them for the purpose of stocking fish farms. There has been a tremendous development of fish farms recently becanse of the discovery that the manuring of fish farms led to such a terrific increase in the size of the fish. The manuring of fish farms has the same effect as the manuring of pastures. Without the manuring of dams, trout may grow to three or four pounds weight in the natural state, but with manuring, they have been known to grow to eight or ten pounds weight. Recently, a dam was emptied three years after it had been stocked with trout, and some of the fish had grown to the size of 8 lb. in three years. Surely, when a system such as this fish farming has been shown to be so good, it is time that the Government assisted the States to increase the popularity of the practice. In some",21,Pairs
79,Mr Fairbairn (Farrer) [3.37],"nases, I believe that dams have produced half a ton of fish annually per acre, and there have even been records of 2 tons -of fish per acre having been obtained from a dam annually. That is something we cannot afford to ignore. I hope ithat the Minister for Primary Industry help the States by assisting them in cotimexion with hatcheries. We have to get types of fish that are -suitable, and then go ahead and produce an enormous number of f r y and make them available to people. We have two ideal types of Australian fish. One is the callop, yellow belly, or .golden perch as it is known in different places. It is an extremely good fish and -one which multiplies rapidly in size, gaininstrumentalities that should do tbe ing a weight of 15 lb. within a remarkably short period. It is, without doubt, the best fish anywhere in Australia for use in this region or anywhere from here westward in New South Wales, and in Victoria and South Australia. In addition, of course, we have a magnificent fish in the Murray cod. It is nothing for the Murray cod to grow up to 100 lb. ancl individual cases have been reported of cod being caught far in excess of that weight. Anything that can be done to assist the States to develop tbeir hatcheries will aid primary production in Australia enormously. The State of New South Wales has done something in this line. I saw a small drum in which a few fish had been placed, and I understand that they were being taken to Adaminaby for breeding purposes. Here we have a fund which has as its object the increasing of fish production in Australia and one ""of the best ways in which . we can do that is to say to the States, "" How can we help you increase the output of your hatcheries?"" In addition. I think that we should say, "" We will be prepared to help you in any way, by sending out pamphlets or anything of that nature which will encourage people on the land to go in more for this type of fish farming"". take this into consideration. not disagree with the honourable member mation gleaned by the Commonwealth for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn). The Scientific and Industrial Research development of fisheries in our inland Organization. waters with a view to the greater supply of the excellent fish which are to be found there is a very desirable objective, but I would issue a warning. As the Government has the numbers, one can assume that the trust account will be established. I sincerely hope that it will not be used to expand the fisheries section of the department, or encourage it to take over the function of fisheries development in the respective States. In every State fisheries departments are already in existence. Many are 100 years old. So far as I know them, they are excellently staffed but always short of money. They have at their disposal a vast fund of knowledge of indigenous and imported fish. They are the actual work. I see no objection to this Government making available from the trust account to the respective States money to assist them to attain objectives of the kind advocated by the honourable member for Farrer. After all, this Government is continually harping on the need for economy, and the evil of having too many bureaucrats. It alleges that if Labour were in office here it would encourage centralization and thc concentration of all administrative activity in this capital city of Canberra. On the contrary, our desire has always been to see power decentralized from Canberra to provinces, States or whatever they may be called, just as the State governments delegate their powers to cities and municipalities -sometime s extending and sometimes contracting them. Under that system there would be no danger of centralizing administration and this, after all, is what people object to most strongly. The Minister should keep a very strict guard against any tendency towards the duplication of work clone by the States. That applies to fisheries development both on the mainland and within the 3-mile limit. 1 should not like to see any intrusion by the Commonwealth into the field in which I hope that the Minister will the States operate.

81,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [3.45],"I do research work and disseminate the infordebate has revealed quite clearly that the criticism levelled at this bill by the Opposition in the early stages is shared by some supporters of the Government. The honourable member for Farrer( Mr matter. Fairbairn) and the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) have indicated that the wisdom of establishing a fisheries development trust account, such as is provided for in clause 4 of the bill, mfust be tested by asking whether it will be put to adequate use for the purposes set out. One knows very well that a trust account is very often nothing more than a receptacle in which to hide funds for a particular time or a particular purposesometimes to create a surplus for more general use in connection wibh the economic policy of the Government. Honourable members want to know whether the trust fund will be used adequately for tbe development of the fishing industry. The doubt was, I think, raised in the minds of Opposition members partly because of the manner in which the proposal was put forward. It has been associated with the sale of the assets of the whaling commission. It was apparent on the 16th February, and again on the 22nd February, when this matter was first raised, that the Government was somewhat uncomfortable, to say the least, in relation to the sale of the assets of the to some extent, justify tbe view taken by whaling commission. It nevertheless proceeded with that intention in a manner that I am sure will be examined later by tliis committee. It is quite possible bhat this bill has been presented because the Government wishes to hide, as much as it can, the circumstances under which it has decided to sell the assets of the whaling commission. Here the Government is saying, ""We are using tbe proceeds of bhis sale to assist the fishing industry"". In this way the Government seeks to justify something which, upon the grounds that it has previously chosen to put forward, is in no way justified. The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr endeavour to remedy as soon as possible. McMahon) has given us information, more substantial than we have received hitherto, about the way in whioh this fund might be used. He said that the application of the fund would be in the hands of his department, and he referred especially to the Director of Fisheries. It would appear that a good deal of the work involved in giving effect to the bill might be carried out in that department but, as has already been pointed out, the Government has not a very good record in this The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) last night showed us the poor record of this Government in relation to tuna fisheries, and the delay, because of inadequate funds, in the work of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization. The honourable member for Moore and the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) pointed out how backward the fisheries of Australia have become. The States fisheries departments and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization no doubt possess the resources needed to give effect to the bill, but the Government has given ns no indication that it has taken any action to explore this field. Presumably the bill has been introduced without the benefit of a prior investigation, in association with the State departments or tbe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization, of the way in which it might be made to work. ; This reveals a considerable inadequacy in the presentation of the measure and must, the Opposition that it has been submitted now mainly to cover up the way in which the whaling commission's assets have been sold. Had the Government told the House that it had been in. touch with the State fisheries authorities and the Gommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, and had, as a' -remit, discovered ways and means by which this money could ' be devoted to particular purposes, it would have been a very different matter. Presumably none of those steps has so far been taken, and I think that these arp the defects which the Government should It is not the intention of the Opposition to oppose, in principle, the provision of assistance in the conduct of research in this field.

I also assure him that the problem of the distribution of literature is covered in clause 6 of the. bill, and that that distribution will be one of the functions of the new division. I should also like to assure the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), who has taken a very great interest in the past in the problem of our fisheries, and knows a considerable amount about it, to judge from a reading of the old records, that clause 6 places certain restrictions on the activities of the Commonwealth under this measure. In the first place, it is not intended that the Commonwealth should in any way infringe on the powers of the various State governments and their departments of fisheries. ""What is intended in this measure is that the activities of the State authorities shall be supplemented.

I also assure him that it is not intended in any way to interfere with the powers of the State departments of fisheries, but merely to supplement their activities.

The honourable member for Werriwa dealt w it h the history of that matter so far as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is conoerned. I should like the Minister to examine the statements made by the honourable membei' for Werriwa, because tbey seem to show that, for five years at least, the project of getting a suitable vessel, which is absolutely essential, and which the Chifley Government had decided on, in principle, has been postponed. Nothing has been done about it , and it is a really sorry and disgraceful thing that so important a sphere of research as that pertaining to the development of fisheries in Australian waters beyond territorial limits should be neglected. Each year, in the report presented to us, there has been an excuse-and a very lame onethat the necessary money has never been provided. The principle of obtaining the money for fisheries research and development from the proceeds of the sale of the Australian Whaling Commission's enterprise which, as the Minister knows, we attacked even more directly and strongly, seems to me to be an extraordinary principle. We favour the encouragement of research and development as such. I should like the Minister to obtain the information necessary to enable him to inform the Parliament, at a suitable time, why the project approved by the Chifley Government for the provision of the necessary vessel has been shelved, on one pretext or another, for nearly six years. Of course, it may not be possible for the Minister to obtain and provide us with that information while this debate is still in progress. The decision to obtain a vessel was taken by the Chifley Governnient, in which the honourable member for Lalor( Mr. Pollard) was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, within whose ambit of responsibility fell matters affecting fisheries. The Treasury approved the project when Mr Chifley was TreaI do not wish to surer, and plans for the provision of the vessel had been, at any rate, adumbrated and commenced when the Chifley Government left office, it being obviously",24,Pairs

I wish the Minister to tell me whether I am correct in saying that it would be possible, it kept the station, it would be able to oven if not probable, under this bill, for the Government to develop such fishing grounds, if it so desired, in co-operation with the States-and that is the important point-and so assist in fostering the fishing industry in the Murray River and other inland rivers, and also in inland lakes and places other than the sea. Before thc Minister replies, I want to make it clear that I have said "" through the States"". T tbink that is the vital point. It is probable that, under the Constitution, the Commonwealth could not assist directly in places such as those I have suggested, but if it were to act through the States, I do not think there is anything in the Constitution-ther e is certainly nothing in the bill-that would prevent it from taking the course that 1 have advocated.

That highlights the fact that this Government, if it had any sense, would not sell the whaling station.

Paragraph (b) of sub-clause (2.) states that there shall be paid into the account moneys paid to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the account. That is a very sensible provision. Paragraph (c) states that there shall be paid into the account moneys received by the Commonwealth from the disposal, by sale or otherwise, of land, goods, or other property acquired or produced, or for work paid for, out of moneys standing to the credit of the account.

Is it not the responsibility of the Governnient to say, "" The Commonwealth Bank of Australia makes overdrafts available to soundly based enterprises. If they are soundly based, they will get the money; but if they are not soundly based, they will not get the money"". If a risk is involved, there is no reason in the world why the Government, after considering the bank's report, should not say that it would guarantee the bank against any loss that might be incurred.

The Labour party seems to be bereft of ideas for the -development of new industries in Australia. Almost all Australian industries, including the fishing industry, have been -developed by private enterprise, by men whom the Labour party seems to despise. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable meinber is making a second-reading speech. He should confine himself to the clause now before the committee. -clause deals with these matters, upon which almost the whole bill is founded. It is only right that, as has been provided in this clause, financial assistance in the form of loans should be given to people who are prepared to develop a new industry. After all, such assistance is given to other primary industries. Why should it not also be given to the fishing industry? There is no reason why it should not be given. To give such assistance is quite legitimate. I know of no ocean fishing enterprises that are looking for charity; rather are tbey looking for assistance in the form of loans such as those that have been made available to other primary industriesloans that they will have a reasonable chance of repaying to the Government. I commend the Government for introducing this bill, and particularly the clause that is now under discussion. The assistance for which provision is made will afford much relief to those persons who .are trying to develop new phases of the fishing industry along the Australian coastline. I support the bill to the hilt. gations of ignorance and of people being bereft of ideas are not argument. When my time expired a little earlier, I was about to inform the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Brand) and, in particular, the Minister for Primary Industry very careful, there would develop within the department something in the nature of a banking inquisition, and that it would be necessary for the Minister to have about him a number of officials who were competent to analyse people's financial position and to advance or refuse to advance loans to them accordingly. The honourable member for Wide Bay has stated that he is in favour of loans, and that loaus are granted to other primary producers. Such loans have been advanced, but at low rates of interest fixed by the Australian Labour party. party even sold wheat to New Zealand at os. 9d. a bushel. stitute argument either. Not long ago the honourable member for Wide Bay endorsed the proposal of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to increase interest rates. If he asserts that the fishing industry is a primary industry, let me remind him that low rates of interest will not apply to money borrowed by fishermen from the banking institutions. Although it is true that loans are made availaole to primary producers in New Soutb Wales and many other States, they are made available through the banking institutions. If the Government is not very careful in the administration of this development trust account, the Minister will find it necessary to surround himself with people who are in the nature of a banking staff and who can thoroughly analyse people's financial position and ascertain whether loans are justified. The whole burden of my earlier criticism of this measure concerned the people to whom the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) referred last night. He spoke of the small, individual fishermen, who go out and risk the hazards of the sea. They will get nothing from this bill. When, on behalf of tliose individual fishermen, brave men who do a great service to the people of this country, -Alle the honourable member approaches the Minister in six months' time and asks for a few pounds for them, he will not get it. The money will go to the people who invest money in the larger fishing vessels, and who never leave their suburban homes in the cities adjacent to tbe fishing grounds.

Various State governments have, in the past, adopted the practice of providing money for purposes such as this through their various -departments, and experience has shown that such schemes have nearly always -ended disastrously. I could give many illustrations of that fact. Clause agreed to. Clause6 (Application of the Account;. Clause6 states the purposes for which the money may be applied. Sub-clause (1.) (a) provides that it may be applied for the initiation or continuation of research or investigation in connection with, or for the promotion of, the fishing industry. We know that the appropriation measures that are dealt with in this chamber each year provide for certain sums of money to be made available to the Department of Primary Industry for investigation of the fishing industry, or for extension work. Provision of funds is also made to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization for this purpose. However, it appears that the Government now wishes to provide the money from the sale of this splendid public asset. Sub-clause (1.) (h) provides that money in the .account may be applied to financial assistance, by way of loan or provision of share capital, or otherwise, to persons -engaged, or proposing to become engaged, in the fishing industry. It appears that those who will be responsible for the administration of the development account will have the responsibility of deciding whether they will invest in shares in. some concern which, from outward inspection, appears quite sound and genuine. That concern may issue a certain number of shares on its own account, and then ask the Government to purchase a number of shares. opposing that provision? to the Minister the implications of these provisions, and I a.m indicating that the fisheries section of the department that he administers will have the responsibility of determining the soundness or otherwise of such propositions. Sub-clause ( l . ) ( c ) provides that moneys in the account may be applied for the establishment or development of the fishing industry in a particular place or for a particular purpose. I agree with that provision. Sub-clause ( l . ) ( d ) allows the money to be applied for the training of persons in connection with the fishing industry. That is a very good proposal, too, but let me point out, to the Minister that the most successful scheme of training in the whaling industry during recent years involved the [4.27] training of the staff that is now employed at Carnarvon, and this Government now proposes to dispose of the industry in which that staff is engaged. In the initial stages of operation of that whaling station, we brought out about 50 Norwegians. Most of them finished their contract and returned to Norway. However, among those men were some expertgunners. Two of them are still employed at Carnarvon, and their contract will shortly expire. Two others are employed at private whaling stations. There is at Carnarvon to-day, as a direct result of governmental activities, a very competent staff which this Government proposes to throw, as it were, on to the scrap heap, when it sells the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission to a private firm. 1 know that certain assurances have been given that the people who purchase thc Carnarvon station will take over the existing staff, but who wants to transfer from a very desirable set of employers, wbo provide good conditions, to another set of employers who may or may not provide good conditions? However, the Opposition does not object to the Government's policy of training people for these industries. Further paragraphs of sub-clause (1.) refer to extension work. That kind of work is very desirable. In the past, the money required for it ias been included in departmental estimates, and that could be done in the future. Now it appears that the Government will provide a lot of money, not only from the sale of the whaling station but also from Consolidated Revenue. The money that has been provided in the past will continue to be provided, but from a different source, and",30,Pairs

I refer again to sub-clause ( l . ) ( b ) , which covers the granting of nnancial assistance by way of loan or provision of share capital. If the Minister is not careful he will find that the Department of Primary Industry will develop into a pawn-broking establishment, and his staff will be engaged in determining the relative merits of numerous claims. That work is usually done by a bank, whether a State bank or the Commonwealth Bauk, and that practice should be adhered to. If the Government wants to be more generous than the banks, it can make grants to the industry. The Opposition is critical of all these matters to which I have referred, although, like the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Brand), we do not disagree with the general purposes of the measure. What we disagree with is the proposal to sell an asset of the people in order to provide money for activities wbich, in the past, have been financed from other sources.

107,Motion (By Mr Mcmahon ),"is a bill for an act to repeal the Whaling Industry Act 1949-1952 and for purposes connected therewith. It is a measure that should have preceded the -one that the House has just agreed to. The fact that it comes after that measure only highlights the attempt of the Government to dampen down the iniquity of its proposal to sell a very important government instrumentality. It is perfectly obvious that if there were nothing in the ordinary course of events that the Government wished to keep from public attention, the measure now before the House would have come first. Then it would have been perfectly obvious that the Labour party would have supported with enthusiasm the establishment of a fisheries development trust fund. Thati * perfectly obvious, because the Opposition would have been confronted with a f a i l accompli. The Government would have bad authority to sell the whaling station. A pledge, already given to thc people who have to all intents and purposes bought it, would have been thereby practically legalized, but the idea was to throw out the bait for consumption by the public that here is a magnificent gesture by the Commonwealth Government in establishing a gigantic development trust account to help the fishermen, particularly the little fishermen who go out and brave the terrors of the seas. But that was not the procedure. The Fishing Industry Bill was introduced first and was followed by this measure which takes from the Australian Whaling Commission its authority to control, as far as the sale is concerned, the commission's assets at Carnarvon and at other places. I emphasize that its assets include the three very valuable chasers that are used to bring the whales from territorial waters to the whaling station. Much has been said about the history of whaling in Australia, but this measure is of such importance, and it is such a bad move on the part of the Government to dispose of these assets, that I think some historical background should be given to this House. After World War II . , it was brought to the notice of the Government of the day, particularly by enthusiasts in Tasmania where whaling was probably established first iD Australia, that considerable whaling wealth was obtainable in the waters adjacent to Australia and in the Antarctic. The interests concerned emphasized that Norwegian, British and South African whalers were operating in the Antarctic, and that the Japanese were likely to operate there in the near future. Vast wealth was being taken from the Antarctic waters, and it was suggested that it was about time the Australian people woke up and participated in the harvesting of that wealth. Consequently, the Australian Government of the day appointed a sub-committee of the Cabinet and an inter-departmental committee of highly skilled men, including scientists and officers of the Treasury and of the then Department of Commerce and Agriculture, to investigate and report to the Cabinet sub-committee. The report of the inter-departmental committee disclosed that vast wealth was undoubtedly to be won. It was thought, initially, that it might be possible, and even desirable, for the Australian Government to invest in a capital ship which could go to the Antarctic and win the wealth that was obtainable there from whaling. But, at that time, the war had not long ended, and there arose the question whether it would be possible to obtain a capital ship at a reasonable cost. Inquiries were made, and it was found that a suitable capital vessel would have cost approximately Â£6,000,000 at that time. That amount was considered an excessive price for the type of vessel required, in the light of expected future developments in shipping values when war losses had been made good. the honourable member mean a mother ship? to which the whales would be brought by chasers, and which could remain in the whaling area for the whole season. The next best thing was to ascertain whether if would be possible and feasible for the Australian Government itself to establish a shore station to win some of the wealth obtainable from whaling operations in seas adjacent to Australia's territorial waters, and, in particular, to",32,Whaling Industry Act Repeal Bill 1956 Second Readino

110,Mr Pollard,"Yes, a mother shipcatch humpback whales, which were reported to be available in very great numbers indeed. It is known that humpback whales travel up the east and west coasts of Australia in large numbers every season ancl are available for the taking. At that time, no one in Australia had any particular practical or other knowledge of whaling. The last shore station had been conducted by the Norwegians at Point Cloates about twenty years before. That station was then in a state of disorder. Machinery, equipment, buildings and facilities were in a sorry condition. The sub-committee reported to the Cabinet that it was not practicable, at least for a government, to rehabilitate that station in such a manner as would make it a sound working proposition. At about that time, quite a number of people had applied to the Australian Government for the allocation of licences to engage in whaling off the Australian coast. Factors that became apparent as a result of those inquiries partly actuated the Government itself when it decided to go into the industry direct. It was found that many of the applicants for Commonwealth licences to take whales off the Australian coast were men of straw who hoped, first, to obtain licences, and, subsequently, on the strength of their holding Hcences to engage in whaling, from which unlicensed persons were excluded, to float companies and to undertake whaling ventures. It was found, on investigation, that very few, if any of them, had practical knowstaff, and the experience of tbe good team ledge of whaling. After a good deal of consideration, it tralia a large number of trained men was decided that the Australian Government should enter the industry direct. The government of tbe day had then to decide how best to do this. First, it sought the services of a man who had had experience in shore-based and Antarctic whaling operations. After inquiries had been macle in London by the Australian High Commissioner of the day, wei obtained the services of Captain Melsom, who made certain very excellent recommendations to the Government. Some were not accepted, with ample justification, as was afterwards proved. Many of Captain Melsom's recommendations were desirable, and, accordingly, they were accepted. It was decided to establish the government whaling station at Carnarvon, in Western Australia, and to appoint a commission to manage it and to conduct all the operations essential toa. whaling enterprise. It then became necessary to select a man of suitable drive and capacity to act as chairman of the commission. Mr Bowes, who is still chairman, was chosen for the task. A representative of the Treasury was appointed to the commission to keep an eye on financial matters, and a representative also of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture was appointed. From the inception of the commission, as long as I was associated with it, Mr Bowes, Mr Sheehan and Mr Stevenson did a first-class job, and gave wholeheartedly of their best. This is bestillustrated by the fact that, in 1951, the first year in which whaling operations were conducted for a. full season, OOO whales were taken. In every season since, except for one, in which, I think, only 500 whales were taken, 600 whales have been caught. In five years of operation, profits totalling ' Â£1,000,000, or somewhat more, have been made for the people of Australia. But something more has been achieved also. The experience we have obtained, the knowledge we have gleaned from the Norwegians who were brought from Norway to help conduct the whaling operations, the techniques that we have learned, the practical experience of the members of the commission and of their executive of workers that was marshalled to operate the station, have made available in Auswho are capable of successfully engaging in whaling operations. Very great knowledge and experience were gained also in the installation of the plant at Carnarvon. Although dollars were scarceat the time, the Chifley Government, on the recommendation of its advisers, set aside sufficient dollars for the import from America of plant of a type that had never been used in Australia before and, in fact, was, at the time, in use in very few otlier countries. As a result, the extraction of oil at Carnarvon is to-day higher than the rate in Norway or in any other country one may care to mention. This standard of efficiency applies also to all other aspects of the station's operations. It is the best and the most -efficient in the world. As a consequence, it pays the people of Australia substantial dividends, and it has become a model for all who desire to establish themselves in tbe whaling industry in Australia and, for that matter, in other parts of the world. numerous, especially people who desire to invest in the whaling industry. They .go to Carnarvon to observe and to learn, and they do not depart disappointed. The net result is that, already, at Moreton Bay, in Queensland, a private -enterprise whaling station is showing substantial profits. The Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, which established a whaling station at Point Cloates almost simultaneously with the establishment of the government station at -Carnarvon, has learned a very great deal indeed from the government establishment. The irony of it is that the present -Government should now play so false to its undertakings to the Australian people .as to dispose of the great public asset which has done such good work. One might compare this action, in fact, with that of a State government in disposing of some very good educational institution after it had shown the way. Probably the greatest tribute to the station's success I stated that a very great value attaches lies in the fact that other persons have -copied it and learned from it, and finally, in some cases, have cast most envious eyes upon it. Knowing the political philosophy of the Government over a number of years, these persons bave been niggling at the Government, white-anting it, getting at its weaker supporters, both in the Ministry and in the ranks, pointing out that the Government is opposed to socialism and asking what part this whaling station should play in the activities of a Liberal government. Eventually, the Government is succumbing to their blandishments and handing over the finest whaling station in the world in the very prime of its life for what might be called a mess of pottage-Â£350,00 0 deposit on an asset that is returning Â£200,000 annually without fail. That is not the worse aspect of the matter. For each of the next two years Â£120,000 is to he paid, and Â£290,000 in the third and final year. ber's Labour colleagues offered only Â£620,000. my friend from Western Australia says, that my Labour colleagues in tbe Western Australian Government offered only Â£620,000, but my honourable friend does Visitors to the station are not realize that the figure at which the Government is selling this great station to the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited does not take into consideration the right to use territorial waters controlled by the State Government and thc right to use the land which is leased to the Commonwealth. The freehold of the property is vested in the people of Western Australia, and that is of very considerable value. Has the honourable gentleman considered that? Has he considered that the Western Australian Government feels so annoyed at the sell-out of the people's assets that those who buy the station may find themselves in a very uncertain position in regard to the licence that is attachable to this project in the event of the return of a Labour government to this Parliament. I issue that warning. We might not have any hesitation in dealing very arbitrarily with a transaction which we consider is of the most phony character. Earlier in my speech to the licence itself, and in the early days of inquiries into this project persons were hawking the licence. That was the basis on which they offered inducements to the public to invest capital in their project. Does the honourable gentleman discount that ? Does he desire another reason why the Western Australian Government did not offer more than Â£620,000? The Western Australian people are becoming very annoyed at the failure of this Government to ensure that effective assistance is rendered to their rapidly developing State. I do not blame the State Government, but the honourable gentleman might, in his speech on the subject, discuss some of the phony aspects of this transaction. On the 16th February, I asked 'a question relating to this matter. I asked wihether the Government intended to sell the project and whether tenders were to be called. I did not receive any direct answer. I received an evasive, resentful,",33,Whaling Industry Act Repeal Bill 1956 Second Readino

112,Mr Pollakd,"It is quite true, asand non-committal reply from the Minisassumption to be justly drawn was that things were not fair and square and in the light of day as they would be witb a transaction that was open and honest. Subsequently my colleague, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), asked a supplementary question, and again there wa> evasion. from time to time until it was elicited that this very valuable project had not been thrown onto the open market for tender. After all, the people's assets belong to all the people, and whatever governments may have done in the past or may do in the future, whether or not honourable members who laugh cite precedents, to ensum that matters are clean, clear and above board, tenders should always, where practicable, be called for the right to purchase. from a departmental source, but probably Nobody will deny the practicability of calling for tenders in this instance. If the Government was not conscious of its vulnerability to criticism in relation to tenders, what was the reason for the evasiveness of the Minister for Trade? Why did he show resentment that it had come to the light of day that the Government was negotiating the sale? Why did he say bhat I was being fed with information from some official source? Should not the information that this instrumentality was for sale have been freely available? Why should it be hidden? Even to-day the Opposition and the Parliament do not know the terms of the contract. The correct course is to introduce in the Parliament a bill authorizing the sale of a government instrumentality, disclosing in the schedule the specific terms on which it is to be sold. What is the position to-day? I have here in my possession the terms proposed by the then Department of Commerce and AgricultureT suppose by the Fisheries Division. Irrespective of who drafted them, no doubt the terms were approved by the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr and our adverse balance of payments that McMahon 1, DidI obtain this information as a result of its direct presentation to the Parliament by the Minister, or did I have to obtain it by some subterfuge? T have it and I shall quote from it. The draft contains the terms and conditions under which it is proposed that this station shall be disposed of to the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited. What are these terms and conditions? They are outrageous. Why were they not available to the House for public criticism? Why did I have to obtain them, by some stroke of luck? able gentleman obtain them? Minister, and I do not think he will ever accuse me of dishonesty. They did not come from any governmental source. Never since I relinquished control of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture have I embarrassed any officer by seeking inside information, nor have I done so in this case. The terms and conditions under which this station is to be sold came into my hands certainly not from a disappointed purchaser. He can obtain them, but a member of the Parliament cannot have available for criticism here the underhand conditions which have been circulated to a few prospective purchasers. Does that not savour of sharp practices? Whatever justification may be advanced by the Government for its policy of selling the people's property, there can be no justification whatever for an underhand sale which does not give openly to every citizen the right to submit a tender, if he has the necessary money. I even go so far as to say that in certain circumstances it is not necessarily desirable that the highest tender be accepted, but at least everybody should know all ahout the terms and conditions. Otherwise it is crook and phony and there is something to hide. I am not saying that the Minister for Primary Industry knows all about it ; I think that, he knows very little about it. By way of apology, I say that I believe that his colleague, the Minister for Trade, and the head of the Department of Trade, are so busy worrying about external trade they just do not know what is going on behind the scenes. When the Minister for Trade suggested that I was being fed with information from some official sourcea nice accusation!-h e went on to say, "" Of course, I do not mind"".

119,Mr Pollard,"ThatFrom time to time, we hear of the Government's great belief in competition. Yet what did it do? It sold the whaling station to people who are already in the game, who already have a licence and who, under the terms of the agreement, will be able to keep the licence that they have and company will produce it "" . take over the Government's licence and, consequently, have a quota of 1,000 whales a year. The maximum quota that the Government will make available for any other station is for 500 or 600 whales. That is a nice state of affairs 1 Where does the Australian Country party stand in this matter ? If the honorprice. Profit will be paramount and the able member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) were a primary producer living in Western Australia, I would expect him to be very wrathful about this matter. I would expect him to be running to the branches of the Australian Country party in Western Australia pointing out what the future held for their members in respect of the supply of concentrates. Is it realized in Western. Australia that last year the Carnarvon whaling station produced no less than 7,981 tons of whale solubles, which are highly concentrated, high protein content, stock feed? This is a valuable and scarce product. A portion of that 7,981 tons was whale meal which is used by the banana-growers and other primary producers. utilized as stock feed and has a very high protein content. It is about 82 per cent, protein, whereas linseed meal is about 35 per cent., and bran and pollard are between 9 per cent, and 11 per cent. That will give honourable members an idea of what a very valuable concentrate this is. A very large proportion of that 7,981 tons of high protein stock feed was produced by the Carnarvon whaling station. Government supporters' may ask, ""What of it ?"" It is of paramount importance. The whole of that important product was sold in Western Australia. gentleman will read the last report of the Australian Whaling Commission he will see that my statement is correct. If the honourable member wants to quibble, how much of last year's production would he suggest was exported? Not any of it ! The whole of the production of approximately 8,000 tons was sold on the local market. Honourable members opposite may ask, ""What of that?"" The feed was used for the benefit of the poultry industry. Again they may ask, "" What of that ?"" It looks all right on the face of it Honourable members may say,."" The honourable member says that the company will produce it. What he will not tell the farmers of Western Australia is that the company, when it gets its greedy hands on the station, will make its own price in Western Australia for concentrates will be that set by the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, after consultation with all the other stations iu Australia. If the overseas market happens to be more profitable concentrates will be exported and the poultry farmers and banana growers of Western Australia will have to go without. charges Â£ 1 a protein unit. mission charges, the new controllers of the enterprise will charge more, perhaps 30s.

Despite this the chairman, his fellow commissioners, and the 120 workers, including the champion gunners and every one else who has put his heart and soul into this industry, working for the people of Australia and giving a most illuminating example of successful application during the lastseven years, will be thrown away like a bundle of dirty rags, and left to the mercy of another employer.

There is no power by which a government can force a firm to keep on an employee if it does not wish to do so. Eveni f there were, it would not be exercised by this Government, whose philosophy embraces the right to hire and fire. If , finally, this evil proposal is put into effect, I appeal to the Government to remember those who are on wages and salaries, and who have shown great loyalty in directing the activities of the commission. They should be given one or two months' pay, or substantial leave, in appreciation of their services. That would be no more than decent. In view of what I have said the Government should think further before proceeding with this proposal. I am not suggesting that there is corruption anywhere, but rather that there has been serious mismanagement, and misjudgment in public policy.. This successful public instrumentality is to become the plum of a favoured few, who were so lucky as to receive information regarding it. Why should not a returned soldier, or a gallant airman, such as the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Never mind about protecting the 'fish; Fairbairn), have been able to buy the enterprise if he had sufficient capital. Why were not all prospective buyers advised through the press that the enterprise was up for sale ? Why has it been necessary for those interested to make special trips to Canberra in order to find out what it is all about, and why havo their movements been secret? According to the Western Australian press, the seven directors of one company left for Canberra on seven different days. There is surely something phony about that sort of thing. When other instrumentalities have been sold, the relevant bill has contained a schedule setting out the exact terms and conditions of sale. The Minister, who is a man of great principle, smiles, but he will agree with what I have said. Such information as I received about the way in which the undertaking was to be sold came to me unintentionally in the first instance, and by agreement in tbe second instance. Apparently the successful company is to be given the right to take a further 500 whales. It already has the right to take 500 through its station at Point Cloates. Further, the company is assured that no more licences for the taking of whales on the Western Australian coast will be issued to other persons during the 1956, 1957 and 1958 seasons. In fact, the company is being given a monopoly along that coast. tecting the mdustry. porters, who are willing to protect the industry, are not so willing to protect their fellow citizens, who had a right to be informed of this very profitable transaction. Government supporters know that they must apologize for the surrender of Â£200,000 in Commonwealth revenue each year, for the dumping of 120 men in the lap of a new employer, and for the hazards associated with selling this enterprise on terms. In a period of years the company may collapse and be unable to pay. I know that it is a very efficient firm, but anything may happen. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver) suggests that no more licences are to be granted for 1956, 1957 and 1958 so that the whales may . be protected. why was not Parliament told of this? Did the Government wish to hide the fact that it was giving this protection to the company? Oan the honourable member assure us that the maternal instincts of the whales will not be so strong that in the next season or two they will come back from the south with many more calves than they have had in previous years? It may become desirable for the Government to issue additional licences, but it will be tied lock, stock and barrel to this company. When licences were issued to the Cheynes Beach Whaling Company Proprietary Limited it was uot assured that no more licences would be issued. It went into the industry and risked its capital. It did not have the benefit of buying on terms from the Government. It risked the issuing of licences to other stations.

This Parliament, above all, should be informed frankly of what has ..gone on behind closed doors. I am quite sure that at a later stage, if members of the ministerial parties do not indicate their dissent in relation to this matter, there will come from my side of the House some suggestions on bow to deal with this problem. would have been amazing, indeed, if we had not been treated in the course of this debate, to a great deal of socialist nonsense about tbe people's assets. We have just heard from the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) the usual totalitarian threat that if this measure is passed, ancl if the Labour party ever sucoffice, he did not deliberately obstruct ceeds in gaining power in this Parliament, a Labour government will do its best to nullify the sale of this whaling -enterprise-in other words, to socialize the industry, confiscate the assets of the establishing was pioneering the industry. Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, .and penalize it for entering into a normal business transaction. straighten out our thinking on this matter. If the Government has any obligation to engage in the business of whaling it has equally an obligation to -engage in the grocery business, the baking business or the milk business, or any other government's commission could claim to kind of business. The approach of the Opposition to this matter seems to suggest that that is the view of honourable members opposite. 1 know that the Minister himself has suggested that great credit belongs to the Labour Government that -established the Australian Whaling Commission ; but members of the Labour party claim a great deal of credit under false pretences because, as the honourable member for Lalor, who was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in the Labour Government at the time, and was administratively responsible for the whaling industry, will recall, when it was proposed to establish the commission the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited was already endeavouring to obtain a whaling licence. remind the honourable member of the cirI n the circumcumstances surrounding the granting of that licence. For two years, the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited had been endeavouring to obtain a licence and on every hand, from the then Minister right through his department, the company met obstruction. It was only as a result of the strenuous representations of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( MrH . V. Johnson), to whom I give credit for not being as socialistically minded as some of his colleagues, that the Minister at last relented and granted the company a licence. In the course of his speech, the honourable member for Lalor made all sorts of vague insinuations that something improper and underhand was going on. I should like him to examine his record in the department to see whether, when the socialist government was in the issue of a licence to the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, a private company, in order to enable that government to say that the commission it was We ought to able member all about it if he likes. member will examine the record he will find, I think, that I have spoken the truth, ancl that the issue of a licence to the company was held up so that the be a pioneer in the field of whaling. Now that whaling has been established successfully, the Government has decided that it is not a function of governments to operate this sort of business. That decision was arrived at as long ago as 1952. It is all very well for the honourable member for Lalor to suggest that the Government's intention to dispose of the whaling enterprise was kept secret.

Surelyi t would be logical to sell it to some interest that had a f u n d of knowledge and experience in the industry, and which could offer some concrete evidence that it could carry the industry on as successfully as it had hitherto been carried on. Approaches were therefore made to vernment, so it is most unlikely that the people wbo had some claim to those Australian Government could have been qualifications. Several proposals have in collusion witb the company. In fact, been considered by the Governinent since.' it was commonly stated, and Mr Hawke 1952, and recently more attractive prohimself had hinted on more than one positions were submitted. When the occasion, that he knew that an offer of decision was finally made to bring the more than Â£800,000 had been made. Yet, matter to finality, eight offers for the in spite of that knowledge, his Governpurchase of the enterprise were received, ment submitted a tender for only and the closing date for tenders was set Â£620,000. If that is the case, it discloses at, the end of February. The Labour an even more interesting state of affairs. Government in Western Australia then It discloses that the Western Australian fin barked on a very peculiar course of Government never had the slightest intenconduct, l t made a great song and dance tion of making a genuine attempt to buy about not having had any information the Australian Whaling Commission's about the Government's intention to sell, assets. All it did, in effect, was to employ although the information was readily tactics designed to influence the voters in available in the records left to it by the the Western Australian State general previous government, had it cared to election which was then pending. refer to them. A t the request of the Western Australian Government the dosing date for tenders was extended to if Mr Hawke's offer was intended to be enable that Government to consider its a f a ir one, it deprives of force the arguposition. It is an interesting fact that the The whaling enterprise is being sold Western Australian Government's offer for Â£8S0,000, which is a f a i r compromise was the second lowest of the offers between the valuation of Â£954,000, made received. Wheni t was announced that by the Commonwealth's own valuer, and the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited the valuation made by a private valuer was the successful tenderer, the Labour nominated by the Government, whose Premier of Western Australia, Mr figure was only Â£763,000. So we find Hawke, made a strange comment. He that, after all this song and dance about said he wondered whether the No r' West the value of the people's assets, Mr. Whaling Company Limited's offer had Hawke's idea of the value of the underbeen made after the Western Australian taking was only Â£620,000. That brings to Government's offer had been made. He my mind a comment made by one newsimplied, in fact, that this Government paper, which was "" What does that partiliar] deliberately embarked on a course of cular Labour Government want-the conduct designed to deny the Western people's assets at basement bargain Australian Government a true opporprices ?"" tunity to buy the whaling enterprise, although be well knew that the period for the lodging of tenders had been people ? extended for fifteen days for the sole purpose of enabling him to make an offer on behalf of his Government. SoÂ»the comment made by the Labour Premier of Western Australia was not only a rather surly comment, but was also a deliberate attempt to impute to this Government improper conduct, an imputation which he well knew to be false. Its falsity is also exposed by the fact that six of the seven other tenders were substantially higher than the tender submitted by tbe Western Australian GoI n the light of the overall position, ments of the Opposition about the price that is to be paid for the undertaking.",40,Whaling Industry Act Repeal Bill 1956 Second Readino
137,Mr Bryant,"Are they not the samewrong. Mr Hawke was trying to deprive the people of the rest of Australia of an asset for the sole benefit of the people -ci Western Australia. That is quite a -different proposition, as the honourable member will surely realize. I am glad that the honourable member has raised that point, because the truth of the matter is that an attempt has been made to obscure the issue under a thick socialist fog. This identification of you, me and everybody else as the wealthy owners of something is absolute nonsense. If we really own something, we oan exercise active ownership.

It can become a very burdensome the public by a business enterprise. There liability. The plain truth is that any has been a lot of very loose and sloppy business or asset is valuable for two thinking on the matter of profits by honorreasons. First, it is valuable, from the able members opposite. They say that point of view of the community, by the Australian Whaling Commission has reason of the productive contribution made substantial profits, and they glory in goods or services that it makes to the xn that. Yet, a day or two ago, they -community; and, secondly, it is valuable, were complaining about the profits of a from the point of view of its owner, by private business General Motorsreason of the return to the owner from the Holden's Limited. The socialist conceprendering of services or the productive tion of the function of a business seems to effort. The two things are distinctly be very peculiar in this regard. Socialists related. With regard to productive effort, let us have a look at the records of the Nor West Whaling Company Limited and the Australian Whaling Commission. From the point of view of capital invested, from the point of view of profits, and from every other point of view, we find that the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited has made a positive contribution to the community. It is functioning at least as successfully-som e people would say more successfully-tha n the-Australian Whaling Commission. In general, that applies to any government-controlled business and any privately controlled business. The citizen, as such, by being labelled as the owner of a business, does not gain any advantage from the productive effort of that business, whether it be a whaling business or anything else. We do not ger, a free ride from Trans-Australia Airlines. We pay the same fare as we do to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited.

There is a very good reason Let us turn to the profits earned by a cannot reconcile their ideas about profits. They say, first, that any concern that",41,Whaling Industry Act Repeal Bill 1956 Second Readino
138,Mr Freeth,"No, that is quitemakes large profits is exploiting the public. Let us have a look at that one. We have, side by side, the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited and the Australian Whaling Commission. Both are earning substantial profits. Because of that, we have not heard one word of criticism by honourable members opposite about the profits earned by the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, but other companies, including General MotorsHolden's Limited, have come in for a substantial amount of criticism for exploiting the public. I suggest that there is quite an interestsum of money-wil l require some protecing point to be made here. If it is justifiable for the Government whaling enterprise to make handsome profitswe have seen that honourable members opposite take some pride in that it is equally justifiable for a private company to make similarly handsome profits. Buti f it is wrong to make profits, why should a government enterprise exploit the same people whom a private concern would exploit? It is no excuse to say that the profits made by the government enterprise are converted for the benefit of the community. The people who are being exploited are the individuals who are dealing with the enterprise. If we say that the profits are being converted for the benefit of the community, we are simply arguing that the whole community should be made accomplices in the crime of exploitation. It has been pointed out that the Australian Whaling Commission serves the primary producers of this country. So will the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited. The primary producers will benefit from the by-products of its whaling business. Surely it is desirable that this business should be carried on as efficiently as possible. If private enterprise can carry on the business efficiently, it is entitled to do so. It is not a function of the Government to operate such a business. That is the real basis of tb . rliflVP ence between a socialist and a Viuerai oatlook on these things. We believe that an asset is only valuable because it can produce something. We believe also that it can produce that something better if it is controlled by men who freely and willingly use their own judgment, whether they be shareholders or directors. Compulsory Jt -[05 ] ownership of an asset, with no choice but to submit to the tyranny of bureaucratic experts, leads only to the so-called asset becoming a burdensome liability. The honourable member for Lalor has directed attention to the fact that some arrangement has been made with the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited in regard to the licence. "" He mentioned that subject among a lot of suggestions that something improper had been done. Any reasonable man will take the view that a company which is paying out a substantial bum of money-Â£880,00 0 is a substantial tion in regard to its asset. Tbis Government has complete control of the number of whales that can be killed on the Western Australian coast. The only protection that the Government can give is a guarantee that this company will not be unfairly treated. If the Government wanted to issue licences to other companies, that could be done only by reducing the quota of whales allotted to the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited. What the company has purchased, in fact, is the right to take and kill each year 500 whales, or whatever other number is regarded as reasonable having regard to the paramount necessity to preserve whales along the Western Australian coast. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to assume that it would require some assurance in regard to the number of whales allotted to it. The honourable member for Lalor has suggested that no guarantees were given to the Cheynes Beach Whaling Company Proprietary Limited. He will recall that that company had a tremendous battle to obtain a quota of whales, because the original quota of 1.200 whales for Western Australia was split up between the Australian Whaling Commission and the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited. It was only with the utmost reluctance that the Labour Government of which he was a member, and later this Government, granted a liceAot vo xhc Cheynes Beach Whaling Company Proprietary Limited. I venture to suggest that, if a government whaling organization is in .operation, there is a greater reluctance to admit a new organization to the industry by issuing an additional licence. T l u quota of the Cheynes Beach oompany, whicli is the third organization operating in Western Australia, has been built up very slowly over the years to 120 whales. 1 have made inquiries from the responsible Minister, and I bave ascertained that that company has received an assurance that, if it is found necessary to reduce the quota of the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited following its purchase of the Australian Commission's assets, its own quota will uot necessarily be reduced. It has also received an assurance that, if it is thought desirable to increase the overall quota of whales for Western Australia, its quota will be increased pro rata -West Whaling Company Limited. Apart Having regard to the number of whales whicli expert authorities regard as being a safe quota each year for Western Australia, the objections of the honourable member for Lalor to the arrangements that have been made in this connection are rather laughable. He knows that the organizations that have operated off the coast of Western Anstralia have kept within the limit of 1,200 whales a year, with a. variation of perhaps 50 either way. Does he seriously imagine that an^ other organization would be eager to enter the whaling business with a small quota of approximately 50 whales? He knows quite well that it could not possibly operate economically on that basis. Let me remind him that, in order to protect thc industry, the quota for each of the major companies has been reduced over the last, twelve months or two years from 600 to 500 whales. The possibility of a substantial increase of those quotas to beyond 6.00 whales in the near future is very remote. ber think that the price is correct? mention that matter. an investigation of it by a committee? ber for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) has suggested that on the sale of Commonwealth property, there should be some guarantee of just terms. It is interesting to note that, on this occasion, the Government has accepted the highest tender. The honourable member for Lalor has somewhat different ideas from these of .tlie Government. He has suggested that one would not necessarily sell to the highest bidder but to the bidder with the best qualifications to carry on the undertaking successfully. On that basis, he cannot possibly have any objection to the acquisition of this station by the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited. In relation to just terms, we have the valuation that the Labour Government of Whaling Western Australia has placed on this particular asset. As I have already stated, the tender that it submitted was the second lowest of the eight tenders received, and was approximately Â£260,000 lower than that submitted by the Nor' from the fact that the sincerity of the Western Australian Government in regard to this matter is in some doubt, surely the tender that it has submitted is a complete answer to the objections that have been raised by honourable members opposite. In the general approach to this proposition, honourable members opposite have advanced no justification for the retention of this undertaking by the Government other than some woolly socialist idea that it is something that the people own. I suggest that the people of Australia should be warned that the Australian Labour party still believes that private business undertakings should become the property of the public through government ownership. That seems to be the logical conclusion to be drawn from Labour's approach to this subject. It would be very dangerous for any persons who believe in the value of private enterprise or the private ownership of any property to accept the arguments submitted by the Opposition. I compliment the Minister for Trade this bill. For some years, it has been my view that this Government should not retain such a hazardous and risky enterprise. Though we give credit to the Labour party for having, according to its own claim, pioneered the industry in Western Australia there is some doubt about that claim. I sincerely hope that members of the public are aware of the dangers that are inherent in the outlook of the Labour party in relation to this matter.

143,( Mr Mcewen) For Having Introduced,"-Tb e Opposition opposes this measure because it feels that it involves a number of important principles in relation to wbicb tbe Government so far has not furnished an answer. I think ic ought to be made clear from the start that what is involved is not merely the disposal of certain Commonwealth assets at Carnarvon controlled by the Australian ""Whaling Commission, but that attached to those assets is a public franchise in the form of a licence to take 500 whales a year from the seas in that region. In othe woi-ds, attached to the assets is something which by its very nature is a monopoly. The Government has not indicated any definite principles that have been followed in arriving at the valuation of Â£380,000. There are political questions involved. There is the matter of the disposal of those assets, including the right to take 500 whales from thesea every year. There are several complicated legal problems involved, about which lhe Government has given us no information whatever. the Government is making this change ostensibly because it does not believe in something that it vaguely calls socialist enterprise, despite the fact, that certain public property of a particular kind is involved. If . on the other hand, the members of the Governinent are adopting the role of apostles of private enterprise in disposing of these assets. I suggest that there are recognized tests that sbould have been applied in order to determine a reasonable value for the undertaking. We have been given an overall figure of Â£.880,000, and the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) made great play on what he called the low offer of the Government of Western Australia. I suggest that what should concern the members of this Parliament, as the trustees of public property, is not how low certain estimates were, but what is in fact a reasonable price for the Government to ask for these assets, treating them as a going concern, and realizing that they include a franchise to farm 500 whales a year. We realistically. What we are doing is selling this enterprise to a private concern known as the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited. In order to see the picture clearly, we should consider the financial history of this company, and its financial position at the present time. In the Melbourne Stock Exchange Record of the 29th March, 1956, the 10s. shares of the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited were quoted at a selling price of 24s. 6d. to yield 8.16 per cent. In the month that has intervened sinct the publication of the Stock Exchang,. Record the shares of that company have increased in price from 24s. 6d. to 27s. Apparently, the people who are interested in speculation upon the stock market are of the opinion that the No r ' West Whaling Company Limited w ill, as a result of the deal being made by this Government, be a better commercial enterprise. That point should be appreciated to begin with. The second point that should be considered-and here I am applying whai might be called the private enterprise I suggest that method of approach-is that if any one of us, as an individual in the community, wished to buy into the No r ' West Whaling Company Limited, which at the moment is paying dividends of 20 per cent., he would not buy in at 10s. a share, but at a price that would give a yield of 8.16 per cent. The figures that I shall give to the House after the adjournment w ill indicate that this Government is offering the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited the right to take over this going concern at a figure that will yield it 20 per cent. In other words-, there is a difference between the yield that could be expected by any outside person wishing to buy into the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, and what can be expected by that company when it obtains this public asset at the price that this Government is prepared to accept. I shall develop that, argument later. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. that what was involved here was not merely a collection of assets, a certain should look at the problem physical situation with a present book value of Â£809,000, but the fact that attached to those assets is a licence, a",44,Whaling Industry Act Repeal Bill 1956 Second Readino
144,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [5.63j.,,45,Whaling Industry Act Repeal Bill 1956 Second Readino
145,Mr Crean,"I suggested earlierkind of monopoly, originally vested in the Government. What, in fact, is being done is to transfer the whaling franchise to one concern, the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited. I indicated earlier that the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited has a paid-up capital of Â£270,000 and for the past four or five years it has been paying dividends at the rate of 20 per cent., or an aggregate amount of Â£54,000 a year. The shares of the company are 10s. shares, and at the 29th March last they were quoted on the Melbourne stock exchange at 24s. 6d. each, which gave at that stage what investors call, a yield of 8.16 per cent. Since negotiated, apparently in anticipation that it will be a better deal for the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited in the future, the shares have risen until at the moment they are quoted on the Melbourne stock exchange at 26s. 6d. and sometimes at 27s. I suggest that since this Government of Â£300,000 plus a mortgage, if I might is taking a doctrinaire stand on what it put it that way, to the Government at calls socialization, honourable members on the rate of 5J per cent. this side of the House are entitled to ask what kind of standards ought to be applied in assessing the value of this kind of social philosophy is it that says undertaking.

Tbere are plenty of They comprised floating assets that are cases in existence on well-established listed as stock Â£30,563, debtors Â£1,2S5, and cash and bonds Â£291,509, a total of principles to determine what the value Â£323,357. The fixed assets comprise of a transaction like this would be if plant and machinery Â£200,339, crafts the reverse were taking place, that is if and vehicles Â£122,872, buildings Â£23,883 the Government, let us say, was taking and furniture and fittings Â£1,114, a total over the Nor' West Whaling Companyof Â£34S,208. Â£671,565. What is taking place here is that the precedents so far as the reverse is concash and bonds that the Nor' West Whalcerned. My colleague the honourable ing Company Limited holds, totalling member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) roughly Â£300,000, are to be applied appaaptly pointed out here last night that, rently as the down payment on the goif assets belonging to a private individual vernment undertaking, of which the total are being compulsorily acquired by the price is Â£880,000. I point out to the Commonwealth, he has the right under House, firstly, that the Nor' West Whalthe Constitution to what is called just ing Company Limited, as a result of a compensation. down payment of Â£300,000, is to have the apparently silent on a transaction of this full use of public assets valued conservakind, but because there is silence there tively at Â£880,000. At that stage it does not own those assets. It has an equity only of approximately one-third of the total value. Apparently in the name of something that is called private enterprise, to enable this transaction to take place the Government will receive 5Â£ percent, on the approximate Â£600,000 outstanding, but by the use of those Â£600,000 of assets in combination with the other Â£300,000, or in round figures Â£900,000, the company will get a substantial return before taxation. I , for one, use the basis of profits before taxation has been deducted. In my this transaction has been opinion, a company has no more right to talk about its income after taxation than has any individual in the community. A certain income is earned and if it is over a stated level the Government is entitled to levy taxes upon it. It is conservatively estimated that this company will derive Â£200,000 in profits, in round figures, before taxation, on an initial investment I ask the House in all seriousness what to give it to a private company that canThe total assets are Limited rather than, as here, a handback of public enterprise into private bands. There are plenty of established The Constitution is should be at least an indication by the Governnient of the principles involved in arriving at the selling price. The suggestion has been made that there were two kinds of valuation. I submit that the Government ought to have indicated the basis on which the valuation had been arrived at because, to use the words of the Ministerf o r Trade( Mr McEwen), there were considerable variations in two of the valuations. One gentleman placed the value of the assets at Â£760,000; another placed it at Â£954,000. The Minister said that when the matter was looked at, it was found that the real argument was about something called company taxation. He is strangely silent as to what kind of company taxation was involved and on what anticipated profit it was estimated. What is happening here is that the No r ' West Whaling Company Limited, in its existing entity, will be able to continue, as before, to pay this 20 per cent, dividend to its existing shareholders without calling upon the resources of this concern at all, but as an aggregate it w ill receive an additional Â£200,000 per anum, approximately. I use the round figure of Â£200,000 because I think it w ill be conceded that it is reasonable in the circumstances. Last year, on a catch of 600 whales, the profit was Â£225,000. This year the quota is to be reduced, but I have it on reasonably good authority that for the year ending the 30th June, 1956, the profit on a catch of 500 whales can be computed to be of the order of Â£200,000. Assuming that it is Â£200,000 a year, let us consider now the question of company taxation. A t the new rates of company taxation, the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited will pay an additional Â£S0^000 of taxation, on that Â£200,000. This w ill leave to the company a clear Â£120,000 a year whicli it w ill have acquired for a down payment of Â£300,000 and a mortgage for the remainder of the purchase price at 5Â£ per cent. I submit that that is what this transaction comes to when it is analysed. TheN o r ' Westcompany is not increasing its capital at this stage, so f a r as I can make out. It is not making a fresh issue of capital. It is making the Â£300,000 down payment out of the assets it has already accumulated. On its existing undertaking, it w ill still be able to pay the Â£54,000 of dividends each year. I think its profits last year were approximately Â£120,000, and, after paying taxation and dividends, it was still able to put a considerable amount into reserve. Assuming that it pays no additional dividend, the immediate shareholders w ill he no worse off, and the company will receive money that formerly went into the Commonwealth Exchequer. Of the profits of Â£200,000 a year, Â£80,000 w ill certainly go to the Commonwealth in taxation, but the other Â£120,000 w ill become the. property of the Nor' West company, which, apparently, in each of the first two years, is to pay back Â£120,000 of the capital sum remaining. I ask the Housei n all seriousness: What kind of business arrangement is this? Cani t be conceived as anything other than the giving of favouritism of a rather doubtful kind to a very fortunate group of people in the community' by giving them, in effect, the right to earn an additional Â£120,000 a year, and saying to them, "" We are prepared to take that back, at the end of the year, as the instalment you owe us "" ? involved ? lionorable member Avhen he spoke, and I ask hi m to allow me to develop my argument, which it is rather difficult to advance in a heated atmosphere. A f t e r two years, the fixed assets position of the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited w ill be Â£540,000 better in consequence. It will have transformed its own accumulated Â£300,000 into the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission. The surplus profits w ill have been used to pay off part of the remaining debt. A p parently, the company hopes to pay back the other Â£360.000 or so that w ill remain outstanding after two or tliree years. I suggest that, by that time, it w ill probably be able to go on the market and float additional shares for that amount. What will really happen w ill be that a capital appreciation of no mean order w ill go entirely to the existing shareholders of the Nor' West company. If the Government is prepared to allow that",45,Whaling Industry Act Repeal Bill 1956 Second Readino

147,Mr Ceean,"I did not interrupt thesort of thing to happen in the disposal of public assets, it should at least be honest about it. It is easy enough for the honourable member for Forrest, the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) and the Cleaver) to say there was no one else in the field offering to buy the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission. Technically, if a sound commercial pi'ice, payable on reasonable termsGovernment supporters say that is the test-ha d been asked, there would have been no one at all in the field. The Government is giving a particular company an opportunity because it happened to make the highest offer, but it was not necessarily obliged to accept any offer if 'the quotes were inadequate. I mentioned earlier that a person, not at present a shareholder of the Nor' West -""Whaling Company Limited, who wants to buy into that company, must pay 24's. for a 10s. share. The Government, in effect, is selling the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission to the company at the equivalent of par. member quarrel with the official valuations ? of valuation. It is not easy to determine what a reasonable basis ought to be in circumstances such as this. There is, at least, some doubt about it, but there is no doubt in my mind that the Nor' ""West company has received a bargain. In this sense, the bargain means the expropriation of public property into the hands of a select private group. Western Australian Governnient honest? I made at first: The Government, in this instance, is disposing not only of physical assets but also of public propertythe government-controlled right to. take 500 whales, which was given to the Australian Government for the benefit of the Australian people under an international agreement. If that right were sold to the Western Australian Government, at least the public side of the disis recognized in this country as an position, namely, the franchise, would go into another set of public hands, not into private hands. that be? in all seriousness, and the House, to consider the figure of Â£809,000 cited by the the written-down value of the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission in its last balance-sheet. Even that figure is open to some doubt at the moment. It is doubtful whether those assets could be provided in similar condition for Â£809,000 to-day. However, assuming that that is the correct figure, do Government supporters seriously suggest that the value of the right to farm 500 whales, which is public property, and which, on present figures, gives a gross return of Â£600,000 and a clear net profit of Â£200,000, is only Â£81,000 ? To my mind, it is not so much the assets that are important. The franchise is the important thing. I emphasize the word "" franchise "" because I do not think there is any getting away from the fact that it is public property. What is important is the exercise of that franchise in conthe honourable junction with the physical assets of the Australian Whaling Commission. Let us assume that, after allowing for taxation, the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited will receive Â£120,000 clear from the exercise of that franchise in conjunction with those assets. That is a return of 12 per cent, or 15 per cent. What would Government supporters, as apostles of private enterprise, pay for a concern that would return them a certain Â£120,000 clear after the payment of taxation? I suggest that they would pay far more than Â£880,000. As I said earlier, this is not a matter about which one can be dogmatic. Certain precedents are established for evaluing concerns in respect of which no share price is quoted on the stock exchange.

159,"The Moral, Political, And Mr Chaney (Perth) [S.30j","Thisdays of the year never think of the western State, now have their attention focussed on one small part of the west, and that some of the statements that they have made are far removed from the truth. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr initiative of the Australian people. They Pollard) said that the Government's original intention in the establishment of this whaling station was to assist in the development of the north-west of Western Australia. Whatever may . have been achieved by the Australian Whaling Commission at Babbage Island, it has not done a thing to further the development of the district in which the Babbage Island station was constructed. During the whole period of the operations of the commission, the yearly population of the area has not increased by more than one or two people. The benent to the district has been nil and the real objective in the establishment of the whaling station has been achieved in the fact that it has been proved that whaling can be carried on with some success off the coast of Western Australia. But it should be borne in mind that thc Australian Whaling Commission was not the first in this field. The company that has received so much criticism from the Opposition during this debate, the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, was founded and brought to a successful stage in its career by a type of men with an increased .number of whom this country would be better off. The honourable member for Lalor called them men of straw. I remind him that when a certain British general was declared to be mad, a sovereign said, "" If he is mad, I wish that using a plant that was not to be compared he would bite some of my other generals "". If the men behind the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited are men of straw, it is a pity that we have not a far greater numfirst and I think that when it was formed ber of them in Australia. I invite honourable members to look at their achievements and compare it with the achievement of the Australian Whaling Commission which had the unlimited resource of the Government behind it. .The men who founded the'Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, had had little experience in whaling at the time that the company started its operations. The principals of the firm had been engaged in shipwrieht engineering and they took over an old station that had been abandoned by the Norwegians, I think in the 1920's, after an unsuccessful attempt to start a whaling industry. Starting from a long way behind, in a short space of time they have built up a business that is a credit to them and a credit to the have displayed a spirit that the Government should encourage, not compete with, because the duty of governments should be to act as the guardian of trade, commerce and industry and not to act as a competitor. that is held at present by the majority of the people of this country. Statements have been made to-day by members of the Opposition that made me regret that they have not been broadcast throughout Australia. It was pointed out that if a private industry took over the assets of the Australian WTialing Commission it would have the right to hire and fire. That is a right that should be held very dearly by the Australian people. Just as the people of this country have the right to hire and fire the members of this House, so that principle should operate throughout every industry in Australia. Only in that way do we get efficiency. Private enterprise has a record of far better treatment of its employees than some other undertakings that have been sponsored by governments. I return to the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited. This company started off with a quota of some 600 whales a year, with the one that had been financed by the unlimited resources of the Government. The company was heavily mortgaged at into a public company it had about 1,000 shareholders. It has been said that the sale of the government industry was not sufficiently publicized. It was stated in the debate on the proposed amendment to the Address-in-Reply that the ""Western Australian Government knew nothing about it. At that stage of the proceedings in this House, the objective of the Opposition was to bring the Western Australian Government into the market as a successful tenderer for the industry. It is strange that during the State election campaign",49,Pairs
160,Mr Ckean,That is one point of view.,50,Pairs
161,Mr Chaney,"It is a point of viewin Western Australia the official newspaper of the Australian Labour party, which has just been started over there, in its special north-west edition, contained a statement that the honourable member for Gascoygne in the Western Australian Parliament had been elected three years previously because the people did not agree with the Federal Government's idea of selling the whaling station. Commission provided a safeguard against That statement indicated that the Australian Labour party was fully aware, three years ago, of what was taking place. Yet, in this House, it has been stated that notliing was known of the Government's intention. It is a fact that the Labour party knew, everybody in Western Australia knew, and every one hi Australia should have known of the Government's intention. The Cheynes Beach Whaling Company Limited, which some honourable members have said did not have an opportunity to purchase the enterprise, knew very well that it was up for sale, but I believe that that company was not in a position to tender for it. We heard a long outburst about thi the autliority whom the honourable memprice at which the station would be sold. ber quoted if he had realized that what [ believe that the value of any commodity he had said would be applied to shares is determined by the demand for it. For in a whaling company. The fourth the purchase of this station, eight applishould have referred to "" The possible cations were received, the' prices varying continuance of that business in its present from Â£519,000 to about Â£850,000.

I have mentioned made and each of them approximated previously that in South America whales that figure. I think that that, in itself, migrated up the coast regularly, but sudis sufficient indication that the price denly disappeared. Who can say that obtained by the Government was a fair this will not happen off the coast of and just one. It is quite easy to make Western Australia? Private industry is statements based on vast sums of money prepared to take that risk in order to in an attempt to bamboozle the public, develop its asset. Many arguments now but, in his calculations, the honorput forward are the reverse of those that able member for Melbourne Ports( Mr were offered previously. Honourable memCrean) did not make any allowance for bers have heard a long discussion on the the annual interest that must be paid high protein by-products of the whale. by the Nor' West Whaling Company My figures may be a little inaccurate but Limited, as the successful tenderer. The they reveal that whale meal is landed payment of that interest will reduce the at Fremantle at about Â£57 a ton, whereas figure that was quoted by the honourable meat meal is about Â£30 a ton. If the member by Â£30,000. Now, Western Australia is still smartincreases, obviously the demand for whale ing from the effects of the oil boom, of meal will decrease. That introduce? which honourable members are all aware. another element of risk into the industry. When the oil company concerned found, at its first attempt, a supply of oil that could possibly prove of commercial value, history of the Nor' West Whaling Commany thousands of people in Western pany Limited they will recall that at first Australia had their fingers burnt in the resultant boom. They were not the big businessmen of whom we hear so much from the Opposition. Many of them were ordinary working men who invested a few shillings in the hope of a quick return for their money. The way in which the Government handled the sale of the assets of the Australian Whaling some smart ojierator offering shares on the market and catching, once again, not those who were established, but the ordinary little people who had very little money to waste on investment in shares of a doubtful character. This is the whole position. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports quoted from some authority three rules concerning the value of shares. I think that his aim was to establish the value of the assets of tlie Australian Whaling Commission. I think that a fourth rule should have been added to the three rules that he quoted, and I think that this fourth rule would have been added by supply of meat meal, which has much the same nutritive value as whale meal, If honourable members have studied the Fairmile vessels, for use as whale chasers, were purchased. Experts said that they were unsuitable but were proved wrong. In operation, the Fairmiles were highly successful but unfortunately in the first year one was wrecked on the dangerous reef-studded north-west coast. This is a further indication of the risks involved in the industry. The Nor' West Whaling Company Limited proved that little capital, combined with a high degree of efficiency, can give a return equal to that derived from large capital investment and ordinary efficiency. The capital outlay of the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited was about half that of the Australian Whaling Commission, but after three orfour years, witb similar quotas, both companies were earning a similar profit-abou t Â£200,000. However, that figure depends less on the quota of whales than on the international price of whale oil. Australia produced only 4 per cent, of the world's whale oil requirements and obviously the countries that produce the remainder have a great, deal to say about the international price. The Government established a model whaling station, as it had set out to do. A. tribute was duo to the people concerned, and the Minister paid that tribute in las second-reading speech. However, now is the time to allow private enterprise to develop the industry further. This debate has been closely tied up with that on the Fishing Industry Bill, which proposes to set up a trust fund for the benefit of the industry. I believe that the majority of Western Australians are either totally disinterested in the sale duced to undertake a 30-day voyage for of the Australian Whaling Commission's asset, or are in agreement with what this Government has done. Western Australians generally will be glad to know that the Commonwealth will soon have available funds and plans for the development of the fishing industry off their coast, for of all the States Western Australia most needs this development. Even though Western Australia supplies about 60 per cent, of the crayfish tails sent to America from this country, the crayfish boats at Geraldton operate from a tiny jetty which is so inadequate that if one boat is tied up the others have to keep away. This product alone brings 1,500,000 valuable dollars to this country each year. There, surely, is an avenue for assistance of the kind contemplated under the Fishing Industry Bill. I should like to pay a tribute to the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) for inaugurating, when Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, the Fisheries Newsletter. That publication is now carried on under the administration of the Minister for Primary Industry tains a reference to the tuna catches made by the Japanese in the Indian Ocean. At present Australia is importing 50 per cent, of its fish requirements. If we could develop the tuna industry off the coast of Western Australia we could not only reduce our imports but also increase our exports. The Fisheries Newsletter contains the following report:Japanese tuna long-line fishermen arc getting catches of 12-14 yellowfin per 100 hooks in the western Indian Ocean. This is a much higher catch rate than they get on any otlier grounds (says US. Fishery Products Report). The 750-ton Seiju St aru returned to Shimizu (Japan) with a f u l l load of 425 tons of tuna after an 80-day trip that extended ncross the Indian Ocean to the vicinity of tlie African coast. The average day's catch was 12 tons of yellowfin. It was expected that the proceeds of the voyage would amount to Â£4.0,000 and that crew members would each receive about Â£122. We should not have to undergo the long drag from Japan to the Indian Ocean, but we would need to remember that Australian fishermen, with their higher wages and standard of living, could not be inmonetary rewards that would be acceptable to Japanese. However, the fish are there to be caught and the development of our fishing industries generally is closely linked with the question of immigration. In the main, our coastal fisheries are operated by new Australians or persons of southern European descent. They are willing to work long hours for a reward that would not perhaps be attractive to Australian nations. Therefore, only good can arise from the sale to private enterprise of the Government's whaling asset. We should be the watchdogs of the public purse, and encourage industries rather than compete against them.",50,Pairs
162,( Mr Mcmahon). The March Issue Con,"The honourable member for Lalor mentioned that certain tricks were available by which a spoke could be thrown in this Government's wheel. He mentioned in particular the leasing of the land on which the whaling station stands. Whatever honourable members might think, the people of Western Australia would be quite vocal and demonstrative if they felt that their Government would, by refusing to lease the small area of land necessary, be. so parsimonious as to prevent the transaction from taking place. Honourable members should not forget that the character of the Western Australian people is slightly different from that of the people in the heavily industrialized areas of eastern Australia. Western Australians have a much better philosophy of life, and a broader outlook towards people who are prepared to do something about developing the vast unused areas of Australia. Enterprise, initiative and courage are needed in Western Australia more than they are needed now in some of the other States, where development is at a more advanced stage. I think it would be interesting to see the reaction of the people of Western Australia to any implied threat by the members of the Opposition in this House in relation to this transaction. told us earlier that they were disinterested about it in Western Australia. did. They are disinterested in the sale of the venture of the whaling commission contrary to what the honourable membei and his colleagues on the Opposition side believe. But the moment that honourable members opposite, if elected to office as a government, start to pull on some of their tricks, they will find that the interest of the people of Western Australia in this matter will grow apace, and that it will be an interest that will react badly against some members of them. I notice that a phophesy was made that of the Government in this sale. As we the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited -have listened to speaker after speaker on would, or could, in all probability become the opposite side of the House the difinsolvent in twelve months. Whom do ferences that lie between the supporters honourable members opposite expect to of the Government and the members of believe that a company such as the Nor' the Labour party have become ever West Whaling Company Limited would clearer to all of us. But there is at least become insolvent in twelve months, wheone member on the Government side who is a mere study of the history of its operations will convince them that it will probably get a far greater return out of the purchase that it has made than was ever derived from that undertaking before. I wish to make only one more comment before I conclude. It has been mentioned that the station was built mainly with war disposals materials. That is quite true. Some of the disposals materials came from the former power alcohol plant that was constructed in the south-west of Western Australia, at a cost, I think, of Â£1,500,000 of public money, and from which not one gallon of power alcohol was ever taken. E realize that it might be argued that, having wasted Â£1,500,000 in that direction, we should try to get it back in another direction. Western Australians are aware of this fact. I suppose if the war had lasted longer than it did we might have got a gallon or so of petrol out of that plant, but my point is that it is foolish to compare the operations of one company with those of another. In any case, we must realize that because the whaling station was built from disposals materials mainly derived from that power plant we got a valuable asset which was built largely of materials from an undertaking that was no longer used. I shall conclude in the same strain as that in which I started, with the hope that it will be borne in mind that the Opposition's attack does not centre on the sale of the Australian Whaling Commission's enterprise-because , after all, the Government made its intentions quite clear in that regard long ago. It revolves around the purpose of government, and we should be quite certain in our own minds that we know the real purpose of government, and have the courage to carry out that purpose. is what we are here for-to carry out the purpose of the Labour party, which is to fight tooth and nail the outrageous acts",52,Pairs

I think we can estimate its value at anything up to Â£500,000. So we can say that, at a conservative estimate, this station is worth perhaps Â£1,500,000 as a going concern. After all, a taxi plate in Melbourne is worth Â£1,000 or Â£1,200. That is the value of the plate only. It does not include the value of a taxi-cab, the price of which Let us suppose that shares were issued. one of the principles of private enterprise, in praises of which they are so For eighteen months, it a great, deal more tban that, but these showing enterprise.

In the third year, Â£290,000 will be paid. We were told in the debate on that smokescreen called the Fishing Industry something or other bill that the Government requires this money to develop the fishing industry, but we are giving away assets worth, at a conservative estimate, Â£1,000,000 for what amounts to only Â£130,000 in cash more than we should have got if we had kept them. No matter what methods or arithmetic we use, no matter what sophistry we use, no matter what technical jargon from the share market we employ, the fact remains that the total net return to the Government on this transaction will be about Â£130,000, over what it would have received in three years' profit if we retained the station. These people will get the station for a deposit of Â£350,000. They will earn almost that sum in profits on the first year's operations. Out of profits, they will be able to pay the rest of the money, and at the end of the period they will have assets worth Â£1,000,000. This sale is indefensible, even as a business proposition. Honourable members opposite believe in the principles of private enterprise. All that we ask is that, as trustees of the assets of the people, the members of the Government should adopt in relation to the sale of public assets the same principles as they would adopt in relation to the sale of their own assets. This is not, a sound proposition, from whatever point of view it is regarded, and there is no way in which the Government can dodge its responsibility for it. We shall ensure that the people of Australia will not forget what has happened. The whole transaction is fraught with danger. The Government is getting rid of the people's assets. While it is getting rid of one undertaking, why does it not, get rid of the lot? What is wrong with selling Trans-Australia Airlines? member for Batman has stated, that will be the next. Why should those other undertakings be protected? They are being protected because they are nearer than are the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission, which are 2,000 miles from the great centres of population and most of the people who own it do not know a great deal about them. Supporters of the Government have never told them about the undertaking, and Opposition members have not the resources to do so. Every day in every capital city public enterprise in the form of Trans-Australia Airlines is showing the people that it can do a better job than can private enterprise. That is especially true of undertakings established by Labour men who followed Labour traditions and knew what they wanted. Within a few years of the establishment of those undertakings we have seen the monuments of private enterprise crying for mercy. If the present Government had not been returned to office certain private enterprises would have been bankrupt financially, just as the Government is bankrupt politically. lions of pounds lost on other undertakings ? afraid to touch Trans-Australia Airlines. When such questions are posed, the Minister for Trade leaps to his feet and says, "" Because that is our policy "". The right honourable gentleman knows that the disposal of such undertakings as Trans-Australia Airlines would sound the death-knell of the Government parties. Even though I like them personally, if honourable members opposite were to tell the people of the advantages of public enterprise, they would not remain in office very long. I direct the attention of honourable members to the concluding paragraphs on the first page of the roneoed copy of the sixth annual report of the Australian Whaling Commission. The fact that the renort is roneoed shows that not very much money has been expended in publicity.

I could easily use niy time by reading, for the benefit or tbe personal profit of supporters of the Government, the rest of the report, but I shall not do so. The establishment of this station is a classical example of what the Labour party, or the socialist party if honourable members prefer that word, has done to provide for private industry not only an incentive, but also a model that has been followed during its six years of existence. It is one example of the various ways in which public enterprise has outstripped private enterprise and has shown it how to do the job. I object to honourable members opposite leaping to their feet and talking about the Australian way of life. They know nothing about it . In particular, the statutory corporation was an Australian invention. history of the statutory corporation is a little vague, it is generally conceded that it was an Australian invention or development. This is pointed out in the report of tbe Public Accounts Committee on the Aluminium Comniission which quotes the establishment of the Statu Savings Bank of Victoria in 1SS1 as its example. examples of the contribution of the Australian Labour party to the Australian way of life. Our contribution has been creative and constructive, while that of honourable members opposite has been destructive. If the Government had its way, it would hand over our assets, our resources, and eventually the control of our welfare to irresponsible private enterprise. with such matters can lie only with the elected Parliament, but the Barliameiit is being ignored by the Government, not only in relation to the handing over of our assets, but also in the cavalier manner in wbich the Minister for Trade has treated it . I object to that attitude, and L and my colleagues w ill ensure over the next three years that more tlian 2,000,000 other Australians object to it also. I rise to support this measure for reasons original legislation in 1949. I am glad that the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) has reminded me of that fact. When the original legislation was introduced, I described the establishment of this whaling station as being a further venture by the socialists without giving private enterprise a chance. I was described by the present meinber for Lalor( Mr Pollard), who was then Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, as being one of the reactionaries-in fact, the reactionary-of the Parliament, t am glad to be here now to see this Government, at long last, getting rid of the undertaking. The statement by the honourable member for Lalor this afternoon that the rehabilitation of the Point Cloates plant was impracticable is a further indication of the fact that it was the intention of the Australian Labour party, in Although the 1949, and still is, if given the chance, to prevent private enterprise from having an opportunity to engage in the whaling industry. TbeN o r' West Whaling Company Limited has proved most conclusively during the period that the Australian Whaling Commission has been in operation that, not only has it been able to rehabilitate the Point Cloates pro.Such organizations are ject, but also that it has been able to build up a most successful business in competition with the Commonwealth's undertaking. Those honourable mcmbers who have taken auy interest in this venture will recall that the first Fairmilc vessel owned by the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited ran on tbe rocks, as mentioned by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney).

178,"Minister F O R Trade ( Mr Mcewen), Who","I hope that I do not do an injustice to the honourable member for Wills, but I think he said that this Government had deliberately kept the sale of the whaling station secret. That statement is further evidence of the division in Labour's ranks, not only in the Parliament, but abo from one end of Australia to the other. The new Labour paper that is published in Western AustraliaI forget the name of it-ha s clearly stated, with bold headlines, that three years ago Mr Norton, the meniber for the State electorate of Gascoyne, in which Carnarvon is situated, won his seat because of the objection of the people in that area to the sale by the Commonwealth of the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission. Tet the honourable member for Wills stands up in this chamber to-night and says, with all the sang froid in the world, that this sale has been kept secret. Honourable members of the Opposition know as well as any one else in Australia that when the Government went to the people in 1949 it told them quite plainly that its intention was to desocialize industry in this country. Then, in 1952, in a public statement, the present Minister for Trade Australian Whaling Commission for sale to any one who was interested. The undertaking was offered even to the then Western Australian Government, but it was not interested. As was pointed out during the debate on the Address-inEeply to the Governor General's Speech, when this matter was brought up by moans of an amendment, the present Premier of Western Australia, knew of this offer by the Australian Government to the Western Australian Government. If he did not know, he is not a. fit and capable person to be the Premier of a State, because he must have had access to the Government's records and its files. The matter of the sale of this undertaking was used merely for purposes of political propaganda on the eve of the recent election in Western Australia. The figures that have been given this evening by speakers on the Opposition side are a further evidence of the division in the Labour party. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr The honourable member went further and Crean) gave quite a treatise on finanop. and he concluded by saying that the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, after paying taxation and other charges, would make a profit of Â£120,000 a year. I think I am correct in saying that when the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) was speaking he mentioned the matter of interest, and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports nodded his head in assent. However, the honourable member for Wills quite recently told us that the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited would make at least Â£200,000 profit in a year. bers on the other side of the House should get together on these matters if they wish to contribute anything worthwhile to our debates. But perhaps they are in a similar position to some of their colleagues in Sydney at this very moment. At least they have not made any concerted attack on the Government's proposals. They have merely given a clear demonstration that they are members of a definite socialist party, a party which is socialist through thick and thin, and proposes to be so in the years to come. The honourable gentleman who took the opportunity of leading the debate for the Opposition used some very strong language in this Parliament. He spoke about phony deals, and he used other adjectives that I shall not endeavour to recall. One thing he said was that this Government had, over the years, been white-anted, and that it had cracked up under pressure and had agreed to sell this venture. If there is one gentleman In this Parliament who knows that statement to be false, it is the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), who made the statement to-day. honourable member who should know that that statement is false, it is the honorablo. member for Lalor, who made it.

I say the Government can do a service to the poultryfarmers in Western Australia by clearing up this insidious propaganda that is being circulated. I know where it is coming from. an interested party to try to stir up strife and create fear in the minds of the poultry-farmers. I ask the Minister, before this debate is concluded, to have their interests watched, and see that whale meal will not be exported to America to the detriment of the poultryfarmers in Western Australia. I support this bill 100 per cent, because I am sticking to my guns as I did in 1949. The sooner the deal is completed, the better for the country. to oppose this bill. In doing so, I regret that the constant interruptions in the speecli by the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) seem to have achieved their purpose, because it is extremely diflicult to discover what the speech was about. The main point seems to be that the intention of the Government to sell tlie assets of the Australian Whaling Commission was well known, and to support this, the suggestion is made, for the second time in this debate, that a Labour newspaper in Western Australia publisbed a statenient that the intention of the Government to sell the whaling station had influenced an election result. Of course, the Western Australian Labour paper probably said that. It could also say that there are strong suspicions that the Government intends to sell the vessels of the Commonwealth shipping line, or that the Government intends to sell the assets of Trans-Australia Airlines. But would that mean that fair notice had been given to otber buyers if, in a week's time, the Government brought to this House a proposal, I am glad of that which it had not taken the trouble to explain to the House for the sale of Trans-Australia Airlines to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited? That is analogous with what has taken place in this case. Let me see what the evidence supports. It is not the habit of the honourable member for Canning to refer to evidence in his speeches, but T want to refer to the evidence, and he can check it for himself. When this Parliament first assembled for this session, there were whispers in the corridors and elsewhere that the Government proposed to sell the whaling station, that the Government proposed to sell it to the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited. Before very long, there were whispers that the price was not going to be more than Â£800,000. In this case there was not only inadequate notice of the Government's intention to sell, but there was inadequate notice of its intention to sell to the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, and that seems to have been its intention all the time.

If that is so, why did the Government not answer the questions asked by the Opposition, to which I have just referred ? If it had announced its intentions in November, 1952, why was it not willing to state them in this House on the 15th, the 16th and the 29th February? On the 29tb February, the Leader of the Opposition again took action because the Oppositiou bad not succeeded in obtaining any definite information. He asked tbe Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) a question about the Western Australian Government in relation to this matter. The Treasurer chose to give no informaof order in an attempt to prevent the Trade. Is this the attitude of a goWe had proposed to consider whatever offersI have suggested to the Prime Minister that Government's intentions had literally to said. . . the Leader of the Opposition (DT. has been badgering me . . . Of course the Leader of the Opposition hacl been badgering him. The Opposition had to badger the Government for nearly throe weeks in order to get this information: so it is true that the Minister for Trade had been badgered. What was the alternative to this badgering? But the alternative for the Opposition was to give up its responsibilities in safeguarding the public assets of the Australian people. The alternative open to the Government in this matter was not to continue in this fashion but to make, in this Parliament, a clear statement that it intended to sell the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission, and to advertise in the press and elsewhere, properly calling tenders for the purchase of those assets. But, on the 29tb February, the Government stated that offers would be received up to the end of February. It was not, and never had been, the Government's wish to make its intentions -clear, as I think I have demonstrated. VVhat were its intentions? I suggested at the outset that it intended to sell the assets -of the Australian Whaling Commission to the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited as quietly as possible. This is further evidenced by a particular transaction to which I shall refer. A representative of the West Australian Whaling Company visited Canberra on the 13th March, 1956, and I understand that he was introduced to the private secretary to the Minister for Trade by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney). This company made two alternative offers. The first was an offer to buy a 49 per cent, interest in the Carnarvon whaling station for Â£400,000 in cash, a considerably greater amount of cash than will b> obtained from the transaction upon which the Government has embarked, and to leave a 51 per cent, interest in the station with the Commonwealth. It made an alternative offer of Â£S50,000, which, so far as I can make out, was a cash offer. Otherwise, it offered Â£100,000 deposit, and more, if necessary, with ten annual payments of Â£100,000, making the total payment Â£1,100,000, of which Â£227,826 represented interest. from the proposal accepted by the Government. cant point. I am veiy pleased at that interjection. This may very well be the link between the present price and the sale. It would have given a net return of Â£872,174, a little less than Â£8,000 less than the offer from the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited which was accepted. Despite the fact, that all this time the offer which the company was supposed to have made was said to be no more than Â£800,000. within a few days an offer of Â£880,000 was made, a little more than Â£8,000 above the largest offer by an alternative buyer. Does this not suggest that there was a possible conveyance of information about the otlier offer during those few days?

A substantial group of Melbourne businessmen, as soon as the information had been obtained by them, entered the field, prepared to make a substantial offer for the assets of the Australian Whaling Commission, but tbey were not able to do so because the Government had chosen, on the 29th February when it made this statement, to close the receipt of offers for the station. Other intending buyers were given little information and little assistance, but the shareholders of the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, from tbe very beginning, have been the favoured few, 1,000 lucky people who are getting an asset worth at least, on a conservative estimate, from Â£1,200,000 to Â£1,500,000, for a mere Â£880,000. This method of doing business has resulted iu the sale of a substantial asset belonging to the people of Australia for a greatly undervalued figure.

I feel a little sorry for the outlook of honourable members who represent -the Australian Labour party. the last four occasions that the people of Anstralia have been asked to vote for a government they have placed this Government in power. On all four occasions the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has told the people in his policy speech that he will not bother with State trading. That is pretty clear. The statements that have been made by the honourable member for Lalor, the honourable member for Yarra and other honourable gentlemen to the effect that the people had not been told about the sale of this enterprise is so much hooey. The people have been told of the Government's intentions on each of the last four occasions on which the Government appealed to the people prior to a general election. Furthermore, the matter has been given such prominence in Australia that no fewer than eight companies have made -offers for the purchase of this station. It is most remarkable that eight offers should have been made for a large enterprise such as this. The fact that those offers have been received proves that the Government has very widely publicized its intention to sell this industry. The honourable member for Lalor questioned the propriety of selling this station, Ithat and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) claimed that it had will bring into this country the same been sold in an underhand manner.

The Government is not anxious to take over enterpriser, valuer estimated the value to be Â£954,000 even a whaling station, so'in Queensland always high. Nevertheless, the Government was able to sell the enterprise for Â£8S0,000, which was Â£260,000 more than the Western Australian Government was prepared to give. The offer that was made by the Western Australian Government was the second lowest of the offers that were made. Those offers ranged from Â£519,000 to Â£880,000. The argument of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports falls to the ground completely because the Government has taken all reasonable opportunities of On ensuring that it got full value for the enterprise. Who is there to doubt that, in view of the profits that have been made from time to time by the station, the amount of Â£880,000 is not a fair and reasonable price ? There is no one to say that it is not fair and reasonable. After all, the true value of a proposition is its market value. There can be no gainsaying that the Government has taken every step to see that the full market price was secured for the Carnarvon whaling station, which was built for the purpose of proving that shore-based whaling stations could be successful. Up to the time at which this station was constructed, the whaling industry had been carried in big ships. The Government was able to show that by means of a shore-based station it could set up an industry that would provide work for people. The effect of this legislation will not be to abolish the whaling station. The same number of whales, 500 a year, will be processed at the station in the years to come as has been processed in the past. The private company which has purchased the station will be able to process the same number of whales as was processed by the Australian Whaling Commission. t will employ the same number of men is now employed in the work.

233,( Mr Mcewen) Has Told Us To The Effect,"the Labour Government will not take over Tangalooma whaling station but encourages private enterprise to carry on the undertaking. Labour Government has done more to establish State enterprises than any other Labour government in Australia. In 1914 when a Labour government first came to power in Queensland it set out to socialize everything on which it could lay hands. It bought businesses such as cattle stations, sugar mills, butchers' shops, hotels, saw-mills, and brickworks for the purpose of carrying on State enterprises. Then, after it had started these enterprises, it prepared a book entitled Socialism at Work, in which it laid out the whole of those enterprises as a pretty picture on paper. But it was not long before all those enterprises made losses of over Â£4,000,000. That Â£4,000,000 had to be paid by the people of Queensland by way of increased taxation because at that time taxation was levied by the States and not through the uniform taxation system. The people of Queensland know, just as the Labour party of Queensland knows, that State enterprise cannot be a success in a country in which the people believe in their individual freedom to trade. If there is any country in the world in which day have to meet the losses on another individual enterprise is sought it is in this free country of Australia and the Labour party in Queensland cannot be dragged into a State enterprise of any description. As a matter of fact, the Oppositiou, tralia and Tasmania have Labour governas far as it has gone, has indicated that ments, but in none of these States is people from Victoria, like honourable government enterprise being developed. members from Victoria, are the only ones Why then should this Government, whicb in the Labour party who desire to mainis not socialistic in outlook, continue to tain a State enterprise which the Western encourage state ownership?

The by-products of that industry areavailable to the people of Queensland and of Australia, just as are those from Western Australia. Whaling is a seasonal 1 occupation, and by no means permanent. Indeed, it offers limited opportunities. The honourable member for Yarra saidi that each of the Australian whaling stations could process only a certain number of whales each year. In Queensland the number is 600; and at Carnarvon it is 500. Though the whaling industry offers limited opportunities, the fishingindustry generally offers unlimited scope. That is why this Government is endeavouring to develop it. We hope that its produce will find a market both in this country and overseas, thus bringing to Australia a dollar income that will be of great assistance to us. I can understand why Labour supporters, who are socialistic in outlook, should be depressed that this station is being sold, but the people look to us to quit the trading field, knowing that otherwise they may some government undertaking.

I advanced those reasons earlier in this debate. They were reinforced substantially and effectively by defunct whaling station. They were able the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) and emphasized in detail for Yarra( Mr Cairns). One of the outstanding reasons is the evasion practised by this Government, aud its unwillingness to seek the best tender available. It did not give the fullest publicity to this matter and there is every reason why an impartial authority such as the Public Accounts Committee should investigate every aspect of the proposed sale to Nor' ""West Whaling Company Limited. After all, this asset is, on the Government's own admission, worth substantially more than â¬1,000,000, yet not one advertisement has appeared in the daily or evening press of the last twelve months intimating that this great people's asset is to be sold and tenders invited for its purchase. member suggest that any one in the entering the industry from scratch, as whaling industry did not know that the commission's asset was for sale? why the right to purchase should have been the prerogative of some one already in the whaling industry? The Moore family, before entering the whaling industry in 1943-44, knew nothing of whaling stations or the catching of whales. One must acknowledge the great capacity Mr Failes interjecting, you! You have been absent from the chamber all the evening during thi:debate, but now you come in and want to make a damned nuisance of yourself. That is what he has done. The Moore family, in other words the centre of the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited, knew nothing about operating or establishing whaling stations, or catching whales. I have paid tributes to that family. They were a family, I understand, that operated a foundry. They had a knowledge of the engineering industry and, as most engineers usually are, they were versatile people. By virtue of that fact they were in the position to put into practice the rehabilitation of a to accumulate information from other sources, I do not know what sources, and by the honourable member they decided to attempt, and actually performed,fcheremarkable feat of restoring that defunct whaling station to useful life. In doing so they probably did something that nobody else could have done. My reply to the Minister, for Customs and Excise, when he asks whetlier I think that nobody in the whaling game knew about this proposed sale, is what about people iu this day and generation situated as the Moore brothers were before they entered the whaling industry? The Moore brothers had not previously been in the whaling game, but, because of their engineering capacity and their natural abilities, of which the Minister for Customs and Excise apparently knows nothing, they were able to make a go of it.

I hope that I shall not be deprived of the opportunity to point out that on every Friday, and probably every Saturday, every daily journal in Australia carries advertisements, on which the Government spends thousands of pounds, announcing sales to be held at various centres in the respective States to dispose of old Army junk and other more valuable products. Those are extensive, and expensive, advertisements. Every item that is for sale is publicized in detail. Yet, in regard to an asset which is valued at more than Â£1,000,000. but which in actual fact, in terms of replacement value, has a value probably nearer to Â£4,000,000, not one solitary advertisement has been inserted by the Government in any morning or evening newspaper anywhere in Australia. Let that sink well in ! Honorahle members interjecting, Honourable members will cease interjecting. Deputy Speaker. Let that strange fact sink well into the minds of the Government. Why, on the one hand, in reference to tlie sale of relatively paltry articles belonging to the Government, and tlierefore to the public, does the Government spend thousands of pounds in advertisements in the daily press all over the Oommonwealth, whilst, in regard to the disposal of an asset valued at more than Â£1,000,000, and with a true value of probably Â£3,000,000 or Â£4,000,000, not one single solitary line appears in anydaily newspaper announcing the salenot a solitary penny is spent by the Government on any newspaper advertisement to acquaint the citizens of Australia with the fact that this enterprise is availadvertising mediums of the press were able for purchase? And the Minister for Customs and Excise asks whether 1 am suggesting that the people; interested in whaling did not know about the proposed sale! There are other people besidesthose engaged in whaling who might, be interested in it, and surely they have a right to know of the availability for sale of the enterprise, and be given an opportunity to tender for it. It might as well be suggested seriously that if tbe procedure the Government has adopted in this instance is correct, when the saleof some old junk at Tottenham or Bandiana or Brisbane is proposed, the Government ought to circularize, by private circular only, marine and junk dealers, and thus save thousands of pounds that would otherwise be spent ou advertisements. But what the Government does is to publish the terms of sale of such junk all over the Commonwealth, itemizing every detail, because it knowsthat, as sure as the sun rises and sets, people like constituents of the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), who are mainly farmers, and other people in the community, are interested in all sorts of things that are sold at junk sales. I used the Moore brothers as an illustration of my point, and I think they provide a splendid illustration. There are probably many other citizens, people like the Moore brothers were before they engaged in the whaling industry, who know nothing about whaling but, given the opportunity to engage in the industry, could make a success of their venture, as the Moore brothers did. The Moores operations with greater efficiency than some of the old Norwegian stations conduct theirs. I have paid tribute in this chamber to their particular ability, which they used to rehabilitate a defunct establishment. Just as they came out of the blue, knowing nothing about the whaling industry, and made a success of their venture, other people might similarly come out of the blue and make a success of it. But no opportunity was given to any Australian taxpayer, other than the people already in the whaling industry, to know all about the proposed sale of this very valuable asset.

But I do say that the Labour party, believing this to be an outrageous transaction, will, when given an opportunity-yo u can bet your lives on this-explor e the situation to see by what manner of means the people can have restored to them the rights that are now being taken from them.

Territories) [10.32] -It seems to me that tbe House has arrived at an extraordinary situation, when we look back on the debate that has been taking place for some bours past. We were debating the motion for the second reading of the Whaling Industry Act Bepeal Bill, which contains provisions to repeal the Whaling Industry Act and to vest control of the Australian Whaling Commission's assets in the Commonwealth. It was explained at the outset of the debate that the purpose of the proposal was to put the Government in a position where it would be able to sell the commission's assets to the Nor' West Whaling Company Limited. The debate proceeded and many interesting points were made. There were differences of view in various parts of the House, as might have been expected. Honourable members opposite put forward, along traditional lines, their arguments that these were the people's assets, that the people's assets should be preserved, that That debate proceeded, if I may venamendment which is now before the",71,Pairs
270,Mr Hasluck (Curtin,"Minister forHouse, he made, by adjective and innuendo-certainl y not by means of statements that would stand examination-veile d suggestions that there was something wrong, that there was something amounting almost to malpractice, if not actually to malpractice, in the way in which the wliole of this deal had been conducted. Then he threw into the House this amendment, which suggests that, before the bill is further considered, the whole matter should be referred to the Public Accounts Committee. That is unusual. When an unusual course of that kind is taken, I submit that it is necessary for the member and the party that takes that unusual course to support their action in a convincing way. But those members who were present when the honourable member for Yarra made his speech and tliose members who were present when the honourable member for Lalor( Mr yes. Having made those vague statePollard) made his speech in support of the amendment must be amazed at the hardihood of the Opposition in coming forward, without a tittle of proof, without, a tittle of evidence, without a single shred of fact, and trying to interrupt the procedures of the House in this unusual manner. They have nothing whatsoever io support the unusual course which they propose the House should take. It is quite open to the honourable member for Yarra to move and the honourable member for Lalor to second an amendment of this kind, but surely, when they interrupt the customary procedures of the House in this manner, they owe it to the House to produce some convincing proof that there is something to investigate. Go back to the speech made by the honourable member for Yarra. Tbere was not a very full attendance in the House IIt that time. Being a member of the Opposition, he had the privilege of not being subjected to a call for a quorum. If he had been subjected to a call for a quorum, his speech would certainly have been interrupted while a larger number of members assembled. Those few of us who had the pain of listening to him recall quite clearly that what he did in liis speech was to follow a technique with which we are familiar in other circles outside the Parliament, but with which, happily, we are not so familiar in ibe Parliament. It is this: You start off with a rumour and you turn that rumour into a suspicion. Having done that, you have reached the point where you say, "" This is what may have happened"". Then, having reached that point, yo,u say, ""That is the fact on which I build my case."" The honourable member for Yarra followed that well-known technique. He suggested that some one had introduced somebody to somebody else, or that it was said that somebody had done that. was denied flatly by interjection at the time he made the statement. it? ments, having made the suggestion that there was something wrong, he turned his own suggestion, his own doubt, his own rumour, into the fact on whicli he based bis ease. Tbat is not good enough for a parliamentary procedure. If a member wishes the Parliament to take action of the kind proposed in this amendment, surely he must support his case with something more than turning a rumour into a fact, something more than parading a number of adjectives or trotting out a great deal of innuendo. The poverty of the speecb of the honourable member for Yarra was exposed in an even more emphatic manner by the speech just made by the honourable member for Lalor. In part, the. speech just made by the honourable member for Lalor was identical with the speech' that be made in the second-reading debate some hours earlier. He twisted it, if I may say so without disrespect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in order to give it an application that would make it conform to the Standing Orders and apply to the amendment. But it was, in all material respects, the speech that he had made in the second reading debate earlier. The only difference was that he threw in a few more adjectives.

Honourable members interjecting, from other States may interject, but they were paying much more for meat than were the people in Queensland. Those butcher shops would still have been in operation but for the fact that a great number of the persons who were employed did not do their job. The fact that thc shops were closed does not prove that that State enterprise was not successful I believe that it would be better for all the people of Australia if industries like the one we are discussing were socialized and if the money received from their operations were paid to the people instead of being given to private companies I definitely resent any statement that I do not support government enterprise. Not only do I support government enterprise, but let me say without any equivocation that I am a definite believer in socialism. J. should prefer to be associated with a socialist enterprise that failed than with a government that gave the people's money to private enterprise. I believed in the establishment of Trans-Australia Airlines. The Government has had to come to light with Â£1,000,000 or Â£2,000,000 to help Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, a private enterprise the shares of which are held by various shipping companies. That company was in the red, and this Government had to come to its assistance.

That the House do now adjourn. 1 wish to raise the matter of an application by Aerial Agriculture Proprietary Limited, of Bankstown, New South Wales, for permission to import from Italy a multi-engined SIAI Marchetti SM95 aircraft to cost approximately Â£20,000. It is intended that the aircraft shall be used for the purpose of aerial agriculture, that is, for spreading superphosphate and seed for pasture improvement. Two applications have been rejected but a third application has been lodged, and it is my hope that, by putting the facts before the House and the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Osborne), more careful consideration will be given to the application than has been the case in the past. The company has pioneered the use of aircraft for agricultural purpose in Australia, and it is, I believe, the largest operator in this field and has been operating for the longest period. It has had considerable experience. The general manager, Mr Watson, made investigations in New Zealand and in the United States of America, in 1954 and 1955, to determine whether this is the best means of carrying out the work. As a result of the company's experience ever since the war, and as a result of these investigations, the company is of the opinion that a large four-engined slow aircraft of the",74,Pairs

291,Mr Turner (Bradfield) [10.49],"type proposed is best suited for adapting to tbe purpose that the company has in mind. The company claims that very important economies can be achieved by tbe use of this aircraft. For example, the superphosphate will iiot have to be bagged; it can be transported in bulk. There will be no need for surface transport from railway stations to depots. Tliere will not be a need for a large number of landing strips, as is the case at present with small planes. There will also be less labour required for loading and other duties. T do not wish to go into the technicaliaeroplanes, of which there are very few, ties of this matter. The Company is convinced that it can more cheaply carry out. this work by means of this kind of aircraft. If this licence is not granted, thc company's fleet of small aircraft will have to be replaced very shortly, because tlie machines are wearing out, and the cost of their replacement will be just as great as is the cost of the aircraft that tbe the importance of the work that this company wishes to import, and which it believes will be more suited to its purpose. So far as dollars and overseas exchange are concerned, it is quite obvious that if these people are enabled to carry on their work, it will be possible to increase production, and so earn the hard currency that we so badly need. Indeed, I would suggest that if the production of wool were increased by 300 bales enough money would be earned to pay for this aircraft. I do not want to give close attention to technicalities in regard to this matter. If the departmental officers are of the opinion that this type of aircraft is not satisfactory, all I can say is. that the company that is making the application has had considerable experience, that investigations have been carried out by it and it is prepared to back this venture with its own money. I do not know what the theoretical views of departmental officers may be, but when a relatively small amount of money is involved, when the people concerned are prepared to back tbeir opinion with their own money and their own long experience, then it is not for departmental officers to purport to know better than the people who carry on the business. I also submit very strongly tbe fact that the aeroplane that the company wishes to import is an old type of passenger aeroplane, which is too slow for passenger purposes and is now available on the market at a very cheap price. It is no longer useful for the purpose for which it was originally designed. It is of no use to say, "" The financial position at present is difficult. ' We cannot afford such things at this time,, but in twelve months, or two years, if the application is renewed it may be granted "", because within a relatively short time these will have been sold to other people, particularly people in the United States of America who have discovered that they are useful for this purpose. This is an opportunity that, can be seized now but cannot be seized to-morrow. There is no need for me to emphasize company carries out, or the fact that it is very effectively done -by aerial means. I urge thc Minister concerned to reconsider the matter, and in particular to bear in mind its urgency. I remind him that this purchase cannot be made in the future. If the opportunity is not availed of now it will not present itself in the future. I impress upon the Minister again that this company has had long experience, and it is prepared to back its judgment with its own money. wish to direct the attention of the the trafficking that is going on in import licenses, particularly in regard to B category quotas. When the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Osborne) was in charge of the quotas he gave a very reasonable reply, as regards administration, to one of my questions. But this is not a question of administration, it is a matter of very obvious racketeering within the framework of the regulations set up to deal with the licensing of imports. That is where the trouble has occurred, and I suggest that the Government must",75,Adjournment Import Licences Whaling Pension S

The simple story is that our balance of payments position is deteriorating to the amount of between Â£20,000,000 and Â£30,000,000 a month, and at the same time it is obvious to any one who is interested in the matter, or who has studied it for any length of time, that something bas gone wrong with the quota system. In its original form that system may have been effective, but latterly interested people have been able to get around its provisions, while preserving a semblance of legality so far as tlie licences are concerned. The ordinary taxpayer has been told are many ex-servicemen, and other recently that everything must be cut young Australians, and, indeed, other back, that he must tighten his belt and businessmen, in business iu a small way, prepare for difficulties ahead, and that but the man who had established quotas one of our greatest difficulties is that in tbe base year gained an almost everwe are buying more than we can pay for. lasting grip on import licences.

While I am dealing with the question of imports, there is another serious matter that I ask the Minister to consider. If there is racketeering with import licences that have fallen into disuse because the person holding the licence is now out of business, and if such charges can be substantiated, then it means that undeserving people have been lucky enough to obtain import permits at the expense of certain young ex-servicemen.

But the 1951-52 base years are now out of it is necessary to recall the facts. First dato and should be related to turnover of all, there is the need for import and the question of basic sales volume. licensing in Australia to-day and there Let me remind the Minister that, in reis an imperative need to bring our import gard to quotas, it is the little man who and export budgets into balance.

""Without attempting to commit my colleague, the Minister for Trade, I think it is reasonable to hope that a process which has begun is not likely to stop, but I could not assure the honourable member for Bradfield that the application of which he speaks is at the top of thc list or likely to receive immediate favorable consideration. There is one thing that I recall about this application. Although, as he says, only Â£20,000 is involved, ancl that is only tbe price of some 300 bales of wool, it is for Bradfield not to fall into the attia second-hand aircraft and if it were imported would be the only one of its make in Australia. Experience has shown that the cost price of an aircraft is only the beginning; there are matters of spares and maintenance ancl things of that sort, and they are likely to prove particularly heavy with a second-hand aircraft. The honourable member also referred to the import licensing system and the diffithe fact that this opportunity must culties that arise in it. Unfortunately, it be taken now, or it will be lost; but I does not appear that what I said about seem to recall that it is a revival of an B category licences, and about this application that was made a year or two supposed trafficking in them, has been years ago. Perhaps the honourable member retained in his mind. So, perhaps, I might hope, as I do, that the opportunity should go over it again. But before I will recur at a time when it can be do so, I think I must take him up on two granted. I urge him to remember that the things that he said this evening.

On the other hand, we depend in the main for the money to pay for our imports, the prices of which will fluctuate greatly from time to time, on a group of commodities, such as wool, wheat; meat, butter and metals. There could hardly be a more fluctuating group of commodities. sugar, perhaps, is more constant. The prices of our primary products must fall sometimes as they did in the year before last, and last year. We must expect recurring periods in which there will be difficulties with our balance of payments. I ask the honourable member tude of mind of assuming that this must continue for very long, and I hope that he will encourage the applicant for this aircraft to hope that he may get a suitable one before long.

308,Mr Caiens,"In that case, I shallin the industrial areas, pensioners were being provided with community centres and clubs of one kind or another. But, as money for such purposes has become so expensive and so difficult to obtain, partly as a result of this Government's policy, those facilities are no longer being provided. In my electorate, efforts have been made, over two or three years, to provide these facilities, but there is not sufficient money. This is coupled with the fact that changes in the landlord and tenant acts of some States have caused many age and invalid pensioners to be evicted, in some instances from condemned houses in shocking condition, which, nevertheless, provided them with shelter for from 12s. 6d. to 25s. a week. Those people who have been evicted are now forced to pay, for other accommodation, rents ranging from 30s. to Â£2 10s. n week. Last week, I inquired about sixteen different advertisements for houses to let in my electorate. It turned out that not all were houses. Some were only single rooms. Not one was available for less than Â£3 10s. a week. How can an age or an invalid pension pay a rent in excess of Â£3 10s. a week? Many of these pensioners have not been able to afford new clothing for three or four years. They have sufficient money only for the bare necessities of food. Many of those who are unable to walk cannot travel, because they can afford nothing for fares. They have to remain in their homes, and must rely on neighbours for the purchase of their requirements. Very often, they have no one on whom they can depend. Between 480,000 and 500,000 people are in this position. They represent nearly 12 per cent, of the total adult population. Yet they have between them no more than 3 per cent, of the national income!

I understand that earlier this evening, when I was absent from the House, the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns') made certain statements which would appear to impugn my administration. The allegation, as I understand it to have been made, is that in connection with the sale of the Australian Whaling Commission station at Carnarvon, subsequent to the introduction by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) of a representative of one of the tenderers for the station, to a secretary of mine, the present successful tenderer had an opportunity to increase its previous tender. As a result, it became the highest tender, and therefore the successful one. There is no vestige of truth whatever in the allegation, and the honourable member for Perth has said that he never introduced any representative of the company concerned to my staff. honourable member for Perth queried the date. member for Perth will have something further to say on that point by way of personal explanation. However, I advise the honourable member to keep out of this discussion because he is involved deeply enough already.

322,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.28],"Cowper( Sir Earle Page), a member of tbe Australian Country party. All of tbese wires have been couched in most courteous terms, and I assure the Minister for the Interior that if he thinks this is putting me to any expense in respect of my stamp allowance, which is already inadequate, he is mistaken because it is not costing me anything at all, because I dictate these telegrams over the telephone in the Commonwealth Parliament offices in Sydney. It may be argued by Government supportersI agree to an extent-that this is merely a book entry as between one government department and another, but the time of Postal Department officials is taken up and telegraph facilities are used. Why can I not obtain this information ? Why can the Ministers at least not tell me whether they intend to supply the information? What is wrong with giving it? As a matter of fact, I think it is a real experience to see the lavish accommodation of the Minister for the Army in the Oommonwealth Parliament offices in Sydney. He has all sorts of colours around the walls. It is evidently a new form of camouflage; at least, that is what it appears to me to be. I understand that the colour scheme in one of the rooms incorporates the colours of his old regiment in the Volunteer Defence Corps during the war. Why can we not have this information? I shall not weary the House by reading all the telegrams, but the"" last one is rather interesting.

Would you say wliether or not you intend supply desired information and thus avoid further unnecessary any great length with the subject-matter expense additional telegrams for which you are entirely responsible. That telegram was sent on the 30th April and I am still awaiting a reply from the Prime Minister. It took three urgent telegrams to the Minister for the Interior before I could even get him to advise me that this was a matter for the Prime Minister's Department. I shall excuse the Minister for the Interior, because probably he would not know and it took a good deal of time for him to find out. Why did this matter arise? The Minister for the Interior is in charge of the Commonwealth Parliamentary offices in Sydney, and every member of the Parliament, no matter to what party he belongs, is entitled to have facilities to carry out in a proper and efficient manner work in respect of his electorate and the people he represents. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Cope) has been endeavouring for some time to have his name put on the door of his room, and honourable members know how long he has been a member of the Parliament. The department says that no funds are available for the purpose of putting the name on the door. This is the Government which talks about running the country efficiently. Let us examine the matter of the provision of a secretarytypist for each member. If the secretary typist goes on three weeks' annual leave, the Minister refuses to provide :t replacement. If she is away sick and furnishes a medical certificate, a replacement can be obtained after two weeks. When I contacted the Minister, I told him that there were members of the Parliament who had received replacements for secretary-typists who were on holidays. He sent a telegram to me, asking me to supply the information, and all that this dumb Minister has to do is to ring up his department in Sydney and ask the responsible officer who gave me the information.

324,Mr Fairhall (Paterson,"Ministe rthe trunk line facilities at a great rate, completely oblivious to the cost to the Commonwealth of telegrams, when he might quite easily use the telephone and we might have a pleasant tete-a-tete on the subject. However, I do not propose to discuss the cost of refurnishing the offices, which as the honourable member well knows is a matter for the Prime Minister's Department. He seems to have a peculiar idea that because a different coloured paint is used the result is lavish furnishing. I remind him that no more is charged for paints of different colours. In regard to the provision of alternative secretary-typists, the honourable gentleman has been through this matter with my predecessor in office, and he knows very well that the recommendations and reports accepted by the Government and confirmed by my predecessor were to the effect that when a member of the secretarial staff -took holidays it was to be arranged at a time suitable to the honourable member. I point out that there is some discretion left under this provision. It is a discrewas some limitation as to how the space tion exercised by the Minister in special cases, and I do not mind assuring the honourable gentleman that I shall use that discretion constructively in special cases; but bis is not a special case. He is a member of a party which has quite a number of members with head-quarters in the Commonwealth Parliament offices in Sydney, and if he has run himself out of friends in his own party, that is not a matter for which he should blame the Minister for the Interior. I am rather disappointed that on this particular occasion he has not seen fit to put up the annual notice on his door ascribing the closure of his office to me, because I would much care to check his facts. He sughave been glad to autograph that particular piece of documentation. When the honourable gentleman does put up a worthwhile case for special considerashops. In fact, of course, the 7,000-odd tion, I assure him that it will have special square feet was the space offered to the"" consideration. I want to say a few words to the honourable member for Melbourne, and I am sorry that my time has been cut rather short. On the motion for the Hansard report of the honourable the adjournment of the House on the gentleman's speech! 18th April, the honourable gentleman rose and raised, to use his own wordsThe manner in which leases are arranged in Canberra and the manner in which the lessees exploit persons who rent or sub-lease their properties. The honourable gentleman then went on to deal with the lease of a building area held by Chic Salon Properties Limited, of which a certain Mr L. 0. Bailey is the managing director. I am sorry the honourable gentleman did not give this matter the adequate and careful consideration which usually characterizes his utterances in this House. The facts are that a lease of a building area was offered at public auction on the 21st March, 1953. There was only one bidder at the auction. That was Mr L. O. Bailey, who secured the lease, on behalf of the company of which he was managing director-Chic Salon Properties Limited. The rental, pending reappraisement, was Â£430 a year and there was a covenant that a twostory building had to be provided. There was to be used, but there was no limitation at all so far as sub-letting was concerned. The lessee merely exercised his perfect right in private enterprise to take a business risk, and he put on the site a building which far exceeded the requirements of his covenant and which, in fact, has made a very great contribution to the commercial facilities available in the Capital City. The honourable member for Melbourne expressed some concern on tbe question of rents, but, apparently, he did not take gested the building contained 7,000-odd square feet and that the area had been divided into at least 23 ground floor one prospective client who referred the matter to the honourable member for Melbourne.",84,Government Supporters D O That
325,Mr Calwell,I did not say that.,85,Government Supporters D O That
326,Mr Fairhall,"I am quoting fromquoting.me. that the honourable gentleman have a look at "" the Hansard report. The honourable member then proceeded to make some deductions from supposition and, again quoting his own words, he saidIf this company is getting the lease for Â£430 a year and it lets the building subsequently to 23 firms or companies it.is doing pretty well if it gets Â£77 a week rent from those 23 firms. The honourable gentleman must think it i? Christmas all the time in private enterprise; but I remind him that it is a profitand-loss economy. In this case, the honourable gentleman has indulged in a bit. of over-simplification which always characterizes cases in which an ardent socialist finds himself on the scent of a little so-called capitalist exploitation. Far from getting Â£77 a week rent for each of the 23 shops, the rentals, in fact, rangedown to Â£2 15s. a week. In this case, on that 7,000-odd square feet of space for the rental of Â£77 a week, the lessee was providing special structural alterations to give adequate space for restaurant purposes. Furthermore, for modern premises in a good location, l is . a square foot per annum is not an excessive rental to provide for depreciation, amortization on building costs, insurance, interest, land rates, rates, electricity, fuel, caretaking management and so'on. The honourable member then went on to'talk about the exploitation involved in the conditions submitted to proposed sub-lessees under which they were invited t6 subscribe capital for the construction of t h e building by way of debenture. ' iFirst of all, I find that no promoter slmres in this company have been issued, or offered, for other than their full face value. The employees of associated companies were admitted to participation at face value, and the cost of the building, including constructional costs plus architects'; fees, land rents, rates, interest and so , on, amounted to something like Â£250,000, of which the debenture holders were invited to -contribute only Â£100,000. As the debenture holders will .receive o per cent, interest on their money and will be repaid in full, and as they are adequately protected and will derive the benefit of occupancy of a. new and suitable building, I should like to know where exploitation is involved in this transaction. Furthermore, since nobody obliges them to go into this sort of proposition, which is a perfectly normal business undertaking, the honourable gentleman's accusations of exploitation simply fall to the ground. There is no reason why the fact that this land is held under lease from the Commonwealth should really interest this Parliament beyond the payment'of the rental fixed, or offered at auction. To put this matter at rest, I must conclude that the company obtained its lease in competition, that it has carried out its building covenant, that the terms of the lease have been strictly complied with and, therefore, the public interest has been completely preserved. Beyond that, the department, the Government or this Parliament should not concern itself with the matter other than to be appreciative of the fact that private enterprise has gone to considerable lengths at vary great cost, and has taken considerable risk in the promotion of a business venture which, has added materially to the commercial facilities available in this Capital City. personal explanation. I did not say that 7,200 square feet was offered to this particular company. I said that was the total amount of accommodation that would be available in the completed building and that portion of it was offered to a company in Melbourne. I did not say that Â£77 per week would have to be paid by each"" of the tenants of the building. Tbe Minister is entirely wrong on those two matters, and, as to the rest of his statement, I let it go. Question resolved in the affirmative.
