I think it has been, conclusively shown that there are no strong reasons' why a distinction should be made between the town and suburban areas and the country, in the matter of telegraph rates. Those who reside in town and suburban areas have many advaatages which country residents do not possess. They have a delivery of letters two or three times daily, a telephone service, and many other means of communication arising out of their closeness to eaoh other.

If the town and suburban telegraph rate is lowered, a larger staff of operators and messengers will be needed for the transmission of the messages, and not only will the revenue from, telegrams suffer, but the receipts from the postal and telephone services are also likely to diminish. I shall altogether oppose the adoption of a sixpenny rate for telegrams, and I think there are strong reasons why whatever .rate is given to the town and suburban areas should be extended at least some distance into the country. must again ask the attention of honourable members to the fact that the department is proposing to make concessions in this direction which are estimated at some £40,000 a year. It is, moreover, proposing to give to the community a cheaper telegraphic I do not wish to system than exists anywhere else in tlie known world. In making that statement. I am quoting the words of Mr Sassoun, who is associated with Mr Sandford Fleming in electrical business. Honourable members may be of the opinion that the telegraphic systems of the United States and of Canada are cheap systems; but Mr Sandford Fleming, in speaking on the subject to a body of scientists, specially interested in this matter, drew attention to the fact that the rates charged in those countries are practically twice as high as the rates charged elsewhere.

Sir PHILIPFYSH very largely. However, I wish to limit my observations to the question immediately before the committee. I desire to call attention to a statement which has been rather forcefully obtruded upon honourable members, namely, that the schedule gives no advantages to the people-that instead of the 6d. suburban rate being maintained, it is being increased to 9d. I find that, whether the message be confined to twelve words or to 24 words, and even taking into consideration the charge for the address, Victoria gains considerably under the schedule. If I take the rate between New South Wales or Victoria and South Australia, I find that in every respect, excepting the twelve words, there is an all-round reduction-that whereas the rates are from 2s. to 3s., they will be from ls..6d. to 2s. So far as New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia are concerned, the rates which are at present from 3s. to 4s. 6d. will be reduced to Is. 6d., with a maximum of 2s. It will be a great disappointment I hold, to the people of the five States who have a suburban rate if it is discontinued. It is the cheapest service so far as the department is concerned. More profit is made on the suburban business than on any other; the cost of construction is limited to a few miles instead of extending to hundreds of miles, while the cost of maintenance is proportionately less. presume that, with a rate of I d . per word, the profit is greater over the short distance than over the long distance. man any official statement to that effect ? Sir PHILIPFYSH been associated with a Postal department for a great many years, and in Tasmania we always considered that agreater profit was made on the short mileage than on the long mileage. I think it will be found that the. suburban rates on the mainland pay better than do the rates for long distances. A very large proportion, of the population of these States live within the operation of the suburban rates, and to rob the five States of the advantages which they have because Victoria has not enjoyed them is wrong. I believe that they would prefer to extend to Victoria the advantages which they enjoy. I hope that the suburban rate not will be continued. It will operate gentleman, before he resumes his seat, indicate what his attitude is with regard to charging for the address and the sender's name 1 General lays great stress on the advisability of enabling him to charge for the address and the sender's name. It has been stated by the honourable member for Parramatta that a return of the number of telegrams sent out of the Sydney office on a given day shows that about 90 per cent, averaged from five to fifteen words. My honourable colleague urges the advisability of making the proposed charge, because he has valued the services to be rendered at over £95,000 per annum, and although I have heard the honourable member for Parramatta challenge the accuracy of that statement on. one or two occasions, it is endorsed by the Deputy Postmasters-General, who, being practical men, are in a position to support their statements. If it is seriously proposed to deprive the Postmaster-General of his right to make this charge, I must ask honourable members to consider at what cost it is to be done, and to give a reason why it should be done, seeing that in other important countries a charge is made. In New South Wales and Canada, the address is not charged for in connection with a certain class of their business, but, as I said before, their rates are certainly twice those which Therefore, we may are payable elsewhere. suburban rate pay in Sydney, where the address is not charged for 1 Sir PHILIPFYSH I am not in a position to say. The department cannot No ; but I have afford to give way in every direction, and I must ask the committee to consider whether it is advisable to adopt a uniform rate of Id. per word for the Commonwealth, ancl to enable the Postmaster-General to make good some portion of the loss which it will entail by making a charge for the address, and the name of the sender.

I hope that the committee will support the provision for a charge to be made. to have long second reading speeches on every point which is raised, we shall not conclude the consideration of this Bill to-day. T should like the debate to be confined to the simple point-ar e we to have differential rates within one State-whic h is raised by the amendment of the honourable member for Grampians to strike out the words, "" town and suburban within prescribed limits"" 1 I think that we should not sanction the introduction of differential rates. I fail to see why the rate for Melbourne ancl suburbs should be different from that for Gisborne, Kyneton, Bendigo, Ballarat, or Castlemaine. I am not familiar with the working of the department, but I imagine that it costs no more to send a telegram from Melbourne to Ballarat or Bendigo than to Caulfield or Williamstown, which are within the metropolitan radius. Residents in the cities enjoy many more conveniences than are at the command of people who live in the remote districts. In many cases heavy porterage has to be paid upon country messages,and it is wrong to penalize those who are far removed from the populous centres by making them pay an extra charge for their telegrams. Whatever rate is fixed should be uniform throughout the States. We cannot afford to throw away revenue, and if the reduction of the telegraph rates would involve any loss I should be in favour of retaining those now in existence, at any rate until the bookkeeping period has expired. Sir WILLTAMM c MILLAN (Wentworth) I am always happy to shorten debate as much as possible, but I regard this as one of the most important and practical questions that we have been called upon to discuss. The Bill will be far-reaching in its consequences, and our decision will probably hold good for a very long period. The figures furnished by the Government with regard to many matters connected with the postal system show the necessity for employing some reliable statistical authority. I do not for one moment doubt the bona fides of the Minister, but I do not believe in the figures he has presented to us. I am sorry that I cannotagree with the proposal 44 c 2 that a uniform rate should be charged throughout the States. So many attempts have been made to curtail the rights and privileges which have hitherto been enjoyed by the public that people are beginning to ask whether the objects with which the Commonwealth was established were not entirely misunderstood. The Government proposals with regard to city and suburban telegrams would have the effect of increasing the rates from 6d. to 9d. per message, and I shall be no party to making any such change. Uniformity is very desirable within reasonable bounds, but we must not lose sight of the special considerations which should operate in this case. I am willing to support the honourable member for the Grampians in securing a uniform rate for all messages throughout the Commonwealth, beyond, those despatched within city and suburban areas. The question for us to consider is whether the rates now proposed, including the eight words allowed for the names and addresses, are reasonable, in view of the financial necessities of the department. In dealing with this matter for the whole of the Commonwealth, we should not lay too much stress upon the necessity for immediate payment. If we believe that an. arrangement extending generous terms to the public would pay within a reasonable period we should be prepared to face an immediate loss. That should be the guiding policy in the administration of all the great public departments. I should cordially support a proposal to make a uniform charge of 9d. per message throughout Australia, apart from a special charge of 6d. per message for telegrams despatched within city and suburban areas. In each case eight words should be allowed for the names and addresses. sufficient for messages despatched from one end of Australia to the other 1 know that 9d. telegrams would pay at once,, but I believe that ultimately the revenue would be increased. None of us can say with authority that a 9d. or a lOd. or a Is. rate would involve a loss, and wecanonly arrive at the truth by experience after a reasonable trial. The statistics presented to us cannot be absolutely relied on. I make full allowance for the difficulties of the situation, because I have stated on previous occasions that no Treasurer could possibly forecast the financial position of the Commonwealth during",17,Mcsmillan What About Weight Of Newspapers The Department Will

21,Sir William Mcmillan,"I do uotthe next two or three years. A t the same time, we should be prepared to make reasonable concessions, and to deal with the Commonwealth departments from a national stand-point, in order that the public may derive substantial advantages from the change of administration. It is a matter for consideration whether eight words would be sufficient to allow for names and addresses. In England, they obviate a great deal of difficulty by ' charging for the addresses, and they adopt a system under which persons can register their addresses at a small fee, and thus reduce the directions on the telegrams to a minimum number of words. I know, however, that an many parts of Australia the addresses .have to be given at some length in order to insure the delivery of the message to the -proper person. not to niake innovations which will have -the effect of restricting the privileges ihitherto enjoyed by the public. I should ""be inclined to adhere to the present system >rather than take drastic steps which would -operate to the disadvantage of those who mow make use of the public services. The tendency of all progressive movements in these days is to annihilate space so far as correspondence and communication is concerned, and the volume of business in our public departments and our revenue will increase in proportion tb the liberality of the terms extended to the public. I understand, of course, that there are certain Jimits beyond which we cannot go if -we --desire our public departments to be cond u c t e d upon a paying basis, but it will be -better to err on the side of liberality at the amount in porterage. If they do not pay --outset, and retrace our steps afterwards if i necessary. . .amendment of which I have given notice provides for the omission of the whole of the words in the body of the schedule, invcluding those comprehended in the amendjtnent now before us, and the substitution ,of an entirely new form. The honourable member for Grampians has submitted the straight-out issue whether there should be any distinction made between town and suburban and country telegrams. I am strongly of opinion that it is unfair to 'lifferentiate between the two classes of messages, because any such distinction :nust perpetuate that centralizing policy which has been one of the greatest curses £>{ Australia. I recognise that the claim I put forward by residents in the metropolitan areas has a certain amounc of force. The claim is, that they are really wholesale customers, but I would point out that they cannot really be regarded as wholesale customers, because the individual units who use the telegraph lines must be taken into account. It simply means that the scattered populations-thos e who from the very fact of their being separated should have greater consideration-ar e made to suffer I think that is very unfair. I am glad to say that we have not had this differential rate in Victoria, and when we last reduced the cost of postage we again refused to have a differential rate. Victoria is one of the most evenly settled Statesi n the group. Asi t has been found in Victoria inadvisable to make this distinction, how much greater will We should be very careful be the ill results followingf rom such a distinction in States that are not so closely.settled? I would urge honourable members to see that every part of every Statei n the Commonwealth has the same privilege extended to it , and that no part is called upon by reason of the disadvantages from which it suffers to pay a greater penalty than the people in those parts who enjoy greater benefits. The honourable member for Echuca has pointed out that in the country at present those who use the telegraph wires are placed at a distinct disadvantage, not only with regard to the want of facilities in being compelled to travel very many miles to use the telegraph, and in being compelled also to wait a considerable time before receiving replies to their messages, but also in having to pay a large porterage, we have in Victoria a system by means of which telegrams can be sent to the receiver by post; but that means delay and probable additional expense. Isi t a fair thing that those who live in areas which are more centralized should have the privilege of a reduction, such as is proposed by the Government, of per cent, over those who are residing in the country ? That is the question we have to settle. Are we to have a differential rate, or-as we saythat all men are equal before the law, and as duties of customs that are imposed are levied equally in every instance-ar e we going to say that those who use the post-office are to . be charged in accordance with the benefit which they receive. The benefit to a man in the country is not one whit greater than to the",18,Mcsmillan What About Weight Of Newspapers The Department Will
22,Mr Salmo N (Laanecoorie),"Theman in the town. The benefit is equal, and the expense is very nearly equal; at any rate, there is very little difference indeed. Therefore, we should not make this difference in the payments. Some honourable members may ask whether I should be in favour of all men paying the same for travelling on the railway lines without regard to distance. There the benefit which is conferred upon the passenger bears a strict relation to the amount which he pays, and to the cost of conveyance. But with regard to telegraphs there is very little difference, or none whatever. Under the circumstances, I hope to see the cost reduced. I do not want to ' see the amount which the Government proposes charged at all j but, if it is to be charged, let it be paid financial reasons. The distinction is preby all, and not by a section. MrJ OSEPH COOK (Parramatta) I do not think we are proceeding in the right way with regard to this question. First of all, the committee should have decided whether the names and addresses are to be paid for. The Victorian rate will be a n ' increase upon the New South Wales rate, and that is what we want to avoid. penny telegrams without names aud addresses being charged for. whatever rate is fixed shall be uniform, we shall be committed to a higher uniform rate, instead of to a lower one. is whether we shall have differential rates or not. decide is whether we shall retain the words "" town and suburban."" If the honourable member for Parramatta wants sixpenny telegrams, he should propose a charge of Sixpence within a certain radius of a post office. point, and I. also want to abolish these distinctions if I can get a uniform lower rate. But I do not want to abolish them if we are to have a uniform higher rate. If I could .not get a sixpenny rate for the States, I should prefer to have a sixpenny rate for the cities, and ninepence for the country, rather than a nine penny rate all through. The honourable member for Grampians, on the other hand, is, I understand, in favour of a nine penny rate all through. I do not think there .should be a uniform rate throughout the Commonwealth. We have not got to that point yet. We are pushing the federal idea to an absurd extreme if we urge that. AVhat we want is a zone rate. member favours penny postage for the whole Commonwealth. in favour of a uniform telegraph rate if I thought it would pay.. That is the distinction between postal and telegraphic rates. The honourable member can at' present send a letter to Queensland for 2d., but he cannot send a telegram, to Queensland at the same rate as that forwhich he can send a telegram in his own. State. The telegraph rates vary for purely served everywhere. In Canada and all over the world there is no uniformity as between, .postage and telegraph rates. For the present, at any rate, Is. for Inter-State telegraph messages is little enough. A shilling for 3,000 miles ought to satisfy the greatest stickler for economy or for facilities. My idea is that there should be a zone within which the 6d. rate would operate, names, I shall vote for sixand addresses being not charged for ; anrv that there should be another rate of' Is. for the rest of the Commonwealth. I would make the zone 600 miles in extent. MrA . PATERSON -That would coverNew South Wales, but what about Queensland '! be 600 miles from any post-ollice in the Commonwealth ; therefore it would operate as well in Queensland as anywhere else.. Any man 'in Queensland would be able to go to a telegraph-office, say, in thecentre of that State, and could send a 6d. telegram to Brisbane or to the northern, portion of the State within 600 miles. The zone rate would operate all over Australia, without respect to borders. But the proposal of the honourable member would operate only within the State, and he would still charge for names and addresses, which is the most vicious element in the whole position. It really means that a proposal for 6d. telegrams is a proposal for 9d. telegrams. If the Minister will take the schedule as it stands, and will leave out the proposal to charge for names and addresses, I shall be prepared to support him right through. It is the proposal to charge for names and addresses that I most strongly object to. Let the Government agree to",19,Mcsmillan What About Weight Of Newspapers The Department Will

I fully recognise that whilst our present financial relations with the States continue, the question of revenue is one of the very -greatest importance. I attach no importance whatever to the estimate which the Minister has placed before us in regard to addresses and signatures. Last night the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable and learned member for Corinella stigmatized some of the estimates which he gave as mere guesswork. I am disposed to go further, and say, in the language of the poet Gordon, that it is not only guesswork, but a blank enigma. No one can possibly say what the result of these charges will be. Therefore I think that the estimate of the Attorney-General ought to be completely eliminated from the consideration of this question. The Government, moreover, have entirely given away any propose further that Inter-State argument in favour of an additional rate which may be based either on long distance or upon the cost of transmission. The question of long distance involves the cost of construction and maintenance of the lines, and the charge for transmission involves the passing of the same telegram through several different offices. The Minister representing the Postmaster-General has W o u l d it not declared that the public could send an Inter-State message from Cape-Leuwin or Cape Howe to Thursday Island. He might have gone further, and stated that they could send a telegram from Brisbane to As a matter of fact the Cape Leuwin. Upon the ground of distance, there is no justification whatever for an extra charge upon Inter-State messages. The only reason which can possibly be urged is that some messages pass from within the boundaries of one State to those of another. The Minister has also put it that it might be held to be unconstitutional to adopt the zone system. But I look at that matter from an entirely different stand-point. I think that the system, as proposed by the Ministry, would be unconstitutional. They propose to introduce a zone of 25 miles upon the boundaries of the different States. have now dropped that. constitute a preference as between one part of a State and another, I do not know what does. If an individual trading between Moama and Melbourne, and another trading between Deniliquin and Melbourne are to be charged different rates, the former 9d., and the latter Is., I hold that a distinct preference is made in favour of one part of a State as against another. I have looked up probably the best constitutional authority to be hadI refer to Messrs.

Under that proposal a telegram can be sent in South Australia from Adelaide to Port Darwin-a distance of about 2,000 milesbut in no part of Victoria can a message be sent a quarter of that distance. a distinct preference is given to one State as against another. To my mind there is no justification whatever for this distinction. On the one hand, a message can be transmitted for 2,000 miles in South Australia for 9d., whilst a similar telegram between . Moama and Echuca-a distance of only one mile-would tem at least has the advantage that some reason can be assigned for the extra charge. We cannot split up'a penny for a postage stamp into a number of parts as a pound can be apportioned in connection with railway travelling; neither can 9d. for a telegram be subdivided into a great many parts. We fnusfc take a certain area in which a minimum charge is made. The rate charged for telegrams in Sydney, for the metropolitan area is Gd., and for the country Is. It seems to me that fact indicates that Sydney has contorian Storekeepers' and Traders' Associatrolled the destinies of New South Wales very much as Melbourne has dominated those of Victoria. rate in Sydney would be very much equalized by the fact that most of the country messages would be charged a lower rate than they are at present.

Of course, I admit that the long-distance lines in South Australia and Western Australia are to a large extent national lines. objecting to the rate charged in South Australia. ment, that if the people of one State can send a telegram 2,000 miles for 9d., there is no reason whatever why the Commonwealth should not adopt the same course irrespective of State boundaries. the Inter-State' telegrams simply cross the border line, and if the argument of the honourable member for Parramatta, that a 6d. rate within the metropolitan area will produce more revenue is sound, it is fair to assume that a reduction in the Inter-State charge will also be productive of a similar Mr Skene. result. Trade advantages are generally with the large towns. To my mind, the charge in the town districts might well be so levelled up as to bring about a uniform rate. My contention is that a uniform rate would be more in consonance with the federal The rate which is now prospirit; that it would facilitate and simplify the administration of the department; and ' that it would, perhaps, effect some saving in that direction. The 9d. rate-eliminat ing, of course, the proposed charge for name, address, and signature-shoul d be a Thus uniform one, and the people of Sydney should consider the advantage which they would obtain from the extension of the rate to country districts. I believe that the p2-oposal which I have made for a uniform rate would, if adopted, return just as much, if not more, revenue than would the proposal made by the Government. be charged Is. The zone sysSir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -I . welcome the announcement made by the Attorney-General that the Government are prepared to accept a modified scheme. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that one of the principal grounds of complaint against the scheme embodied in the Bill was the charge proposed to be made for names, addresses, and signatures, because that charge would have involved a very heavy burden upon persons using the service. In a circular issued by the Viction, it is stated thatUnder my proposal, the 6d. Telegrams, if sent according to the proposed, new rates in the schedule, would cost the sender at least 50 per cent, more than is charged at present. Similarly the Intertelegrams. community of Victoria make decided complaints, in which the Stock ExchangeI am not joins very seriously, against the proposal. In a circular issued by the Stock ExchangeI only use it to point the arguof Melbourne, it is saidOur principal objection to the Bill is the new departure charging for name, address, and signature, introduced by the Postmaster-General on the plea that this is the practice in every civilized, The bulk of country outside of Australia. In making this assertion the Postmaster-General evidently overlooked the United States and Canada, where name,.address, and signature are free. Particulars are furnished showing that if a charge were made for names, addresses, and signatures, the business done in the telegraph office at the Melbourne Stock Exchange would involve an extra charge",22,Mcsmillan What About Weight Of Newspapers The Department Will
46,Mr Salmon,That is in regard to 9d.,23,Mcsmillan What About Weight Of Newspapers The Department Will
47,Sir John Quick,"Yes. The trading,of over £1,800 per annum. I am glad that the Minister has seen his way clear to propose an amended scheme, in which he has abandoned the contemplated charge. A t the same time. I am sorry that he is unable to go a little further, and provide for 6d. telegrams over wider areas than those of city and suburbs. Like the honourable member for Echuca and the honourable member for Laanecoorie, I fail to see why cities such as Melbourne, Sydney, or any other Australian capital, should be particularly favoured by the special application of the system to them. It is said that most of these metropolitan centres have hitherto enjoyed the system, and that it would be very hard to deprive them of it . B ut the value of the system in city and suburbs has been of late years considerably reduced by the extension of the telephone service. When (id. telegrams for cities and suburbs were first introduced, there was no telephonic system such as now exists in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and the other metropolitan cities of the Commonwealth and the extension of the telephone service has largely dispensed with the necassity of resorting to the popular and cheap system of 6d. telegrams in these places. It is stated in a circular issued by the Victorian Shopkeepers' Association that the telephone is now so largely used in cities and suburbs that telegrams are rarely thought of by business people, so that the great stress laid greater expense than is involved in sending by the honourable member for Parramatta upon the Gd. telegram system as a kind of rightful inheritance of Sydney and other capitals, is not altogether justified. The time has arrived when we should allow telegrams to be sent at this cheap rate over wider areas than those suggested. The only question is as to the principle upon which the system should be extended. .It should be possible to devise a method to extend it, first of all to telegrams sent to any address within a State. That is what, I understand, the honourable member for Laanecoorie suggests. To a large extent, however, that would involve an inequality in the privileges enjoyed by the people of the various States. For instance, residents of Queensland would be able to send sixpenny telegrams over much wider areas than would be possible to the people of Victoria. Mi-. CROUCH -In Western Australia system ; but as the time is not yet ripe for people would be able to send telegrams that, I do not see my way clear to unduly over distances twenty times as great as would be possible to the residents of Tasmania. fore a State could hardly be taken as a fair measure. If it were decided to adopt the sixpenny telegram system, it would be only fit and proper to consider the zone system suggested by the honourable member for Parramatta. occur under that system. Sir JOHN QUICK I do not think that the discrimination would be so glaring. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN But the bookkeeping period is fatal to the adoption of that system. not quite satisfied that the time has arrived when we could adopt it ; but, ideally ancl logically, I think it would be a desirable system. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN The honourable member for Parramatta allows that the time has not yet arrived for its adoption. not think that the suggestion made by the honourable member for Grampians, that we should have one uniform system, could be vindicated either on commercial or logical grounds. We should charge for telegrams, according to the value of the services rendered. It is urged that a telegram can be sent over a distance of 1,000 miles at noa message over .a distance of 100 miles. But in dealing with a revenue-earning and servicerendering department such as this, we have to consider the amount of capital which has been sunk to enable it to render those services. never have a 6d. rate for the country. rough and ready line of demarcation in regard to the value of the services rendered, without insisting upon any mathematical accuracy. A t the same time. I do not think the time has arrived for that. I have been principally interested in endeavouring to secure the abolition of the proposal that a charge should be made for names, addresses, and signatures. [ am glad that that proposal has been thrown aside. My next object will be to secure the concession of 6d. telegrams, either within a State or under some zone",23,Mcsmillan What About Weight Of Newspapers The Department Will

53,Sir John Quick,"We might have apress it . I hope the time will arrive when the department will be conducted upon such lines, and when our federal development will have arrived at such a stage as to enable us to give more liberal concessions in this direction. very glad that the Ministry have made an amended proposal, because I am always anxious, especially in regard to postal matters, to follow the recommendations of the department, seeing that private members necessarily suffer from a want of accurate information upon the question. I was in somewhat of a difficulty in regard to the proposals in the Bill, because they do not appear to be in accordance with the recommendations of the experts. certainly not in accordance with the two recommendations contained in the report which 1 obtained from the Minister, and therefore I should have had considerable difficulty in accepting them. The proposition now made comes very near to an alternative proposal made by the experts. It is more protective for the revenue, and therefore I approve of it , although it is not quite so liberal. The alternative suggestion now made is that a charge of 6d. shall be made for a telegram containing sixteen words in cities and suburbs ; 9d. for other telegrams transmitted to any address within a State, and Is. for Inter-State telegrams, with a charge of I d . per word for every word in excess of sixteen. That proposal allows six words for the name and address as against the estimate of five given by the experts. The recommendation of the experts was that Inter-State telegrams should be transmitted for 6d. each. Their alternate suggestion was that a charge of 6d. should be made for city and suburban telegrams, and 9d. for any other telegram sent to any address within a State, with a charge of I d . for every additional word over fif teen. They also proposed a 6d. rate for Inter-State telegrams up to fifteen words, with a further charge of I d . for every additional word. MrL . E. GROOM -Did they actually propose a lower' rate for Inter-Sfcate messages than that for State messages ? and learned member will find the statement to which I have referred in the second alternative suggestion made by the experts. The Ministerial proposal that a charge of Is. shall be made for Inter-State telegrams is certainly far more protective to the revenue. I contend it should be so for the reason that the loss will be far greater to South Australia than to any other State. In South Australia we obtain a far greater proportion of our postal and telegraphic revenue from the transmission of telegrams than from other branches of the service. ""When we were consideringthematter at theConvention in 1897, figures were produced showing that in 1896 South Australia obtained £89,000 from the telegraph service, as against £91,000 obtained by Victoria from the same source. Having regard to the smaller population in South Australia, the returns for that State are much larger. Mr L.' E. GROOM I find that the experts They. are recommended that a charge should be made for names and addresses in Inter-State messages. That would have made the InterState rate higher than that proposed for messages within a State. for names and addresses in all cases. case of city and suburban messages. The Government propose Is. telegrams, allowing six words for the name and address, to that it really amounts to a proposition so transmit a ten-words message for Is. That is half the rate at present charged on telegrams between South Australia and Victoria, and 1 believe it to be a fair concession. ""We cannot expect to keep up the rate of 2s., nor can messages be sent for as low a sum as has been suggested, seeing that that course would mean a loss of some £20,000 in South Australia. The estimated loss for the whole Commonwealth will be £90,000, and, considering that the telegraph service produces more in proportion in South Australia than in any other State, the South Australian share of the loss would not be a tenth ; but, if addresses were free, to probably £20,000. I am glad, therefore, that an alternative suggestion has been made which very nearly represents what is a fair charge for all the States. SirM ALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I am glad the Minister has I think the honourable agreed to allow six words for the names and addresses.

I consider that the lower the charge for messages, the greater the revsnue is likely to be. I cannot, however, support a very large reduction because I think it would take some time to make up the revenue. A t the same time, I feel that the proposal now before us is a step in the right direction. There will be a large increase in the number of Inter-State messages, and of messages in the cities and suburbs. Personally I have the same complaint to make against telephones that I have to make in regard to the delivery of telegrams. Many of us know that it is better to walk home than to send a telegraph message there, and much loss of time and inconvenience is caused by delay at the telephone. No satisfaction will be given until some money has been spent on establishing the metallic return system. I do not blame the officers of the department; I blame the fact that the money is not forthcoming to bring the service up to date, and I hope the matter will be taken into consideration as soon as possible. concession has been, made by the Minister, though I cannot regard it as of any advantage to the ordinary man in Victoria, who will have to pay higher rates than previously.

An allowance of sixteen words for 6d. would be of no advantage in Victoria.

It is proposed that Inter-State charge shall be Is. for sixteen words. honourable and learned member not to continue to discuss the rates ; they are not now before the committee. spect that the Acting Prime Minister, in his responsible position, urged the proposed rates as arguments against the suggestion of the honourable member for Grampians, and that therefore I have a perfect right to discuss this matter, and I intend to do so, unless I am otherwise stopped. I have only one other, but very necessary, reference to make to tlie rates. It has been suggested, as an amendment, that the charge for an Inter-State message of sixteen words shall be 9d. A t tlie present time a person in any part of Victoria can telegraph to New South Wales ten words I ask the honourable for Is., which means twenty words or ' eighteen words, allowing ten words or eight words for the address and signature.

68,Mr Kennedy (Moira),"I am predepartment throughout the Commonwealth. We have not during the present discussion taken into consideration the important factor of the interest charges on the cost of postal and telegraphic construction throughout the Commonwealth, which represent, about a quarter of a million sterling. That is practically a subsidy contributed by the general taxpayer for the benefit of those who use the post and telegraph service, and we are making reductions which, in some instances, amount to 33 per cent. The question arises whether the increased business will be sufficient to return the necessary revenue; and past experience goes to prove that no such result will follow, and that consequently there is possibility of further loss. There is no possibility of introducing the zone system at the present time j and we must accept the situation. The honourable and learned member for Corio has pointed out that the country residents of Victoria will suffer a loss.on the charges for Inter-State telegrams to New South Wales; but it must not be forgotten that on the other hand a decided reduction is made in tlie cost of telegrams to South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. There will also be a gain in connection with town messages; and, under the circumstances, I am prepared to accept the amendment proposed by. the Government. am sorry that the feeling of the committee seems to be against the proposal of the honourable member for Grampians. At any rate, the representatives of one State, which at present has the advantage of sixpenny telegrams within a certain radius, are very strongly against that proposal. I am afraid that if we permit differential telegraphic rates, the result may be that when'at some future time it is sought to adopt a uniform tariff, we shall find very strong protests made on behalf of what I may call vested interests. We may find the residents of towns, which have the advantage of lower rates, contending that if there is to be a uniform tariff throughout the Commonwealth it must be that to which they have been accustomed. When it is remembered that beyond a certain distance, from the centre of a city, a charge of 9d. is proposed to be made for a telegram, and a charge of Is. for sending the same telegram into another State, no matter what the distance may be, how can it be said that the charge is being made in accordance with Again, while it is proposed to send a telegram 5 miles for 9d, the same telegram can be sent 300 miles for the same amount.

The honourable gentleman told me that Kyneton had not sufficient population within its own boundaries to justify the extension of the privilege to it , but that when its suburbs were taken into account it would be' qualified to benefit by the special rate. the derivation of the word, and in its usual acceptation, is an addition to a city; but there are suburbs in Melbourne which are themselves cities. The only right basis to go upon in this matter is the population basis. If we adopt'any other, there will be endless trouble. I shall, however, oppose the proposals of the Government, because I regard them as unfair to those who live in the country districts. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I intend to move the insertion of the word "" eighteen."" That, I think, will get over -the difficulty which has been raised by the honourable member for Laanecoorie. ber can do that when the amendment now before the committee, which provides for the creation of a blank, has been disposed of. _ surprised at thereadiness with which the proposals of the Government have been accepted, especially by country representatives. In speaking upon this subject, I am speaking in the interests not merely of the residentsof the country districts of Victoria, but of the residents of the country districts in all parts of Australia. We are told that we must agree to special town and suburban rates in Victoria, because the other five States are at present enjoying those rates, but that a uniform rate of 6d. throughout the States cannot be adopted because it would not pay. I should like to know if the sixpenny rate for town and suburban areas pays. If it does, there could not be much loss in extending it to the country districts, but if it does not pay, it is a gross injustice to charge the country districts 50 per cent, more to make up whatever loss is incurred. TheI gave the honourable residents in country districts are subject to quite enough disadvantages at present in their remoteness from centres of population, their want of facilities for intercourse, the distance which they have to go to get to post-offices, and the porterage which they have to pay on telegrams, without having to pay an additional 50 per cent, for their messages. If a difference must be made between the town and suburban and country rates, cannot a smaller difference than 50 per cent, be adopted ? Would not a difference of 20 per cent, be sufficient to cover the extra cost of transmission ? In my opinion, the people in the country should be put on the same level as those in tlie towns. I think that, like the acting leader of the Opposition, we are all doubting Thomasesi n regard to the accuracy of the estimate which places the loss of the department at £40,000. That estimate is mere guesswork, because it cannot be satisfactorily foretold what result will come from our new conditions. But let us err on the safe side. Ifi t be thought desirable, however, to run the risk of loss, let us run that risk in respect to both town and country telegrams. Then if, after two or three years'experience of the rates adopted, the Government show that they cannot be made to pay, Parliament can be asked to increase them. able member say this morning that he would The honourable memmake the rates as high as possible ? loss in the working of the department, but I contend that whatever rates are adopted they should be uniform.

I desire to obtain some concession for country residents. the approval of the committee to the amendment of which I have given notice, I should like to see the zone system established, so that it might operate from centres fixed upon according to population. I should not be in favor of making every small telegraph office a centre, but perhaps the zone system might be applied to townships having 1,000 inhabitants and upwards. preference to the large centres of population. but, e& I have before stated, my first object is to secure a uniform rate. If it could be managed, I should be pleased to see a uniform rate adopted for telegrams, including Inter-State messages, from one end of Australia to the other. against a uniform system of postage, because the information supplied to us showed that it would involve a very heavy loss ; but we cannot obtain satisfactory returns with reference to telegrams. We are told that 6d. telegrams would not pay, and no doubt the revenue would suffer at the outset j but by the time that the bookkeeping period was at an end, the revenue would recover. I believe, moreover, that an Inter-State rateof Is. per message would show payable results, even before the end of the bookkeeping period. I join with the honourable member for Echuca in protesting against country residents, and those who do business with the country, being penalized to the extent of 50 per cent, over the rates charged for telegrams in the city and suburbs. The merchants in the cities would gain more in proportion than would the actual residents in the country by a reduction in the rate for country telegrams, because the additional facilities provided would be availed of to the greatest extent by business men.

It cannot be urged that nine penny telegrams have not proved pavable in Victoria, and any loss that occurs must be attributed fco the sixpenny rate. It would almost seem that the Government were anxious to recoup any losses involved by the sixpenny telegrams out of the profits made upon the higher-priced messages sent through the country. We are not asking that one section of the community should be. benefited at the expense of another, but I had to vote simply tliat fair and equitable treatment shall be extended to the people who live in the country.

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I should like some explanation from the Minister as to the extent to -which the sixpenny telegram system is to be applied. Isi t intended that sixpenny telegrams shall be enjoyed exclusively by residents in the metropolitan centres'! to know to what extent the cheap rates are to he applied in the country districts. I am as much interested as are my honourable friends who have just spoken, in obtaining concessions for residents'in the country. I pledged myself to support the zone system, but I find that that cannot be applied at present. There are a large number of towns throughout Victoria, New South Wales, and other States to which the sixpenny telegram system might he applied. For instance, there are such places as Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, and Launceston, and many others might be also suggested. The power to make regulations prescribing the limits within which the rates for town and suburban telegrams shall have effect is vested in the Governor General in Council; but I think it would be advisable to include in the Bill some provision which would indicate the limits within which these powers are to be exercised. If the sixpenny telegram system is to be applied to all cities, towns, and boroughs, with fairly populous surroundings, and a sufficient number of telegraph stations to justify special arrangements, a valuable concession would be made, but T should not vote in favour of the system being restricted to metropolitan centres only. limi t the town and suburban rates to metropolitan centres only. It is proposed to embrace every township which is associated with what may properly be termed suburbs-place s in which those engaged in business and trade reside beyond the boundaries of the town itself. Every such place will be entitled to consideration. It is impossible to fix an exact limit as to distance, because everything, will depend upon the circumstances of the town and its surroundings. be dealt with on the basis' of revenue, and the honourable member has referred. The not of distance. only consideration. The idea is that the has been established in New South Wales,' system should be applied to townships having suburbs in direct communication, and where a community of interest exists between the residents in the town and the immediate surroundings. This would be partly determined by the existence of telegraph stations, because a sixpenny telegram system could not be applied to places where there is only one station. An Honorable MEMBER -Would the system be applied to the area embraced within a 10 miles radius of.the townships % doubtedly. I am told that in New South Wales a very large number of towns are brought within the operation of the sixpenny telegram system. Thirteen miles happens to be the radius adopted there. It is not proposed to adopt any absolutely fixed rules, but to study the general circumstances of the settlements. If the Minister will permit me, I might explain that in New South Wales they have adopted a 13 miles radius, but within that radius there, must be collected an annual revenue of £2,500 per annum. hibitive. so prohibitive as the honourable and learned member seems to think. These radii are dotted all over New South Wales, and nearly the whole of the State is embraced by them. No difficulty is experienced i u the application of the sixpenny telegram system. It would be unfair to take any particular centre without considering its immediate surroundings. The township forming the centre might return a revenue It is not intended to of only £1,000 per annum, and the business transacted in the area embraced within the 13 miles radius outside of the township might not yield au income of more than £ 5 00 per annum. On the other hand, the cent-re might have only £500 of revenue, while the rest of the area made up the £2,500. Therefore, tlie Attorney-General must see that he had better proceed upon the basis of revenue, rather than, upon that of area, unless every post-office bo made the centre of a zone. officials tell me that the difficulty is that The revenue is not the they wish, from the practical basis which",30,Pairs

But there need not be the same anxiety in this respect, because a list of these centres will be published, and it will be open to this House from time to time to review and criticise it . Parliament will have the power of seeing that all places which ought properly to enjoy this privilege do so. There is no doubt that centres of the size of Bendigo will be included. I am told that in New South ""Wales the system is applied to very much smaller townships. The system is by no means limited to the metropolis. The intention is that it shall apply to numerous areas throughout the country. Mr A. M c LEAN (Gippsland) I regret that I cannot follow the proposal of the Government to make distinctions between certain favoured localities and the rest of the States. It appears to me that that proposal is in. keeping with almost every other move we have made in the direction of discouraging people from becoming producers, and of driving them as far as possible into the favoured centres of population. Why should we make this distinction ? So far as the working of the lines is concerned, it is just as cheap to send a message from Melbourne to Ballarat as it is to transmit one from Parliament House to the General Post-office. Of course, there is a difference in the first cost of the construction of the lines, but are we to levy blackmail for all time upon country residents, simply because they have had sufficient enterprise to settle there ? It is exceedingly unwise for us to endeavour by every means in our power to put burdens upon the country people. No doubt, before long the telegraph wires in the city will have to be placed underground, and that work will cost just as much as would the construction of a long line in the country. Yeti t is proposed that city residents should be able to transmit messages over short lines for 6d., whilst the producer in the country is to be charged 9d. for a similar privilege. I would further point outthat in connection with railways country residents are more heavily taxed than are the inhabitants of the city. If a man in the country sends a truck of stock or produce to the 44 D . Bates BUI. 15557 city, he has to pay freight; and similarly if he obtains a truck of goods.in return, he has again to pay the cost of carriage. The city resident does not contribute anything in that respect. He does not pay for the transit of produce from the country. pay it indirectly when he purchases his meat. MrA . McLEAN -The honourable member is wrong. Cattle from the furthest end of the States are sold in competition with stock which have never been trucked at all. The man who sells his produce does not get a farthing more for it , because of the amount of carriage which he has had to pay upon it . I see no justification whatever for the proposal, and I hope that the Government will not persist in it . If a sixpenny rate all round will not pay, I trust that some intermediate charge will be adopted which will enable the same principle to be applied alike to town and country. the Attorney-General to the honourable and learned member for Bendigo has emphasized the wisdom contained in my proposal to omit the words "" town and suburban."" Had that proposal been adopted, no difficulty could have arisen. The Attorney, General spoke of "" townships and their suburbs,"" but I do not know of any suburbs in Victoria outside of Melbourne, Ballarat, Bendigo, and Geelong. I am sorry that the honourable member for Parramatta has left the Chamber. He has argued that the adoption of a lower rate will produce a larger revenue in the towns than will a higher rate. Yet, in an amendment of which he has given notice, he proposes that a sixpenny rate shall apply within a radius of 600 miles. Does he say that tlie' revenue within that radius is likely to be increased by the -adoption of a sixpenny telegraph rate? Six hundred miles represents double the distance between Melbourne and the boundary of New South Wales. If w.e are to accept his authority that the lower rate will produce a largerrevenue in the towns, it is fair to -assume that it will also produce similar results in the more thickly populated districts. I feel so much the injustice which it is proposed to inflict upon tlie country districts in connection with this matter, that, if a proposal were made for the adoption of a sixpenny State rate, I should support it .

He admitted that he had no official authority for his statement, the accuracy of which I very much doubt. Under the circumstances, I fail to see how the honourable member for Parramatta. can consistently argue against the extension of a sixpenny rate to the whole of a State. against it . a proposal is submitted in favour of a sixpenny State rate, the honourable member will support it . terests are very largely centred in the country districts For many years I have been more intimately associated with the agricultural industry of Tasmania than with, any other. Therefore I am not likely to do anything which would in any way prejudice the interests of the producers. The reason why I draw a distinction between the city and suburban rates, and those applicable to the States, is that within the metropolitan area a very large expenditure upon the construction of -telegraph lines has been incurred. It is purely from a revenue point of view that I recognise that a distinction should be made. Seeing that this large expenditure has been incurred, it would be useless to impose a rate which would prevent people within the metropolitan area from taking advantage of the conveniences afforded them. If the rate be made too high, merchants will employ a boy on a bicycle, and run their messages from one centre to another within a small area, and the Commonwealth wilp be depleted of a very ccmsiderable amount of revenue. It is purely from a commercial stand-point, and in order to guard the reve-wants to telegraph to tlie country he must nue of the Commonwealth, that I in this instance support the Government in what I regard as a very clean-cut proposal, which is easily understood, and which, in many cases, will give country residents a great concession. the future we> shall be able, at a charge of Is., to send a telegram from Melbourne to Thursday Island, a distance of something like 5,000 miles, surely we may regard that as a step in the direction of extreme liberality. If we closely analyze the proposal of the Government, we find that the advantages are largely in favour of the domestic sender as compared with commercial senders. Those engaged in commercial pursuits have perforce to send much longer telegrams than are usual in domestic life. There may be a little bit of jugglery, seeing that the original proposal was f d. for every additional word, and that it is now I d . , and in a lengthy telegram it will be found, in many instances, that the charge is as much, or considerably more, I never have argued than under the original proposal. But taking it all round, I regard the compromise as very reasonable, and one that ought to be generally accepted by tlie committee. should like to reply to some statements made by the honourable members for Gippsland, Echuca, and Laanecoorie concerning the great disadvantages under which country residents are supposed to labour. I know well the general disadvantages which attach to country life ; and I am as keenly anxious as any honourable member to place country residents on an equality with those in the towns.

I take it that if the city man pay 9d., and so with the country man who wants to telegraph to the town. It is a reciprocal arrangement; and in the country, overa given area, the same advantages will be enjoyed as in the cities and suburbs. If When' we consider that in it were intended to make the country resident pay 9d. for every telegram he despatched, it would be a different matter.

We ought to have a local rate such as is proposed; but it would be absurd, when all the other States have townand suburban rates, to attempt to raise the rate to 9d. My desire is to give equal treatment to the town and country, and I suggest that after the word "" suburban "" the words ""or within twenty miles from the sending station "" be inserted. This would give the advantage of the sixpenny rate to country towns which are in proximity to each other. It would make the population of each area in the Commonwealth receive similar and equal treatment to those living in another equal area. of the Government, except as to fixing the limit. not yet even suggested it . We heard from the honourable member for Parramatta the other night that in New South Wales there is a local postage rate operating within a radius of thirteen -miles, and the same principle could be applied to the telegraphic service. This would leavethesixpenny rate in Sydney, Brisbane, and other large centres, and, at tlie same time, would give an equal privilege to country residents. If the Minister reserves the power to define [28 AUG.,., 1902.] Bates BUI. 15559 0 what is a town, he will be pestered by deputations, which will want every small centre declared a "" town,"" and so constant political pressure will be put on him,i and he will thereby create' a great deal of trouble for himself. There are business men in small centres who are as much entitled to consideration as are business men in the cities. The honourable member for Wentworth, when the honourable member for Laanecoorie was speaking, interjected that it is the business men who make the telegraph service pay; and I think that is correct. In Bacchus Marsh, which I can take as a fair example of an Australian country town, there are 500 or 600 people, and I did not. I said I would 30 or 40 shops; and the business men there should have equal rights with the business men in Prahrau, Collins-street, or South Melbourne. The same remark may be made of many Gippsland centres which could not possibly be described as towns with suburbs, but which should have the advantage of a system such as I have suggested, and which I trust the Government will grant. MrM c C AY (Corinella) -In default of a uniform rate for the whole of each State, which I should much prefer, I think there is a great deal of force in the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Corio. If that suggestion were adopted the administration would be relieved of a great deal of pressure, and from possible charges of unjust discrimination. If . it be left to the Minister to define towns, varying reports will be made by the officers of the Postal department as to the paying or non-paying character of the proposals made, and endless trouble will be created. I venture to say that there is not a township in Australia that would not ask, and properly ask, to be regarded as a centre in this connection. The Minister will find it very difficult indeed to draw a distinction between granting a privilege to all and granting it to none except cities. If he granted it only to .the latter, all the alleged equality of treatment for the country would disappear altogether. I therefore trust that the Minister will accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Corio, which, while it does not go as far as I should like, will meet the difficulty.

Sir JOHNQUI CK (Bendigo) I think that the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Corio is worthy of consideration. It will be an unfortunate thing if in our legislation we make a discrimination between town and suburban areas and country areas. Any discrimination that is made should be based upon distance, so that it may not appear that special concessions are being granted to aggregations of population. learned member for Corinella that the Executive will be given an almost insoluble problem to determine if they have to decide iu what cases the sixpenny rate shall apply, and in what cases it shall not apply. There is no statutory definition of a ' town or a suburb, and therefore the application of town and suburban rates would depend upon the personal view of the Minister at the head of the department, which, of course, would be subject to the representations made to him, and the information at his disposal. It would be a graceful concession to country views and interests if a discrimination based upon distance were substituted for the discrimination now provided for. obtain data which would enable us to say with confidence what the exact financial effect of these proposals would be. We can estimate that effect only from the experience which has been gained in New South Wales, where a thirteen-mile limit has been in operation. Both the other proposals which have been submitted by the Government mean an immense reduction in the telegraphic rates at present prevailing throughout the Commonwealth. We have reduced the maximum Inter-State rate from 4s. to Is. That is a reduction which will operate largely in the interests of the country districts, by cheapening their communication with the centres of population which they supply, and with which they do business. But in order that it may not be felt that the various parts of the Commonwealth are not sharing alike in the advantages which are being given, we are ready to accept, though with some hesitancy, the proposal of the honourable and learned member for 'Corio, if he will agree to the reduction of the distance from twenty miles to fifteen miles.

Throughout Victoria there are towns which may be regarded pretty well as county towns. Market days are observed there, stock sales are held there, and they are general centres for business. It would be of great advantage to give the people residing in the smaller townships around these larger towns the advantage of cheap rates, so far as their telegraphic communication with the larger towns is concerned; but I think that, to be of any advantage, the radius provided for in the amendment should be increased from 15 to 25 miles. That extension is certainly necessary to c6Ver the cases which I have in my mind in which I think the convenience should apply. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I am of opinion that the distance should be increased to 25 miles. This is a matter ofimportance to the electors on the West Coast, because it is 21 miles from Strahan to Zeehan, and 25 miles from Zeehan to Queenstown. Why should a discrimination be made between the citizens of the Commonwealth in violation of the provisions of the Constitution ? to me that the Government are offering a concession which is practically worth nothing. The 15-mile radius which they are willing to concede is practically no more than the suburban limitation. Towns like Bendigo, Ballarat, Castlemaine, and Maryborough, get no additional advantage from the adoption of the 15-mile radius. I am in favour of a uniform rate.

The Postmaster-General is not in a position to advise me that any exceptions can be made. rather surprised at the attitude assumed by the Government, seeing that they agreed to an amendment providing for a substantial reduction on the rate for the carriage of materials for the blind.

Sir WILLIAM M c MILLAN (Wentper 100 words within a State. worth) -In regard to the second part of the schedule, I think there should be the that to' reduce the rate would lead to same comparative liberality or generosity an acceleration of communication. This 44 E that has been extended to the first part. This second part might be a little simplified by reducing the number of lines in it from press message not exceeding 25 words is very fair, and the same may be said of the charge of 9d. for messages exceeding 25 words, but not exceeding 50 words; but I think the next line might be omitted. It is a bad principle, in my opinion, to differentiate between telegrams for ordinary purposes, and press telegrams connected with the Commonwealth. Such differentiation must lead to a great deal of difficulty, and I do not know of any principle of equity on which it can be defended. We are dealing with the Commonwealth I cannot accept as a whole, and it looks like making a close preserve for ourselves when we create special terms for telegrams relating to Commonwealth affairs. The special charges are confined to Executive matters and debates in the House, but the next proposal will be to extend them to speeches made by Federal members outside, and to all matters connected with the Federal Government. The best plan would be to reduce the rates as far as the department can see its way to allow it, and, in order to avoid complications, to apply the same rates all round. My proposal is that for Inter-State telegrams of all kinds, the charge for 25 words should be 9d., which is 50 per cent, more that the charge within a State; and that for a message of more than 25 words, and not exceeding 50 words, the charge shall be Is. and for every additional 50 words, 9d. That would make the rates for messages within a State, not exceeding 25 words, 6d., and from one State to another, 9d.; for messages exceeding 25 words, but not exceeding 50 words, within a State, 9d., and throughout the Commonwealth, I s . ; while for every additional 50 words, or portion of the Minister inform me State, and 9d. throughout the Commonwealth.

171,Sir William Mcmillan,"I thinkParliament can sit only in one State, but the people of the whole Commonwealth should be informed of its proceedings as quickly as possible. To that end, I think it is better to lower the telegraphic rates all round to a reasonable extent than to make the distinction provided for in the schedule. It does not seem to me that it is fair that the rate throughout the Commonwealth should be double the rate within a State. In my opinion a difference of 50 per cent, would be sufficient. In the next rate, I propose an addition of 33 per cent. ThenI propose that the rate for an additional 50 words shall be 6d. within a State, and 33 per cent, more throughout the Commonwealth ; so that whereas the charge for telegrams relating to Commonwealth parliamentary and executive proceedings is 6d. for every additional 50 words, I propose to make it 9d. Sir PHILIPPYSH to call the attention of the committee to the fact that the Bill before us was very much liberalized by the Senate. The Postmaster General originally proposed that the rate for every additional 50 words within a State should be 9d., but the Bill now makes it 6d. I intend to go still further, however, and to reduce the charge for every additional 50 words for transmission throughout the Commonwealth from Is. 6d. to Is. Those are lower rates than have been imposed throughout the States hitherto. Seeing that, under the rates now proposed by the Government, enough words to fill a whole column of the Argus can be telegraphed for about 10s. 6d., the charges are surely cheap enough. In view of the concessions made in dealing with other parts of the Bill, I cannot accede to the proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth, and must ask the committee to support this schedule as it stands, with the amendment of which I have given notice. worth) -My point is that it would be better to get r i d of the distinction between telegrams giving Commonwealth intelligence and other telegrams, and to do that I suggest the reduction of the ordinary rates. Of course, if the Government will not agree to a reduction of rates, I do not wish to compel the newspapers to pay more for the transmission of Commonwealth intelligence. the proposals of the Government,* rather than those oi the honourable member for Wentworth, will be accepted. Under the latter the charge for the first 100 words of a message .transmitted within a State would be Is. 3d., instead of Is. 6d., as provided for in the Bill, while there would' be a corresponding reduction in the case of messages for transmission beyond the borders of a State. But the proposal of the Minister to reduce the rate for every additional 50 words for transmission beyond the borders of a State from Is. 6d. to Is. brings' all the rates into conformity. It brings the charge for every additional 50' words for transmission beyond a State into -conformity with the charge for the transmission of an additional 50 words within a State, and also into conform-ity with the charge for messages relating to Commonwealth parliamentary and executive proceedings for transmission beyond a State. Therefore I think that, I wish first of all on the whole, the proposals of the Government are fairer than those of the honourable member for Wentworth. I do not agree -with him that we have no right to allow messages relating to the proceedings of the Federal Parliament to be transmitted at a lower rate than is charged for the transmission of ordinary news. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN I did not say that we had no right to do so, but I think that we should get rid of the distinction. able member's words in shorthand as he uttered them, and he said-""We have no right to make this a close preserve for ourselves."" Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN W h a t I meant to convey was that it is not politic to do so, not that we have no power to do so. we not merely have the right, but that it is our duty to do so. Surely information concerning the proceedings of this Parliament is of far. more importance to the people of Western Australia, or of Queensland, and of other remote parts of the continent, than 1 news respecting a football match or a racemeeting. the report of a football match would be . much more interesting. ports of football matches and race meetingsmay of ten be of great interest to the people of the Commonwealth, but they cannot be of' so much importance to them as reports of the proceedings of this Parliament.

177,Mr Mahon,"I do not deny that reproperty and even the lives of the people are affected by our decisions here, and it; is proper that we should give facilities for making these decisions known. But the proposals of the honourable member for Wentworth virtually amount to the contention that news concerning football matches, race meetings, and other trifling incidents of passing interest, that are of no real moment, are as important as information respecting the proceedings of this Parliament, and should be sent at the same rates. In my opinion, we did wisely when we decided that reports of the proceedings of this Parliament, and of the Commonwealth Executive should be telegraphed at lower rates than those charged for the transmission of general news. If the proposals of the honourable member for Wentworth be accepted, it will be necessary to recast the whole of the second part of the schedule, and I do not think that that is advisable. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I think that the proposal of the Minister is rather better than that of the honourable member for feVentworth. Under the Minister's proposals, the charge for 200 words would be 2s., while under the proposals of the honourable member for Wentworth it would be 2s. 3d. I think, however, that there should be some reduction in the charge for Inter-State messages. If a reduction is made for messages within a State, there should be also a reduction for InterState messages. In my opinion, the amendment of which the Minister has given notice will not meet the case. I think that it is as necessary that the people of Queensland, and of other distant places, should be given cheap telegraph rates as it is tliat the rates within the States should be low. worth) -The schedule, as it stands, is rather ridiculous in this respect: The charge for messages within a State is 9d. for 25 words and not exceeding 50 words, but for 50 words and not exceeding 100 words, it is Is. 6d., or twice as much, so that there is no concession there, because of the longer message. Then for Commonwealth telegrams, the charge is Is. for 25 words, Is. 6d. for a message not exceeding 100 words, and 3s. for a message exceeding 100 words. words, there is a very big concession. think that there should be an intermediate concession. I do not know that it matters it very much in practical press work, but it seems to me that the 3s. rate might be reduced. posed a ful l column of news could be telegraphed for 13s. course, the real point, so far as the newspaper proprietors are concerned, is the reduction of the rates for messages containing more than 100 words. A t the same time, there are many short, pithy telegrams of less than 100 words, and I think that in. view of the rates charged for telegrams up to 50 words, it would be fair to reduce the charges for messages exceeding 50 words, but not exceeding 100 words to 2s. 6d. perts do not regard the present press rates as payable. proposed are fairly reasonable. sent time, if a press correspondent wishes tosend 100 words from Melbourne to Western. Australia he has to pay 4s. 6d., and a similar amount is charged for every subsequent 100 words. Thus, a message containing 200 words would cost 9s. Under the Government proposals a message of 200 words could be sent from Melbourne to Western Australia for 5s. I answer the question of the honourable member for Wentworth by saying that this must be regarded as a very satisfactory reduction so far as the more remote parts of the continent are concerned.. I would not presume to speak for the Sydney newspaper proprietors. charges for press telegrams to Western Australia are extremely high. to press messages despatched from Melbourne to Queensland. I think that the Government have offered very fair terms. The committee should remember tliat this department is not paying expenses, and the mail services hitherto existing in remote portions of Australia are for this reason being curtailed. If these rates are reduced the size of the departmental deficit will form an excuse for the further curtailment of the facilities given and so badly required in the far interior of the continent. I for one will never be a party to a policy which But I will have that result, and which will also form a pretext for reducing the wages of the servants of the Commonwealth.",41,Mceacharn Mel 50 Words The Rate Would Be 6d Within A

A -Canadai t is the practice to transmit press material reduction has been made in the messages at night at half-rates. worth) -Although the Government have not been reduced to the same extent as made considerable reductions in the rates they have in connection with private telecharged for Inter-State press telegrams, I grams. think that, as a matter of symmetry, they should reduce the 3s. rate for messages not exceeding 100 words to 2s. 3d.

The effect of these amendments will be to reduce the rate for telegrams exceeding 50, but not exceeding 100 words, transmitted within any State, from Is. 6d. to Is. 3d., and to decrease the charge for Inter-State messages of similar length from 3s. to 2s. 3d. there is any justification for the great charges for the transmission of press messages. been a little too liberal in regard to ordinary messages, is no reason why we should continue to make concessions which have remind honourable members that last year cause the balance-sheet did not cover inter-",42,Mceacharn Mel 50 Words The Rate Would Be 6d Within A

197,Mr Fowl Er (Perth),"I think thatwhich has heen made in connection with the transmission of press telegrams is not equal to that made upon private messages, the fact must hot be overlooked that hitherto the press have enjoyed a considerable advantage as compared with 'private citizens. Mr L. E. GROOM (DarlingI desire to ask the Attorney-General if it is not possible to extend the definition at the top of the third column of part 2 of this schedule, which applies to press telegrams "" relating to Parliamentary proceedings of the Commonwealth."" vote be taken upon the proposal of the acting leader of the Opposition, will that definition be considered to have been agreed to by the committee 1 would. able and learned member will not press this suggestion. The definition is a fairly general one, and if it be found necessary to extend it hereafter that course can be adopted at an)' moment. MrL . E. GROOM -Unde r that definition press telegrams at the reduced rate would be restricted to Parliamentary debates and Executive proceedings. It would not cover the publication of statistical information, reports of deputations, Customs prosecutions, or important trials before the High Court, all of which are matters of general interest. I think that the definition ought to be extended by adding the words ""and Commonwealth affairs."" That would .cover anything relating to the official proceedings of the Commonwealth. I trust that the Government will accept the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs. It is perfectly absurd that a rate of Is. per 100 words should be charged only upon .telegrams relating to parliamentary and Executive proceedings. In this connection I would point out that Executive acts may at any time call for the issue of a manifesto by the leader of the Opposition or the leader of the labor party. Indeed they might necessitate comment on the part of any private member. the reports of Government proceedings would be telegraphed to the newspapers at the rate of Is. per 100 words, a charge of Is. 6d. per 100 words would be levied upon the criticism of a private member. The latter should have equal rights with members of the Executive in this respect. Downs) not, although I admit that some of the privileges enjoyed by Ministers have recently been swept away. Some of the regulations issued by the Executive have a' very important bearing upon the customs and and Executive postal departments. Take for instance, the If a regulations issued the other day in connection with tlie Post and Telegraph Act. If any honourable member had thought it necessary to comment upon them, or to show reasons why they should not come-, No . into force, the press would have been charged double rates for the transmission of his views. I hope that the honorMinisterial defence of-them. that it is most unfair to discriminate between the character of tlie matter transmitted. The only equitable method which can be adopted is to allow all press telegrams to be despatched at a uniform rate. I feel strongly upon this matter, and I am sony that the Government have broken the arrangement which was entered into with this' side of the House. The House met at eleven o'clock this morning so that honourable members from other States might be enabled to return home this afternoon. The understanding was tliat the Bill should., be passed. caught napping once, and we shall be very wary in future. worth) -No doubt there is a great deal in the contention of the honourable member for Macquarie. It frequently happens that election speeches and addresses delivered upon the public platform are just as important as are Executive proceedings. It is of no use to press the matter now, if the Government do not intend to take it into consideration. We must keep within the terms prescribed by the Government, or make them as extensive as possible, so as Yet whilst to include everything connected with the Pederal Government, Parliament, or Ministers in any part of Australia. This is a difficult matter, but it is one which can be revived in the future.",43,Mceacharn Mel 50 Words The Rate Would Be 6d Within A
