7,Mr Deakin,"It is.AND Dr. asked notice1. How is the difference between his estimate of the yearly cost of a militiaman, £ 1 3 12s. (that is £ 2 0 , as stated by him, less £ 6 8s. pay), and a National Guardsman, £ 5 (without pay), made up; and will he give the detailed items making up each amount? 2. Do thc amounts, £ 1 3 izs. and £ 5 , provide for administration and instruction only ? Is the cost of accoutrements, clothing, rifles, ammuni-. tion, and general outfit, a ll in addition to the above-named annual cost? able member's questions1. The difference between the cost of a militiaman, £ 2 0 , and a National Guardsman, ^ 5 , is made up approximately of Administration and instruction, cluding camps and schools instruction ... Pay Clothing, &c. ... -Stores, contingencies, &c a. No. Rifles and accoutrements are not included, but clothing and ammunition are. If arms, accoutrements, stores, field guns, ammunition, works and buildings, & c , are added, the cost of the present system averages over' ^30 per head, but since some of the items of this expenditure are non-recurring (in the ordinary sense of the term) they should be regarded rather as initial expenditure. .The consideration of three ordinary items,' perhaps, will make it clear to the right honourable member that a multiplication sum does not explain the situation. For instance-tent s and blankets, used under the present system, sumcient for 20,000 men for a four days' camp, are .stowed away practically for thc rest of the year. Since there are (say) ninety times four days in the year, if it were possible to bring a new body into camp for training immediately after the previous detach' ment had completed its period, the same tents and blankets would furnish covering for about a million and three-quarters men in a year. The same would apply to the other appurtenances. If one camp is for four days and another for eighteen 'days, to multiply the cost by four and a half is not justifiable, because the men only travel once to an eighteen days' camp, not four and a half times. per head will not increase four and a half number of men to hold local camps, the distance the individuals would travel would be perhaps a quarter of t h e distance. The lime of fhe inV structors also w ill be utilized in training and not in travelling. Therefore, a much less number of COST OF MILITIAMAN AND instructors for any given number of men would be requisite. When the House has dealt with the main principle and approaches the consideraPAY-LON G SERVICE MEDAL. right honourable member on every point. the Ministerof Defence, upon ister of Defence, upon notice1. As the DefenceB i ll provides for compulsory training for eight' years, viz. :For eighteen days for each of the first three years; For seven days foreach of the last five years.; and as the rate of entry is estimated at 27,000 a year, will not the estimated number under training at the end. of the eighth year be 216,000? 2. If pay were fixed at a day, would not the total amount to be paid for the third year 'be £346,500 and for tbe eighth year £600,750? / right honourable member's questions are1. If all entering completed their periods, the number identified with thc Forces in the eighth year would probably be approximately as stated; £ s. d. but such is not a reasonable expectation.

Sir PHIL IP FYSH (Denison) [3.12] When progress was reported on Friday last I was about to deal with a question of vital importance, not only ' to Tasmania, but to every other State of the Commonwealth. I pointed out that section 94 of the Constitution makes provision for a fair distribution of the surplus revenue from Customs and Excise after a period of five years, but I am not aware that Ministers have shown any desire to carry out the duty imposed on them in that respect. I do know, however, that the honourable member for North. Sydney, when he retired from the Reid-McLean Ministry, after one year of sfervice, expressed an opinion on the subject. I think I am fairly representing that honourable member when I say that, in his opinion, the period of five years was regarded by the framers of the Constitution as sufficiently long in which",13,Customs Administration Export Of Adulterated Chaff out Y

28,Mr Deakin Laid Upon The Table Tlie,"to discover what would be a fair distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue. The honourable member stated that during that period we should have gained experience, and that there had been, in one or two States, somewhat serious changes; as, for instance, in Tasmania, where the difference between the amount paid per capita there and the amount paid per capita in the otlier States, at the time of Federation, had been reduced from about 20S. to something over ios. reached a period when our Customs and Excise revenue realizes, roughly, 55s. per head, and the figures show that the States in this connection are drawing nearer to each other every year. Even Tasmania, with a small population, is becoming more closely allied, so far as the amount per head is concerned, with the other States, and, under the circumstances, it is very disappointing to the Treasurer and people of Tasmania that no steps have been taken under section 94 of the Constitution to remedy what I shall show has been to Tasmania an immense evil. Prior to Federation the Customs and Excise revenue of Tasmania was £ 4 8 0 , 0 0 0 . Federation, under the Kingston Tariff, the revenue amounted to £ 3 2 0 , 0 0 0 , whereas now, that the amount likely to be received for the current year is only. £ 2 1 0 , 0 0 0 . has necessitated a very serious call on direct taxation, in order to make up the deficiency to the Treasurer of the State. Prior to Federation, the indirect taxation in Tasmania amounted to about £ 4 8 0 , 0 0 0 , and the direct taxation to about ,£100,000, but now the Customs and Excise revenue yields only the £ 2 1 0 , 0 0 0 . surer of Tasmania has made, or partly made, up that serious falling off by direct taxation to the amount of £ 2 1 0 , 0 0 0 . Under our Electoral Act, every man and woman exercises the suffrage; and we find that whereas 88 per cent, of the voting power is responsible for 4.15 per cent, of the direct taxation, 12 per cent, is responsible for 95.85. It will be seen, therefore, how nearly we are approaching a period when, if more direct-taxation be necessary, we shall invert the old democratic order of things, and have representation without taxation. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Taxation with practical Iv no representation. -has the position become that I must call the attention of honourable members to facts which prove, so fa r as Tasmania is concerned, that that State is keeping pace with the neighbouring States. Tasmania is closely approximating in her private wealth, her imports and exports, savings of the people, and so forth, with the other States, so there can be no reason to suppose that the State has drifted into a position of less importance from the point of view of revenue. I should like honourable members to give their attention for a moment to the We have now figures. I find that whereas, in 1902, the imports of Tasmania were valued at £ 1 , 1 9 2 , 0 0 0 , they are now. valued at £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , while the exports, which were previously £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , are now represented by £ 3 , 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Then, as showing the t h r if t and accumulation of wealth on the part of the people, we find that -while the Savings Bank deposits in 1902 amounted to £ 6 9 1 , 0 0 0 , they now amount to , £ i ) 4 "" ° ° °These figures, I think, show that Tasmania is keeping pace with the other States, and showing her ability to take her proper place in the Commonwealth; yet we find that, so far as the distribution of Customs and Excise reSoon after venue is concerned, there has been a serious falling off, and a very large deficit has to be faced. This sugspeaking from memory, I think gests a very serious problem which we must at some time or another consider. ThisI f honourable members agree with me that in the matter of savings, wealth, and trade, I may fairly compare the 180,000 people in Tasmania with a similar number of persons in any other part of the Commonwealth, they must admit that the £ 2 1 0 , 0 0 0 , which is now being paid to Tasmania from Customs and Excise reThe Treavenue, is not ai fair proportion of the total revenue received from that source by the Commonwealth Treasurer. The fact that in connection with Inter-State adjustments, New South Wales and Victoria have had to make good to the other States£ 2 , 7 0 0 , 0 0 0 , discloses the trend of trade during the seven years since the establishment of Federation. In the' circumstances, it might be expected that the Governments of those States would be prepared to show some consideration for the States whose revenues they have collected, and to assist in securing a fairer distribution of the Customs and Excise revenue.

29,. Sir Philip Fysh,"Yes. So seriousSir PHILIPFYSH proper reply to make to the Treasurer that, whilst the' Governments of Victoria and New South Wales might not, when privately consulted, have been prepared to do what I suggest, if Ministers had in this House .madeany proposal, under section 94 of the Constitution, to deal more fairly with the weaker States, they would have found a disposition amongst honourable members to suppoit such a proposal. We have never had any such proposal put before us, and ^during the period I have mentioned, Victoria and New South Wales have profited by the filtration of that amount of the trade of other States through their merchants, and Tasmania has lost a profit which she might have obtained if. her trade oversea had been done directly with her own merchants, I think that if the matter had been put fairly before this House in the form of a proposal under section 94 of the Constitution, a more equitable adjustment would have been arrived at. ficials, after investigating the matter, denv that anv loss can be traced. so, and it would possibly be very difficult to trace any loss in connection with the smaller .items on which Customs duties are collected. The figure I have referred to is, however, on record, as the amount involved in the necessary. Inter-State adjustments between New South Wales and Victoria and the other States. Victoria and £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 .

Sir PHILIPFYSH I direct attention to the fact that in Tasmania we have not only the land tax, to which I have referred imposed and collected by the State Government, but land taxation imposed and collected by local Boards equivalent to shire councils in the other States of the Commonwealth. In addition to the State land tax of from one half-penny to one penny per £ 1 according to the value of piivate estates, we have local Board taxation up to is. in the £ 1 for road purposes, and taxation varying in amount for the destruction of the codlin moth and other insect pests. So far as the other States are concerned I am aware that in most of them shire councils collect local rates for local purposes, and these may be compared with the taxation imposed „by local Boards in Tasmania for road purposes. In Tasmania the number of owners of real estate is 22,741. Of these 22,000 pav land taxation on properties under the value of £ 5 , 0 0 0 , and 741 on properties exceeding £ 5 , 0 0 0 in value.

The value of our imports of cordage and twine increased during the same period from £ 1 8 5 , 0 0 0 to £ 2 0 8 , 0 0 0 ; drugs and chemicals from ,£342,000 to £ 3 9 1 , 0 0 0 ; leather from £ 9 1 , 0 0 0 to £ 1 0 1 , 0 0 0 ; machines ancl machinery from £ 8 1 7 , 0 0 0 to £ 8 8 3 , 0 0 0 ; and manufactures of metals from £ 4 5 9 , 0 0 0 to £ 6 0 7 , 0 0 0 . The total value of our imports for the first four months of the present financial year was £16,748,000 as against £16,200,000 in respect of the corresponding four months of last year. We have in these figures a demonstration of the fact which was brought prominently before the notice of the Committee when the Tariff was under consideration, that there are certain classes of goods that cannot possibly be manufactured in the Commonwealth for a great number of years, and which,' consequently, we must continue to import, no matter how high the duty may be.

At present there is a very serious leakage of revenuea revenue which, so far as Tasmania is concerned, amounted to £70,000 annually, before it was affected by the Excise duty. When the time comes for us to review our financial position, I hope that we shall find it necessary to inquire how far the free admission of these manufactures is assisting the development of the tobacco industry. of those articles does not all represent loss. For instance, the tags are paid for. Sir PHIL IP FYSH I have already alluded to the fact that a part of the loss sustained by the Customs revenue is returned to the Commonwealth by means of the Excise levied upon tobacco. That remark, however, does not apply to essences. I merely call attention to the fact that we are paying too dearly for the encouragement which we are according our tobacco manufacturers. They do not employ a large number of hands; and hitherto tobacco has contributed so considerably to the revenue that it is very questionable whether we ought not to review our position in this connection. If the Treasurer is really watchful of the sources of our reyenue, I think that he will devote more attention to this inatter. An honourable member who preceded me went so very fully into the matter of the payment of sugar bounties that I shall not traverse the same ground. But, in passing, I wish to say that we have paid very dearly for our experience in this matter. Kanakas at a cost of £11,400, we have disbursed £1,845,000 in sugar bounties, and otber expenses have amounted to £7,000. £1,900,000 has been contributed to the sugar industry, and all that we have accomplished in the way of preserving a "" White Australia'' consists of the deportation of 4,000 Kanakas, leaving 60,000 Syrians, Japanese, and Chinese within our borders. This result goes to show how easily we are induced by a popular cry to do serious things without achieving any good result. plished a great deal. Sir PHIL IP FYSH -It is true that the number of sugar planters in the Commonwealth has been increased by about 4,000, demonstrating that the larger plantations have been subdivided. But we have not got rid of the whole of the Kanakas, and I do not know when we shall do so. Personally, I think it is a very good .thing that our own people have demonstrated their ability to undertake the work in the canefields. I have merely called attention to the enormous expenditure incurred in connection with the sugar industry. Mr W. H . IRVINE -What is the. total amount of that expenditure? Sir PHIL IP FYSH About £1,910,000. Mr W. H . IRVINE -That represents the accumulated amounts paid by way of sugar bounties? amount that has been paid to the industry since the consummation of Federation, and during the current financial year we shall have to pay an additional £518,900. We are also losing by way of Customs duty £503,000 annually, less the amount that may be paid in Excise. does not know the amount that has been paid in wages? I have occupied the time of the Committee quite long enough. But I felt it my duty to call attention to these items, especially in view of the position occupied by Tasmania, and I hope that honourable members will recognise the very serious aspect which I have put to them. In addition, it is well worth our while to consider what would be the result of future taxation if applied to land. I have been able to instance only the case of Tasmania, because that is the We have repatriated 4,000 only State for which official figures are available. At the present time the holders of land under £5,000 value in that State number 22,000. It would be useI n . the aggregate, therefore, less to limit the collection of a land tax upon estates of more than £5,000 value, because we should then get only eight-fourteenths of the total amount that would otherwise be returned. So that if, under a land tax, based upon the rate payable in Tasmania, £1,500,000 would be collected throughout the Commonwealth, six-fourteenths of it would be contributed by persons who hold land of £5,000 value and under. Thus we should have cast upon us the serious responsibility of imposing a burden upon those who, as the result of thrift, have accumulated small sums in the Savings Bank and building societies, and who have invested those sums in homes for themselves. I hope we shall never do that. I trust that we shall be able to finance the Commonwealth through all her dim-",19,William Lyne No It Was Be £^99>°°O Less So That Tliere Is Another

45,Sir Philip Fysh,"No. I think thatculties without being compelled to resort to direct taxation in the form of a land tax. not intend to address myself at great length to the position of the sugar industry, because that question has already been exhausti%'ely dealt with by the honourable member for Wide Bay. But some remarks of the honourable member for Denison call for a reply. He stated that the net result of the assistance which has been accorded to the sugar industry has been the deportation of some 4,000 kanaikas. That statement is quite correct, and I think that the Commonwealth is to be heartily congratulated upon the success of its policv in that connection.' During the past hundred years only one similar experiment has taken place, upon an extensive scale. I refer to the deportation by the British Government of some 8,000 or 1.0,000 French, from Nova Scotia, to the United States and elsewhere, in 1815. A great deal of suffering was associated with that movement, but I am glad to say that the Kanakas were deported from Queensland without anv serious trouble, notwithstanding the dire prophecies of many that their return to their own islands would be marked by a good -deal of bloodshed. Happily, nothing of the sort has occurred. The honourable member for Denison also asserted that the Commonwealth had succeeded in taking 4,000 Kanakas from the sugar industry, leaving 60,000 Syrians, Japanese, and Hindoos engaged in it. I should like to point out to him that the total number of coloured persons engaged in the industry in Queensland and New South Wales, during 1905, was 8,452, whereas, in 1907. it was only 3,345, a difference of over 60 per cent. honourable member for Denison to say that €0,000 coloured persons had been left in the country, not in the industry? understood the honourable member.' In 1905 I expressed the opinion that there was no occasion to pay the bounty in New South Wales or Southern Queensland, because the effect produced was not commensurate with the amount paid. In New South Wales matters have gone back instead of progressing in regard to the employment of white labour. In Queensland the effect of the bounty has been very marked, as the number of coloured people now employed in the industry as compared with those employed in 1901 shows a striking decrease. In 1902 the percentage of farmers employing coloured labour in Queensland was 60.9, and of those employing white labour 39.1. In 1907 thepercentage of employers of black labour in Queensland had fallen to 8.8, while in the case of white laibour the percefttage had increased to 91.2a very marked difference. But in New South Wales the percentage of farmers employing black labour, which was 10.3 in 1902, had increased to 10.7 in 1907 -a n advance of 0.4 per cent., so that the bounty has had no effect in New South Wales. The estimate, for next year shows a slight improvement in those figures of 2.8 per cent., but up to the present the effect of the bounty in New South Wales has been actually to increase the percentage of farmers employing coloured labour. Therefore, as I said in 1905, there is no necessity for paying 'the bounty in New South Wales or Southern Queensland, because the farmers there had all the white labour they required prior to the payment of the bounty, and there were as many of them employing white labour then as there are to-day. The bounty might be well wiped out in No. 3 district-Queensland 1 and in No. 4 district in New South Wales. I shall not deal further with the sugar question at present, because it is not of great urgency at this moment. We shall have to consider it again shortly when we are called upon to decide whether the bounty system should be continued or not. There are more pressing questions in regard to the finances of the Commonwealth that deserve our immediate attention. I thought when the honourable member for Denison was speaking in reference to Excise duties that he would favour nationalization. I had a faint hope in that direction for a moment, until the honourable member corrected me. Unhappily, * I do not think . the honourable member is built that way. It is about the last thing one would expect from him. The honourable member pointed out that there are sources of taxation in Australia which have not been touched yet, or which, if they have been touched, might be considerably more developed. There is a great deal in what the honourable member, said in regard to the Excise duty on spirits. There are many sources of revenue which the present Government might very easily tap if they had the courage; but that is just what they lack. I will mention three possible sources of revenue. There is, first, the tobacco industry. So",20,William Lyne No It Was Be £^99>°°O Less So That Tliere Is Another

We .say to the Government, "" Here is our policy; will you help us to carry it out?"" As long as a Government will do that, we are perfectly satisfied.

On page 37 of the Budget papers is detailed the taxation paid by that State over a series of years; but, although the estimated return . from Customs and Excise for the present year is only £ 3 8 0 , 0 0 0 , as against £ 4 8 9 , 1 5 1 in 1900, it must be remembered that the difference between the two amounts represents money which has remained in the pockets of the people. manian representatives are complaining that the Customs and Excise returns are not large enough, and that the State Treasury suffers, the New South Wales representatives complain that this taxation is too heavy, and that the Treasurer of their State receives too much from this source, the Customs and Excise taxation of New South Wales having increased £ 1 , 7 8 5 , 7 8 1 in 1900 to £ 4 , 2 7 2 , 6 9 6 , the .estimated receipts for the present year. Whom are we to follow, the representatives of Tasmania, or those of New South Wales? As for the complaints of the State Treasurers, in 1900 the Customs and Excise revenues of the States totalled £ 7 , 7 6 2 , 6 5 3, of which New South Wales received £ 1 , 7 8 5 , 7 8 1 , Victoria£ 2 , 3 4 2 , 4 8 5 , Queensland £ 1 , 5 6 1 , 4 8 6 , South Australia £ 6 3 9 , 0 0 4 , Western Australia £944;74 > and Tasmania£ 4 8 9 , 1 5 1 . During the years 1901-2 to 1907-8 inclusive, the States have received £54,176,909 from the Commonwealth, an average of about £7>739>S5 per annum, or an average for the seven years of within £ 2 3 , 0 0 0 of what the total Customs and Excise revenue amounted to in 1900, and have been relieved of the cost of the transferred Departments. Therefore, although their populations have increased, their Treasurers have no good cause for denouncing the action of the Commonwealth Parliament in depriving them of the surplus revenue.

Postmaster-General Less Expenses (p. 4) Patents Trade Marks, &c. New Revenue ... Miscellaneous The not intended to speak this afternoon, I am not as f u l ly prepared as I should like to be to deal with this subject, and therefore, in concluding my speech, I leave unsaid a good deal which I had intended to place before the Committee. doubt most honourable members will desire to express their opinions in regard to the Budget. I particularly wish to do so, because of my attitude in connection with a While the Tasrecent vote which was taken. The more I investigate the figures, the more I am satisfied that it was right that there should be a distinct declaration by the House of its appreciation of the important fact that our expenditure has grown so much that the revenue is now inadequate to meet many of the proposals put forward by the Government. When I addressed the Committee from last year, I ventured tq submit a form of accounts which would enable the financial position to be seen at a glance, and honourable members were good enough to allow my statement to be included in the Hansard report of my speech. I was hopef u l that that form would be adopted by the Treasurer this year wheni distributing his Budget papers; but as it was not, I shall again ask the Committee to allow me to put his figures before them in a concise 6 statement, which will enable even those who are not experts' to at once grasp the situation. As the Budget papers contain information that may be of service to hon8 orable members individually, I do not suggest their curtailment; but, as the Treasurer has presented his figures, there is such an accumulation of detail, that it is difficult to ascertain the situation without making calculations and compilations whicb should not be necessary. I have set out in the following table the Treasurer's estimate of the revenue and expenditure for the current year, on the basis of section 87 However, as I had of the Constitution... £11,040,711 289,122 £10,751,589 2,687,897 £8,063,692 £2,687,897 £35483.000 3,013,32! 469,679 16,000 5,260 20,000 6,800 £3.205,636",23,William Lyne No It Was Be £^99>°°O Less So That Tliere Is Another

There is another matter to which serious consideration requires to be given, and that is the interest on the transferred properties, for which the Treasurer has made no provision whatever. It will be remembered that at the Hobart Conference of Premiers, in February, 1905, this was regarded as a matter which would, sooner or later, have --£933,260 --£525,840 15,000 17,236 20,00 0 12,00 0 31,50 0 516,22 9 £i,'37,So5 720,51 1 4 1 0 , 8 10 £3,205,636 to be dealt with in a practical manner, and the following resolution was passed: That we consider it to be indispensable that the interest on the cost of transferred properties shall be Federal expenditure.

In consequence of the act of the Commonwealth Treasurer in depleting the States Treasuries, the Treasurers of the States will very properly endeavour to ascertain what is their legal position, and, sooner or later, the question will have to be referred to the High Court for interpretation.

This is not the proper time to refer in detail to the Government scheme of defence, but I may refer to its financial aspect. I find that with the exception of a small amount of about £ 5 , 3 0 0 , derived in revenue, the De. fence Department is a charge upon the people of the Commonwealth, and involves an expenditure of £ 9 3 3 , 2 6 0 at the present time.

The Prime Minister has submitted a proposal in connection with the defence of the Commonwealth, whicli, I certainly think, aims at an object it is desirable to attain if it can be attained prudently and cautiously. Buti f we except the amount which has been transferred to a trust account for the purpose, no provision has been made to meet the increased expenditure involved in the adoption of the Government proposal. shall not trouble honourable members with detailed figures, but even if we adopted the suggestion made by one honourable member who spoke from the other side, and who proposed a starvation allowance to men whilst they are engaged in training in the National Guard, I estimate that the total expenditure involved will very nearly approach £1,500,000 ^ States debts has been given no important place in the Budget statement. of those who have never laid very much stress upon the savings to be .effected by the transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth, because those savings, if made, must be returned to the States originallyresponsible for the loans. But the matter is one which must be dealt with if we are to arrive at a settlement once and for all The Postmaster-General, in of the amount of revenue to be retained for the purposes of the Commonwealth, which, under existing conditions, is limited to one-fourth of the net Customs and Excise revenue. I have always supported the payment of a fixed sum to the States, with an I think I have correctly automatic arrangement by which they might estimate derive some benefit from any expansion of the revenue from Customs and Excise. I ventured, when I last spoke on the Budget statement, to express the belief that the Treasurer's expectations of revenue would not be realized. Although, apparently, I agree with the honorrevenue and expenditure at the present time only about balance, it may be that the Treasurer's expectations of increased revenue will be realized, and that the fear which many honourable members entertain that the honourable gentleman is being led financially into a cul de sac are not justified. I hold the opinion that we are fast approaching the time when it will be necessary for us to borrow money to carry out the large works which will be required to meet Commonwealth expansion. I am aware that that view is not shared by my honourable friends of the Labour Party. I think that it is idle to suppose that the The expenditure on this present generation can meet out of current has practically reached revenue the large expenditure necessary to cope with that expansion of the future which we have a right to expect. I have only one feeling in this matter, and that is that, except for reproductive works, borrowing should be avoided.. Such borrowing may, perhaps, never be forced upon the Commonwealth, but our difficulties must be met and faced. We are told that oyer £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 is required to put the Postal, Telephone, and Telegraph_services I into proper working order. That expenditure would be revenue producing, and I hope that honourable members are agreed that it should not be met entirely from current revenue.

Victoria furnishes a good example for us to follow, because prudence and caution have marked the administration and distribution of the fund. I regret that a sum of only £20,000 is proposed on the Estimates for the purpose of advertising the Commonwealth. That is merely a drop in the bucket. I think that an increased expenditure in that direction would have been quite justified. Long ago we should have had a High Commissioner established in our own offices in London, and the Commonwealth occupying its proper position bereturned to Adelaide for another weekfore the world. Systematic efforts should be made to attract people to Australia. I do not overlook the fact that the States have incurred some degree of responsibility by not accepting the challenge which the Prime Minister, in one of his most fortunate utterances, threw out to them that if they would provide the land the Commonwealth would find people to occupy it. I still hope that in the forthcoming Conference of States Premiers, although it is proposed to be confined entirely to the financial question, it will be recognised that an increase of our population is a paramount consideration to the Commonwealth. to refer briefly to the statement of the honourable member for Kooyong. that the Postal Commission seem to be inquiring merely into differences between officers in the Post and Telegraph Department. He must know very well that a report in a newspaper is a very condensed account of what has taken place, either here or elseI have already exwhere. Generally speaking a little disturbance about something or other, or a little cross firing is fully reported, but a good Whether sensible speech is ignored, even by a newspaper which agrees with the speaker. The proceedings of the Postal Commission are treated in exactly the same way as are those In Victoria a similar of the House. Whenever there has been a little cross firing over an officer or something of that kind it has been reported, but other matters have been simply ignored.

We want to keep the evidence as clear and consecutive as possible, and while we have plenty of witnesses here we think that it is best to spend as much of our time here as is possible. Those who are not on the Commission can have no idea of the volume of work which is done by its members, who are each trying to do the best they can for the Department.

129,Mr Storrer,"There is a difficultyGovernment. Government, I have always reserved to myself the right to speak as I think on any question which may arise. I certainly do not intend to vote for any increase of expenditure which is likely to increase the taxation of the people where I do not think that the proposed increase is deserved or repensed with. It is the fault of the Comquired. I notice that the Estimates provide for an increase in the salaries of the heads of the various parliamentary Departments. While I believe that every man should receive a fair remuneration for his work, I believe that some of our parliamentary officers are overpaid for their work in comparison with the work which is done by a taxpayer outside, and the remuneration which he receives there for. When I was asked some years ago if I was in favour of increasing the remuneration of members of Parliament, I replied that while I was always willing to take as much as possible I tried to consider those who had to find the money. While the taxpayers have to pay so much as they do at the present time, I do not think that it would be wise, for us to increase the salaries of any officers, especially those who are which is still carried on, it was understood well-paid. I shall cast my vote against such lincreases. long the general discussion on the Budget may last, no arrangement will be made to put through so many pages of Estimates in a night. soon they are passed. I am opposed to passing items without reasonable consideration.. As the managers of the public estate of Australia, we should quietly discuss the various proposals coming before us, just as companv directors would deal with their business. Unfortunately our parliamentary procedure seems to require that the various parties should set forth at length their positions in regard to Socialism and other questions, with the result that not sufficient consideracan be got over. This year the sum likely tion is given to the important details of finance. If Australia were governed byone man, he could manage her affairs more economically than they are managed at oresent. He would not have in London a representative for each of the States, but would appoint a High Commissioner to represent both the Commonwealth and the States. wealth is not responsible for the fact that Commonwealth, and that there would not there are six Agents-General. when I was a member of the Tasmanian Parliament, and we were asked to agree to the appointment of an Agent-General for the State, it was said that before long the Commonwealth would appoint a High Commissioner, and. enable this officer to be dismonwealth that there is not in London a representative of Australia who would attend to the business of both the States and the Commonwealth. Then, too, it is well known that a bank will give better terms under a joint and several bond signed by six parties than could be obtained by any one of those parties individually. Similarly the Commonwealth could borrow monev on better terms than any of the six States. mania's guarantee. stands as well in the London market as does that of New South Wales. We can always get what money we need, although we have not borrowed so rapidly as some of the other States. As to the bookkeeping that, after the first six years of Union this I trust that, however would be abolished; but there are still staffs in the Post Office and Cusfoms Departments to check the interchange of parcels and goods between the States. That seems to me to necessitate useless expendiI do not care how ture, and I am sure that if the Government had sufficient strength of will to propose the abolition of the bookkeeping system, Parliament would agree to it. The honourable member for Denison referred to the hardships which Tasmania has suffered since joining the Union. As another representative of that State, I say that its people do not ask for concessions, but they insist on getting their rights. Thev expect that the distribution of revenue shall be -ber capita. There is some difficulty in the way of this because of the large receipts from Customs in Western Australia; but that to be returned to Tasmania is £244,000. The honourable member for Denison put it at £.210,000, which is too little, although the return will be less than was received last year. Our revenue is now, per capita, almost as large as that of the other States, except Western Australia.

154,Mr Johnson,"Becaus e they wouldGovernment are compelled to fire. My pity goes out to Ministers who are so ' spiritless oflice under such humiliating circumstances: The honourable member for Wide Bay admitted that the policy of protection had proved an absolute failure so far as it was intended to benefit the workers of the community. He further declared that he had never entertained the belief that it ' would better workers. YetI recollect the period, only a few short months ago, when members of his own party and of the Government were accustomed during luncheon adjournments to harangue our factory operatives in support of a larger measure of protection being accorded to our industries to save them from extinction and to provide the employees with better wages. I believe that there were one or two count outs through the absence of the then Government whip on those expeditions around the highways and byways, the purlieus and slums of the city of Melbourne. Those who took part in them preached to the wage earners the blessings that would follow the adoption and extension of the policv of protection. Thev did not say anything to the worker at that time about the failure of protection as a panacea for improving his conditions. Their mission was to establish the alleged fact that if the wage-earners would only vote for high protection they were sure to better their industrial position. Yet, the leader of the Labour Party, many of whose followers supported the higher duties, as they allege, in the belief, that the of protection to do what its advocates workers would get the benefit of the duties in higher wages and better conditions, now declares that he never believed that protection would do anything of the kind. The honourable member was one of those who voted for high duties, and he, and those associated with him, are equally responsible for the present Tariff, which is returning so large a revenue at so heavy a cost to the wage-earners. the heavy load which the wage-earners of the country have to bear. believe that protection increases or reducei wages ? and never could increase wages, but tbere are innumerable cases where it has had the effect of reducing them. To illustrate the truth of that remark, I refer the honourable member to the fact that in those countries where the largest measure of protection is established the lowest wages and worse conditions of labour prevail. In China, that they can retain and in Germany,'France, Switzerland, or, in fact, any continental country, where the protective duties are highest, the, wages are lowest, and the conditions of labour and of living are of the worse description. In America the highest wages prevail in the unprotected industries, and the lowest in those most highly protected. With the the condition of the evidence of generations of experience of the absolute failure of protection to benefit the workers, the Labour Party have been mainly instrumental in heaping a heavy burden of Customs taxation upon the people ol this country. They had a f u l l knowledge at the time that the protective policy' had teen proved a failure over. and ow.r again in other countries. of thousands of people who are getting no wages at all in free-trade England. tionist Europe, America, and Australia. I have said that protection is not the remedy. There are between 80,000 and 90,000 unemployed in the city of Berlin alone, and"" that is in a country which has one of the highest Tariffs in the world. In that case nrotection has failed to improve the conditions of the worker, because there the worse possible conditions of labour, and a very low standard of living, obtain. I wish to direct special attention to the admission of the leader qf the Labour Party as to the failure claimed for it so far as it affected the worker. The present Government-som e of whose members went about preaching the benefits of protection to the workers within the last couple of years, and urging the workers to return protectionists in the assured hope that thereby their conditions would be improved-no w admit that t in t policv has not done what they claimed f o : They are responsible for it. It has been a miserable and ghastly failure, and the Government now under the direction of the Labour Party, table a new scheme called the new protection, which, they confidently assure us, is going to bring about a change. I venture to say that just as the old protection was all humbug, the new protection will be an even greater humbug, and the workers will not get a shilling of benefit from it. It is only another device to deceive the workers with a placard that will be absolutely useless to them. It is an illustration of the saying about asking for bread and being",32,William Lyne No It Was Be £^99>°°O Less So That Tliere Is Another

Quite recently a number of unemployed invaded the precincts of Parliament House clamouring for workin Victoria, which has had the alleged benereally responsible for it , and thus we have fits of a protective policy for so many years ! Yet Victoria has a large army of workless people unable to get work, 'and many of them declaring that they are starving, ancl every year she is losing her population by thousands. 1 only has protection been of no benefit to them, but they have had to pay through the nose for everything they l.iuv, and the value of any sovereign that they earn is under that policy reduced to about 13s. That is the only privilege that they have obtained from voting for those who have imposed this policy upon them. Even the new protection memorandum which has been tabled to-day does not pretend to bring about a general improvement in wages and labour conditions. Its operations are to be limited only to a small section of the workers. It is to apply only to those who are fortunate enough to be employed in certain protected industries. But are wage-earners who do not happen to be employed in protected industries not equally worthy of consideration ? ber knows that there is no power to provide for them. And what a satire on the Labour Party and its tinkering policy. Surelyi f one worker is worthy of consideration, another is equally so. Why make an invidious distinction between one class of worker and another? Why are some to be singled out for the special privilege of being able to dip their hands into the pockets of others, ancl the rest excluded ? will get no benefits under the scheme have to pay the cost of protection equally with those who will benefit.

This proposal presumably will have the support of the Labour Party. I believe the Labour Party are the party thepiselves. setting up an aristocracy of labour within the ranks of the workers. That was also clearly indicated by the leader of the Labour Party's objection to the use of the term "" hands "" in Not relation to those who did not happen to earn their living by manual labour. The word "" h a n d s "" was too common, too plebian, a term to employ. According to the honourable member, we must use not an Australian or even an English word, but a French word. Those gentlemen who happen to be employed in the Government service are not to be referred to as civil servants or hands, but as ""employees."" We have to be careful to make these class distinctions between different sections of wage earners now, because the leader of the Labour Party thinks that the term ""hands,"" although applicable to navvies, coal lumpers and wharf labourers, miners, and so on, is offensive when applied to people employed in the post-offices and other Government Departments. I have always asserted that the Labour Party were really the Tory party of the House, and they have been giving evidence lately of their claim to that title. Reference was also made by the honourable member for Wide Bay to the trawler. He spoke of it in terms of eulogy as having been built by the State, and as a shining example of the benefits of the socialistic policy of the Labour Party which the present G'overnment are carrying out. It is a funny thing that whenever an industrial experiment carried out by the Government terminates successfully it is always hailed by the Labour Party as an evidence of the benefits of Those who Socialism, but let failure attend any similar experiment, ancl they at once repudiate it as not being Socialism.

As some honourable members in the Ministerial corner claim to be Fabian Socialists, I woulcl remind them, that one of the foremost writers -of the Fabian school alludes to the tendency of some members of the "" popular party ""-referrin g to the Labour Party-to fall into the error of claiming certain -State-controlled efforts as evidences of Socialism. The Post Office has often been referred to as a socialistic enterprise. -have heard honourable members in this House and on the public platform pointing to the Postal Department as an illustration ber ever been in a country where the letters were delivered by private enterprise? Some of our labour friends use the fact that the Post Office is under State control as an argument for Socialism. All that I can say is that if we are to take that as a socialistic illustration, the sooner we have recourse to some other system the better. If our industries were run oh the same lines as the Post Office, we should speedily be reduced to inextricable chaos.* individualists in the Post Office at present. Labour Party some of their 'own authorities disclaim that the Post Office conducted under State control should be cited as an example of Socialism. Mr J. H . CATTS -Who says that?

The writer is an acknowledged forefront Socialist leader of the Fabian school. What is here referred to is exactly what is being done by the Labour Party in Australia-claimin g all State action as Socialism, no matter for what end it is undertaken. Mr Bland goes on to sayTlie object of these givers of Greek gifts will most infallibly be attained if those Socialists who know what they want hesitate (from fear of its losing popularity, or from any more amiable weakness) to clamour their loudest against any and every proposal whose adoption would prolong the l if e of private capiimproperly applying it. I pointed out tal a single hour. I quote Mr Hubert Bland, not only because he is one of the foremost Socialist writers in England, but also because he condemns the very thing that the Labour Party is doing in this country. It is, as he says, nothing but sham Socialism. They claim as socialistic, enterprises that are not socialistic at all, because they do not involve the basic condition of being held by all in common "" for the equal benefit of all."" will make our own Socialism. in the Labour corner are continually saying that they want certain private industries nationalized, their object being the destruction of private enterprise for profit making. That is Socialism. But when they claim that the mere management of public utilities -whic h does not aim at destruction of profit making-is Socialism, we reply that such control does not involve or imply Socialism at all. however, in spite of their professions, we have had some members of the Corner Party objecting to the term "" Socialist "" being applied to them. Though some of them have time after time declared that their party is Socialist, we have had the leader of the party almost crying because, as he said, the Opposition accused them of being Socialists. should not believe such things. The leader of the Labour Party never cried about that. that there was something ignoble attached to the word "" Socialist,"" and that it was a misrepresentation as applied to him and ' his party. leader of the Labour Party in that way? the honourable member to the speech delivered last week by the leader of his party. I made an interjection at the time. Socialist, if that will suit the honourable member. the Labour Party took exception to the term, and charged the Opposition, with that the term ""Socialist,"" as applied to the Labour Party, did not originate with the Opposition. It originated with themselves. * The present leader of the Labour Party has often declared himself and his party to be Socialists. The exleader of the party, the honourable member for South Sydney, at a Conference in Sydney, declared that the sine qua non ot membership of the party must be that every one applying for admission must be a Socialist. Mr J. H . CATTS -He did not say, '.' must be."" they "" should be."" At all events, he said that this was a sine qua non; that is, that belief in Socialism was an essential condition of membership of the party. Of course, since then, honourable members opposite have been trying to water down their objective, and to explain it away. But their newspapers have not done so. There is no mistake about them. The Queensland labour journal in particular makes no bones about the matter.

It is well that the public should know that whilst the honourable member for South Sydney and some other members of his party are seeking from the public platform to water down their policy and to make the people believe that the Opposition are falsely and wickedly charging them with being Socialists, the Treasurer himself has declaredthat he is a Socialist, and various members of the Labour Party have made the same declaration. One of the most prominent members of that party declared this afternoon that the demands of the party in the future would be for more Socialism, and for Socialism of a more pronounced type. It is time that these facts were known to the public. It is well that the public should know that the longer the present Government remain in power the more Socialism they will get. The leader of the Labour Party made against the Opposition the baseless charge that it accused the Labour Party of wishing to destroy the sanctity of the home and of the marriage tie, and so forthl of the leader of the Opposition all over Australia. of the Opposition have never made such a charge against the Labour Party; but some of them have levelled it against Socialists as a class, and on the strength of the teaching of the standard writers on Socialism, who insist that our present systems of marriage and family lif e cannot be maintained under sdcialistic iconditions. honourable members desire to apply to themselves so wide reaching a term as Socialism if they choose to say that they are memwhat they want. bers of the socialistic school-the y must be prepared to accept responsibility for all that to themselves a term to which, judging by Socialism entails.

But there are one Or two unatters to which I should like to refer, -and amongst these is the administration of Papua. This question has been hanging fire for a long time, and petitions have been received, I understand, .from residents in the Possession, asking that, in the best interests of the country, an Administrator should be appointed at an early date. In this connection, honourable members are entitled to information as to the intentions of the Government. honourable.' that is so, in regard to the intentions of the Treasurer; but that cannot be expected to be wholly satisfactory to the residents of Papua.

At the same primary needI think his own word was '""'peremptory"" especially from the stand-point of defence, is population m terjection, I should like to call attention to the action the other day of the Trades and Labour Council of Sydney. That body passed a resolution inviting the whole of the trade unions and organizations of Australia to join in a representation to the British Labour Party in the House of Commons, as to the undesirability of sending any more immigrants to Australia. I do not know wliether the Sydney Trades and Labour Council maybe'regarded as representing authoritatively the views of the workers as a whole; but, if so, then I point to the discrepancy between the sentiment of that resolution, and the sentiment just endorsed by the honourable member for Herbert. Both the Labour Party and the Prime Minister say that our great need is immigration, and yet we have this resolution on the part of a Trades and Labour Council of Sydney antagonistic to immigration. A significant fact is the absence of any provision in the Estimates for immigration. It is true, there is the item of £20,000 for advertising the resources of Australia, but there is no provision for the actual work of bringing immigrants to this country.",37,William Lyne No It Was Be £^99>°°O Less So That Tliere Is Another

I desire to know whether the Government propose to in any way assist ih the establishment of wireless telegraphic stations on the commercial routes in the Pacific. There is one other point I wish to refer to, and it is connected with the administration of the Telephone Branch of the Post and Telegraph Department. Some representations were made to me by the Municipal Council of Rockdale pointing out that at the very important suburban passenger station of Banksia, on the Illawarra line, distant not more than half-a-dozen miles from Sydney, there was urgent need for the establishment of a public telephone bureau for the convenience of the many passengers by the trains as well as of the local residents. In my opinion, it should be entirely unnecessary to make any representations of this kind to the Department, because, as a matter of business, a public telephone bureau should be established at every suburban station for the convenience of the local residents.

I communicated with the Post and Telegraph Department on this matter; and the reply I got is as follows:With reference to your communication of the 26th August last applying, on hehalf of the Municipal Council at Rockdale, for the estab-lishment of a telephone bureau at the railway station, Banksia, I have the honour to inform you that, owing to the number of telephone works, provision for which has been made on the Estimates for the current financial year, it will not be possible, at present, lo establish a public telephone at the Banksia railway station. The work would include the erection of a line and 'the supply of a cabinet and fittings, together with a telephone instrument, estimated to cost approximately £38. I admit that the amount mentioned is enormous ! When we are proposing to fritter away millions the finding of £ 2 8 must certainly present a very serious obstacle to the Department. However, there is some hope for the future, because the departmental reply goes on to sayThe matter will, however, be brought forward for further consideration next year, with a view to the service being provided as early as possible. Communications of this kind bring the administration of the Department into contempt in the eyes of the public That such a convenience as that asked for should not be provided at a suburban railway station is in itself evidence of a lamentable want of business acumen in the administration, but it is simply humiliating that such a reply, should be given when a request for the establishment of a telephone bureau is made on behalf of a public body. shall feel mean and contemptible in having to send the communication on to the Rockdale Municipal Council. It can only provoke the laughter of any body of business men. This is the kind of reply which I and many honourable members receive to communications concerning such matters. I am aware that it is of little use to say anything on the subject in this House, because when attention was called to it the other day in the form of a vote of censure on the Government, a majority of honourable members, including the members of the Labour Party, asserted that the administration was all right. we are not with the honourable member in such a matter as he has referred tb.

There is not one o i the suburban telephone bureaux that does not show a profit to the Department, and yet here we have evidence that the authorities actually refuse business. aware that there is no telephone bureauestablished at the biggest railway station in Australia? prised to hear it. The statement is only further evidence of the manner in which the Department is administered. However, the honourable member for Yarra need not complain, because he has voted that the financial administration of the Government is perfectly satisfactory. I did not vote in that way, and I am, therefore, at liberty now to express my disapprobation of it.

That was demonstrated very plainly only the other evening. I am aware, of course, that the right honourable member for East Sydney has had his day. The time has gone by for him to get into power. came across four lines the other day which I think aptly describe the right honourable gentleman'* position. They are theseHe revelled under tbe moon, He slept beneath the sun, He lived a life of going-to-do, And died with nothing done. Those lines, in my opinion, aptly sum up the right honourable gentleman's political history. I had no wish to discuss the question of free-trade and protection, but the honourable member for Robertson, made a statement which has since been supported -by the honourable member for Lang, and to which I must take some exception. look out for the honourable member if he did not discuss that question. out for New South Walesi f we had not adopted, the policy of protection.

277,Mr Coon,"And I repeat that the prethen, that the Ministry should receive support when it brings forward proposals of a far-reaching character, covering a policy that the people of Australia have adopted ? Honourable members may, for the sake of convenience, sit on one side of the House or the other, but they must all realize that the present Ministry is putting forward ai policy which the people of Australia have adopted, and which spells progress for the Commonwealth. I did not intend to speak to this question, but was induced to do so by the action of some honourable members of the free-trade party who raised the free trade flag and thought, apparently, that their statements would be allowed to pass unchallenged. orable member'say a word for the old protection ? future, to spell progress, not only for Australia, but for Great Britain. During the consideration of the Tariff various statements were made as to the inability of Australia to manufacture certain goods, and notably dress material. I wish now to congratulate New South Wales on the production of dress material weighing less than 5 ounces per yard. I have here a sample of such material, and the gentleman who forwarded it sent along a declaration that it was made in New South Wales. We have here another illustration of the value of protection. material was being made in New South Wales twenty-five years ago? months ago. ment will extend as fa r as possible the policy of the new protection. If we are to pay invalid and old-age pensions money? ber will not baulk at finding the money when it is necessary to obtain it for such a purpose? He and others should not try to harass the Government in that direction. Every honourable member who voted for invalid and old-age pensions was, I am sure, sincere in his desire that they should be paid, and when the time comes to finance them. I hope that honourable members generally will assist the Government in their efforts to find the necessary funds. But whilst we are providing for the payment of old-age pensions we should take care, by means of the new protection, to improve the conditions of labour, and so to preserve the health of the workers of the community. Let me refer byway of illustration to the position of our miners. We have in the Commonwealth about 100,000 men employed in quartz gold-mining, and in Bendigo, about 100 miles from this city, there are a number of miners who are being allowed to commit what I describe as slow suicide. We have there the deepest gold mine in the world, where men are employed 4,400 feet below the surface. Men cannot work at such a depth for eight hours at a stretch, and two shifts are necessary. A man works below as long as he can, and as soon as he reaches the plat another takes the honhis place. Honourable members may call it Socialism, or any other "" is m , "" but I am in favour of reducing to six per day the number of hours that men have to work below the surface, and if it is possible to extend the new protection to the gold-miners of Australia such an extension will have my hearty support. I trust that the Government will take f u l l advantage of the opportunity they now possess to extend the new protection to all sections of the community. I congratulate the Ministry on their financial proposals. I do not intend to speak at length, because I am anxious, for two or three reasons, that we should deal without delay with the New Works and Buildings Estimates. TheI suppose that sooner the contemplated new works are out in hand the better. If , because of delay in commencing operations, portion of the and buildings is unexpended, that unexpended balance has to be handed over to the States Governments, and they are thankless bodies. Have we the people who send us here. ing with the people themselves we should get fair playAs a matter of fact, it is in the interests of the people that I wish the proposed new works and buildings to be pushed on without delay. They are not enjoying the facilities which they expected to obtain from the Commonwealth. In South Australia we have great difficulty in obtaining materials for various works, and the sooner they are undertaken the sooner shall we find work for some of the 6,000 men said .to be unemployed in Melbourne. In South Australia we have a comparatively small number out of work.",42,William Lyne No It Was Be £^99>°°O Less So That Tliere Is Another

This is a far greater matter than the granting of bounties for the production of articles, many of which can be grown, we know, whether that encouragement is given or not. I have no objection to bounties being offered in certain directions, because we cannot give a duty in every instance. stances where a duty is very much better than a bounty. I observe that a sum of j£i2,ooo has been placed on the Estimates for an Iron bounty. I do not think that that is necessary. I should like to see that sum devoted to the encouragement of inventors. It would produce far better results, because the iron industry,°as I hope to be able to show by-and-by, 'ought now to be able to stand on its feet without other help than a protective duty. able. so now if we impose a protective duty. So far, we have not given the necessary protection to the industry. But that is no reason why we should not do so now. I think that when it is proposed to treat highly-paid officers so liberally as the Estimates disclose, we ought to .know more about the value of their services to the Commonwealth, and whether there is a limit to the salaries in some cases. There does not seem to be a limit until we get down to the bottom of the ladder, and there we find one imposed.

A conthe slightest objection is raised by the siderable time ago I had the opportunity workers of Australia to the introduction of inspecting the new mail van which runs of these men so long as work is provided between Adelaide and Melbourne. It is really a magnificent piece of work. It enables the officers to do their duty comfortably, easily, and quickly. It is a great improvement upon the old van. I inquired as to who was responsible for its construction. I ascertained from some of his friends the name of the officer wTib was responsible for making most valuable suggestions in that regard. I discovered further that he has not received a single There are inpenny by way of recognition, and I doubt if he has even received a letter of thanks. If that is so, I know that the matter has only to be brought under the attention of the Postmaster-General to insure that the valuable services of the officer shall be recognised in someshape or form. If we intend to give encouragement in this matter, we ought to see that no officer who has done valuable work is overlooked. In the course of his rambling remarks, thei honourable member for Lang referred to the question of immigration. He tried to show that the Labour Party are antagonistic to that policy. Now ihe position taken up by the Labour Party in this House is precisely the position taken up by the Labour Premier of South Australia, who said to the people of England: "" In spite of the fact that in South Australia we have never had' more prosperous times than we have at present, and that we need immigrants, we are not ready for them yet. We do not want you to send out a large number of persons until we know how to provide for them."" That is a sensible, reasonable attitude to take up.

Othenvise, while one employer might bring in a man under a fair agreement, another employer might do so under an unfair agreement.

That portion of the machinery which has been alleged to work so badly now-the part represented by the Commissioner and his inspectorswas brought into existence with the deliberate and definite intention of carrying out the system as thoroughly as possible. While I admit that Commissioner and inpectors alike are liable to commit errors of judgment, I have yet to find that they have done anything unbecoming to their office, or in any way contrary to the spirit of the Act.

338,Mr Fowler,"Well, some of us willof those who have been passed over. Honourable members ought to be careful in bringing such cases before the Committee that they are not voicing the spleen and jealousy of those who have lost positions to which they deemed themselves entitled rather than some righteous grievance which I am inclined to think seldom exists. like the one I quoted to-night, where the officer actually got the chance afterwards and proved his superiority. machinery ought undoubtedly to exist to enable any one with a legitimate grievance to prove his position. But until instances of that Kind become much more general than they appear to me to be, I should hesitate long before I brought any serious charge against the Commissioner or his inspectors as to the carrying out of their work. I should certainly have to see the present Act working much worse than it is before I should dream of going back to the old system of promotion ""by seniority. Almost anything would be better than that. In my own State we have had a good many troubles with regard to promotion by merit. Yet, in speaking to large numbers of civil servants as man to man, confidentially and freely, they have invariably admitted that the Act on the whole works well, and that the conditions in the service are much better now than they were under the old State arrangements. There is a measure before the House, introduced by a private member, which it is perhaps out of order to discuss. at this stage, but I wish to say that I believe the Public Service Act could be amended in the direction of improving the power of appeal at present provided. I believe that with that alteration, and one or two minor modifications, such as experience has enabled iis to suggest, we could obtain an improved Public Service Act that ought to be satisfactory to all branches of the service, and give the highest possible degree of efficiency. When the Treasurer was introducing the Budget he referred to the matter of unexpended' votes, and I made an interjection, which he mSghf h'ave thought was rajther too severe, UutI wish to point out the position in my own State as a justification of the strong language which I used. .There is no doubt that the matter of unexpended votes has grown almost to the dimensions of a public scandal, and indicates ai degree of circumlocution in carrying on the business of the Commonwealth that should be abolished at the earliest opportunity. I remember a vote for a post office in my own electorate being passed by Parliament noless than three times before the money was actually spent. sent on to the States Public Works Departments, and you cannot shift them with dynamite. the States Public Works Departments are greatly lacking in energy in the matter of carrying out public works for the Commonwealth, but the trouble .dees not always lie there. It undoubtedly began with the roundabout method adopted, particularly in connection with the Post and TelegraphDepartment. Matters could be very much simplified and expedited if , after Parliament has decided that a certain sum shall be spent-the general principle having beerr affirmed-the spending of the money was determined absolutely by the Deputy Postmaster-General of the Slate concerned. the Commonwealth having its own Public Works Department? tion devoutly to be wished,"" but I do not see how it can be carried out very economically, in regard to the whole of the States, at any rate. trouble is that we are so late in reaching, the consideration of the Estimates. at the bottom of a good deal of the trouble, and an improvement is possible in that respect. But even after all that has been said and done, I know instances where money has been voted for public works and the details have .had to circulatethrough several Departments in the most remarkable fashion. That kind of thing ought to be put an end to at the earliest possible moment, and a more business-like and direct method of dealing with the votes passed by this House should be invented. In my own State, in the financial' year 1907-8, only half of the vote for new works was expended. There is something seriously wrong in such a state of affairs. I am not including the sum that has been put on the Estimates for undergrounding wires in Perth; but what I have said applies to buildings for the Post and' Telegraph Department and Defence generally.",48,Brown H E Has Missed Of The Premiers Of The States Thrusting This

346,Mr Fowler,"That is undoubtedlySir member will remember that sums were voted late in the year, and there was a difficulty in getting all the money spent. than half of the total vote should have been expended I am glad to find that the Treasurer has determined' to no longer starve the Commonwealth Public Departments, although he has not given us very forcible proofs of his intention yet. In Western Australia, Federal members have been in an unfortunate position, in this way : The Federal Government, with the assistance of Parliament, have been straining every nerve to provide the largest sum possible for the States Treasurers. The Treasurers of Western Australia have invariably made a loud outcry because they have not been able to get enough money. At the same time the public of the State make an equally loud outcry because the Post and Telegraph Department in particular is being starved. The Federal Government have, up to the present, been in the position of the old man who tried to please everybody. They wanted to return a large sum to the States, in order to give the States Treasurers enough to spend, and at the same time, they had to see that the Departments were administered on proper lines. In Western Australia so much has been given to the State Treasurer that the Federal Departments have been starved, and odium has fallen upon the Federation in that way. At almost every election, the cry has been, "" Oh for the old days of the State control of the Post and Telegraph Department, when we could get improvements carried out without delay, and without so much difficulty as has to be encountered under Federal surer says he wishes to be generous to the Post and Telegraph. Department, I am afraid he will not be able to prove that he has dealt very generously with it in Western Australia. Comparing this year with last, and including the re-vote of money voted but not spent last year, there is an increase of £2,000 for new works in that State; but, deducting the re-vote, there is an actual decrease. That is not a proper state of affairs with regard to the one State of Australia that is perhaps developing at a much more rapid rate than are the others, and that requires a greater amount of money to be spent on postal matters than does any other State, seeing that we have not had service that the others have enjoyed. I hope that the Treasurer, or, to put it bluntly, the Treasury Department, will see next year that Western Australia is given a sum commensurate with her requirements in that respect. deal more per head of population than the other States have. freely; but she has not got what she is reasonably' entitled io as the youngest State, and the one necessarily requiring more developmental work to be done than the others do. I brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General, a few days ago, ( a case in which the postal services of a considerable town in my electorate were being conducted in premises which had been condemned by the local Board of Health as insanitary and unfit for occupation. I was told that perhaps next year something might be done to give those people proper postal accommodation. I do not intend to wait for next year. If the Postmaster General does not see fit to do something in a case like that, I assure him that he will hear more from me about it. I wish to bring under the notice of the Treasurer the necessity for some inspection of the working conditions under which Government contracts are carried out in Western Australia. I refer more particularly lo the contracts for clothing. I am informed, and my information is, I think, trustworthy, that some of that work is done under conditions which would not be approved of by the Government, and certainly not by a majority of the members of this House. I am told that a certain amount of sweating goes on in connection with conditions."" Whilst the Treathem, and that there is an urgent necessity for the appointment of an inspector to see that proper labour conditions, as laid down by the Federal Government, are observed. There is in that State an Inspector of Factories, whose services could, I believe, be obtained to supervise the conditions under which the Federal Government contract work is done. I trust that the Treasurer will note what I am saying, and take steps to have that inspection carried out, for I can assure him, on the very best authority, that the matter urgently requires his. attention. Perhaps the most striking feature of that Treasurer's Budget was his reference to old-age pensions.

But take the case -of a father of a family who has met with a serious accident after being resident three -or four years in Australia. Is he to be precluded from receiving the invalid pension because he does not happen to have lived in the Commonwealth for a, longer period? Should not the fact that he has worked hard and maintained 'a creditable record, entitle him to assistance? member think that such persons are more deserving than many old people are? capacitated whilst working for his living is Of course, the Treaundoubtedly more deserving of consideration than are many old persons who ought to have made provision for their old age, but have not done so.

Many of them are accompanied by children or mere babies. Sometimes I have seen these infants lying down exhausted and asleep by the side of their blind parents.

Such a state of things ought to be unknown in this great Commonwealth, where there is so much natural wealth; and I believe that the spirit of philanthropy which should be embodied in an Old-age Pensions Act, would put an end to such conditions.

The fact remains, however, that in the greater portion of the Commonwealth there is the Wages Board system. It is admitted that the Arbitration Court system has broken down, as was only to be expected. Under the Wages Board system employees rn'eet employers, and, both understanding the business, they talk matters over, and, as a rule, agree among themselves, whereas a Court is about the last place where people can be brought to an agreement. My great objection to the new protection proposals is that there is introduced the machinery of the Arbitration Court, which has been a notable failure.

Of course, we know perfectly well that farming is a protected it has been very difficult to apply the Wages Board or Arbitration Court system.

First of all there will be the States Wages Boards in the various States, with the exception of Tasmania and South Australia. where they have an Arbitration Act which does not apply to many industries. apply to them. Then we shall have tbe Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act covering disputes extending beyond the boundary of any one State, and on top of these the operations of this Excise Court or Inter-State Commission.

I am very glad that at the present time the condition of the told the "" Berry Blight"" was bad. industry is satisfactory. Another matter to which I wish to refer is the vote of ^20,000 appearing in the Estimates for advertising Australia. We shall have to look the question of immigration sternly in the face. I need not go into figures to show what the influx of population has been of late. It is not at all what most of us would wish it to be. I am not one of those who desire to see people dumped into the Commonwealth without some provision being made for them. I think provision might be made for them if the Commonwealth did the oversea work and the States looked after the immigrants on their arrival. Apparently there are many people at the present time seeking occupation or land in the various States without being able to obtain what they desire. I think that the States Governments should be responsible for them. In my opinion, it is. the duty of the Commonwealth Government to make the necessary arrangements to secure a considerable flow of properly-selected immigrants into Australia, and to devise some method of putting them on the land, where they may have a chance of making a living. I think the proposed vote of ^20,000 is quite inadequate for the purpose. I hope that the Ministry will take this matter seriously in hand. They have sheltered themselves so far under the excuse that it is the business of the States Governments. We should go into the matter more thoroughly, and I wish the Government would take it up seriously, because from many points of view, it is necessary that there should be a big influx of population. take it up. afraid that some of their bosses in the Labour corner will not let the Government take it up.

What the members of the Labour Party .advocate, and what I think every one advocates, is the cutting up of large estates. We only differ as regards the method of -doing that. My honourable friends say that it ought to be done by means of a pro-gressive penal land tax, and I contend that the Government ought to come forward boldly and pay the proper-value of the land. The imposition of a graduated land tax would certainly Teduce the price of all land. It would create a panic more or less. Seddon, the value of land in New Zealand has increased by over £47,000,000. a natural increase in values all round. I have pointed out that that country is different from Australia in that it has a regular rainfall, and that a man there is able to cut up his property. In the first instance the land was gradually bought from the Maoris; it was not sold by the Government with an indefeasible tenure, as in Victoria. If that bargain had been between individual and individual, we should, undoubtedly, recognise that a breach of the agreement had been committed. WhatI desire to emphasize is that we require to obtain land upon which to settle intending immigrants, and the only way in which we can secure that land is by borrowing. In Canada there is an enormous organization, called the Grand Pacific Railway Company As regards flocks of under 500 duce nearly as much as does Australia. ing a far bigger stream of immigrants. If the honourable member's argument means anything, it means that we ought not to interfere with the system of individual enterprise. But of late years, we have prevented individual enterprise, so that to-day capitalists cannot embark upon industries with any great amount of confidence. Their efforts are "" cribb'd, cabin'd, and confm'd,"" and in many directions ihe Government to-day are doing work which was previously undertaken by private enterprise. they are doing it better. that. In my opinion, the Government, as a rule, do not perform work as well as does private enterprise. That, however, is a debatable question, the threshing out of which would probably occupy a couple of weeks. If we desire to attract immigrants to the Commonwealth, the Government must provide the land upon which they can settle, otherwise private enterprise must do so. do that, or discontinue using immigration as a political placard. money on advertising our resources if we do not really intend to undertake this work. My own opinion is that the people According to Mr of the Commonwealth desire us to undertake it, and the only way in which we can do it is by borrowing the necessary money and ear-marking the security. The project will not be worth tackling if we are not prepared to spend about £20,000,000 upon it.",59,William Lyne Th E Honourable With The Same Subject Then The Lord Help

The Commonwealth Government is the proper authority to borrow the requisite money, and, I believe, that they can obtain it cheaper than can the States. In Canada tbe necessary funds are provided by the Grand Pacific Company, the Salvation 'Army, and a number of different classes of people.
